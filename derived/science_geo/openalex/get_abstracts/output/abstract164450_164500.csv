https://openalex.org/W2136359657,"Room-temperature ultraviolet lasing in semiconductor nanowire arrays has been demonstrated. The self-organized, &lt;0001&gt; oriented zinc oxide nanowires grown on sapphire substrates were synthesized with a simple vapor transport and condensation process. These wide band-gap semiconductor nanowires form natural laser cavities with diameters varying from 20 to 150 nanometers and lengths up to 10 micrometers. Under optical excitation, surface-emitting lasing action was observed at 385 nanometers, with an emission linewidth less than 0.3 nanometer. The chemical flexibility and the one-dimensionality of the nanowires make them ideal miniaturized laser light sources. These short-wavelength nanolasers could have myriad applications, including optical computing, information storage, and microanalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2035594105,"Intracellular zinc is thought to be available in a cytosolic pool of free or loosely bound Zn(II) ions in the micromolar to picomolar range. To test this, we determined the mechanism of zinc sensors that control metal uptake or export in Escherichia coli and calibrated their response against the thermodynamically defined free zinc concentration. Whereas the cellular zinc quota is millimolar, free Zn(II) concentrations that trigger transcription of zinc uptake or efflux machinery are femtomolar, or six orders of magnitude less than one atom per cell. This is not consistent with a cytosolic pool of free Zn(II) and suggests an extraordinary intracellular zinc-binding capacity. Thus, cells exert tight control over cytosolic metal concentrations, even for relatively low-toxicity metals such as zinc."
https://openalex.org/W2115785513,"How cytokines control differentiation of helper T (T H ) cells is controversial. We show that T-bet, without apparent assistance from interleukin 12 (IL-12)/STAT4, specifies T H 1 effector fate by targeting chromatin remodeling to individual interferon-γ (IFN-γ) alleles and by inducing IL-12 receptor β2 expression. Subsequently, it appears that IL-12/STAT4 serves two essential functions in the development of T H 1 cells: as growth signal, inducing survival and cell division; and as trans-activator, prolonging IFN-γ synthesis through a genetic interaction with the coactivator, CREB-binding protein. These results suggest that a cytokine does not simply induce T H fate choice but instead may act as an essential secondary stimulus that mediates selective survival of a lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2077670403,"A computer simulation of North American end-Pleistocene human and large herbivore population dynamics correctly predicts the extinction or survival of 32 out of 41 prey species. Slow human population growth rates, random hunting, and low maximum hunting effort are assumed; additional parameters are based on published values. Predictions are close to observed values for overall extinction rates, human population densities, game consumption rates, and the temporal overlap of humans and extinct species. Results are robust to variation in unconstrained parameters. This fully mechanistic model accounts for megafaunal extinction without invoking climate change and secondary ecological effects."

The pn junction was formed from a boron-doped p-type diamond layer and phosphorus-doped n-type diamond layer grown epitaxially on the 111 surface of single crystalline diamond. The pn junction exhibited good diode characteristics, and at forward bias of about 20 volts strong ultraviolet light emission at 235 nanometers was observed and was attributed to free exciton recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2043547481,"The mushroom bodies of the Drosophila brain are important for olfactory learning and memory. To investigate the requirement for mushroom body signaling during the different phases of memory processing, we transiently inactivated neurotransmission through this region of the brain by expressing a temperature-sensitive allele of the shibire dynamin guanosine triphosphatase, which is required for synaptic transmission. Inactivation of mushroom body signaling through alpha/beta neurons during different phases of memory processing revealed a requirement for mushroom body signaling during memory retrieval, but not during acquisition or consolidation."

The precise mechanism by which neural stem cells are maintained during embryogenesis remains to be determined. Here, we found that transient misexpression of the basic helix-loop-helix genes Hes1 and Hes5 keeps embryonal telencephalic cells undifferentiated although they have been shown to induce gliogenesis in the retina. These telencephalic cells later differentiate into neurons and astroglia when Hes expression is down-regulated, suggesting that Hes1- andHes5-expressing cells are maintained as neural stem cells during embryogenesis. Conversely, in the absence of Hes1and Hes5, neural stem cells are not properly maintained, generating fewer and smaller neurospheres than the wild type.

As differentiation proceeds, neural stem cells are decreased in number but remain in the brain until adulthood (2Johansson C.B. Momma S. Clarke D.L. Risling M. Lendahl U. Frisén J.

It has been shown that the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 genes Hes1and Hes5 are expressed in the ventricular zone of the developing nervous system, which contains neural stem cells (5Akazawa C.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 283-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that these Hes genes are negative regulators of neuronal differentiation. However, it is not known whether Hes-expressing cells remain as neural stem cells or become glia in the embryonal brain. In the retina, both Hes1and Hes5 are expressed by differentiating Müller glia, and misexpression of Hes1/5 promotes the generation of Müller glia at the expense of neurons, whereas the inactivation of Hes1/5 results in defects of Müller glial development (18Hojo M. Ohtsuka T. Hashimoto N. Gradwohl G. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Development. 2000; 127: 2515-2522PubMed Google Scholar, 19Furukawa T. Mukherjee S. Bao Z.-Z. Morrow E.M. Cepko C.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 383-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Thus, these Hesgenes are capable of not only inhibiting neurogenesis but also promoting retinal gliogenesis. Interestingly, the membrane protein Notch, which controls Hes1/5 expression, has also been shown to inhibit neurogenesis while inducing gliogenesis (11Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Furukawa T. Mukherjee S. Bao Z.-Z. Morrow E.M. Cepko C.L.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), suggesting that Hes1 and Hes5 regulate neurogenesis and gliogenesis as Notch effectors. Strikingly, in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), even transient activation of Notch signaling is sufficient to irreversibly inhibit neurogenesis and instruct gliogenesis (22Morrison S.J. Perez S.E. Qiao Z. Verdi J.M. Hicks C. Weinmaster G. Anderson D.J. Cell. 2000; 101: 499-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). However, these findings contrast the previous observation that Notch signaling is involved in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state and only allows, rather than instructs, gliogenesis (25Nye J.S. Kopan R. Axel R. Development. 1994; 120: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Dorsky R.I. Rapaport D.H. Harris W.A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It is likely that different cells may respond in different ways to the same signal, and it remains to be determined whether in the brain, the Notch-Hes pathway instructs cells to become glia, as in the retina and PNS, or to remain undifferentiated. Here, to determine the functions of Hes1 and Hes5in the developing brain, we performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. We found that transient misexpression ofHes1 or Hes5 in the embryonal brain inhibits both neurogenesis and gliogenesis, in contrast with the retina and PNS, and keeps cells undifferentiated. However, these undifferentiated cells later become neurons and glia when Hes expression is down-regulated, suggesting that Hes1+ and Hes5+ cells remain as neural stem cells. Conversely, in the absence of Hes1 andHes5, neural stem cells are not properly maintained, generating fewer and smaller neurospheres. These results indicate thatHes1 and Hes5 play an important role in the maintenance of neural stem cells but not in gliogenesis in the embryonal brain. Rat Hes1 and Hes5 cDNAs were inserted into the EcoRI site of pCLIG (18Hojo M. Ohtsuka T. Hashimoto N. Gradwohl G. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Development. 2000; 127: 2515-2522PubMed Google Scholar), which directs gene expression from the upstream long terminal repeat promoter with cytomegalovirus enhancer. This vector also directs enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression through the internal ribosomal entry site. For the introduction of DNA, pregnant mice were deeply anesthetized, and a ventral midline incision was made to perform in uteromanipulation. The expression vector (5 µg) in solution containing 0.05% trypan blue as a tracer was injected through the uterine wall with a glass micropipette into the telencephalic vesicle of each embryoin utero. 1 µg of pCL-EGFP was also co-injected with the expression vectors in many cases because EGFP+ cells can be more easily identified (the same results were obtained). The volume of the injected DNA solution was kept minimal (mostly about 1 µl). After injection, electroporation was carried out as described previously (27Funahashi J. Okafuji T. Ohuchi H. Noji S. Tanaka H. Nakamura H. Dev. Growth Differ. 1999; 41: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Electrodes CUY 650–5 (φ: 5 mm) or CUY 650P10 (φ: 10 mm) were placed outside of the uterus on both sides of the head of the embryo in utero. A square electroporator CUY21 EDIT (TR Tech, Tokyo, Japan) was used to deliver five 50-ms pulses of 50 V with 950-ms intervals. Then the abdominal wall of the pregnant mouse was sutured. Embryos or neonates were harvested 2–7 days after electroporation. The brains were excised, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, cryoprotected in 25% sucrose in PBS overnight, and embedded in OCT compound. 16 µm-thick cryosections were cut and examined immunohistochemically. The primary sphere formation assay was performed essentially as described previously (17Nakamura Y. Sakakibara S. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Shimazaki T. Weiss S. Kageyama R. Okano H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 283-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The uterus of the pregnant mouse was dissected at E11.5, and the heads of the embryos were excised. With fine forceps, the epidermis, mesenchyme, and meninges were removed. The neuroepithelium of the dorsal telencephalon was transferred into the neurosphere culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 100 µg/ml transferrin (Sigma), 25 µg/ml insulin (Sigma), 20 nm progesterone (Sigma), 30 nmsodium selenite (Sigma), 60 µm putrescine (Sigma), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF; Life Technologies, Inc.), and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Life Technologies, Inc.)), washed in PBS once, and digested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and DNaseI (50 µg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. 0.25% trypsin inhibitor and PBS were added, and the cells were spun down, resuspended in the neurosphere culture medium, and dissociated completely by pipetting. 50 µl of the cell suspension (at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml) were plated in each well of 96-well ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The numbers of primary spheres were counted, and the sphere sizes were compared at days 10 and 14. For the secondary sphere formation assay, primary spheres were collected at day 7, spun down at 600 rpm for 1 min, and digested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and DNaseI (50 µg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. 0.25% trypsin inhibitor and PBS were added, and the cells were spun down, resuspended in the neurosphere culture medium, and dissociated completely by pipetting. 40 µl of the cell suspension (at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml) were plated in each well of 96-well ultralow attachment plates. The numbers of secondary spheres and the sphere sizes were examined at day 7. Secondary spheres were collected and plated onto polyethylenimine- (Sigma) and fibronectin- (Life Technologies, Inc.) coated Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) in the differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 25 µg/ml transferrin, 15 µg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 30 nmsodium selenite, 3.3 ng/ml EGF, 1.7 ng/ml bFGF, 10 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma)). After 7 days of culture, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and examined immunocytochemically. Neuronal and glial differentiation was defined by triple-labeled immunocytochemistry using anti-MAP2 (neuron), anti-GFAP (astrocyte), and anti-O4 (oligodendrocyte) antibodies described below. Fixed cryosections were washed three times with PBS and preincubated in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and then incubated in 1% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 with the following antibodies. Primary antibodies used are as follows: rabbit anti-GFP (diluted 1:500; Medical and Biological Laboratories), rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000; Molecular Probes), mouse anti-MAP2 (1:500; Sigma), mouse anti-βIII-tubulin (1:2000; BAbCO), mouse anti-RC2 (IgM, 1:2; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), mouse anti-nestin (1:500; PharMingen), mouse anti-GFAP (1:400; Sigma), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:10; Dako), mouse anti-S100β (1:250; Sigma), mouse anti-O4 (IgM, 1:5; Chemicon), mouse anti-GalC (IgG3, 1:20; Chemicon), mouse anti-Ki67 (1:100; PharMingen), mouse anti-Myc (1:500; Invitrogen), and rabbit anti-Myc (1:500; Medical and Biological Laboratories). To detect these antibodies, biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgM (7.5 µg/ml; Vector), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Vector), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (1:500; ICN/CAPPEL), 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Jackson), Fluorolink Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (1:400; Jackson), and Fluorolink Cy3-labeled streptavidin (1:1000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. Fluorescently labeled preparations were imaged using a Carl Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope or a Carl Zeiss Axiophoto2 microscope equipped with an AxioCam color CCD camera. The images were processed by Photoshop 4.0 software (Adobe). Previously generated Hes1 −/−and Hes5 −/− mutant mice (15Ishibashi M. Ang S.-L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 16Cau E. Gradwohl G. Casarosa S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Development. 2000; 127: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were crossed to ICR mice for several generations. For genotyping ofHes1 −/− mutant mice, the 0.9-kbBamHI-PvuII fragment was used as a probe as described previously (15Ishibashi M. Ang S.-L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). This probe detected a 12-kb wild-type band and a 2.3-kb mutant band. For genotyping ofHes5 −/− mutant mice, a 0.9-kbSmaI-BamHI fragment was used as a probe (16Cau E. Gradwohl G. Casarosa S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Development. 2000; 127: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This probe detected a 7-kb wild-type band and a 4-kb mutant band.Hes1 −/− -Hes5 −/−double-null embryos were obtained by crossingHes1 +/−-Hes5 −/− orHes1 +/−-Hes5 +/−mice. During neural development, Hes1 and Hes5 are specifically expressed in the ventricular zone (5Akazawa C. Sasai Y. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21879-21885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 8Allen T. Lobe C.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1999; 45: 687-708PubMed Google Scholar). To examine their functions in the developing brain, we injected the expression vectors into the telencephalic vesicle of mouse embryos and introduced the vector DNA into telencephalic cells by electroporation (Fig.1 A). By this method, the exogenous genes can be transiently misexpressed in embryonal telencephalic cells. EGFP alone or together with Hes1 or Hes5 was misexpressed in telencephalic cells at E13.5, and after 2 days (E15.5), the fates of the transfected cells (EGFP+) were determined. When EGFP alone was misexpressed, the majority of the EGFP+cells migrated out of the ventricular zone into the outer layers during the E13.5-E15.5 period (Fig. 1 B). Some of them reached the cortical plate and expressed the neuronal markers MAP2 (Fig. 1,B–D) and βIII-tubulin (data not shown), indicating that many of the ventricular cells underwent neurogenesis during the E13.5-E15.5 period. This result is consistent with the previous observation that neurogenesis proceeds during the E13.5-E15.5 period (29Jacobson M. Developmental Neurobiology. Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, when Hes1 orHes5 was misexpressed together with EGFP, almost all transfected cells (EGFP+) remained in the ventricular zone (Fig. 1, F and J). These transfected cells were negative for MAP2 (Fig. 1, G, H, K, and L) and βIII-tubulin (data not shown), indicating thatHes1 and Hes5 inhibit neurogenesis. Because these EGFP+ cells were also negative for the astrocytic markers GFAP and S100β and the oligodendrocytic marker GalC (data not shown),Hes1 and Hes5 did not promote gliogenesis during the E13.5-E15.5 period. To verify the expression of Hes1 and Hes5, three repeats of the Myc epitope were fused in frame to Hes1 and Hes5 at the amino terminus, and the Myc expression was examined. We found that the majority of the cells in the EGFP+ region displayed a high level of nuclear staining of Myc (Fig. 1, Iand M). We also observed inhibition of neurogenesis when Hes1 and Hes5 without Myc tags were misexpressed (data not shown), thus excluding the possibility that the Myc epitope affected the Hes functions. To further determine whether the Hes1-EGFP+ and Hes5-EGFP+ ventricular cells are in a mitotic phase, we performed immunohistochemistry for Ki67, a nuclear antigen expressed by proliferating cells. Many of the Hes1-EGFP+ (Fig.2, A–C) and Hes5-EGFP+ (Fig. 2, D–F) ventricular cells were positive for Ki67. These results demonstrated thatHes1 and Hes5 are capable of maintaining undifferentiated and proliferating cells in the ventricular zone. Interestingly, many of the Hes1-EGFP+ and Hes5-EGFP+ ventricular cells extended vertical processes through the intermediate zone and cortical plate toward the pial surface (Figs. 1 (F and J) and 2 (Aand D)). This morphology is typical of radial glial cells, which have cell bodies in the ventricular zone and extend long processes from the ventricular zone to the pial surface (30Rakic P. Brain Res. 1971; 33: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). To determine whether these transfected cells are radial glia, we examined radial glial markers RC2 and nestin. The cell bodies and processes of almost all Hes1-EGFP+ and Hes5-EGFP+ cells were positive for RC2 (Fig. 3,A–C and G–I) and nestin (data not shown). In addition, the end-feet of Hes1-EGFP+and Hes5-EGFP+ processes were positive for RC2 (Fig. 3,D–F and J–L). These results indicate that misexpression of Hes1 andHes5 promotes the generation of radial glia during the E13.5-E15.5 period. It was believed previously that radial glial cells are the specialized glia that guide the migration of neurons (30Rakic P. Brain Res. 1971; 33: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). However, recent studies revealed that radial glial cells are identical to neural stem cells (31Malatesta P. Hartfuss E. Götz M. Development. 2000; 127: 5253-5263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Noctor S. Flint A.C. Weissman T.A. Dammerman R.S. Friegstein A.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 714-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Thus, these results strongly suggest that Hes1 and Hes5 may play an important role in the maintenance of neural stem cells but do not induce gliogenesis in the embryonal brain, unlike in the retina and PNS. This effect is very similar to that of the active form of Notch1, which also predominantly induces radial glia when misexpressed at an earlier stage of development (23Gaiano N. Nye J.S. Fishell G. Neuron. 2000; 26: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that Notch1 and Hes1/5 function in the same pathway (11Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 33de la Pompa J.L. Wakeham A. Correia K.M. Samper E. Brown S. Aguilera R.J. Nakano T. Honjo T. Mak T.W. Rossant J. Conlon R.A. Development. 1997; 124: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the Hes1-EGFP+and Hes5-EGFP+ ventricular cells are neural stem cells, they should differentiate into neurons and glia when Hes1 and Hes5 expression disappears. To determine the later fates of the ventricular cells that are inhibited from differentiation by Hes1 andHes5, the telencephalons transfected at E13.5 were examined postnatally. Because Hes1 and Hes5 proteins are unstable compared with EGFP, 2T. Ohtsuka and R. Kageyama, unpublished data. Hes expression disappeared in many of the transfected cells during embryogenesis (Fig. 4, D,H, L, and P), whereas EGFP expression remained postnatally in many cells (Fig. 4, A, E,I, and M), which enabled us to determine the postnatal fates of the transfected cells (EGFP+). When EGFP alone was misexpressed at E13.5, the majority of the EGFP+ cells differentiated into neurons present in the deep layers of the cortex at postnatal day 1 (P1) (Fig.4 Q). When Hes1 or Hes5 together with EGFP was misexpressed at E13.5, many of the transfected cells now migrated out of the ventricular zone and differentiated into neurons, which were located in the superficial layers of the cortex at P1 (Fig.4, A–C and I–K). Because these EGFP+ cells in the cortex lost Hes1 and Hes5 expression (Fig. 4, D and L), it is likely that the cells that lost expression of Hes1 and Hes5 underwent neuronal differentiation. Because these neurons were present in more superficial layers than the neurons of EGFP misexpression alone (Fig. 4,A and I versus Q), the former neurons were born later than the latter. When EGFP alone was misexpressed at E15.5, neurons were generated in the superficial layers (Fig. 4 R), suggesting that Hes1 andHes5 delayed neuronal differentiation for at least 2 days. We also found that many of the EGFP+ cells remained near the ventricle and that those cells differentiated into GFAP+ astrocytes at P1 (Fig. 4, E–Gand M–O). These results demonstrated that the cells that are inhibited from differentiation by Hes1 orHes5 later differentiate into neurons and glia, consistent with the above notion that Hes1 and Hes5 maintain neural stem cells in the embryonal brain. Immunostaining indicated that some of the cells near the ventricle still expressed Hes1 and Hes5 (Fig. 4, H and P), and it is possible that these Hes1+ or Hes5+ cells could be astrocyte-like neural stem cells. The misexpression study indicated that Hes1 andHes5 are capable of maintaining neural stem cells in the embryonal brain. To further determine whether Hes genes are required for the maintenance of neural stem cells, we performed a neurosphere assay. Neural stem cells plated in low attachment dishes expand in the presence of EGF and bFGF and form ball-like structures called neurospheres (34Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Science. 1992; 255: 1707-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (4545) Google Scholar). Dissociated telencephalic cells were prepared from wild-type, Hes1 −/−,Hes5 −/−, andHes1 −/−-Hes5 −/− mouse embryos of E11.5 and cultured in the presence of EGF and bFGF. After 7 days, many neurospheres were formed in cultures prepared from wild-type, Hes1 −/−, andHes5 −/− embryos (Fig.5, A–C). After 14 days, these neurospheres became larger, althoughHes1 −/− spheres were smaller than the wild-type and Hes5 −/− spheres (Fig.6, E–G). In contrast,Hes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−neurospheres were significantly smaller in size and did not seem to expand during the culture period (Fig. 5, D andH).Figure 6Quantification of neurosphere formation activities.

Because it was sometimes difficult to distinguish between small neurospheres and dying cell clusters, only spheres larger than 50 µm in diameter were counted. At day 10, the majority of neurospheres was still less than 100 µm in diameter in all cultures (Fig. 6 A). However, whereas the total number of spheres larger than 50 µm was over 130 in the wild-type, Hes1 −/−, andHes5 −/− cultures, it was approximately only 40 in Hes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−cultures at day 10 (Fig. 6 A), indicating that the number of sphere-forming cells was significantly reduced in the absence ofHes1 and Hes5. At day 14, larger spheres were increased in the wild-type, Hes1 −/−, andHes5 −/− cultures, although the average size ofHes1 −/− spheres was smaller (average size: wild type, 174.4 µm; Hes1 −/−, 139.2 µm; and in Hes5 −/−, 173.0 µm) (Fig.6 A). In contrast, larger spheres were not increased inHes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−cultures at day 14 (average size: 91.9 µm), suggesting that the expansion ofHes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−spheres stopped (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, whereas there were on average of 11.6 neurospheres that were larger than 300 µm in diameter in the wild-type and Hes5 −/− cultures and 6.3 neurospheres in Hes1 −/− cultures, there were no such neurospheres inHes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−cultures at day 14 (Fig. 6 A). These results indicate thatHes1 and Hes5 are required for the normal expansion of neurospheres. To examine the self-renewal activity of sphere-forming cells, the above neurospheres were dissociated, and an equal number (2 × 103) of cells were replated to form secondary spheres. At day 7, there were ∼90–100 spheres larger than 50 µm in the wild-type, Hes1 −/−, andHes5 −/− cultures, whereas there were only 20 in Hes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−cultures (Fig. 6 B). These results indicate that the number of cells with the self-renewal activity was significantly reduced in the absence of Hes1 and Hes5. In addition, from 2 × 103 replated cells, 5–8 spheres became larger than 300 µm at day 7 in the wild-type,Hes1 −/−, and Hes5 −/−cultures, whereas virtually no such spheres were formed inHes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−cultures (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the growth rate of sphere-forming cells was also significantly reduced in the absence of Hes1and Hes5. To examine the differentiation activity of sphere-forming cells, secondary spheres were plated down in polyethylenimine- and fibronectin-coated dishes and cultured in a differentiation medium. Almost all spheres (>90%) from the wild-type andHes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−cultures generated mixtures of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Fig. 7,A–D). Because it is likely that each sphere arose from a single cell, such sphere-forming cells may represent multipotential neural stem cells. These results indicate that, although the number and growth rate of neural stem cells were severely reduced in the absence of Hes1 and Hes5, their multipotentiality of differentiation was not lost. In addition, cells of secondary spheres from both the wild-type andHes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−cultures very efficiently differentiated into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Fig. 7, E–H). Thus,Hes1 and Hes5 mutation did not affect the generation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, consistent with the above observation that neither Hes1 nor Hes5directly induced gliogenesis in the embryonal brain. We found that misexpression ofHes1 and Hes5 in the developing telencephalon keeps undifferentiated cells in the ventricular zone and that many of the Hes1+ and Hes5+ ventricular cells have a morphology of radial glial cells, which are now identified as neural stem cells. Furthermore, these ventricular cells, which are inhibited from differentiation by Hes1 and Hes5, later differentiate into neurons and glia when Hes gene expression is down-regulated. Thus, the main function of Hes1 andHes5 in the embryonal telencephalon is the maintenance of neural stem cells but not the promotion of gliogenesis, unlike in the retina and PNS. Consistent with this notion, neurosphere assays demonstrated that, in the absence of Hes1 andHes5, neural stem cells prepared from embryonal telencephalon do not efficiently expand, generating fewer and smaller neurospheres. Virtually noHes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−neural stem cells form spheres larger than 300 µm in diameter, whereas wild-type stem cells efficiently form such large spheres. It is likely that most ofHes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−neural stem cells stop cell division and differentiate into neurons and glia. These results are consistent with the previous observation that mutations for Hes1 and/or Hes5 lead to premature neuronal differentiation (7Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.-L. Nakanishi S.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 283-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be determined how Hes1 and Hes5 maintain the undifferentiated state of neural stem cells. It has been shown that Hes1 is able to down-regulate the expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which is required for exit from the cell cycle (35Castella P. Sawai S. Nakao K. Wagner J.A. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6170-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hes1 represses p21 expression not only by directly binding to its promoter but also by inhibiting Mash1-dependent activation (35Castella P. Sawai S. Nakao K. Wagner J.A. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6170-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is likely that this repression of p21 expression leads to cell proliferation and the maintenance of the undifferentiated state. Despite the severe abnormalities,Hes1 −/−-Hes5 −/−neural stem cells still proliferate and form small neurospheres. This observation indicates that there may be anotherHes1/5-related gene involved in the maintenance of neural stem cells. It has been shown that a splicing variant of Hes3, named Hes3b, is expressed at a high level in the midbrain-hindbrain and at lower levels in other regions (13Hirata H. Ohtsuka T. Bessho Y. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19083-19089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Lobe C.G. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hes3b encodes a complete bHLH domain and inhibits neuronal and glial differentiation similarly to Hes1 but in contrast to the other splicing variant Hes3a that has an incomplete basic region and does not inhibit neuronal differentiation (6Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 13Hirata H. Ohtsuka T. Bessho Y. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19083-19089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that Hes3b may also contribute to the maintenance of neural stem cells in the embryonal brain. We previously found that the number of sphere-forming cells was reduced in the absence of Hes1 (17Nakamura Y. Sakakibara S. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Shimazaki T. Weiss S. Kageyama R. Okano H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 283-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the present study, although the growth rate of Hes1 −/−neurospheres was reduced, their number was not significantly affected, suggesting that Hes1 −/− phenotypes became weaker. This change may be attributable to different genetic backgrounds of Hes1-mutant mice; the previous genetic background is the mixture of ICR and 129 strains, whereas the current one is substantially ICR. In the embryonal telencephalon,Hes1 and Hes5 do not induce the development of astrocytes or oligodendrocytes but maintain undifferentiated cells in the ventricular zone. Consistent with this misexpression study, the efficiency of gliogenesis is not affected by Hes1 andHes5 mutation;Hes1 −/−-Hes5 −/− cells differentiate very efficiently into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Notch-Hes1/5 pathway determines the fate of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the developing telencephalon. In contrast, in the PNS, neural crest stem cells differentiate into neurons in the presence of BMP2 but, upon Notch activation, they adopt the glial fate, indicating that Notch directs the fate switch from neurons to glia (22Morrison S.J. Perez S.E. Qiao Z. Verdi J.M. Hicks C. Weinmaster G. Anderson D.J. Cell. 2000; 101: 499-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Strikingly, even transient activation of Notch signaling is sufficient for gliogenesis from neural crest stem cells. In a sharp contrast to neural crest stem cells, many of the Hes1+ and Hes5+ ventricular cells of the telencephalon later differentiate into neurons, indicating that the Notch-Hes pathway does not irreversibly induce gliogenesis in the brain. Alternatively, Notch signaling may play an important role in the generation of late-born neurons in the cortex by transiently preventing neurogenesis. Thus, different cells respond in different ways to the Notch-Hes pathway, but the molecular basis for these diverse responses remains to be determined. In the retina, Notch signaling has been found to promote Müller glial development at the expense of the neuronal fate (18Hojo M. Ohtsuka T. Hashimoto N. Gradwohl G. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Development. 2000; 127: 2515-2522PubMed Google Scholar, 19Furukawa T. Mukherjee S. Bao Z.-Z. Morrow E.M. Cepko C.L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 383-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Interestingly, induction of Müller glial development is also observed in double-mutant mice for the neuronal bHLH genesMash1 and Math3 (37Tomita K. Moriyoshi K. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5460-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 38Hatakeyama J. Tomita K. Inoue T. Kageyama R. Development. 2001; 128: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these mutant retina, the cells that normally differentiate into bipolar neurons adopt the Müller glial fate (37Tomita K. Moriyoshi K. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5460-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 38Hatakeyama J. Tomita K. Inoue T. Kageyama R. Development. 2001; 128: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other regions of the nervous system of Mash1-Math3 double-mutant mice, the cells that normally differentiate into neurons adopt the astrocytic fate, resulting in a loss of neurons and premature generation of astyrocytes (37Tomita K. Moriyoshi K. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5460-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Similarly, the double mutation of Mash1 andNeurogenin2, another neuronal bHLH gene, leads to a decrease of neurons and premature generation of astyrocytes (39Nieto M. Schuurmans C. Britz O. Guillemot F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These results indicate that neuronal bHLH genes such as Mash1,Math3, and Neurogenin not only determine the neuronal fate but also actively inhibit gliogenesis. Consistent with this notion, overexpression of Neurogenin1 actively inhibits astrocyte differentiation (40Sun Y. Nadal-Vicens M. Misono S. Lin M.Z. Zubiaga A. Hua X. Fan G. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 2001; 104: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). These results raised the possibility that down-regulation of neuronal bHLH genes is one of the mechanisms that initiates gliogenesis. Because Hes1 and Hes5 functionally antagonize neuronal bHLH factors (6Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 9Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R.

A. 1997; 94: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), it is likely that misexpression of Hes1 and Hes5 may inactivate Mash1 and Math3, thereby inducing gliogenesis in the retina. However, misexpression of Hes1 and Hes5 did not induce astrocyte development in the embryonal brain. We found that some of the Hes1+ and Hes5+ cells later differentiate into astrocytes at P1. However, this cell type is unlikely to be directly induced by Hes1 and Hes5 but most likely to be a secondary fate from neural stem cells because these astrocytes appear only around the perinatal period. Thus, the Notch-Hes pathway may only secondarily promote astrocyte development in the brain by maintaining neural stem cells until astrocytic differentiation occurs. Recent studies suggest that misexpression of Id1, a helix-loop-helix factor that dominant-negatively regulates neuronal bHLH factors, generates astrocytes (42Cai L. Morrow E.M. Cepko C.L. Development. 2000; 127: 3021-3030PubMed Google Scholar). However, these astrocytes also appear only postnatally, and therefore, the astrocytic fate choice by Id1 could be indirect. Currently, we do not have a clear answer as to why activation of the Notch-Hes pathway induces gliogenesis in the retina but not in the brain, although inactivation of Mash1, Math3, andNeurogenin2 induces gliogenesis in both the retina and brain. It is possible that the Notch-Hes1/5 pathway may suppress astrocytic genes in addition to Mash1, Math3, andNeurogenin in the brain as observed for oligodendrocyte development in the optic nerve, which is inhibited by the Notch-Hes5 pathway (43Wang S. Sdrulla A.D. diSibio G. Bush G. Nofziger D. Hicks C. Weinmaster G. Barres B.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Notch signaling is modulated by many factors, such as Numb and Mastermind (21Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4896) Google Scholar). Thus, the Notch-Hes1/5 pathway could be modulated by such factors so that neurogenesis but not gliogenesis is blocked. Further characterization of Notch modulators is necessary to understand the diverse functions of Notch signaling. We thank Drs.

MDM2 regulates p53 either through inhibiting p53's transactivating function in the nucleus or by targeting p53 degradation in the cytoplasm. We identified a previously unknown nuclear export signal (NES) in the amino terminus of p53, spanning residues 11 to 27 and containing two serine residues phosphorylated after DNA damage, which was required for p53 nuclear export in colloboration with the carboxyl-terminal NES. Serine-15-phosphorylated p53 induced by ultraviolet irradiation was not exported.

Ligand binding stimulates phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Ste2p and Ste3p cytoplasmic tails, and both modifications are required for rapid receptor internalization (17Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J.

Monoubiquitination of the retroviral Gag protein is required for a late step in virus budding (26Patnaik A. Chau V. Wills J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Independent of the proteasome, the formation of polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys63 on the L28 ribosomal protein regulates ribosome activity (29Spence J. Gali R.R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D. Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains activate the IκB kinase (30Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E.

These functions of ubiquitin have recently been discovered, and little is known about how they regulate protein structure and/or activity.Although ubiquitin is a small protein, it is complex compared with other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. In this study, we have begun to define the important functional features on ubiquitin's surface. First, we have identified the ubiquitin amino acids that are essential for vegetative growth of a yeast cell. These residues map to the ubiquitin tail and to two distinct functional faces of the ubiquitin globular domain. Second, we demonstrate that distinct amino acids of ubiquitin mediate its two best characterized functions. Whereas Ile44 and surrounding hydrophobic residues are required for both proteasome recognition and endocytosis (11Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 21Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), a distinct surface region of ubiquitin containing Phe4 is required only for endocytosis.DISCUSSIONThe ubiquitin molecule comprises a compact globular domain that consists of a five-stranded β-sheet and an α-helix and a flexible tail formed by four protruding residues (42Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Wilkinson K.D. Cook W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3582-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 43Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Two surface regions that are important for the defined functions of ubiquitin in proteasome recognition and endocytosis have been mapped onto this structure. A hydrophobic patch including Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 is required for proteasome degradation (11Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and plays a critical role in endocytosis (21Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Phe4 and adjacent residues are important for the endocytic role of ubiquitin but do not function in proteasome binding and degradation. Although the C-terminal tail of ubiquitin is required for all known ubiquitin functions, the essential nature of this structural feature is due to its role in conjugation. The tail is not known to be important for downstream recognition in any ubiquitin signaling pathway.The ubiquitin residues essential for vegetative growth of yeast lie on these same three surface features, namely the tail and two distinct clusters on the globular core domain centered around Phe4or the Leu8/Ile44/Val70 hydrophobic patch (Fig. 1 B). Many of the essential amino acids we identified are known to be involved in ubiquitination, deubiquitination, and/or proteasome-mediated degradation (see below), all essential cellular processes. Except for the C terminus, the essential surface ubiquitin residues do not correlate closely with surface residues conserved in both of the ubiquitin-like proteins Rub1p and Smt3p (Fig. 1 A). Although the Leu8/Ile44/Val70 hydrophobic patch is conserved in Rub1p, Rub1p does not efficiently signal endocytosis when fused to Ste2p. 2J. C. Jemc and L. Hicke, unpublished data. Our results suggest that the inability of Rub1p to signal endocytosis may be due to the absence of residues comprising the Phe4patch. Nedd8, the mammalian Rub1p homologue, can replace one of the ubiquitins in tetraubiquitin. This observation suggests that the inability of Rub1p/Nedd8 to signal proteasomal proteolysis may reflect the absence of enzymatic mechanisms for assembly into substrate-linked chains, rather than an inability of proteasomes to recognize Rub1p/Nedd8 chains (39Whitby F.G. Xia G. Pickart C.M. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34983-34991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).The ubiquitin tail consists of the essential residues Leu73, Arg74, Gly75, and Gly76. Gly75 and Gly76 are important for ubiquitin conjugation and deubiquitination (44Hodgins R.R. Ellison K.S. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8807-8812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Pickart C.M. Kasperek E.M. Beal R. Kim A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Arg74 is essential even though it is not important for E1 interaction or ubiquitin conjugation. These residues may be important for deubiquitination (47Johnston S.C. Riddle S.M. Cohen R.E. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3877-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and possibly for proteasome recognition as well (13Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Xu X.X. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6980-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Arg74 and Leu73 play a minor role in endocytosis.The essential surface cluster including Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 consists of nine amino acids that extend from the base of the ubiquitin tail up to Gly47and Lys48 (Fig. 1 B). All of these residues are probably involved in ubiquitin conjugation and/or proteasome degradation, and they may also be important for deubiquitination (48Lam Y.A. DeMartino G.N. Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28438-28446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Lys48 is the major site of polyubiquitin chain formation that is necessary for proteasome degradation (5Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The role of Gly47 has not been characterized, but since it bridges Lys48 and the Ile44 hydrophobic patch, it may play a role in proteasome degradation. Arg42 and Arg72 are required for efficient activation of ubiquitin by the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (14Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39Whitby F.G. Xia G. Pickart C.M. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34983-34991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and Ile36plays a role in conjugation and/or proteasome recognition (11Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The function of Leu71 has not been investigated, but since it lies adjacent to Ile36, Val70, and Arg72 it is likely to play a role in conjugation or proteasome degradation.The second essential cluster on the globular domain surface consists of residues Gln2, Phe4, and Thr12. Phe4 is critical for endocytosis, and Gln2 and Thr12 play a minor role. The effect of the F4A and F4Y mutations is not due to structural instability, because these mutant variants are conjugated to substrates efficiently (Fig. 2 A) and are expressed as well as wild type ubiquitin in yeast cells (data not shown). Moreover, the F4A and F4Y mutant proteins are recognized by proteasomes in the context of polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 3). Although most of the Phe4 patch residues involved in endocytosis are essential, endocytosis itself is not absolutely required for vegetative growth of yeast at 24 °C (49Bénédetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 50Wesp A. Hicke L. Palecek J. Lombardi R. Aust T. Munn A.L. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2291-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This suggests that the Phe4 patch may be involved in other, non-proteasome-dependent functions of ubiquitin. We conclude that ubiquitin carries a distinct essential surface region that is important for endocytosis, and perhaps for uncharacterized functions of ubiquitin, but not for proteasome degradation.Our observations demonstrate that the Ile44 hydrophobic patch is critical for multiple functions of ubiquitin and suggest that Ile44 may interact with different proteins to facilitate either proteasome degradation or endocytosis. Proteasome degradation requires interaction of the Leu8/Ile44/Val70 hydrophobic patch with a regulatory subunit(s) of the proteasome. To promote endocytosis, Ile44 together with Phe4 may form an extended binding site that interacts with a component of the endocytic machinery. Alternatively, Phe4 and Ile44 may interact with different endocytic proteins. Efficient proteasome binding requires a tetraubiquitin chain, whereas endocytosis is triggered by monoubiquitination. Therefore, the interaction of a specific binding partner with Ile44 may depend on the type of ubiquitin modification. Although monoubiquitinated receptors are efficiently recognized for endocytosis, the actual endocytic signal may be more complicated than a single ubiquitin. For example, monoubiquitinated plasma membrane proteins such as Ste2p form multimers (51Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 52Yesilaltay A. Jenness D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), potentially allowing the display of a unique multimeric binding surface composed of noncovalently linked, but closely associated, ubiquitin monomers. Alternatively, the location of the ubiquitinated proteins at the plasma membrane may influence binding partner selection.Monoubiquitin functions as a signal for internalization not only in yeast but also in higher eukaryotes. A fused ubiquitin moiety lacking lysine residues is sufficient for the endocytosis of chimeric plasma membrane proteins expressed in mammalian cells (22Nakatsu F. Sakuma M. Matsuo Y. Arase H. Yamasaki S. Nakamura N. Saito T. Ohno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26213-26219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As in yeast, Ile44 is important for ubiquitin-dependent internalization in animal cells (22Nakatsu F. Sakuma M. Matsuo Y. Arase H. Yamasaki S. Nakamura N. Saito T. Ohno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26213-26219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The function of Phe4in animal cell endocytosis has not been reported. Ile44 is part of a ubiquitin sequence, DQQRL43I44, that is similar to the DKQTLL dileucine endocytosis signal that was identified in the CD3 subunit of the T cell receptor (53Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Like Ile44, the mutation of the buried Leu43 to Ala severely inhibits endocytosis in yeast and animal cells (21Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 22Nakatsu F. Sakuma M. Matsuo Y. Arase H. Yamasaki S. Nakamura N. Saito T. Ohno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26213-26219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). DQQRLI alone can serve as a transferable linear internalization signal when appended to a heterologous protein in mammalian cells (22Nakatsu F. Sakuma M. Matsuo Y. Arase H. Yamasaki S. Nakamura N. Saito T. Ohno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26213-26219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, DQQRLI as a linear peptide signal cannot promote endocytosis in yeast (21Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Leu43 is buried in the hydrophobic core of the folded ubiquitin polypeptide and is therefore unlikely to be accessible for binding to endocytic machinery as part of a linear dileucine internalization signal.In conclusion, ubiquitin carries a limited number of essential surface residues with defined functions in proteasome-mediated degradation or endocytosis. All essential residues are in, or adjacent to, two distinct hydrophobic surface patches. One of these surfaces is multifunctional and is involved in proteasome degradation and receptor endocytosis. The second, smaller hydrophobic surface is required for endocytosis but not for conjugation or proteasomal degradation. Previous mutational analyses of ubiquitin targeted a limited number of residues, and, with a few exceptions, consequences were examined with only one or a few enzymes. The present study is the first comprehensive analysis of essential features of the ubiquitin surface. Despite the functional importance implied by ubiquitin's extraordinary conservation, the majority of ubiquitin surface residues can be mutated without affecting viability under laboratory conditions. Perhaps the nonessential residues provide an evolutionary advantage in the outside environment by participating in nonessential ubiquitin-dependent processes such as DNA repair, histone modification, or the regulation of ribosomal proteins (8Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pham A.D. Sauer F.

Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D. Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Conjugation to ubiquitin targets cellular proteins for degradation through two major pathways. Ubiquitination is required for the selective proteolysis of many intracellular proteins by the 26 S proteasome (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of plasma membrane proteins require ubiquitination to signal their internalization or sorting in the endocytic pathway and subsequent degradation in the lysosome (2Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 3Hicke L.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Modification of substrates with ubiquitin proceeds through a three-enzyme cascade, resulting in the formation of a covalent isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine 76 of ubiquitin and a lysine residue in the target protein. Some substrates are conjugated to just one ubiquitin, whereas others are conjugated to multiple ubiquitins in the form of a polyubiquitin chain. Chains connected through three of ubiquitin's seven lysine residues (Lys29, Lys48, and Lys63) have been identified in vivo in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Efficient recognition of ubiquitinated substrates by the 26 S proteasome requires a minimum targeting signal consisting of four ubiquitin moieties linked to each other through isopeptide bonds between Gly76 and Lys48 (5Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 10Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). The Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 amino acids in the ubiquitin polypeptide, known collectively as the hydrophobic patch, are critical for proteasomal degradation, although mutations in these residues have little effect on the formation of ubiquitin conjugates (11Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Mutations of ubiquitin tail residues that disrupt ubiquitin conjugation can also affect proteolysis (12Ecker D.J. Butt T.R. Marsh J. Sternberg E.J. Margolis N. Monia B.P. Jonnalagadda S. Khan M.I.

Ubiquitination regulates the endocytic traffic of signaling receptors, ion channels, permeases, and transporters in yeast and mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 2Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 3Hicke L.

In mammalian cells, the down-regulation of growth factor receptors and the epithelial sodium channel by endocytosis and degradation in the lysosome is regulated by ubiquitination. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, G protein-coupled signaling receptors (Ste2p and Ste3p) as well as permeases and transporters are internalized into the endocytic pathway by a ubiquitin signal. Ligand binding stimulates phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Ste2p and Ste3p cytoplasmic tails, and both modifications are required for rapid receptor internalization (17Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Cell. 1988; 55: 221-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 18Hicke L. Riezman H.

Receptors that lack post-translational ubiquitination sites in their cytoplasmic tails can be internalized by monoubiquitin fused in-frame (20Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitin also promotes internalization of plasma membrane proteins in mammalian cells when it is fused to an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (22Nakatsu F. Sakuma M. Matsuo Y. Arase H. Yamasaki S. Nakamura N. Saito T. Ohno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26213-26219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The single fused ubiquitin carries within its three-dimensional structure all of the information necessary for regulated endocytosis (21Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In contrast, monoubiquitin is an inefficient signal for proteasome recognition (10Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is important for other cellular functions. Monoubiquitination of histones plays a role in meiosis in yeast and the development ofDrosophila embryos (23Pham A.D. Sauer F. Sci"
https://openalex.org/W1522674317,"Angiogenesis is associated with several pathological disorders as well as with normal physiological maintenance. Components of vascular basement membrane are speculated to regulate angiogenesis in both positive and negative manner. Recently, we reported that tumstatin (the NC1 domain of α3 chain of type IV collagen) and its deletion mutant tum-5 possess anti-angiogenic activity. In the present study, we confirm that the anti-angiogenic activity of tumstatin and tum-5 is independent of disulfide bond requirement. This property of tum-5 allowed us to use overlapping synthetic peptide strategy to identify peptide sequence(s) which possess anti-angiogenic activity. Among these peptides, only the T3 peptide (69–88 amino acids) and T7 peptide (74–98 amino acids) inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis specifically in endothelial cells. The peptides, similar to tumstatin and the tum-5 domain, bind and function via α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> in an RGD-independent manner. Restoration of a disulfide bond between two cysteines within the peptide did not alter the anti-angiogenic activity. Additionally, these studies show that tumstatin peptides can inhibit proliferation of endothelial cells in the presence of vitronectin, fibronectin, and collagen I. Anti-angiogenic effect of the peptides was further confirmed <i>in vivo</i> using a Matrigel plug assay in C57BL/6 mice. Collectively, these experiments suggest that the anti-angiogenic activity of tumstatin is localized to a 25-amino acid region of tumstatin and it is independent of disulfide bond linkage. Structural features and potency of the tumstatin peptide make it highly feasible as a potential anti-cancer drug."

Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). For example, PPARγ is a central component of the adipocyte differentiation program and regulates genes involved in lipogenesis and peripheral glucose utilization. In contrast, PPARα target genes are involved in fatty acid catabolism and utilization. Potential natural ligands for PPARs include a broad range of polyunsaturated fatty acids (4Kliewer S.A.

However, each of these molecules has effects independent of their ability to activate PPARs, and their role in PPAR signaling in vivo remains unclear. A number of high affinity synthetic ligands exist for both PPARα and -γ. Hypolipidemic fibrate drugs are activators of PPARα (11Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3011) Google Scholar), whereas a class of antidiabetic drugs known as thiazolidinediones are potent and selective activators of PPARγ (12Willson T.M. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Evidence is emerging that PPARs, and the γ isoform in particular, are important in regulating pathways beyond energy homeostasis (13Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For example, activating ligands of PPARγ have been shown to modulate the growth of epithelial cells derived from diverse organs (14Mueller E. Sarraf P. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Martin K.J. Zhang M.

This is perhaps most evident in the colon, which was found to express levels of PPARγ mRNA nearly equivalent to that found in adipocytes (19Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18779-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Within the colon, the highest levels of receptor expression have been observed in post-mitotic, differentiated epithelial cells (20Mansen A. Guardiola-Diaz H. Rafter J. Branting C. Gustafsson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 844-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Lefebvre M. Paulweber B. Fajas L. Woods J. McCrary C. Colombel J.F. Najib J. Fruchart J.C. Datz C. Vidal H. Desreumaux P. Auwerx J. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 162: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Consistent with this expression pattern, activation of PPARγ in cultured colon cancer cells induces growth inhibition and an increase in several markers of cellular differentiation (22Sarraf P. Mueller E. Jones D. King F.J. DeAngelo D.J. Partridge J.B. Holden S.A. Chen L.B. Singer S. Fletcher C. Spiegelman B.M. Nat.

Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1049-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Whether or not the anti-neoplastic effects of PPARγ ligands operate in vivo remains controversial. For example, agonists of the receptor reduce pre-malignant intestinal lesions in rats treated with the carcinogen azoxymethane (24Tanaka T. Kohno H. Yoshitani S. Takashima S. Okumura A. Murakami A. Hosokawa M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2424-2428PubMed Google Scholar) but slightly increase colon polyps in mice that are predisposed to intestinal adenomas because of a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene (25Saez E. Tontonoz P. Nelson M.C. Alvarez J.G. Ming U.T. Baird S.M. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1058-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 26Lefebvre A.M. Chen I. Desreumaux P. Najib J. Fruchart J.C. Geboes K. Briggs M. Heyman R. Auwerx J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Finally, 8% of primary colorectal tumors were found to harbor a loss of function mutation in one allele of the PPARγ gene emphasizing a putative role for this receptor as a tumor suppressor in humans (27Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). PPARγ may also be important in modulating the intestinal inflammatory response. Ligands for PPARγ have been shown to inhibit the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in colonic epithelial cells through an NF-κB-dependent mechanism (28Su C.G. Wen X. Bailey S.T. Jiang W. Rangwala S.M. Keilbaugh S.A. Flanigan A. Murthy S. Lazar M.A. Wu G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease, mice treated with PPARγ agonists exhibit decreases in several indices of inflammation. In addition, mice that are heterozygous for the PPARγ gene show an increased sensitivity to chemicals that induce colitis (29Nakajima A. Wada K. Miki H. Kubota N. Nakajima N. Terauchi Y. Ohnishi S. Saubermann L.J. Kadowaki T. Blumberg R.S. Nagai R. Matsuhashi N. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 460-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To understand better how PPARγ regulates different facets of intestinal epithelial cell biology, we sought to identify PPARγ-regulated genes in a human colorectal cancer cell line using microarray technology. PPARγ-selective targets included genes involved in the regulation of cell growth, colon epithelial cell maturation, and inflammation. In addition, three different members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family were induced by PPARγ. Consistent with this, exposure of colon cancer cells to a PPARγ ligand induced an increase in Ca2+-independent, CEA-dependent homotypic aggregation, suggesting a potential role for PPARγ in regulating intercellular adhesion. The MOSER S (M-S) (30Levine A.E. McRae L.J. Hamilton D.A. Brattain D.E. Yeoman L.C. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2248-2254PubMed Google Scholar) colon carcinoma line was a gift of M. Brattain (University of Texas Health Sciences, San Antonio, TX), and COS7 cells were purchased from the ATCC. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone), l-glutamine (2 mmol/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 µg/ml) in a 5% CO2atmosphere with constant humidity. For all experiments in which a receptor ligand was added, cells were grown in the above media except regular 10% FBS was replaced with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (HyClone). All total RNA isolations were done using the TRI-reagent (Molecular Research Center). All synthetic PPAR and RXR ligands were from GlaxoSmithKline and dissolved in Me2SO. The Me2SO concentration of all experiments was kept constant at 0.1%. The following synthetic ligands were used in our studies to determine the specificity (i.e. PPARγ-dependent or -independent) and selectivity (i.e. PPAR subtype-specific) of each induction or repression: rosiglitazone (thiazolidinedione PPARγ agonist (31Lehmann J.M.

Each compound was used at a concentration where it is selective for the indicated isoform. M-S cells and COS7 cells transiently transfected with either mPPARγ/pCDNA3.0, hPPARδ/pCDNA3.1, or hPPARα/pBKCMV were harvested in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (1× PBS), and cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer. Centrifuged lysates (50 µg) from each cell line were fractionated on a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% powdered milk. Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: monoclonal anti-PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500), rabbit polyclonal anti-PPARδ ((35Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W.G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K.

Winegar D.A. Hybridoma. 1998; 17: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); 1:1000). This was followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (The Jackson Laboratory) at a dilution of 1:50,000 for 1 h. Detection of immunoreactive polypeptides was accomplished using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). M-S cells (5.0 × 105/well in 24-well plates) were transfected with a mix containing 0.66 µg/ml PPRE3-tk-luciferase (a gift of R. Evans, Salk Institute (La Jolla, CA)), 0.66 µg/ml pRL-TK (Promega), and 0.66 µg/ml pCNDA3 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 h. FUGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the transfection mix at a lipid:DNA ratio of 3.5:1. The transfection mix was replaced with complete media containing either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or the indicated ligand. After 24–36 h, cells were harvested in 1× luciferase lysis buffer. Relative light units from firefly luciferase activity were determined using a luminometer (MGM Instruments) and normalized to the relative light units fromRenilla luciferase using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104/well in 6-well plates and replaced the next day with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS and either 0.1% Me2SO or the indicated ligand. Cells were exposed to fresh media and compound every 48 h. Cells were counted at the indicated times using a Coulter counter. Each experiment was done in triplicate. Human Named Genes GENEFILTERS Release I blots (Research Genetics) were probed with [33P]dCTP-labeled cDNA synthesized from RNA isolated from exponentially growing M-S cells that had been exposed for 24 h or 6 days to 0.1% Me2SO or 1 µm of the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone. The cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase primed with oligo(dT) primers. For the 6-day treatment, fresh media and compound were added every 48 h. Membranes were hybridized and washed according to manufacturer's instructions. The blots were imaged using the Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (Hewlitt-Packard) and imported into the Pathways Software (Research Genetics) to identify differences in the intensity of cDNA spots between different treatments. Total RNA was isolated from M-S cells exposed to 0.1% Me2SO or 1 µmof the PPARγ ligand GW7845 for 24 h. The RNA was subsequently treated with DNase I and cleaned up using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Samples were sent to the DNA Facility at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA), where the RNA samples were converted to biotinylated cRNA and probed to the Affymetrix Human GeneFL GeneChip arrays according to manufacturer's directions. By using the difference call decision matrix algorithm, the Affymetrix chip software identified a total of 89 genes (1.6% of transcripts) that were induced or repressed 2.5 times or greater after treatment with the PPARγ ligand GW7845. Fourteen out of these 89 were tested for confirmation by Northern blot hybridization, and 9:14 (60%) were confirmed as true positives. By using the confidence interval Equation 1, p^±1.96p(1−p)/n−12n(Eq. 1) a 95% confidence interval was obtained for the estimate of “true positives” found in the sample of 14 genes based on Northern blot. This 95% confidence interval can be used to estimate the interval that for 95% of the time will cover true value of the proportion of true positives. This can then be used as an estimate for the proportion of true positives from the original 89 genes the Affymetrix software detected as important. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (10Gupta R.A. Tan J. Krause W.F. Geraci M.W. Willson T.M. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13275-13280Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing M-S cells were treated with the indicated PPAR or RXR ligand for 24 h or 6 days. Total RNA from each sample (20 µg) was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Hybond-NX nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were pre-hybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in Ultrahyb (Ambion). Hybridization was conducted in the same buffer in the presence of 32P-radiolabeled partial cDNA fragment of the indicated gene. Blots were washed 4 times for 15 min at 50 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and once for 30 min in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Membranes were then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and images were analyzed using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System and Optiquant Software (Hewlitt-Packard). Each membrane generated was also hybridized with a [32P]dCTP-labeled probe for 1B15/cyclophilin (37Medhurst A.D. Harrison D.C. Read S.J. Campbell C.A. Robbins M.J. Pangalos M.N. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 98: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) to normalize for differences in RNA loading. Partial cDNA fragments for adipophilin, RegIA, keratin 20, BGP, and NCA were generated by PCR with M13 forward and reverse primers using a sequence-validated human IMAGE cDNA clone (Research Genetics) of each gene as a template. Partial cDNA fragments for L-FABP and Gob-4 were generated using reverse transcriptase-PCR and gene-specific primers corresponding to 56–375 base pairs for L-FABP and 283–550 base pairs for Gob-4 (each from the translational start site). The template for these PCRs was a random-primed cDNA library of M-S cells treated with either 0.1% Me2SO or 1 µmrosiglitazone. Both of these PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm gene identity. A partial fragment of CEA was obtained by restriction digest of full-length CEA cloned into pBLUESCRIPT (SK+) obtained from C. Stanners (McGill Cancer Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The protocol used was identical to the methods reported by Yan et al (38Yan Z. Deng X. Chen M. Xu Y. Ahram M. Sloane B.F. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27902-27907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing M-S cells were treated with 0.1% Me2SO or the indicated ligand for 4 days, with fresh media and compound added after the first 48 h. Cells were then harvested by gentle trypsinization with 0.025% trypsin and 0.01% EDTA. After resuspending the cells in 10 mm EDTA in 1× PBS (at a density of 2 × 106/ml), pelleted cells were resuspended in 5 mm EDTA, 1× PBS. This was followed by disaggregation that was achieved by repeated forceful passages through a Pasteur pipette to generate single cell suspensions. Aliquots were then transferred to a 15 × 100-mm test tube and shaken for the indicated time at room temperature (tubes were placed at a 45° angle). A sample was taken, and the total number of cells and the number of single cells for each sample were counted using a hemocytometer. Each experiment was done in triplicate. For the antibody blocking experiments, Fab′ fragments from normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-CEA antibody (CEA Ab-2, NeoMarkers) were isolated using papain digestion followed by incubation with protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to remove both undigested antibody and Fc fragments. The anti-CEA antibody reacts to CEA and CEA-like proteins including BGP and NCA. Fab′ fragments at a concentration of 1 mg/ml were added to the aggregation experiments when indicated. The M-S colon carcinoma line was evaluated for its suitability in studying gene expression changes in response to PPARγ activation in intestinal epithelial cells. The cell line was found to express protein for all three PPAR subtypes (Fig.1 A). PPARγ transcriptional activity was measured in cells transfected with the PPRE3-tk-luc reporter vector that contains a luciferase cDNA downstream of three tandem repeats of the PPAR-response element (PPRE) from the acyl-CoA oxidase gene (39Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). PPARγ agonists from two different chemical families (rosiglitazone and GW7845) induced a dose-dependent increase in reporter activity that could be blocked by co-treatment with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (Fig.1 B). Either of these two PPARγ agonists also induced a time-dependent decrease in cell number compared with vehicle-treated cells; this decrease in cell growth could be reversed by co-treatment with GW9662 (Fig.2 A). The PPARα-selective compound GW7647 or the PPARδ-selective ligand GW1514 had negligible effects on the growth of the M-S cells (Fig. 2 B). Thus, activation of PPARγ activity in these cells induces a specific and significant decrease in cell number. This decrease in cell number was not due to an increase in apoptosis but rather a delay in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (data not shown).Figure 2PPAR γ specifically and selectively inhibits the growth of the M-S colon carcinoma cell line. A, M-S cells were treated with the PPARγ agonists rosiglitazone (1.0 µm) or GW7845 (1.0 µm), the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (5.0 µm), or a combination of rosiglitazone and GW9662, and the number of cells were counted at days 2, 4, and 6 post-treatment.B, M-S cells were treated with the PPARγ agonists rosiglitazone (1.0 µm) or GW7845 (1.0 µm), the PPARα agonist GW7647 (1.0 µm), or the PPARδ agonist GW1514 (1.0 µm), and the number of cells were counted at days 2, 4, and 6 post-treatment. Each data point represents the mean of three independent experiments. Error bars = S.E. DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two different microarray technologies were used to identify genes induced or repressed in the M-S cells exposed to rosiglitazone (see “Experimental Procedures” for extended details). Membranes containing 5,184 non-control spotted cDNAs (Research Genetics) or oligonucleotide-based arrays that represent 5,600 unique genes (Affymetrix) were used. A short treatment time (24 h) was examined with the intent of identifying direct PPARγ target genes that are responsible for the growth inhibition and differentiation induced by activation of the receptor. An extended treatment time (6 days) was also evaluated to understand the gene expression pattern in cells that have already significantly growth-arrested due to PPARγ activation. Data from the cDNA filter arrays were found to contain a large number of false positives and were used only to help interpret data obtained from the oligonucleotide-based arrays. By using the difference call decision matrix algorithm, the Affymetrix chip software identified a total of 89 genes (1.6% of transcripts) that were induced or repressed 2.5 times or greater after treatment with the PPARγ ligand GW7845. Fourteen of these genes were selected for independent confirmation by Northern blot hybridization. Four of these genes (adipophilin, keratin 20, NCA, and L-FABP) were selected based on their prior identification as PPARγ targets using cDNA filter arrays. These were the only four gene targets commonly identified by both array methods. The other nine genes were selected for secondary confirmation based on a combination of cDNA probe availability and putative gene function. From this subset analysis, 9:14 genes (60%) on the Affymetrix chip could be verified by Northern blot hybridization (TableI). Based on these results, a confidence interval equation was used to estimate the proportion of true positives from the original 89 genes detected by the Affymetrix software (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The result was a 95% confidence interval of 0.31 and 0.82. This can be read as 95% of the time the true value of the proportion of true positives will lie between 0.31 and 0.82.Table ISummary of genes induced or repressed after exposure of M-S colon carcinoma cells to the PPARγ ligand BRL49653Gene nameFold change1-aRelative fold induction calculated by measuring the digital light units (DLU)/mm2 of each indicated mRNA in storage phosphorimages of Northern blots containing total RNA (20 µg) from cells treated with 0.1% Me2SO or 1 µm rosiglitazone and hybridized with the appropriate labeled cDNA.

The cellular proteins that regulate V-ATPases remain largely unknown. A screen for proteins that bind the V-ATPase E subunit using the yeast two-hybrid assay identified the cDNA clone coded for aldolase, an enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. The interaction between E subunit and aldolase was confirmedin vitro by precipitation assays using E subunit-glutathione S-transferase chimeric fusion proteins and metabolically labeled aldolase. Aldolase was isolated associated with intact V-ATPase from bovine kidney microsomes and osteoclast-containing mouse marrow cultures in co-immunoprecipitation studies performed using an anti-E subunit monoclonal antibody. The interaction was not affected by incubation with aldolase substrates or products. In immunocytochemical assays, aldolase was found to colocalize with V-ATPase in the renal proximal tubule. In osteoclasts, the aldolase-V-ATPase complex appeared to undergo a subcellular redistribution from perinuclear compartments to the ruffled membranes following activation of resorption. In yeast cells deficient in aldolase, the peripheral V1 domain of V-ATPase was found to dissociate from the integral membrane V0 domain, indicating direct coupling of glycolysis to the proton pump. The direct binding interaction between V-ATPase and aldolase may be a new mechanism for the regulation of the V-ATPase and may underlie the proximal tubule acidification defect in hereditary fructose intolerance.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). V-ATPases function in the acidification of a variety of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells (2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and in proton secretion from the plasma membrane of some specialized cells in higher organisms (3Gluck S.L. Underhill D.M. Iyori M.

Bioessays. 1999; 21: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are required for maintaining the acidity of endosomes, lysosomes, Golgi-derived vesicles, chromaffin granules, the central vacuoles of yeast and plants, and some clathrin-coated vesicles (2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In some specific cells of the proximal tubule and collecting duct of the kidney, V-ATPases are present at high densities on the plasma membrane and have a central role in maintaining the acid-base balance of the organism (3Gluck S.L. Underhill D.M. Iyori M. Holliday L.S. Kostrominova T.Y. Lee B.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 427-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In osteoclasts, cells that are essential for bone remodeling, densely packed V-ATPases reside in a specialized domain of the apical plasma membrane known as the ruffled membrane, where they acidify an extracellular compartment at the site of attachment to bone (5Gluck S.L. Lee B.S. Wang S.P. Underhill D. Nemoto J. Holliday L.S. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar). Osteoclast proton secretion is required both for dissolution of bone mineral and for efficient degradation of bone matrix proteins by acid cysteine proteinases (6Holliday L.S. Welgus H.G. Fliszar C.A. Veith G.M. Jeffrey J.J. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22053-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).During the past decade, much effort has been devoted to isolating genes that encode the subunits of V-ATPases, determining how V-ATPase genes are regulated, and identifying interactions among subunits to allow modeling of the overall structure of the V-ATPase (7Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that V-ATPases bind regulatory proteins other than their own subunits. First, fractions have been isolated from bovine kidneys that either activate or inhibit V-ATPase activity in vitro. The activating and inhibiting activities were greatly enriched and were shown to have physical properties suggesting that they are proteins (8Zhang K. Wang Z.Q. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14539-14542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhang K. Wang Z.Q. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9701-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the carboxyl-terminal domain of the B1 subunit was found to interact with the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor in a cell type-specific manner (10Breton S. Wiederhold T. Marshansky V. Nsumu N.N. Ramesh V. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18219-18224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Third, the H subunit of the V-ATPase has been shown to interact with the human immunodeficiency virus protein Nef and through this interaction may be involved in the regulation of CD4 levels on the surface of T cells (11Lu X., Yu, H. Liu S.H. Brodsky F.M. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Fourth, the c subunit, which is the primary component of the proton pore, has been shown to interact with α2β1 integrin (12Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23119-23127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and with the human papillomavirus E5 protein and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (13Goldstein D.J. Andresson T. Sparkowski J.J. Schlegel R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4851-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Finally, we have demonstrated that V-ATPase interacts with microfilaments during osteoclast activation (14Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This interaction appears to be mediated by high affinity microfilament binding sites in the amino-terminal domain of the B subunits (15Holliday L.S. Lu M. Lee B.S. Nelson R.D. Solivan S. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32331-32337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase-microfilament interaction varies with the activation state of osteoclasts, suggesting a new mechanism for controlling bone resorption. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that to understand V-ATPase assembly, transport, targeting, and regulation, it will be necessary to identify and study proteins that bind V-ATPase subunits but are not elements of the core structure of the enzyme.V-ATPase consists of a complex of peripheral subunits known as the V1 that attaches to a complex of integral proteins known as V0. The regulation of V-ATPase activity following physiologic stimulation occurs at several levels, including increased gene transcription and protein synthesis (16Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that V1 and V0 can dissociate from each other and remain in dynamic equilibrium with the holoenzyme. In the midgut of the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), disassembly of V-ATPases into V1 and V0 occurs during molting and can be induced by starvation of the intermolt larvae (19Jager D. Novak F.J. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Klein U. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1019-1027PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast cells, brief glucose deprivation induced dissociation of V1 from V0, which was fully reversible upon the readdition of glucose and did not require new protein synthesis (20Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V-ATPase dissociation induced by glucose removal did not involve the cyclic AMP/Ras pathway, the Snf1p kinase, protein kinase C, or the stress response protein Rts1p, which are major proteins for glucose signaling in yeast (20Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the mechanism underlying the V-ATPase disassembly induced by glucose starvation remains unknown.In this study, we present several lines of evidence that the E subunit of the V-ATPase binds the glycolytic enzyme aldolase. On the basis of these data, we suggest that direct binding of aldolase to V-ATPase may provide a basis for coupling glycolysis directly to the ATP-hydrolyzing proton pump.RESULTSWe previously cloned the gene coding for the E subunit of V-ATPase (16Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Hirsch S. Strauss A. Masood K. Lee S. Sukhatme V. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3004-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and made monoclonal antibodies against its protein product (25Hemken P. Guo X.L. Wang Z.Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E subunit of V-ATPases does not share homology with any subunits of F-ATPases and thus is likely to play a role in the unique function and regulation of V-ATPases. To search for protein binding partners of the E subunit, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays using a triple selection system, with human full-length E subunit as the bait, selecting from a human kidney cDNA expression library. One of the first three cDNA clones identified as interacting with E subunit was the H subunit of V-ATPase (Fig. 1). This finding is consistent with a previous report indicating that the E subunit could be cross-linked to the H subunit in V-ATPase from bovine clathrin-coated vesicles (30Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and further validated our yeast two-hybrid assay. The second clone showed no homology to any DNA or peptide sequences in the GenBankTM data base. The third cDNA clone had 100% identity to the coding sequence for human aldolase C (31Rottmann W.H. Deselms K.R. Niclas J. Camerato T. Holman P.S. Green C.J. Tolan D.R. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), an enzyme essential for glycolysis.To confirm the interaction between the E subunit and aldolase, we performed precipitation assays with GST-E subunit fusion proteins. The coding sequence for the E subunit was ligated, in frame, to the coding sequence for GST in a bacterial expression vector as described under “Materials and Methods.” The resulting GST-E subunit fusion protein was purified from bacteria with glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with aldolase C labeled in vitro with [35S]methionine. After extensive washing, the glutathione beads were boiled in sample buffer, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and autoradiography (33Pollard J.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 32: 67-72PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of labeled aldolase C to the GST-E subunit fusion protein was evident in the precipitation assays (Fig.2 B, lane 1); in contrast, no binding to GST was detected (Fig.2 B, lane 2).Figure 2In vitro interaction between V-ATPase and aldolase. A, generation and purification of the GST and GST-E fusion proteins. The E subunit of V-ATPase was fused in frame with the GST gene. The ligated plasmid DNA was transformed and amplified in bacteria. Bacteria containing the recombinant plasmids were treated with isopropyl thiogalactoside for induction of protein expression, lysed by sonication, and purified with glutathione beads. The purified GST native protein and two independent samples of the GST-E fusion protein were shown along with their corresponding bacterial lysates. B, physical association between aldolase and the E subunit of V-ATPase. The GST-E fusion protein (lanes 1 and 3) and the GST native protein (lanes 2 and 4) were bound to glutathione beads and incubated with 35S-labeled aldolase. F-actin was also added (lanes 3 and4) and shown to have no effect on the interaction between the two proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It was reported previously that aldolase exists both in fluid and immobile states in the cytoplasm (34Pagliaro L. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Wang J. Tolan D.R. Pagliaro L. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The immobile fraction, attributed to cross-linking of aldolase by F-actin, was reduced markedly by injection of the aldolase substrate fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Subsequent studies showed that aldolase substrates and products inhibit the binding of actin to aldolase, consistent with at least partial overlap of catalytic and actin-binding sites on aldolase (36Wang J. Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. Pagliaro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6861-6865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that the E subunit binds to the same site on aldolase as F-actin (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4). Binding of aldolase to the GST-E subunit fusion protein was not affected by the addition of F-actin (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4). This suggests that the binding site for E subunit on aldolase does not overlap with the binding site for actin filaments.Substrates and products of aldolase disrupt its binding to F-actin (36Wang J. Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. Pagliaro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6861-6865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether fructose-1,6-diphosphate or fructose-1-phosphate, substrates for aldolase, or dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a product of aldolase, inhibited the binding of the enzyme to the V-ATPase E subunit. As shown in Fig.3, the aldolase substrates and products had no effect on the binding of E subunit by aldolase. These findings provide additional evidence to that in Fig. 2 that the binding site for the V-ATPase E subunit is not in the catalytic domain of aldolase.Figure 3Distinct binding sites on aldolase for V-ATPase and for substrates and products of aldolase. Cell extracts from RAW 264 osteoclast-like cells were incubated with the aldolase product dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) at a concentration of 100 µm, the substrate fructose 1-phosphate (F1P) at a concentration of 100 µm, and the substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) at a concentration of 10 µm. Following immunoprecipitation with E11 and protein A-agarose beads, the samples were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-aldolase antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There are three known isoforms of aldolase, A, B, and C, that are derived from distinct genes (37Salvatore F. Izzo P. Paolella G. Horiz. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 8: 611-665PubMed Google Scholar) and whose deduced amino acid sequences share 85% homology. A preliminary analysis of kidney mRNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR showed that all three genes were expressed in the kidney (data not shown). We cloned the genes for the A and B isoforms of human aldolase and tested their ability to bind to the V-ATPase E subunit in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Co-transformation of the E subunit “bait” construct with each of the three aldolase isoforms cloned into the library vector resulted in growth of yeast colonies on triple drop-out plates (Fig.4). These data indicate that the E subunit interacts with each of the A, B, and C isoforms of aldolase.Figure 4The E subunit of V-ATPase interacts with all three isoforms of aldolase. cDNAs for the three isoforms of aldolase were cloned in frame into the yeast expression vector that harbors the GAL4 activation domain. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into PJ69 DB-E cells expressing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain-E subunit fusion protein. The transformed cells were selected on Ade−/Leu−/Trp− dropout plates, followed by streaking on His−/Leu−/Trp− dropout plates to monitor for growth. The positive control represents co-transformation of p53 and T-antigen in two-hybrid expression vectors, pVA3 and pTD1 (CLONTECH), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine if aldolase and the E subunit interact in vivo, we examined whether aldolase co-immunoprecipitated with V-ATPase isolated from intact tissue and cells. V-ATPase was isolated from bovine kidney microsomes by immunoaffinity purification as described previously (26Gluck S. Caldwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the anti-E subunit monoclonal antibody, H6 (38Yurko M.A. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15770-15779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified V-ATPase was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed for the presence of aldolase by immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti-aldolase antibody (27Lenk S.E. Susan P.P. Hickson I. Jasionowski T. Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Aldolase was detected in V-ATPase isolated from kidney microsomes (Fig.5 A, lane 1), whereas in protein samples without the addition of the H6 antibody, aldolase was not detectable (Fig. 5 A,lane 2). These results indicate that aldolase is associated with the V-ATPase in kidney tissue.Figure 5In vivo interaction between V-ATPase and aldolase. A, V-ATPase was purified from bovine kidney microsomes by using the monoclonal antibody H6, denatured, applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-aldolase antibodies.B, osteoclast-enriched mouse marrow cultures were harvested, lysed, and immunoprecipitated using the anti-E subunit monoclonal antibody, E11. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting analysis using anti-aldolase antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether aldolase was also associated with the V-ATPase in osteoclasts, we carried out co-immunoprecipitations, using the monoclonal anti-E subunit antibody E11, from osteoclast-containing mouse marrow cultures (14Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Aldolase was demonstrable in immunoprecipitates with the E11 antibody but was not detected in samples in which E11 was replaced with an irrelevant antibody (Fig.5 B). These findings show that aldolase is associated with V-ATPase in the intact osteoclast.We compared the subcellular distribution of aldolase with that of the V-ATPase, by double label immunocytochemistry using antibodies to aldolase and V-ATPase E subunit. In sections of mouse kidney, aldolase showed abundant staining in the proximal tubule in both the cytoplasm and the submicrovillar zone of endocytic vesicles. Merged confocal optical sections suggested extensive colocalization of V-ATPase and aldolase in the endocytic zone (Fig. 6,A–C). Aldolase staining was also observed in the cytoplasm of the thick ascending limb and in the Bowman's capsule.Figure 6Co-localization of V-ATPase with aldolase in kidney tissue sections and in osteoclasts. Kidney tissue sections were cut, dewaxed, and rehydrated (A–C). RAW 264 cells were treated with osteoprotegerin ligand, induced to differentiate into osteoclasts, and plated on dentine slices (D–F). Murine bone marrow-derived osteoclast cultures were scraped and plated on glass coverslips (G–I) or on dentine slices (J–L). Following fixation, the cells were stained with the anti-V-ATPase antibody E11 (A, D, G, and J) and anti-aldolase antibodies (C,F, I, and L). Texas Red-conjugated and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were added for V-ATPase and aldolase staining, respectively. Coverslips and dentine slices were viewed by scanning laser confocal microscopy.B, E, H, and K are merged images, with yellow representing precise colocalization. In kidney tissue sections (A–C), colocalization of aldolase and V-ATPase was observed in proximal tubules (arrows) but not in intercalated cells (arrows). G–I, a portion of a giant unactivated osteoclast surrounded by a number of mononuclear cells. In activated osteoclasts (J–L), aldolase and V-ATPase colocalize in the ruffled membranes (arrows). The scale bar for A–C (seeL) is equivalent to 50 µm; for D–F, it is equivalent 15 µm; and for G–L, it is equivalent to 25 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The distribution of aldolase and V-ATPase was also examined in osteoprotegerin ligand-stimulated RAW 264 cells and in mouse marrow osteoclasts. Osteoprotegerin ligand-stimulated RAW 264 cells are osteoclast-like cells that express high levels of V-ATPase. V-ATPase and aldolase were distributed in perinuclear compartments of these cells (Fig. 6, D–F). Merged confocal images of these cells double-labeled with anti-V-ATPase and anti-aldolase antibodies indicated extensive colocalization of aldolase and V-ATPase (Fig.6 E). Extensive colocalization of aldolase and V-ATPase was also observed in perinuclear compartments of inactive osteoclasts (Fig.6 H). In actively resorbing osteoclasts on bone slices, V-ATPase is concentrated in the ruffled membrane (Fig. 6 J). In these cells, aldolase was also concentrated in the ruffled membranes (Fig. 6 L). Fig. 6 K shows that in these cells, V-ATPase and aldolase are concentrated and co-localize in the ruffled membranes. These findings indicate that aldolase undergoes a subcellular redistribution in the osteoclasts following activation of resorption and that the enzyme remains associated with the V-ATPase.Extracellular glucose concentrations regulate V-ATPase activityin vivo by regulating the extent of association between the V1 and V0 (20Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether glycolysis is directly coupled to the V-ATPase proton pump, we examined the assembly and disassembly of the V-ATPase for a yeast mutant strain deficient in aldolase and compared with its isogenic wild-type strain. As shown in Fig. 7 A, antibody 13D11, which recognizes the 60-kDa peripheral subunit of the V-ATPase, brightly stained the vacuolar membrane of the wild-type strain, indicating the presence of fully assembled V1V0complexes. When the same antibody was used to stain the mutant yeast cells, the vacuolar staining was significantly reduced, and only diffuse cytoplasmic staining was visible in some cells (Fig.7 B). Antibody 10D7, which recognizes its epitope on the 100-kDa V0 subunit only when V1 is dissociated from V0, showed no staining of yeast vacuoles of the wild-type cells (Fig. 7 C), whereas vacuolar staining was easily visualized in the mutant cells deficient in aldolase. Our data indicate that the V1 and V0 domains of the V-ATPase remain dissociated from each other in yeast cells deficient in aldolase.Figure 7Disassembly of the V-ATPase in yeast cells deficient in aldolase. Wild-type (A and D) and mutant cells deficient in aldolase (B and E) and in glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (C and F) were grown to midlog phase, fixed, and stained with monoclonal antibodies 13D11 to detect both intact and disassembled V-ATPase (A–C) and 10D7 to detect disassembled V-ATPase (D–F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The dissociation of V1 from V0 in the yeast mutant deficient in aldolase was also examined by immunoprecipitation analysis. In addition to a 3-fold decrease in the levels of V-ATPase compared with wild-type cells (Fig.8 A), V1 was found to remain dissociated from V0 in the aldolase mutant cells in the presence of glucose (Fig. 8 A). In contrast, assembled V1V0 complexes were detected in a yeast mutant strain deficient in the glycolytic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Fig. 8 A). Disruption of the gene for glucose-6-phosphate isomerase was previously reported to render the activity of the glycolytic enzyme in the yeast mutant undetectable (39Maitra P.K. Lobo Z. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 156: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), whereas the levels of other glycolytic enzymes remained largely unchanged in the yeast mutant (39Maitra P.K. Lobo Z. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 156: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Figure 8Disassembly of the yeast V-ATPase in cells deficient in aldolase but not in cells deficient in glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. A, immunoprecipitation analysis of the yeast V-ATPase in the wild-type (wt) and mutant cells. Yeast cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, lysed, incubated with the anti-B subunit monoclonal antibody 13D11, and immunoprecipitated by protein A-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The total amount of radioactivity in the V-ATPase subunits was quantitated by a densitometer. In the aldolase mutant (ald) cells, the 69-, 60-, 32-, and 27-kDa V1 peripheral subunits were reduced by 75, 64, 70, and 74%, respectively, indicating a 3-fold decrease in the V1 domain of the V-ATPase. The 100-, 36-, and 17-kDa V0 subunits remained undetectable (<1%) in the aldolase mutant, demonstrating disassembly of V1 from V0. Comparable levels in the V1 subunits were found in the mutant cells deficient in glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (pgi) as in the wild-type cells, whereas the 100-, 36- and 17-kDa V0 subunits were reduced by 48, 47, and 50%, respectively. B, quantitation of the 100-, 36-, and 17-kDa V0 subunits in the wild-type and mutant yeast cells. An autoradiogram was obtained in which the V1 subunits in the aldolase mutant are at comparable levels with that detected in the wild-type and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase mutant cells. V0 subunits were quantitated and adjusted against the level of the 60-kDa V1 subunit within each strain as percentage of assembled V-ATPase. Hatched,filled, and open bars designate wild type, aldolase, and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, respectively.C, measurement of aldolase activity in the V-ATPase immunoprecipitates.

https://openalex.org/W2079676761,"Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 (PfAMA-1) is a malaria merozoite integral membrane protein that plays an essential but poorly understood role in invasion of host erythrocytes. The PfAMA-1 ectodomain comprises three disulfide-constrained domains, the first of which (domain I) is preceded by an N-terminal prosequence. PfAMA-1 is initially routed to secretory organelles at the apical end of the merozoite, where the 83-kDa precursor (PfAMA-183) is converted to a 66-kDa form (PfAMA-166). At about the time of erythrocyte invasion, PfAMA-166 selectively translocates onto the merozoite surface. Here we use direct microsequencing and mass spectrometric peptide mass fingerprinting to characterize in detail the primary structure and proteolytic processing of PfAMA-1. We have determined the site at which processing takes place to convert PfAMA-183to PfAMA-166 and have shown that both species possess a completely intact and unmodified transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain. Following relocation to the merozoite surface, PfAMA-166 is further proteolytically cleaved at one of two alternative sites, either between domains II and III, or at a membrane-proximal site following domain III. As a result, the bulk of the ectodomain is shed from the parasite surface in the form of two soluble fragments of 44 and 48 kDa. PfAMA-1 is not detectably modified by the addition ofN-linked oligosaccharides.

Despite this, many aspects of invasion remain obscure. In particular, the molecular interactions that mediate and control the sequential processes of host cell binding, merozoite reorientation and junction formation, parasitophorous vacuole formation, and host cell entry are only just beginning to be dissected (1Chitnis C.E.

A number of merozoite proteins known to play a critical role in invasion are initially sequestered in a complex of secretory organelles located within or adjacent to the apical prominence of the parasite. One of these proteins is apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1),1a low abundance type I integral membrane protein that is synthesized during the last few hours of intracellular maturation of the parasite and accumulates within the necks of the paired rhoptries (3Deans J.A.

Examination of multiple sequence alignments and mass spectrometric studies of correctly folded recombinantPlasmodium chabaudi AMA-1 have indicated that the ectodomain of the molecule has a conserved overall structure; most of the sequence can be divided into three distinct domains (domains I–III), the integrity of which are maintained by three, two, and three intradomain disulfide bonds, respectively, between 16 conserved cysteine residues (18Hodder A.N.

Preceding domain I is an amino-terminal prosequence, which varies substantially in sequence and length but exhibits a high degree of conservation between phylogenetically close Plasmodiumspecies; e.g. AMA-1 of Plasmodium falciparum(PfAMA-1) and of the chimpanzee malaria parasite Plasmodium reichenowi (PrAMA-1) share a similar large insertion within the prosequence (16Kocken C.H.

PfAMA-1 is synthesized as an 83-kDa precursor. Soon after transport to the rhoptries, the 83-kDa form is subjected to a proteolytic processing event that involves the loss of an N-terminal fragment and conversion to a 66-kDa form. Both remain membrane-bound, but remarkably, the 66-kDa form is able to redistribute onto the surface of the merozoite, while the unprocessed 83-kDa form remains apically restricted (4Narum D.L.

Parasitol. 2000; 111: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The significance of the proteolytic processing of PfAMA-1 is unknown, but its conserved nature and its apparent association with redistribution of the protein suggest that it may be required for PfAMA-1 to move onto the parasite surface or to mediate its role in invasion or both. To begin to elucidate the functional significance of the processing, we have performed a detailed structural study of affinity-purified, parasite-derived PfAMA-1. We have first defined precisely the site at which the protein is processed to produce its 66-kDa form. From this information, it is now possible to accurately define the boundary between the prosequence and the start of domain I. We have also identified two fragments of the protein that are specifically shed following merozoite release and show that this results from further processing events that release most of the PfAMA-1 ectodomain from the merozoite surface. The remainder of the protein is probably carried into the invaded host cell. These observations allow us to localize the epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody, which prevents erythrocyte invasion to domain I to II. Finally, we have shown that PfAMA-1 is not detectably post-translationally modified by oligosaccharide addition. Trypsin (modified sequencing grade) and Glu-C was from Promega (Madison, WI). Sequencing grade chymotrypsin, recombinant N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), and peptide-N-glycosidase A (PNGase A; from sweet almond) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [35S]Methionine/cysteine (Pro-mixTM) was fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech, as were all chromatography media and low molecular weight marker proteins for SDS-PAGE. 18O water was obtained from Isotec (CK Gas Products Ltd., UK). Prestained high molecular weight marker proteins were from Life Technologies, Inc. Protease inhibitors p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, bestatin, pepstatin A, leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain were all obtained from Sigma. Colloidal Blue protein stain was from NOVEX (Carlsbad, CA). Protein sequence alignments and pI and molecular mass predictions were performed using Lasergene DNAStar, version 4.05. Homology searches of the incomplete P. falciparum and other Plasmodium genome data bases were performed with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), National Institutes of Health, using the CustomBLAST server at the NCBI Web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Malaria/plasmodiumblcus.html). In vitro culture and synchronization of erythrocytic forms of P. falciparum(clone 3D7) was as previously described (20Blackman M.J. Heidrich H.-G. Donachie S. McBride J.S. Holder A.A. J. Exp.

Schizonts were either stored at −70 °C until required or used for invasion experiments. Some were first biosynthetically pulse-radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (22Blackman M.J. Fujioka H.

Isolation of young ring stage parasites resulting from the radiolabeled schizonts and analysis by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE were performed as described previously (20Blackman M.J.

Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit antiserum against PfAMA-1 was produced by immunization with baculovirus-derived recombinant PfAMA-1 (24Narum D.L. Welling G.W. Thomas A.W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1993; 657: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 4G2dc1 and 28G2dc1 were purified from hybridoma culture medium by Protein G-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Purified mAb 4G2dc1 was coupled to a 1-ml column of N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose High Performance (HiTrapN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated) as recommended by the manufacturers. Briefly, purified antibody was transferred to coupling buffer (0.2 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3) by desalting on a PD-10 column equilibrated in coupling buffer. A total of 2 ml of purified mAb 4G2dc1 at a concentration of 6.1 mg ml−1 was then applied to the HiTrapN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column and recirculated for 30 min at room temperature. Coupling yield under these conditions was ∼70%. Excess antibody was washed away, and the column was blocked with 0.5 m ethanolamine in 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3, and then washed as recommended by the manufacturer. For use in immunoprecipitations, purified mAb was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B Fast Flow, as recommended by the manufacturers. An accumulated total of ∼15 ml of packed frozen schizonts was thawed directly into 80 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, pH 8.0) containing the following protease inhibitors: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm);p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (0.5 mm);N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (0.2 mm); bestatin (2 mg ml−1); pepstatin A (2 mg ml−1); and leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain (all at 10 mg ml−1). The lysate was stirred at 0 °C for 1 h, clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and finally passed through a 0.45-µm filter before being applied at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 to the 4G2dc1 affinity column, via a 2-ml precolumn of Sepharose 4B. All chromatography was performed at 4 °C. The affinity column was washed with 100 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. Detergent exchange on the column was then performed by washing with 20 ml of 5 mmCHAPS in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.6, before eluting bound proteins with 0.2 m glycine-HCl, 5 mm CHAPS, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.7, at a flow rate of 0.25 ml min−1. Preliminary experiments showed that elution at low pH was more efficient than at high pH (50 mmdiethylamine, pH 11.0). Eluate fractions (1 ml) were immediately neutralized by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and stored at −70 °C. Shed, soluble forms of PfAMA-1 were affinity-purified from parasite culture supernatants. Percoll-enriched mature schizonts (unlabeled or biosynthetically radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine) were washed and recultured for 7–11 h in the presence of a 10-fold excess of fresh erythrocytes to allow merozoite release and reinvasion (final hematocrit ∼2%). Culture supernatants were then harvested, clarified by centrifugation, passed through a 0.22-µm filter, and either analyzed by immunoprecipitation (if radiolabeled) or applied to a mAb 4G2dc1 affinity column. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 400 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, and then bound proteins were eluted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.7. No detergent was used during the column purification procedure. Eluate fractions (1 ml) were immediately neutralized by the addition of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and stored at −70 °C. Affinity-purified proteins were concentrated by centrifugation in 12-kDa molecular mass cut-off Vectaspin Micro ultrafiltration units (Whatman) and then solubilized in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and alkylated with iodoacetamide as previously described (25Sajid M. Withers-Martinez C. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 631-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then either transferred directly to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for N-terminal amino acid sequencing or stained with Colloidal Blue stain and processed by in-gel proteolytic digestion using a modification of the method described previously (22Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H.L. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Grainger M. Hackett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, excised SDS-PAGE protein bands were washed with 60% acetonitrile, 200 mmammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile, and then dried and reswollen in a minimal volume of trypsin or chymotrypsin at 2 ng µl−1 in 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate or at 4 ng µl−1 Glu-C in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8. In some cases, digestion buffers were prepared using 50% (v/v)18O water. After overnight digestion at 32 °C, the supernatant was acidified by the addition of a one-tenth volume of 4% trifluoroacetic acid before analysis by mass spectrometry. Proteins to be treated with PNGase F were first denatured by heating at 95 °C for 6 min in 50 µl of 0.4% (w/v) SDS in 16 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. The sample was diluted with 50 µl of distilled water and then further supplemented with 100 µl of 2× PNGase F digestion buffer (2% (w/v) CHAPS in 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 20 mm EDTA, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) and divided into two aliquots. To one of these was added 2 units (2 µl) of PNGase F, and then both were incubated overnight at 37 °C prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. For treatment of peptides with PNGase A, in-gel protease digests were lyophilized and taken up in 40 µl of 5 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The sample was heated at 95 °C for 6 min to inactivate residual protease activity and then divided into two. One aliquot was supplemented with 30 microunits (0.6 µl) of PNGase A, and then both samples were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C before acidification and analysis by mass spectrometry. N-terminal sequence analysis of polyvinylidene difluoride-immobilized proteins was carried out at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility (Cambridge University) by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Procise protein sequencer. Peptide mass fingerprinting (26Pappin D.J.C. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar) was performed using a Reflex-III matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser and a Scout-384 probe, to obtain positive ion mass spectra of digested protein with pulsed ion extraction in reflectron mode. An accelerating voltage of 26 kV was used with detector bias gating set to 2 kV and a mass cut-off of m/z 650. Matrix surfaces were prepared using recrystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and nitrocellulose using the fast evaporation method (27Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Acidified digestion supernatant (0.4 µl) was deposited on the matrix surface and allowed to dry prior to desalting with water. Trypsin autolysis products were used for internal calibration. Peptide mass fingerprints obtained were searched against the nonredundant protein data base placed in the public domain by NCBI, using the program MASCOT (28Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J.C. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6813) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the internal calibration was refined using selected intense PfAMA-1 ions. Matched peptide masses were thus finally obtained with a mean mass accuracy of 7 ppm. In estimation of sequence coverage, any observed masses that matched more than one possible peptide sequence were completely excluded from the analysis. SDS-PAGE fractionation of proteins eluted from the mAb 4G2dc1 affinity column revealed the presence of just two major components of apparent mass of 83 and 66 kDa, as well as a less abundant doublet of 46 kDa and minor bands of 55 and 28 kDa (Fig. 1 A). On analysis by Western blot, all but the last two species were recognized by a polyclonal anti-PfAMA-1 antiserum (not shown); the 55- and 28-kDa bands were reactive with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody alone, suggesting that they represent IgG heavy and light chain probably derived from slight leaching of the affinity column (not shown). They were not examined further. To identify the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 83-, 66-, and 46-kDa PfAMA-1-derived proteins (referred to hereafter as PfAMA-183, PfAMA-166, and PfAMA-146, respectively), each was subjected to five cycles of Edman degradation. Sequencing of PfAMA-183 provided ambiguous data, yielding the sequence Gln/Ser-Asn/Tyr-Tyr/Pro in the first three cycles. Phenylhydantoin yields were significant but very low (∼1 pmol), indicating that the protein was substantially blocked. Application of Heijne's (−3,−1) rule (SignalP program; genome.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) (29Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. Heijne G. Prot. Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar) to the deduced 3D7 PfAMA-1 sequence predicts that signal peptide cleavage most likely takes place between Gly24 and Gln25, which would produce a protein with the N-terminal sequence Gln-Asn-Tyr (Fig. 1 B). Our results are therefore consistent with the PfAMA-183 species representing the full-length PfAMA-1 product derived by removal of the secretory signal peptide from the primary translation product. Edman degradation of PfAMA-166 and PfAMA-146provided much more definitive data (phenylhydantoin yields were ∼10 and 1.25 pmol, respectively). For both proteins, the N-terminal sequence obtained was Ile-Glu-Ile-Val-Glu (Fig. 1 A), which corresponds to Ile97-Glu101 of the PfAMA-1 sequence (Fig. 1 B). Conversion of the 83-kDa PfAMA-1 precursor to the 66-kDa form therefore involves proteolytic cleavage between Ser96 and Ile97 within the motif92NLFSS↓IEIVE101. It may be significant that this processing site is not closely flanked by any polymorphic residues in known PfAMA-1 sequences (15Marshall V.M. Zhang L. Anders R.F. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 2000; 109: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is also very similar to the corresponding flanking sequence in PrAMA-1 (16Kocken C.H. Narum D.L. Massougbodji A. Ayivi B. Bubbeld M.A. van der Wel A. Conway D.J. Sanni A. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the only difference here being an Ile → Asn substitution at the P1′ position relative to the cleavage site (Fig. 1 B). Since cleavage site recognition by proteases is usually determined primarily by residues N-terminal to the scissile bond (i.e. the P4–P1 positions), the absolute conservation of these residues between the two species suggests that processing of both PfAMA-1 and PrAMA-1 probably occurs at the analogous position. Intriguingly, however, there is no obvious homology between this region of PfAMA-1 or PrAMA-1 and AMA-1 sequences from any otherPlasmodium species or T. gondii (Fig.1 B). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic, chymotryptic, or Glu-C proteolytic digests of all three proteins following reduction and alkylation provided data that supported the above sequencing results as well as additional information on the primary structure of the proteins. In all cases, searching of the obtained peptide masses against the nonredundant NCBI protein data base using MASCOT identified the P. falciparum3D7 AMA-1 sequence (GenBankTM accession number U65407) as the most significant hit (typical MASCOT probability score >300). The MALDI-TOF spectra also reproducibly exhibited a complete absence of any major unidentifiable peaks, confirming the absence of any other protein contaminants (Fig. 2). Examination of tryptic digests of PfAMA-183 and comparison with the expected masses of tryptic peptides of the 3D7 PfAMA-1 sequence identified peptides that covered most of the entire deduced sequence (Figs. 2 and 3 A). Notably absent from the coverage was any sequence derived from the predicted secretory signal peptide, consistent with the proposal (tentatively made above on the basis of the limited N-terminal sequencing data) that PfAMA-183 represents the PfAMA-1 primary translation product minus the secretory signal peptide. This suspicion was finally confirmed by the presence of an ion atm/z 2728.229, which corresponds to the predicted N-terminal tryptic peptide 25QNYWEHPYQNSDVYRPINEHR45 with a pyroglutamate modification of the N-terminal glutamine residue (expected m/z 2728.245). This ion was conspicuously absent from tryptic digests of any of the other PfAMA-1-derived fragments (Fig. 2, and see below). The presence of an N-terminal pyroglutamate modification of the affinity-purified PfAMA-183 explains the poor yields obtained during Edman degradation of the protein. The sequence covered by the MALDI-TOF analysis also included an ion at m/z 1636.805, corresponding to the peptide609ASHTTPVLMEKPYY622 (predicted m/z1636.805), the expected tryptic fragment derived from the extreme C terminus of PfAMA-1. No signal corresponding to a mono- or diphosphoryated derivative of this or any other peptide was detected. Between these two regions, the coverage also included three tryptic peptides (Gly155–Lys177, Asp281–Lys292, and Cys490–Arg503) containing three of the six potential N-glycosylation motifs (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) within the 3D7 PfAMA-1 sequence (Fig. 3 A). The three remaining potential N-glycosylation sites reside within two predicted tryptic fragments, Asn371–Lys376 and Cys409–Lys447 (Fig. 3). However, further examination of chymotryptic and Glu-C digests of PfAMA-183identified the chymotryptic peptide413NVKPTCLINNSSY425 as well as increasing overall coverage of the mature sequence (Gln25–Tyr622) to 91%. No peptide encompassing the sixth potential N-glycosylation site at Asn371 was identified in any of the proteolytic digests. Analysis by MALDI-TOF of proteolytic digests of PfAMA-166was similarly informative (Figs. 2 and 3 B). Prominent in the spectrum of tryptic digests was an ion at m/z 758.450, corresponding to the peptide 97IEIVER102(predicted m/z 758.441). The corresponding chymotryptic peptide 97IEIVERSNY105 was also detected as the most intense ion in chymotryptic digests of PfAMA-166. These peptides were not present in digests of PfAMA-183(Fig. 2). Since neither peptide could result from internal proteolysis (Ile97 is not preceded by a tryptic or chymotryptic cleavage site), these results are fully consistent with the Edman degradation data in confirming Ile97 as the N-terminal residue of PfAMA-166. As in the case of PfAMA-183, coverage of the PfAMA-166 sequence extended right through the putative transmembrane sequence to the extreme C-terminal tryptic peptide of the protein,609ASHTTPVLMEKPYY622, demonstrating unambiguously that both species possess a completely intact cytoplasmic domain. PfAMA-166 presumably translocates to the merozoite surface in this form. N-terminal sequencing of PfAMA-146 had shown that it possesses an N-t"

https://openalex.org/W2021067833,"Thioredoxins (Trx) are small ubiquitous proteins that participate in different cellular processes via redox-mediated reactions. We report here the identification and characterization of a novel member of the thioredoxin family in humans, named Sptrx (sperm-specific trx), the first with a tissue-specific distribution, located exclusively in spermatozoa. Sptrx open reading frame encodes for a protein of 486 amino acids composed of two clear domains: an N-terminal domain consisting of 23 highly conserved repetitions of a 15-residue motif and a C-terminal domain typical of thioredoxins. Northern analysis and in situ hybridization shows that Sptrx mRNA is only expressed in human testis, specifically in round and elongating spermatids. Immunostaining of human testis sections identified Sptrx protein in spermatids, while immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy analysis demonstrated Sptrx localization in the cytoplasmic droplet of ejaculated sperm. Sptrx appears to have a multimeric structure in native conditions and is able to reduce insulin disulfide bonds in the presence of NADPH and thioredoxin reductase. During mammalian spermiogenesis in testis seminiferous tubules and later maturation in epididymis, extensive reorganization of disulfide bonds is required to stabilize cytoskeletal sperm structures. However, the molecular mechanisms that control these processes are not known. The identification of Sptrx with an expression pattern restricted to the postmeiotic phase of spermatogenesis, when the sperm tail is organized, suggests that Sptrx might be an important factor in regulating critical steps of human spermiogenesis."

We recently discovered that cells from Werner syndrome patients displayed a deficiency in p53-mediated apoptosis and WRN binds to p53. Here, we report that analogous to WRN, BLM also binds to p53 in vivo andin vitro, and the C-terminal domain of p53 is responsible for the interaction. p53-mediated apoptosis is defective in BS fibroblasts and can be rescued by expression of the normalBLM gene. Moreover, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from BS donors are resistant to both γ-radiation and doxorubicin-induced cell killing, and sensitivity can be restored by the stable expression of normal BLM. In contrast, BS cells have a normal Fas-mediated apoptosis, and in response to DNA damage normal accumulation of p53, normal induction of p53 responsive genes, and normal G1-S and G2-M cell cycle arrest. BLM localizes to nuclear foci referred to as PML nuclear bodies (NBs). Cells from Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients carrying p53 germline mutations and LCLs lacking a functional p53 have a decreased accumulation of BLM in NBs, whereas isogenic lines with functional p53 exhibit normal accumulation. Certain BLM mutants (C1055S or Δ133–237) that have a reduced ability to localize to the NBs when expressed in normal cells can impair the localization of wild type BLM to NBs and block p53-mediated apoptosis, suggesting a dominant-negative effect.

The gene responsible for the BS has been identified asBLM, which encodes a 1417-residue protein with ATP-dependent 3′-5′ DNA helicase activity, and it belongs to the RecQ DNA helicase family (3Ellis N.A.

In addition to BLM, the RecQ family in mammalian cells contains at least four more proteins,i.e. RecQL, WRN, RTS, and RecQL5 (4Karow J.K. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Furthermore, both BLM and WRN also contain signature motifs that belong to the DExH-containing DNA helicase superfamily, which includes XPB and XPD. Germline mutations in these genes have been linked to cancer predisposition syndromes, WS, xeroderma pigmentosum syndrome B (XP-B), and D (XP-D), respectively (5Ellis N.A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Therefore, both p53 and members of the RecQ family play an essential role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing the risk of cancer. Apoptosis is an important process in normal development and in stress-mediated signaling pathways. Defective regulation of apoptosis often contributes to the etiology of cancer.

We recently reported that cells from XP-B, XP-D, or WS individuals have an attenuated p53-dependent apoptotic pathway and p53 binds to XPB, XPD, and WRN (23Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D.

In addition, similar to p53-deficient cells, the XP-D LCLs have a deficiency in DNA damage agent-induced apoptosis (23Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G.

We hypothesized that similar to WRN, BLM is also a target for p53 binding and p53-mediated apoptosis. We found that BLM-deficient cells have an attenuated DNA damage-activated and p53-mediated apoptosis. However, induction of p53 and p53-mediated transcriptional activation of downstream targets including Gadd45, Bax, and p21waf1 was normal. p53 bound to BLM both in vivo and in vitro. Cells that lack p53 had normal numbers of NBs and normal levels of BLM, however, BLM transit to the NBs was reduced and ectopic expression of p53 in these cells restored BLM transit to the NBs to normal. Moreover, overexpression of BLM mutants that have a deficiency in localization to NBs in normal cells can block wild type BLM localization to NBs and inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis. Our results indicate a novel mechanism of p53-mediated apoptosis involving a p53-BLM-PML signaling pathway.

Cells were seeded onto coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, permeabilized with methanol for 20 min, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline-plus solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.15% glycine, 0.5% bovine serum albumin), and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. The slides were then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with either Texas red or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector Laboratories) at a 1:300 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were mounted in VectaShield solution containing 0.5 µg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Cells were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope equipped with a high-performance CCD imaging system (IP Lab Spectrum). Alternatively, confocal fluorescent images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal scan head mounted on a Nikon Optiphot microscope with a ×60 planapochromat lens. Sequential excitation at 488 and 568 nm was provided by a krypton-argon gas laser. Emission filters of 598/40 and 522/32 were used for sequentially collecting red and green fluorescence, respectively, in channels 1 and 2. Z-sections were collected at 0.5-µm intervals for each cell using LaserSharp software. Images were analyzed by Confocal Assistant software. To quantify nuclear BLM foci between NHF and LFS fibroblasts, images that only showed cells with BLM foci were randomly collected. Western blot analysis was performed similarly as described previously (23Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Harris C.C.

For analyzing the viability of LCLs, exponentially growing cells were plated at a density of 6.25 × 105 cells/ml, treated with various doses of either doxorubicin (Sigma) or γ-radiation, and incubated for a designated time. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion as described previously (23Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

In the experiments with Fas-mediated apoptosis, a Fas-specific antibody (C3H) at a concentration of 1.4 µg/ml was added to the culture media that contain LCLs. Cell viability was monitored at 4, 8, and 24 h. RNase protection assay was done essentially as described (25Robles A.I. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4681-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Expression of p53-responsive genes was determined using the hStress-1 multiprobe template set includingbcl-X, p53, Gadd45, p21, Bax, mc11, c-fos, bcl-2, as well as the housekeeping genes, L32, andglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Quantification of mRNA species was performed by densitometric analysis with MacBas software (FUJIFILM). Immunoprecipitation and recombinant protein binding assays were essentially as described (24Spillare E.A. Robles A.I. Wang X.W. Shen J.C. Schellenberg G.D. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For flow cytometric analysis, cells were exposed to 5 Gy of γ-radiation and incubated for 4, 8, or 24 h. Prior to harvest, cells were incubated in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine at a final concentration of 10 µm for 30 min. After harvest by trypsinization, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol until the day of analysis. Cells were treated with 0.1 m HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100 to extract histones, followed by boiling and rapid cooling to denature the DNA. Cells were then incubated with anti-bromodeoxyuridine-fluorescein isothiocyanate (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and counterstained with propidium iodide containing RNase. Samples were run on a Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur. Data analysis was performed with CellQuest software for the Macintosh (Becton-Dickinson). Cellular debris and fixation artifacts were gated out, and the G0/G1, S, and G2/M fractions were quantified. To investigate the response of BS fibroblasts to p53-dependent apoptosis, we microinjected p53 and BLM cDNA expression constructs separately or together into normal human fibroblasts (NHF) and BS fibroblasts, and then monitored their ability to undergo apoptosis. The BS fibroblasts that were used in these experiments, GM03498 and GM01492, are null for BLM (see “Experimental Procedures”) and exhibit a high SCE phenotype characteristic of BS cells. GM01492 fortuitously is negative for p53 expression (27van Laar T. Steegenga W.T. Jochemsen A.G. Terleth C. van der Eb A.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 981-983PubMed Google Scholar). p53-mediated apoptosis was attenuated in two BS fibroblasts (GM03498 and GM01492) when compared with three normal NHF examined (GM07532, GM00038, and GM08402) (Table I). Coexpression by microinjection of a normal BLM expression vector caused a significant increase in p53-mediated apoptosis of GM01492 cells (Fig.1A), which is evidence of complementation of the attenuated apoptotic phenotype. Expression of a mutant BLM protein that contains a cysteine to serine amino acid substitution at residue 1055 (C1055S) and has no detectable helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities (28Neff N.F. Ellis N.A. Ye T.Z. Noonan J. Huang K. Sanz M. Proytcheva M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), did not cause an increase in p53-mediated apoptosis. These data indicate that an enzymatically active BLM product is required for the p53-dependent apoptotic effect. In contrast, the mutant BLM (C1055S) acts as a dominant-negative mutant to block p53-mediated apoptosis in NHF (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, an N-terminal deletion mutant of BLM (Δ133–237) also blocks p53-mediated apoptosis in NHF (Fig. 1 A).Table IPrimary cultured fibroblasts derived from BS patients are insensitive to p53-induced apoptosisCell strainDiagnosisBLMPercent apoptotic cells1-aCells that stained positively for p53 and exhibited typical features of apoptosis, including cytoplasmic blebbing, chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation, were counted.

Open table in a new tab To determine the role of BLM in apoptosis at the physiological level, sensitivity to cell death induced by γ-irradiation or doxorubicin was investigated in four BS LCLs. Three BS LCLs (GM03403, GM09960, and HG1525) feature a high-SCE phenotype and are homozygous for null mutations in BLM. The fourth (GM04408) is a low-SCE cell line in which the BLM gene was spontaneously correctedin vivo by a somatic intragenic recombination event, thereby becoming heterozygous for one of its BLM mutations (3Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that cell viability, monitored by trypan blue exclusion, in LCLs treated with γ-irradiation or doxorubicin is tightly correlated with apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner, as evidenced by annexin V positivity, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation (23Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 25Robles A.I. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4681-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Using trypan blue exclusion assay, we found that the three high-SCE BS LCLs examined were less sensitive to both of the genotoxic agents when compared with normal human LCLs (Fig. 1,B and C, and data not shown). In contrast, the low-SCE BS LCL (GM04408) exhibited the same sensitivity to both agents as normal LCLs (Fig. 1, B and C). Expression of a normal BLM cDNA expression vector construct into the high-SCE BS LCL HG1525, which reduces the SCE rate toward normal (16Ellis N.A. Proytcheva M. Sanz M.M. Ye T.Z. German J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1368-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), sensitized the cells to γ-radiation-induced cell killing (Fig. 1 D). BS LCLs exhibit a normal sensitivity to Fas antibody-induced apoptosis (data not shown), indicating that the resistance obtained in BS cells to DNA damage-induced cell killing is not due to a general defect or inability to undergo apoptosis. Because DNA damage-induced cell killing of normal cells is predominantly dependent on the induction of p53 (10Lowe S.W. Lin A.W. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar, 11Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Schwartz D.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4681-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we compared p53 levels in normal and BS LCLs following treatment with 5 Gy γ-radiation or 1 µg/ml doxorubicin. Both normal and BS LCLs had similar expression profiles after the induction of p53 in response to DNA damage (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained with another BS LCL GM09960 (data not shown). To determine whether a defect in p53-mediated transcriptional transactivation of downstream genes associated with a loss of BLM, we examined the mRNA levels of p21, Gadd45, Bax, and p53 by RNase protection assay in BS LCLs following treatment with 5 Gy γ-radiation. Both normal and BS LCLs displayed a similar induction of p21, Gadd45, and Bax (Fig. 2 B), indicating that p53-dependent transcription is normal in BS cells. Consistent with this finding, BS LCLs underwent normal cell cycle arrest at G1 and G2 (Fig. 2, C andD, data not shown) and accumulation of cyclin B1 and hypophosphorylated Rb upon treatment with γ-radiation (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicated that p53-dependent transactivation in response to DNA-damaging agents is normal in BS cells. By indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, focal concentrations of BLM can be detected in the NBs in all cells in which BLM protein can be detected (the co-localization is >90%). Because the NBs are known to play an important role in apoptosis and p53-mediated apoptosis was defective in BS cells, we investigated whether BLM localization to the NBs could be modulated by p53 function. To test this possibility, we analyzed three LFS fibroblast cell strains, two heterozygous for missense mutations of p53 at codons 248 and 175, respectively, and one homozygous for a frameshift mutation in p53 that results in a p53-null phenotype (see “Experimental Procedures”). The average numbers of BLM foci per nucleus were significantly lower in the p53-deficient fibroblasts compared with the numbers in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 3), whereas the average numbers of NBs per nucleus as determined by staining with anti-PML was the same in all fibroblast cell lines examined (Fig. 3 F and data not shown). We also examined BLM localization in two LCLs (TK6 and WTK1) that differ in the status of p53. TK6 cells contain a normalp53 gene and are sensitive to radiation-induced cell killing, whereas its isogenic derivative (WTK1) contains a mutant p53 and is radiation-resistant (29Little J.B. Nagasawa H. Keng P.C., Yu, Y. Li C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11033-11036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results from fibroblasts with a mutant p53, the average numbers of BLM foci per nucleus in WTK1 cells was lower than in TK6 cells (Fig.3 D). The numbers of BLM foci per nucleus in normal fibroblasts was unchanged by γ-irradiation (Fig. 3, B andC), suggesting that post-translational modification or stabilization of a normal p53 does not affect BLM localization to the NBs. Similar results were obtained with γ-irradiated TK6 and WTK1 cells (Fig. 3 D). Because the steady-state levels of BLM were the same regardless of p53 status or radiation treatment (Fig.3 H), the reduction in BLM foci in the LFS fibroblasts was not explained by decreased BLM protein. To test whether expression of a normal p53 protein in the mutant fibroblasts could overcome the defect in BLM localization, we examined a 041-derived clone that contains a tetracycline-induciblep53 expression construct (30Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Upon induction of p53, the average numbers of BLM foci per nucleus was increased to levels similar to those in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 3 E), whereas the number of NBs per nucleus remained the same (Fig. 3 F). BLM levels were not changed by induction of p53 (Fig. 3 G). Because the steady-state levels of BLM are the same under all conditions tested, the data indicate that a greater proportion of BLM in the LFS cells is in a diffuse rather than a focal distribution compared with normal cells. Taken together, our data show that p53 functions in the localization of BLM to the NBs. Expression of a normal GFP-BLM in normal fibroblasts resulted in efficient localization of the protein to the NBs (Fig.4) (31Hu P. Beresten S. van Brabant A. Ye T. Pandolfi P-P. Johnson F.B. Guarente L. Ellis N.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, expression of the GFP-BLM C1055S or Δ133–237 mutant resulted in either a lower efficiency of localization"

Nosocomial infections associated with indwelling medical devices or surgical wounds can lead to more serious invasive diseases such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and septicemia. Infection is dependent upon the ability of the bacteria to adhere to the host extracellular matrix or to the layer of proteins coating implanted biomaterial such as catheters and prostheses (3Höök M.

ClfA and ClfB have a domain organization characteristic of many surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria (15Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). At the N terminus a signal sequence directs the protein across the cytoplasmic membrane. Region A is the surface-exposed ligand-binding domain (10Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. François P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Region R is composed of serine-aspartate dipeptide repeats and functions as a stalk to display the ligand-binding A domain on the cell surface (16Hartford O. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol.

The C terminus has features common to many cell wall-anchored proteins of Gram-positive bacteria, including an LPXTG motif (LPETG) responsible for covalently linking the protein to peptidoglycan, a hydrophobic domain, and positively charged residues at the extreme C terminus.The A regions of ClfA and ClfB have only 26% residue identity and promote binding to different parts of fibrinogen. ClfA binds to the extreme C terminus of the γ-chain (17McDevitt D. Nanavaty T. House-Pompeo K. Bell E.C. Turner N. McIntire L. Foster T.J. Höök M. Eur. J.

Foster, and M. Höök, submitted for publication. Region A of ClfB contains a short motif SLAVA, a putative protease recognition sequence at which recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli is cleaved. A similar motif SLAAVA is present in ClfA (8McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar).In contrast to ClfA, which is present on cells at all stages of the growth cycle, ClfB is only present at a detectable and functional level on the surface of cells of strain Newman in the exponential phase of growth (10Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. François P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This suggests that transcription of the clfBgene ceases during exponential phase and that the surface protein may be degraded by proteases or be shed into the growth medium. Transcription of the spa, fnb, and cnagenes, encoding protein A, the fibronectin-binding proteins, and the collagen-binding adhesin, respectively, occurs only in exponential phase (19Gillaspy A.F. Leev C.Y. Sau S. Cheung A.L. Smeltzer M.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3170-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sarravia-Otten P. Muller H.P. Arvidson S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5259-5263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but in most cases sufficient protein remains on the surface of cells in the stationary phase to promote ligand binding.The genes encoding surface proteins and extracellular proteins are subjected to control at the transcriptional level by the Agr and Sar global regulators (21Novick R.P.

Gillaspy A.F. Rechtin T.M. Hurlburt B.K. Smeltzer M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas expression of fibronectin binding protein A gene is activated by Sar in exponential phase and is repressed by Agr in stationary phase (20Sarravia-Otten P. Muller H.P. Arvidson S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5259-5263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sar is also a repressor of the extracellular protease genes becausesar mutants express much higher levels of several proteases (24Chan P.F. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6232-6241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).S. aureus can secrete several proteases including the metalloprotease aureolysin, and several cysteine and serine proteases (25Arvidson S.O. Easmon C.S.F. Adlam C. Staphylococci and Staphylococcal Infections. Academic Press Inc., London1983: 745-808Google Scholar). The metalloprotease is expressed throughout the growth cycle, whereas the other proteases are expressed only in the stationary phase (25Arvidson S.O. Easmon C.S.F. Adlam C. Staphylococci and Staphylococcal Infections. Academic Press Inc., London1983: 745-808Google Scholar, 26Arvidson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 302: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The functions of the proteases are poorly understood, but there is evidence that they can cleave both bacterial and host proteins. Metalloprotease activates the serine protease proenzyme by removing an N-terminal domain (27Drapeau G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 607-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also activates prothrombin giving pseudocoagulase activity (28Wegrzynowicz Z. Hechko P.B. Drapeau G. Jeljaszewicz J. Pulverer G. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1980; 12: 138-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it cleaves mammalian plasma proteinase inhibitors (29Potempa J. Watorek W. Travis J. J. Biol.

The surface-associated fibrinogen-binding ClfB protein was cleaved to a smaller non-functional form by removal of an N-terminal domain. We provide evidence that ClfB is cleaved by the metalloprotease aureolysin. Cessation of transcription of clfB late in exponential phase, as well as a combination of inactivation of ClfB protein by protease, shedding of molecules into the growth medium, and dilution of the remaining functional surface protein as the cells enter stationary phase, explain the inability of bacteria from stationary phase to bind to fibrinogen in a ClfB-dependent manner.DISCUSSIONThe work described in this paper provides an explanation for an earlier observation that the ClfB protein is only present in a detectable and functional form on cells from the exponential phase of growth (10Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. François P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We have shown that this is a more complex phenomenon than originally thought. It involves cessation of transcription of theclfB gene toward the end of exponential phase and proteolytic cleavage of surface-bound ClfB to remove an N-terminal domain causing loss of fibrinogen binding activity. Shedding of full-length and truncated ClfB into the growth medium and dilution of molecules remaining on the surface during the last three cell division events leading to stationary phase also contribute to the loss of ClfB from the cell surface in stationary phase.ClfB expression and activity was found to reach a maximum in mid-late exponential phase and declined steadily as cultures progressed into stationary phase. By late stationary phase, there was only a trace amount of ClfB present on the cell surface and ClfB-mediated adherence to fibrinogen was very low. A clfB-lacZ reporter fusion was used to study transcription of clfB. Maximum reporter activity was observed in late exponential phase cells (A 600 = 1–1.5), coinciding with maximum protein expression, and declined rapidly thereafter. Neither the agrnor the sar global regulators had any significant effect onclfB transcription, in contrast to other surface protein genes. Genes encoding protein A (spa) and fibronectin-binding protein (fnbA) are negatively regulated by agr (20Sarravia-Otten P. Muller H.P. Arvidson S. J.

This correlated with lower levels of ClfB protein in the former strain.The size of the full-length ClfB protein is different in strain Newman (150 kDa) compared with 8325-4 (140 kDa) reflecting a difference in the length of the repeat region R. In both Newman and 8325-4, full-length ClfB was cleaved to truncated forms of ∼120 or 110 kDa, respectively. Cleavage occurred earlier in the growth cycle of 8325-4 and to a greater extent than with strain Newman. This reflects differences in the level of metalloprotease expressed by the two strains.SarA is a major repressor of transcription of several protease genes (30Potempa J. Fedak D. Dubin A. Mast A. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 255: 21482-21487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The level of several extracellular proteases is higher in asarA mutant of 8325-4 compared with the wild type. Since SarA had no effect on transcription of the clfB gene, we used sarA mutants to investigate the effect of proteases on cell wall-associated ClfB. In Newman sarA, the truncated form of ClfB appeared earlier in the growth cycle and was present at an increased level compared with the wild-type strain. In 8325-4sarA, only the truncated form of ClfB could be detected, even at the earliest part of the growth cycle. These cells adhered very poorly to immobilized fibrinogen, indicating that the truncated form of ClfB had lost function.The recombinant ClfB protein is particularly sensitive to cleavage at a putative proteolytic cleavage site, SLAVA. Cleavage of rClfB at this site by a putative E. coli metalloprotease resulted in the loss of the ability of the protein to bind to fibrinogen.2Region A of ClfA has a similar protease recognition site, SLAAVA (9McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), although in this case cleavage does not result in loss of fibrinogen binding activity. Thus, it was hypothesized that the SLAVA motif could be the site at which proteolysis occurs in ClfB protein expressed on the staphylococcal cell surface. S. aureus Newman cells expressing full-length ClfB protein were incubated with a concentrated stationary phase culture supernatant from a protease-overexpressing strain, Newman sar. Complete cleavage of the 150-kDa ClfB protein to the truncated form occurred. Cleavage was inhibited by EDTA and o-phenanthroline, suggesting involvement of a metalloprotease. Similarly, incubation of recombinant rClfB44–542 and rClfB197–542 with the Newman sar culture supernatant resulted in proteolytic cleavage at the SLAVA motif and in loss of fibrinogen binding activity. Cleavage occurred between Ser197 and Leu198, or between Ala199 and Val200 within the SLAVA motif and was inhibited by EDTA and o-phenanthroline. The metalloprotease of S. aureus is known to cleave at the N-terminal side of hydrophobic residues including leucine and valine (43Björklind A. Jörnvall H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 370: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and is inhibited by EDTA and o-phenanthroline. It is produced throughout the growth cycle, in contrast to the other staphylococcal proteases, which are expressed predominantly in stationary phase (21Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J.

Although the metalloprotease mediates activation of the serine protease proenzyme (Ref. 23Blevins J.S. Gillaspy A.F. Rechtin T.M. Hurlburt B.K. Smeltzer M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; Fig. 6), it seems unlikely that serine protease or any other protease activated by the metalloprotease is responsible for modifying ClfB, as cleavage occurs in exponential phase and the ClfB cleaving activity of stationary phase culture supernatants is completely inhibited by EDTA. This work demonstrates that the metalloprotease has a central role in modifying a surface protein of S. aureus.It cleaves the N terminus of ClfB, resulting in loss of fibrinogen-binding activity and is possibly also responsible for processing of ClfA.After transcription of the clfB gene and translation of the ClfB protein stops in late-exponential phase, the fate of the ClfB protein remaining on the cell surface was considered. It was observed that the concentration of the protein per cell, and also the ability of bacteria to adhere to fibrinogen, decreased as the bacteria entered stationary phase. The majority of the remaining protein on the cell surface (in 8325-4 and all clinical strains examined) was degraded to the inactive truncate. However, there was no indication that further degradation of the protein occurred, even after prolonged incubation of non-growing exponential cells with concentrated culture supernatant. Some full-length ClfB protein was found in the culture supernatant, but the amount detected did not explain the reduction in ClfB protein on stationary phase cells. We propose that the apparent loss of ClfB is in part explained by a dilution effect, as the cells continue to grow and divide after transcription (and translation) has stopped. Thus, a combination of shedding by autolysis and dilution of ClfB molecules on the surface of daughter cells can explain the reduction of ClfB on the cell surface in stationary phase.The biological significance of the truncation of ClfB during the growth cycle is unclear. However, we argue that it must be of importance because it occurs in most clinical isolates. The loss of an N-terminal domain from the surface-associated protein may release biologically active peptide fragments. The intact domain was not detected in culture supernatants or when purified rClfB44–552 was cleaved with purified aureolysin, indicating that this cleavage product is broken down further. Alternatively, cleavage of ClfB may promote the detachment of bacterial cells from colonized sites and facilitate the spread of infection within the host. Staphylococccus aureus is an important human pathogen causing both community-acquired and nosocomial infections (1Waldvogel F.A. Mandel G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. 4th Ed. Churchill Livingstone, New York1995: 1754-1777Google Scholar, 2Crossley K.B. Archer G.L. The Staphylococci in Human Diseases. Churchill Livingstone, New York1997Google Scholar). Nosocomial infections associated with indwelling medical devices or surgical wounds can lead to more serious invasive diseases such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and septicemia. Infection is dependent upon the ability of the bacteria to adhere to the host extracellular matrix or to the layer of proteins coating implanted biomaterial such as catheters and prostheses (3Höök M.

Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). S. aureus expresses distinct surface proteins, which can bind to host fibrinogen, fibronectin, collagen, and von Willebrand factor, thus enabling the bacteria to colonize and establish a focus of infection (3Höök M.

These proteins belong to the MSCRAMM family of surface proteins (for microbial surface componentsrecognizing adhesive matrixmolecules) (4Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). In addition, fibronectin-binding proteins can also bind to fibrinogen and may promote bacterial adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen (7Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13863-13871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). S. aureus expresses two related surface-associated fibrinogen-binding proteins, the clumping factors ClfA and ClfB (8McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol.

These proteins are covalently attached to the cell wall and mediate adherence of bacteria to immobilized fibrinogen, to blood clots, to conditioned biomaterial ex vivo, and to thrombi on damaged heart valves in a rat model of endocarditis (8McDevitt D.

Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In strain Newman, the clfB gene encodes a protein of 913 residues and was reported to migrate in SDS-PAGE1 gels with an apparent molecular mass of 124 kDa (10Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. François P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). ClfA and ClfB have a domain organization characteristic of many surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria (15Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). At the N terminus a signal sequence directs the protein across the cytoplasmic membrane. Region A is the surface-exposed ligand-binding domain (10Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. François P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Region R is composed of serine-aspartate dipeptide repeats and functions as a stalk to display the ligand-binding A domain on the cell surface (16Hartford O. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The C terminus has features common to many cell wall-anchored proteins of Gram-positive bacteria, including an LPXTG motif (LPETG) responsible for covalently linking the protein to peptidoglycan, a hydrophobic domain, and positively charged residues at the extreme C terminus. The A regions of ClfA and ClfB have only 26% residue identity and promote binding to different parts of fibrinogen. ClfA binds to the extreme C terminus of the γ-chain (17McDevitt D. Nanavaty T.

Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas ClfB binds to the α-chain (10Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. François P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). 2S. Perkins, E. Walsh, T. J. Foster, and M. Höök, submitted for publication.2S. Perkins, E. Walsh, T. J. Foster, and M. Höök, submitted for publication. Region A of ClfB contains a short motif SLAVA, a putative protease recognition sequence at which recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli is cleaved. A similar motif SLAAVA is present in ClfA (8McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In contrast to ClfA, which is present on cells at all stages of the growth cycle, ClfB is only present at a detectable and functional level on the surface of cells of strain Newman in the exponential phase of growth (10Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. François P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This suggests that transcription of the clfBgene ceases during exponential phase and that the surface protein may be degraded by proteases or be shed into the growth medium. Transcription of the spa, fnb, and cnagenes, encoding protein A, the fibronectin-binding proteins, and the collagen-binding adhesin, respectively, occurs only in exponential phase (19Gillaspy A.F. Leev C.Y. Sau S. Cheung A.L. Smeltzer M.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3170-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sarravia-Otten P. Muller H.P. Arvidson S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5259-5263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but in most cases sufficient protein remains on the surface of cells in the stationary phase to promote ligand binding. The genes encoding surface proteins and extracellular proteins are subjected to control at the transcriptional level by the Agr and Sar global regulators (21Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO J. 1993; 14: 3967-3975Crossref Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 22Cheung A.L. Koomey J.M. Butler C.A. Projan S.J. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6462-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The Sar protein represses transcription of the collagen binding protein independently of Agr (23Blevins J.S. Gillaspy A.F. Rechtin T.M. Hurlburt B.K. Smeltzer M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas expression of fibronectin binding protein A gene is activated by Sar in exponential phase and is repressed by Agr in stationary phase (20Sarravia-Otten P. Muller H.P. Arvidson S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5259-5263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sar is also a repressor of the extracellular protease genes becausesar mutants express much higher levels of several proteases (24Chan P.F. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6232-6241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. aureus can secrete several proteases including the metalloprotease aureolysin, and several cysteine and serine proteases (25Arvidson S.O. Easmon C.S.F. Adlam C. Staphylococci and Staphylococcal Infections. Academic Press Inc., London1983: 745-808Google Scholar). The metalloprotease is expressed throughout the growth cycle, whereas the other proteases are expressed only in the stationary phase (25Arvidson S.O. Easmon C.S.F. Adlam C. Staphylococci and Staphylococcal Infections. Academic Press Inc., London1983: 745-808Google Scholar, 26Arvidson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 302: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The functions of the proteases are poorly understood, but there is evidence that they can cleave both bacterial and host proteins. Metalloprotease activates the serine protease proenzyme by removing an N-terminal domain (27Drapeau G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 607-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also activates prothrombin giving pseudocoagulase activity (28Wegrzynowicz Z. Hechko P.B. Drapeau G. Jeljaszewicz J. Pulverer G. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1980; 12: 138-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it cleaves mammalian plasma proteinase inhibitors (29Potempa J. Watorek W. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14330-14334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Potempa J. Fedak D. Dubin A. Mast A. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 255: 21482-21487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In this paper we have analyzed the transcriptional activity of theclfB gene promoter and the level of ClfB protein expressed on the bacterial cell surface at different stages of the growth cycle. The surface-associated fibrinogen-binding ClfB protein was cleaved to a smaller non-functional form by removal of an N-terminal domain. We provide evidence that ClfB is cleaved by the metalloprotease aureolysin. Cessation of transcription of clfB late in exponential phase, as well as a combination of inactivation of ClfB protein by protease, shedding of molecules into the growth medium, and dilution of the remaining functional surface protein as the cells enter stationary phase, explain the inability of bacteria from stationary phase to bind to fibrinogen in a ClfB-dependent manner. DISCUSSIONThe work described in this paper provides an explanation for an earlier observation that the ClfB protein is only present in a detectable and functional form on cells from the exponential phase of growth (10Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. François P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We have shown that this is a more complex phenomenon than originally thought. It involves cessation of transcription of theclfB gene toward the end of exponential phase and proteolytic cleavage of surface-bound ClfB to remove an N-terminal domain causing loss of fibrinogen binding activity. Shedding of full-length and truncated ClfB into the growth medium and dilution of molecules remaining on the surface during the last three cell division events leading to stationary phase also contribute to the loss of ClfB from the cell surface in stationary phase.ClfB expression and activity was found to reach a maximum in mid-late exponential phase and declined steadily as cultures progressed into stationary phase. By late stationary phase, there was only a trace amount of ClfB present on the cell surface and ClfB-mediated adherence to fibrinogen was very low. A clfB-lacZ reporter fusion was used to study transcription of clfB. Maximum reporter activity was observed in late exponential phase cells (A 600 = 1–1.5), coinciding with maximum protein expression, and declined rapidly thereafter. Neither the agrnor the sar global regulators had any significant effect onclfB transcription, in contrast to other surface protein genes. Genes encoding protein A (spa) and fibronectin-binding protein (fnbA) are negatively regulated by agr (20Sarravia-Otten P. Muller H.P. Arvidson S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5259-5263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Cheung A.L. Eberhardt K. Heinrichs J.H. Infect.

Genes encoding protein A (spa) and fibronectin-binding protein (fnbA) are negatively regulated by agr (20Sarravia-Otten P. Muller H.P. Arvidson S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5259-5263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Cheung A.L. Eberhardt K. Heinrichs J.H. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the gene encoding the collagen binding protein cna is negatively regulated by sarAindependently of agr (23Blevins J.S. Gillaspy A.F. Rechtin T.M. Hurlburt B.K. Smeltzer M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Expression ofclfB-lacZ was lower in strain 8325-4 compared with Newman. This correlated with lower levels of ClfB protein in the former strain. The size of the full-length ClfB protein is different in strain Newman (150 kDa) compared with 8325-4 (140 kDa) reflecting a difference in the length of the repeat region R. In both Newman and 8325-4, full-length ClfB was cleaved to truncated forms of ∼120 or 110 kDa, respectively. Cleavage occurred earlier in the growth cycle of 8325-4 and to a greater extent than with strain Newman. This reflects differences in the level of metalloprotease expressed by the two strains. SarA is a major repressor of transcription of several protease genes (30Potempa J. Fedak D. Dubin A. Mast A. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 255: 21482-21487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The level of several extracellular proteases is higher in asarA mutant of 8325-4 compared with the wild type. Since SarA had no effect on transcription of the clfB gene, we used sarA mutants to investigate the effect of proteases on cell wall-associated ClfB. In Newman sarA, the truncated form of ClfB appeared earlier in the growth cycle and was present at an increased level compared with the wild-type strain. In 8325-4sarA, only the truncated form of ClfB could be detected, even at the earliest part of the growth cycle. These cells adhered very poorly to immobilized fibrinogen, indicating that the truncated form of ClfB had lost function. The recombinant ClfB protein is particularly sensitive to cleavage at a putative proteolytic cleavage site, SLAVA. Cleavage of rClfB at this site by a putative E. coli metalloprotease resulted in the loss of the ability of the protein to bind to fibrinogen.2Region A of ClfA has a similar protease recognition site, SLAAVA (9McDevitt D. François P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), although in this case cleavage does not result in loss of fibrinogen binding activity. Thus, it was hypothesized that the SLAVA motif could be the site at which proteolysis occurs in ClfB protein expressed on the staphylococcal cell surface. S. aureus Newman cells expressing full-length ClfB protein were incubated with a concentrated stationary phase culture supernatant from a protease-overexpressing strain, Newman sar. Complete cleavage of the 150-kDa ClfB protein to the truncated form occurred. Cleavage was inhibited by EDTA and o-phenanthroline, suggesting involvement of a metalloprotease. Similarly, incubation of recombinant rClfB44–542 and rClfB197–542 with the Newman sar culture supernatant resulted in proteolytic cleavage at the SLAVA motif and in loss of fibrinogen binding activity. Cleavage occurred between Ser197 and Leu198, or between Ala199 and Val200 within the SLAVA motif and was inhibited by EDTA and o-phenanthroline. The metalloprotease of S. aureus is known to cleave at the N-terminal side of hydrophobic residues including leucine and valine (43Björklind A. Jörnvall H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 370: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and is inhibited by EDTA and o-phenanthroline. It is produced throughout the growth cycle, in contrast to the other staphylococcal proteases, which are expressed predominantly in stationary phase (21Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO J. 1993; 14: 3967-3975Crossref Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 22Cheung A.L. Koomey J.M. Butler C.A. Projan S.J. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6462-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays using theaur-lacZ fusion showed that aur is transcribed from early exponential phase (data not shown). Although the metalloprotease mediates activation of the serine protease proenzyme (Ref. 23Blevins J.S. Gillaspy A.F. Rechtin T.M. Hurlburt B.K. Smeltzer M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; Fig. 6), it seems unlikely that serine protease or any other protease activated by the metalloprotease is responsible for modifying ClfB, as cleavage occurs in exponential phase and the ClfB cleaving activity of stationary phase culture supernatants is completely inhibited by EDTA. This work demonstrates that the metalloprotease has a central role in modifying a surface protein of S. aureus.It cleaves the N terminus of ClfB, resulting in loss of fibrinogen-binding activity and is possibly also responsible for processing of ClfA. After transcription of the clfB gene and translation of the ClfB protein stops in late-exponential phase, the fate of the ClfB protein remaining on the cell surface was considered. It was observed that the concentration of the protein per cell, and also the ability of bacteria to adhere to fibrinogen, decreased as the bacteria entered stationary phase. The majority of the remaining protein on the cell surface (in 8325-4 and all clinical strains examined) was degraded to the inactive truncate. However, there was no indication that further degradation of the protein occurred, even after prolonged incubation of non-growing exponential cells with concentrated culture supernatant. Some full-length ClfB protein was found in the culture supernatant, but the amount detected did not explain the reduction in ClfB protein on stationary phase cells. We propose that the apparent loss of ClfB is in part explained by a dilution effect, as the cells continue to grow and divide after transcription (and translation) has stopped. Thus, a combination of shedding by autolysis and dilution of ClfB molecules on the surface of daughter cells can explain the reduction of ClfB on the cell surface in stationary phase. The biological significance of the truncation of ClfB during the growth cycle is unclear. However, we argue that it must be of importance because it occurs in most clinical isolates. The loss of an N-terminal domain from the surface-associated protein may release biologically active peptide fragments. The intact domain was not detected in culture supernatants or when purified rClfB44–552 was cleaved with purified aureolysin, indicating that this cleavage product is broken down further. Alternatively, cleavage of ClfB may promote the detachment of bacterial cells from colonized sites and facilitate the spread of infection within the host. We acknowledge helpful discussions and comments by S. Perkins and M. Höök."

However, prior attempts to measure the affinity of albumin for bilirubin have yielded highly variable results, reflecting both differing conditions and the confounding influence of impurities. We therefore have devised a method based on serial ultrafiltration that successively removes impurities in [14C]bilirubin until a stable binding affinity is achieved, and then we used it to assess the effect of albumin concentration and buffer composition on binding. The apparent binding affinity of human serum albumin for [14C]bilirubin was strongly dependent on assay conditions, falling from (5.09 ± 0.24) × 107liters/mol at lower albumin concentrations (15 µm) to (0.54 ± 0.05) × 107 liters/mol at higher albumin concentrations (300 µm). To determine whether radioactive impurities were responsible for this change, we estimated impurities in the stock bilirubin using a novel modeling approach and found them to be 0.11–0.13%. Formation of new impurities during the study and their affinity for albumin were also estimated. After correction for impurities, the binding affinity remained heavily dependent on the albumin concentration (range (5.37 ± 0.26) × 107 liters/mol to (0.65 ± 0.03) × 107 liters/mol). Affinities decreased by about half in the presence of chloride (50 mm). Thus, the affinity of human albumin for bilirubin is not constant, but varies with both albumin concentration and buffer composition. Binding may be considerably less avid at physiological albumin concentrations than previously believed.

Adv. Pediatr. 1997; 44: 173-229PubMed Google Scholar). Newborn infants with low levels of bilirubin glucuronosyltransferase and people with a severe genetic deficiency of this enzyme are at risk for developing bilirubin toxicity, which occurs when bilirubin levels in cells become sufficiently elevated to interfere with normal cellular functions (2Wennberg R.P. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2000; 20: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Deposition in brain tissues produces the most severe toxicity, known as kernicterus (1Gourley G.R. Adv. Pediatr. 1997; 44: 173-229PubMed Google Scholar), whereas deposition in skin and mucous membranes results in the yellow jaundice characteristic of liver disease. Plasma albumin limits the toxicity of bilirubin by reducing the unbound bilirubin concentration and thereby competing with tissues for bilirubin binding (3Brodersen R. CRC. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1979; 11: 305-399Google Scholar). Extremely avid binding to albumin may be detrimental, however, because it limits the rate of hepatic removal of bilirubin from the plasma (4Weisiger R.A. Tavoloni N. Berk P.D. Hepatic Transport and Bile Secretion: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Raven Press, NY1993: 171-196Google Scholar). Thus, the affinity of albumin for bilirubin may reflect a compromise between the need to prevent excessive binding to tissues and the need for efficient hepatic elimination. Attempts to measure the equilibrium binding constant (KF)1of albumin for bilirubin have been hampered by the difficulty in measuring the extremely low concentrations of unbound bilirubin typically present in plasma, reportedly less than 0.005% of total bilirubin at physiological albumin concentrations (3Brodersen R. CRC. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1979; 11: 305-399Google Scholar). For this reason, investigators have usually measured the binding affinity at much lower albumin concentrations where the unbound fraction of bilirubin is correspondingly larger. The value of KF thus determined is then used to predict the unbound bilirubin concentration for physiologic albumin and bilirubin concentrations. This approach assumes that KF is a constant that is independent of the albumin concentration. This assumption has never been adequately tested and has recently been questioned (5Pascolo L. Del Vecchio S. Koehler R.K. Bayon J.E. Webster C.C. Mukerjee P. Ostrow J.D. Tiribelli C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Ahlfors C.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, many properties of albumin are known to depend on its concentration (7Scatchard G. Batchelder A.C. Brown A. Zosa M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1946; 68: 2610-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Mueller U.W. Potter J.M. Biochem.

Bree F. Tillement J.-P. J. Chromatog. 1981; 216: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In particular, the binding affinity of albumin for a variety of metabolites and drugs is reduced at higher albumin concentration (8Mueller U.W. Potter J.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Boobis S.W. Chignell C.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1979; 28: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Brunkhorst W.K.

J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1984; 36: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the assumption that the KF for bilirubin is unaffected by albumin concentration may not be valid. Prior studies of bilirubin binding to human serum albumin have produced estimates for KF that vary by more than 100-fold (3Brodersen R. CRC. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1979; 11: 305-399Google Scholar). One possible explanation is the use of different experimental conditions. However, an even greater confounding factor may have been contamination by impurities. Studies that use radiolabeled bilirubin must contend with the presence of radiolabeled impurities, both those present initially and those generated during the study (e.g.by photodegradation, Ref. 17Ostrow J.D. Schmid R. Samuelson D. J. Clin. Invest. 1963; 42: 1286-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Impurities that bind weakly to albumin but cannot be distinguished from genuine bilirubin may reduce the apparent binding affinity dramatically. For example, if the unbound concentration of bilirubin is 0.01%, then the presence of a nonbinding impurity at a level of 0.1% would reduce the apparent binding affinity ∼10-fold. Current methods do not allow preparation of bilirubin with a purity of >99.99%. Thus, any binding study using labeled bilirubin must compensate in some way for impurities. In the current study, we present a method that uses serial ultrafiltration to progressively and selectively remove weakly bound impurities until the KF value approaches a constant. Our results indicate that the binding affinity of human serum albumin for bilirubin is not a constant, as previously assumed (3Brodersen R. CRC. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1979; 11: 305-399Google Scholar), but is modulated by both albumin concentration and buffer composition. Mathematical modeling of these data allowed us to estimate not only the true binding affinity, but also the amount of initial impurity, the rate of impurity formation during sample processing, and the affinity of the impurities for albumin. To minimize photodegradation of bilirubin (18Blanckaert N. Heirwegh K.P.M. Ostrow J.D. Bile Pigments and Jaundice; Molecular, Metabolic and Medical Aspects. Marcel Dekker, NY1986: 31-79Google Scholar, 19Ostrow J.D. Branham R.V. Gastroenterology. 1970; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Ostrow J.D. Semin. Hematol. 1972; 9: 113-125PubMed Google Scholar), samples were maintained in complete darkness throughout all procedures except when being transferred into and out of the centrifuge and during aliquot removal and remixing of the retentates. Illumination was provided by red lamps with no detectable emission below 600 nm; this has been shown to produce no detectable photodegradation of bilirubin in deoxygenated albumin solution at pH 7.4 (19Ostrow J.D. Branham R.V. Gastroenterology. 1970; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Photoisomerization is also unlikely because of the lack of emission in the range of wavelengths at which bilirubin absorbs light. Radiolabeled bilirubin conjugates were purified from bile after intravenous infusion of δ-[5-14C]aminolevulinic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) to bile-fistula rats using a protocol approved by the Animal Committee of Northwestern University Medical School and the Chicago VA Lakeside Medical Center. Purified14C-unconjugated bilirubin was then obtained by a modification of the method of Ostrow et al. (21Ostrow J.D. Hammaker L. Schmid R. J. Clin. Invest. 1961; 40: 1442-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were removed from pooled bile using reverse-phase C18 cartridges (Mega Bond Elut, Analytichem, Harbor City, CA). Following elution, the conjugated bilirubin was precipitated with lead ion, and contaminating lipids were removed by ethanol extraction followed by two water washes. Unconjugated bilirubin was produced by alkaline hydrolysis of the resulting pigments. After extraction into chloroform, the labeled bilirubin was further purified by two cycles of alkaline extraction followed by recrystallization to constant specific activity according to McDonagh and Assisi (22McDonagh A.F. Assisi F. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 797-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The resulting [14C]bilirubin had a specific radioactivity of 5 × 104 dpm/µg or 0.022 µCi/µg, as assessed by scintillation counting and diazo assay (23Michaelsson M. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1961; 13: 1-80Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and met criteria for purity described previously (21Ostrow J.D. Hammaker L. Schmid R. J. Clin. Invest. 1961; 40: 1442-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The [14C]bilirubin solution was distributed among glass vials, evaporated to dryness, sealed under argon, and finally stored in the dark at −20 °C until use (18Blanckaert N. Heirwegh K.P.M. Ostrow J.D. Bile Pigments and Jaundice; Molecular, Metabolic and Medical Aspects. Marcel Dekker, NY1986: 31-79Google Scholar). Assays at 4-week intervals confirmed the stability of the stored [14C]bilirubin (specific activity within ±2% of baseline). Sucrose buffer solutions contained 10–300 µm human serum albumin (fatty acid free, catalog A-3782, lot 93H9343, Sigma) plus 0.25 m sucrose and 20 mm HEPES, adjusted with Tris to pH 7.4. For chloride buffer solutions, 50 mm KCl was substituted isosmotically for 100 mm sucrose. In two experiments at albumin concentrations of 30–35 µm, 50 mm NaCl, or potassium gluconate were used instead of KCl. On the day of the study, [14C]bilirubin from one vial was dissolved in deoxygenated chloroform, and the last measurable traces of polar impurities were removed by serial extraction with 20 volumes of 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, until a constant solvent partition ratio was obtained (five cycles). The chloroform was evaporated under a stream of argon and the [14C]bilirubin dissolved in 30 µl of Me2SO and diluted into 3.0 ml of deoxygenated albumin solution. The target bilirubin/HSA molar ratio was 0.25 for most experiments but was reduced to 0.10 at the highest albumin concentrations to conserve [14C]bilirubin. Radioassay and diazo assay (23Michaelsson M. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1961; 13: 1-80Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were performed in duplicate on 0.5 ml of the solution, and the remaining 2.5 ml was used immediately for ultrafiltration studies. Ultrafiltration was performed at 25 °C using Centricon 10 ultrafiltration devices (Amicon, Danvers, MA). Experiments for each day were performed in duplicate, and each experiment using chloride buffer was paired with an identical experiment using sucrose buffer (four tubes total). Centricons, presoaked overnight in appropriate buffer, were flushed dry with argon and loaded with 2.5 ml of buffered [14C]bilirubin-HSA solution. Five sequential centrifugation cycles were then performed at 42 ± 6 min intervals (mean ± S.D., n = 112). An initial centrifugation (10 min at 2500 × g) allowed the Centricon membrane to become equilibrated with unbound bilirubin so that the ultrafiltrate composition would accurately reflect the unbound bilirubin concentration in the albumin solution. Subsequent centrifugations (cycles 2 through 5) were for 20 min at 4500 × g. After each centrifugation, 30 µl of stirred retentate, and the entire filtrate were taken for analysis of protein concentration and radioactivity. The residual retentate was then diluted back to its original volume with the same buffer, mixed gently for 2 min, and 30 µl taken for analysis. In selected experiments to assess gradient formation, 10-µl fluid samples were taken from the extreme top and bottom of the retentate fluid column immediately following the final centrifugation using a 25 µl fine-tip Hamilton syringe. Retentate samples (10 µl) were assayed for total albumin concentration by the bicinchonic acid method (24Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18514) Google Scholar) with correction for the small reactivity of the HEPES buffer using a protein-free blank. Control studies indicated that bilirubin did not interfere with this assay at the concentrations used. Radioactivity in the remaining 20 µl of retentate, and the entire ultrafiltrate was determined by scintillation counting. Apparent total [Bt] and unbound [Bf] bilirubin concentrations were calculated from the specific activity of [14C]bilirubin and the dpm/ml of the retentate (sampled before and after each centrifugation) and filtrate, respectively. Apparent bound bilirubin concentrations were calculated as Bt-Bf using the mean dpm/ml and HSA concentrations in the retentate fluid before and after the centrifugation. Control studies were performed in the absence of HSA, using 30 and 45 nm [14C]bilirubin, comparable with Bf values observed in the presence of HSA. The apparent equilibrium binding constant,K′f, was calculated using the familiar mass action equation, Equation 1, in which the numerator contains the apparent concentration of albumin-bilirubin complexes, while the denominator is the product of the apparent unbound bilirubin concentration [Bf] and the concentration of unoccupied albumin binding sites [HSA-Bt +Bf]. [Bt] is the measured total bilirubin concentration. Kf′=Bt−BfBf(HSA−Bt+Bf)(Eq. 1) As used here, K′f is the first stepwise binding constant of albumin as defined by Spector et al. (25Spector A.A. Fletcher J.E. Ashbrook J.D. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3229-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although albumin has multiple bilirubin binding sites (3Brodersen R. CRC. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1979; 11: 305-399Google Scholar), this study considers only the first sequential site to be occupied because the molar ratio of Bt to HSA was always ≪ 1.0. Equation 1 may be modified to expressK′f in terms of actual concentrations by replacing Bf and Bt with their equivalents, BF + I and BT + I, as shown in Equation 2, Kf′=(BT+I)−(BF+I)(BF+I)(HSA−(BT+I)+(BF+I))(Eq. 2) where BF and BT are the true concentrations of unbound and total bilirubin and I is the concentration of unbound impurities. Our modeling strategy was to determine I by finding the values that minimize the differences between K′fpredicted by Equation 2 and K′fmeasured using Equation 1. Thus, the impurity concentration at each centrifugation cycle for each pair of Centricon tubes (containing sucrose and chloride buffer, respectively) was determined by iteratively varying the values of I to minimize the sum of the squares between the observed values of K′f in Equation 1 and the values predicted by Equation 2 for each cycle (after replacing BF with Bf -I and BT with Bt -I). KF was then calculated for each Centricon pair using the standard mass action equation. Note that Equation 2 alone does not allow us to distinguish impurity from unbound bilirubin, as both are efficiently filtered through the membrane. We can calculate I if we know BF, or can calculate BF if we know I, but not both. To determine both values, we take advantage of the fact that removal of impurity by successive filtrations is much more efficient than removal of bilirubin, reflecting the more avid binding of bilirubin to albumin. As the amount of impurity in the solution decreases with each successive cycle, the value of K′f approachesKF. Because I and BF behave differently, they can be separated by our curve-fitting routine. The amount of impurity remaining for any given cycle, n, is also affected by sampling and formation of new impurity during that cycle. The impurity concentration for a given centrifugation cycle, In, is the sum of initial impurity I0 plus any impurity that has formed during sample processing minus all impurity that has been removed by filtration or sampling. This may be expressed as Equation 3,In=I0(1−F)n-1+∑i=2nkBT(1−F)i-2,(Eq. 3) where k is the rate of impurity formation per centrifugation cycle, and F is the fraction of the total impurity that is removed by filtration per cycle. Note that both I0 and newly generated impurity are decreased for each subsequent centrifugation cycle by the fraction, F, of impurity removed each cycle. If the impurity does not bind to albumin, F is simply the fraction of the solution removed by filtration and sampling (0.48). If the impurity does bind to albumin, then F is 0.48 multiplied by the fraction of the impurity that is unbound as shown in Equation 4,F=0.481+HSAKI,(Eq. 4) where KI is the binding affinity of the impurity for albumin. If both I0 and k are zero, Equation 3 simplifies to zero, and we have the traditional case in which no impurity is present. Our approach uses the change in Bf with successive centrifugation cycles to determine the impurity concentration, I. If impurities are present, Bf will typically decrease with each cycle after the first because of progressive, selective removal of poorly bound impurities by filtration, eventually approaching a steady value. For convenience, Bf values were converted to their equivalent K′f values using Equation1 prior to fitting. For each Centricon tube, the sum of the squares of the differences between observed and model-predictedK′f values for cycles 2 through 5 was iteratively minimized using a derivative-free (simplex) method. The value of I for each cycle was calculated from Equation 3 and used to determine the true binding affinity, KF as described below. A Microsoft Excel program to perform the curve fitting is available from the first author. The true binding affinity KF for each centrifugation is found by subtracting the impurity concentration for that cycle In from Bf and Bteverywhere they appear in Equation 1. Modifying Equation 1 and defining R as the ratio of total to unbound impurity, we get Equation 5. KF=(Bt−RIn)−(Bf−In)(Bf−In)(HSA−(Bt−RIn)+(Bf−In))=BT−BFBF(HSA−BT+BF)(Eq. 5) We sought the simplest impurity model that could adequately account for the data. All models considered the amount of initial impurity, I0; the rate of new impurity formation per cycle, k; and the affinity of binding of impurity to albumin, KI, although one or more of these values could be set to zero prior to fitting. Where kwas not zero, we further considered whether k was acting on the total concentration of bilirubin, the unbound concentration of bilirubin, or was a constant independent of either concentration. The best model was selected using three criteria. First, curve fitting of the data must converge on physiologically reasonable (e.g.non-negative) values for the fitted parameters for each pair of Centricon tubes. Second, all parameters must be adequately identified by the data (S.E. of the fitted values ≪100% of the mean). Models that fulfilled the above criteria were further compared according to goodness of fit (determined by the lowest sum of the squares for a given number of unknown parameters). Models with fewer unknown parameters were favored over more complex models if they could adequately account for the data. Differences in values between individual parameters were determined using the appropriate paired or unpaired two-tailed t test with p < 0.05 being judged as significant. Unless otherwise specified, parameter values are listed as mean ± S.E. In eight control studies without albumin, 8–18% of the [14C]bilirubin adsorbed to the walls and frit of the Centricon device during the first centrifugation. With subsequent cycles, no additional adsorption was detected and the concentration of [14C]bilirubin in the filtrate averaged 98 ± 2% of that in the retentate. Thus, no correction for binding to the Centricon was needed for cycles 2 through 5. Subsequent analysis used data from these cycles only. Binding of bilirubin to the Centricon tubes during the first centrifugation was also seen in the presence of albumin, although it was much less pronounced. Radioactivity in the filtrate was 52 ± 30% greater (mean ± S.D., n = 112) after the second cycle than after the first. Assay of ultrafiltrates showed no detectable protein even after 10-fold concentration by lyophilization, indicating that the Centricon membranes were essentially impermeable to albumin. Our assay would have been sensitive to leakage of as little as 0.005 µg/ml albumin in the filtrate. This corresponds to leakage of less than 0.00005% of the albumin from a 1% solution, a value that is at least 1000 times lower than the corresponding fraction of radioactivity filtered (mean 0.22%, range 0.06–1.42%). Total albumin concentration in the solution was not affected by filtration followed by redilution to the original volume. However, total HSA and [14C]bilirubin concentrations in the retained solutions declined by about 10% overall during cycles 2 through 5 because of removal of samples for assay followed by redilution to the original volume. Because we measured the values of [HSA] and [Bt] for each cycle, these small changes had no effect on results. In control experiments at albumin concentrations of 13–17 and 80–90 µm, K′f values did not differ between Bt/HSA molar ratios of 0.44–0.48 and 0.23–0.26 (data not shown). However, molar ratios >0.55 resulted in significantly larger values of K′f, possibly reflecting formation of non-filtered bilirubin aggregates when BF exceeds its solubility in water. To avoid problems related to saturation of the unbound bilirubin concentration, all studies were performed using molar ratios of 0.1–0.25. At the conclusion of each centrifugation cycle, a steep gradient of increased yellow color was visible at the bottom of the retentate fluid. To determine the magnitude of these gradients, 25 µl samples were taken from the extreme top and bottom of the retentate in 4 control Centricons after the 5th spin cycle, being careful not to disturb the gradient. All tubes contained 40–50 µm HSA, whereas two contained sucrose buffer and two contained chloride buffer. Measured concentrations of HSA were 4.0 ± 0.4-fold higher at the bottom than at the top of the retentate column, whereas the comparable value for [14C]bilirubin was 2.8 ± 0.3 (mean ± S.E., p < 0.05 HSAversus [14C]bilirubin). The potential impact of these gradients on our conclusions is considered later. Most prior binding studies have analyzed their data assuming that no impurity is present. To allow comparison with these earlier studies, we first analyzed our data using cycles 2–5 as replicates without any correction for impurities. This analysis suggests a dramatic decrease in the apparent binding affinity of HSA for bilirubin at higher albumin concentrations (Fig.1). The concentration-dependent change inK′f was 9.5-fold in sucrose buffer (from (5.09 ± 0.24) × 107 to (5.36 ± 0.51) × 106 liters/mol) and 8.7-fold in chloride buffer (from (2.19 ± 0.14) × 107 to (2.52 ± 0.28) × 106 liters/mol). Moreover,K′f was significantly greater in sucrose buffer than in chloride buffer (mean ratio 2.03 ± 0.54, p < 0.0002). The decrease inK′f with rising albumin concentration could also be explained by a poorly bound impurity that constitutes a relatively minor fraction of the unbound radioactivity at lower albumin concentrations, but most of the unbound radioactivity at higher albumin concentrations. If so, the true binding affinityKF might actually be constant. This alternative interpretation must be excluded before variation in binding affinity with albumin concentration can be accepted. We therefore estimated the impurity concentration from the change in Bf with successive centrifugation cycles. The radioactivity in the filtrate (Bf) gradually decreased from the 2nd to the 5th centrifugation cycles by a mean of 18%, presumably reflecting progressive removal of impurities by filtration. Because the HSA concentration remained nearly constant, this decline resulted in a corresponding increase in the apparent binding affinity of albumin for bilirubin,K′f (Fig.2). The increase inK′f became less marked with each succeeding cycle, suggesting that impurity was being lost by ultrafiltration more rapidly than it was being formed until a balance between these two processes was approached. The total increase inK′f over cycles 2–5 averaged 17 ± 5% in the absence of KCl and 19 ± 5% with 50 mmKCl present (n = 14, mean ± S.E., Fig. 2). In one study, K′f declined substantially over all cycles, presumably because of very high rates of impurity formation and/or development of leaks in the filter membrane. These data were excluded from subsequent analysis by replacing them with data from a replicate study done under identical conditions. The amount of impurity needed to cause the observed change inK′f for each pair of Centricon tubes was estimated by modeling the K′fdata for each cycle as described in “Experimental Procedures.” All models considered included the initial impurity level, I0, as a fitted variable (allowed range, 0–100% of filtered radioactivity). All models also included possible binding of impurity to albumin by incorporating the binding affinity of impurity for albumin, KI, as a fitted parameter (allowed range, 0-KF). Models that were considered differed only by whether impurity was generated during each cycle and if so, whether the rate constant for impurity formation, k, was proportional to the unbound bilirubin concentration (model A), the total bilirubin concentration (model B), or a constant independent of the bilirubin concentration (zero-order, model C). Thus, the unknown parameters in the fitting process were I0, KI, andk. Both models A and B satisfactorily accounted for the data with reasonable values of the unknown parameters (TableI). All parameter values were adequately identified by the data. Thus, the uncertainty (S.E.) in I0was only 16% of the mean for both models whereas the u"

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) regulates inflammatory and growth responses of intestinal epithelial cells. We determined whether activation of PPARγ modified H. pylori-induced apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells. PPARγ was expressed and functionally active in gastric epithelial cell lines sensitive toH. pylori-induced apoptosis.

One specific host pathway through which inflammatory mediators may influence H. pylori-induced apoptosis is the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ1 (PPARγ). PPARγ and the related isoforms PPARα and PPARδ constitute a family of nuclear hormone receptors with important roles in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation and glucose utilization (24Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar, 25Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). PPARs form functional heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor family of nuclear receptors (24Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). It is now appreciated that PPARs are important in regulating pathways beyond energy homeostasis (26Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For example, although PPARγ was originally identified as a transcription factor essential for adipocyte differentiation (27Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar), there is now increasing evidence to indicate a role for this receptor in regulating other cell types including macrophages, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells. In colonic epithelial cells, activation of PPARγ inhibits intracellular signaling cascades, such as NF-κB, that regulate inflammation and apoptosis (28Su C.G. Wen X. Bailey S.T. Jiang W.

Putative endogenous PPARγ ligands include the cyclopentanone prostaglandin 15-deoxy12,14-J2 (15d-PGJ2), which is derived from PGD2, a metabolite of cyclooxygenases (COX) (31Forman B.M. Tontonoz P.

Collectively, these findings suggest that prostaglandin products generated by COX-2 may contribute to the heterogeneous levels of apoptosis found within H. pylori-colonized mucosa. BecauseH. pylori strains invariably induce gastritis and COX-2-generated ligands of PPARγ may contribute to apoptosis in vivo, the aims of this study were to determine whether PPARγ activation affects the ability of H. pylori to induce apoptosis and to identify the molecular pathways required for these events.

Total RNA was isolated and treated with DNase (1 unit/µg), and 1 µg of RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using random hexamers as described previously (47Peek Jr., R.M. Miller G.G. Tham K.T. Perez-Perez G.I. Cover T.L. Atherton J.C. Dunn G.D. Blaser M.J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 28-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR was performed in buffer containing 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 50 mmol/ liter KCl, 2.0 mmol/ liter MgCl2, 0.2 mmol each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 0.5 µmol/ liter PPARγ primers: 5′-GAGTTCATGCTTGTGAAGGATGC, 3′-CGATATCACTGGAGATCTCCGCC. One µl of cDNA was amplified as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, for 40 cycles, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Reverse transcription-PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cell protein extract concentrations were normalized by the Bradford assay (Pierce), and 25 µg of protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF, Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). Membranes were incubated with affinity-purified anti-PPARγ antibody (sc-1984; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-phospho-IκB antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Primary antibodies were detected using goat anti-mouse (Santa Cruz) or goat anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively, and visualized by the ECL detection system (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gastric cells were cultured on chamber slides with or without H. pylorifor 24–48 h, fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min, incubated with 1 µg/ml propidium iodide for 5 min, and evaluated by fluorescent microscopy. DNA fragmentation was quantified using a commercially available ELISA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) that detects nucleosomal fragments in cytoplasmic fractions of cells undergoing apoptosis but not necrosis, as described previously (23Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. Mays D.J. Forsyth M.H. Cover T.L. Song S.Y. Krishna U. Pietenpol J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6124-6131PubMed Google Scholar). For quantitation of IL-8, AGS cells in 6-well plates were co-cultured with or without H. pylori for 6 h in triplicate, and IL-8 protein was measured in supernatants by ELISA (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (46Peek Jr., R.M. Miller G.G. Tham K.T. Perez-Perez G.I. Zhao X. Atherton J.C. Blaser M.J. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 760-770PubMed Google Scholar). AGS cells (5 × 105) were transfected with a mixture containing 20 µg/ml LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.66 µg/ml PPRE3-tk-luciferase or 0.66 µg/ml pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI), and 0.66 µg/ml pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA) in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 h. The transfection mixture was then replaced with complete media containing either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO or 0.1% acetate) or the indicated ligand. After 24 h, cells were harvested in 1× luciferase lysis buffer. Relative light units from firefly luciferase activity were determined using a luminometer and normalized to the relative light units fromRenilla luciferase using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). AGS cells were cultured on collagen-coated glass cover slides, and cells treated with H. pylori in the presence or absence of BRL-49653 were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 4 oC, and then permeabilized with methanol for 5 min at −20 °C as described previously (48Kaiser G.C. Yan F. Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 602-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Air-dried slides were washed with PBS, incubated in 10% non-immune goat serum in PBS (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 1 h, and then incubated with rabbit anti-NF-κB p65 antibody (1:300) (Santa Cruz) in PBS with 1% goat serum overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed three times for 5 min in PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:2000) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in 10% goat serum in PBS at room temperature. After washing again, slides were dehydrated and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence was observed using a fluorescence microscope, and for each sample, at least 100 cells were evaluated by an independent observer unaware of experimental conditions. Results are expressed as the mean number of cells with nuclear localization of the NF-κB p65 subunit/total number of cells counted. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then solubilized in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40, with leupeptin (10 µg/ml), aprotinin (10 µg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (18 µg/ml)). In vitroGST-IκBα phosphorylation assays were performed by incubating cellular lysates (300 µg) in kinase buffer with 0.5 µg of GST-IκBα fusion protein (Santa Cruz) conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at room temperature. The kinase reaction was stopped by a 1-min centrifugation at 4 °C followed by two washes in ice-cold PBS (49Yan F. Polk D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36631-36636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GST-IκBα was recovered by solubilization in Laemmli sample buffer for detection of phosphorylation by Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-(Ser-32)-IκBα (Cell Signaling). Western blot analysis with anti-IκBα (Cell Signaling) was performed to verify equal protein loading. Two-tailed statistical tests were used to evaluate the data. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analyses of inter-group comparisons; p values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses were performed to determine whether PPARγ is expressed in gastric epithelial cells. PPARγ-specific amplification products (Fig.1 A) and immunoreactive protein bands (Fig. 1 B) were present in both AGS and MKN28 cells. To determine the functional activity of the endogenous PPARγ receptor, AGS cells were transfected with a reporter vector (PPRE3-tk-luc) containing three tandem repeats of the PPAR response element (PPRE) from the acyl-CoA oxidase gene upstream of a luciferase cDNA. Treatment of transfected cells with the PPARγ selective agonists 15d-PGJ2 or BRL-49653, but not the related cyclopentanone prostaglandin PGA1, resulted in a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity; the synthetic compound BRL-49653 was more potent in inducing PPRE3-tk-luc expression than 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 1 C). Thus, PPARγ is expressed and transcriptionally responsive to both endogenous and synthetic ligands in gastric epithelial cells. We tested the hypothesis that H. pylori could induce the phenotypic response of interest (apoptosis) in AGS and MKN28 cells; therefore, we co-cultured cells in the absence or presence of reference strain 60190 and quantified cytoplasmic nucleosomal release. H. pylori significantly increased oligonucleosomal fragments in both cell types at 24 and 48 h (p < 0.001 for each time point versus controls, Fig. 1 D). In addition, the magnitude of H. pylori-induced apoptosis was greatest for AGS cells, and therefore this cell line was used in all subsequent experiments. To independently assess apoptosis, we examined propidium iodide-stained cells using fluorescence microscopy. Similar to DNA fragmentation results, strain 60190 reduced the population of adherent AGS cells and induced chromatin condensation and nuclear segmentation, features consistent with apoptosis (Fig.1 E). These results indicated that we had identified anin vitro system that would allow us to examine the effects of PPARγ activation on H. pylori-induced apoptosis. To determine whether activation of PPARγ altered H. pylori-induced apoptosis, we pretreated cells with increasing concentrations of either 15d-PGJ2, BRL-49653, PGA1, or vehicle alone prior to the addition ofH. pylori and quantified apoptosis by ELISA. H. pylori alone significantly increased apoptosis (p< 0.001 versus vehicle-treated cells, Fig.2 A). Treatment with 15d-PGJ2 or BRL-49653 alone did not significantly increase AGS cell apoptosis (data not shown). However, pre-incubation with either 15d-PGJ2 or BRL-49653 significantly (p ≤ 0.03 for each) inhibited H. pylori-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, and this reduction was not found following exposure to PGA1(Fig. 2 A). To more completely confirm the role of PPARγ activation, we attempted to reverse these events by using the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (50Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Pre-incubation with GW9662 partially reversed the suppressive effects of 15d-PGJ2 and BRL-49653 (Fig.2 B), providing further evidence that specific activation of PPARγ inhibits the ability of H. pylori to stimulate apoptosis in AGS cells. Apoptosis levels within inflamed tissue have been shown to vary depending upon H. pylori strain characteristics (i.e. cagA) (8Peek Jr., R.M. Moss S.F. Tham K.T. Perez-Perez G.I. Wang S. Miller G.G.

Karameris A. Raptis S. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1999; 44: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine whether attenuation of apoptosis by PPARγ activation was affected by strain variation, we measured AGS cell apoptosis during co-culture with a panel of cagA + orcagA − isolates in the absence or presence of BRL-49653. Apoptosis was induced by all strains, although absolute levels varied between different isolates (Fig.3). Specifically,cagA + strains induced higher levels of nucleosomal release than cagA − strains, which is consistent with previous reports (23Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. Mays D.J. Forsyth M.H. Cover T.L. Song S.Y. Krishna U. Pietenpol J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6124-6131PubMed Google Scholar). However, BRL-49653 decreasedH. pylori-induced apoptosis in all samples, albeit to varying degrees, indicating that the ability of PPARγ to attenuate apoptosis is likely not related to the presence of cagA in the infecting isolate. NF-κB is a transcription factor for which activation is tightly controlled by inhibitory IκB pro"

The enzyme has been used in the determination of serum cholesterol and in the clinical diagnosis of arteriosclerosis and other lipid disorders. In addition, it has been shown to be a potent larvicide (1Corbin D.R. Greenplate J.T. Wong E.Y. Purcell J.P. Appl. Environ.

Greenplate J.T. Purcell J.P. Hortscience. 1998; 33: 614-617Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, cholesterol oxidase is an example of a soluble enzyme that interacts with a lipid bilayer to bind an insoluble substrate. Structural and biochemical studies on the enzyme containing the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)1 cofactor non-covalently bound to the protein have revealed the region of the enzyme involved in interaction with the lipid bilayer and have led to a possible mechanism for membrane interaction (5Ghoshroy K.B.

In Brevibacterium sterolicum, cholesterol oxidase has been found to exist in two forms, one in which the FAD cofactor is non-covalently bound to the enzyme (BCO1) and one in which the cofactor is covalently linked (BCO2). Although these enzymes share the same catalytic activity they show no sequence homology. Comparisons of these two forms of cholesterol oxidase reveal large differences in redox potential and kinetic properties suggesting different mechanisms (8Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These studies support the hypothesis that there are significant structural differences between the two enzyme forms, correlated with changes in biochemical properties. Here we report the structure of BCO2 refined to 1.7-Å resolution. The structure reveals features of the enzyme that support previously proposed models of both substrate binding and catalysis. Furthermore, specific active site residues can now be implicated in the mechanisms for oxidation, isomerization, and for the oxidative half-reaction of the enzyme. Pure recombinant BCO2 was obtained from Roche Molecular Diagnostics. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion as described previously (9Croteau N. Vrielink A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell dimension a = 77.44 Å,b = 124.47 Å, c = 80.84 Å, and β = 109.2° and contain 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. Prior to data collection the crystals were briefly soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing 20% ethanediol. Data for the low resolution native crystal and the mercurial derivatives were collected on a MAR image plate detector with a double focussing mirror system (Supper, Ltd.) mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode x-ray generator. The high-resolution native data were collected at 0.979 Å on beamline X8-C (NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York). The x-ray images were processed using the HKL suite of software (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology.

Open table in a new tab Data collection The structure was solved by the method of single isomorphous replacement using a mercurial derivative (HgCl2). Two different soak concentrations of the heavy atom solution were used giving slightly different phase information (see Tables I and II). Heavy atom refinement was carried out using the program MLPHARE. The initial phases from heavy atom refinement of two mercurial sites were significantly improved by solvent flipping using SOLOMON (12Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). A partial model was built for each protomer in the asymmetric unit and used to determine the non-crystallographic symmetry matrices. The program DM was used to further improve the phases by 2-fold averaging, solvent flattening, and histogram matching. The improved quality of the electron density map enabled a more complete model to be built. The model phases were gradually combined with the MIR phases using SIGMAA and the resulting maps used to complete building of the model. Model building was performed with O (13Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and refinement carried out with CNS (14Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

SIGMAA weighted maps calculated with coefficients 3F o − 2F c and F o −F c were used for the model rebuilds. In the final stages of refinement 2F o − F cmaps were used. Water molecules were built where difference electron density above 3ς was observed and where hydrogen bond contacts were made to other polar atoms. As the refinement neared completion, difference electron density maps indicated the presence of 12 molecules of ethanediol, 3 Mn2+ ions, and 1 cacodylate molecule. In the final stages of refinement the NCS constraints were removed and multiple conformations for the side chains of 46 residues as well as one ethanediol molecule located in the active site were included. A surface exposed loop in each protomer was not included in the final model since the density was not sufficiently well defined. Superposition of identical α-carbon positions for the two molecules results in an r.m.s. difference of 0.27 Å indicating that the two subunits are structurally identical. The Ramachandran plot indicates that all residues lie in allowed regions of ϕ/ψ space (15Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J.

Open table in a new tab Cholesterol oxidase (BCO2) from B. sterolicum containing FAD covalently attached to the protein is a monomeric enzyme of 613 amino acid residues. The full-length enzyme contains a hydrophobic presequence of 52 residues, the function of which is currently not known. The protein is cleaved after residue 52 to give the 62-kDa mature form of the enzyme. The structure for the mature enzyme has been determined by the method of single isomorphous replacement and refined to 1.7-Å resolution. The structure is composed of 12 α-helices and 17 β-strands and can be subdivided into two functionally distinct domains: an FAD-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain (Fig.1). Although BCO2 carries out an identical catalytic reaction to that of BCO1, the structural folds for the two enzymes are vastly different. In particular, the nucleotide binding fold commonly seen in the FAD-binding domain is not present in BCO2; rather it adopts a fold seen in the structures of vanillyl alcohol oxidase (VAO) (17Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), murB (18Benson T.E. Filman D.J.

Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8884-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and p-cresol methylhydroxylase (20Mathews F.S. Chen Z.-W. Bellamy H.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This fold has recently been described as a new family of structurally related oxidoreductases (21Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The r.m.s. deviation for 140 α-carbon atoms within the FAD-binding domain between VAO and BCO2 is 1.7 Å. Although BCO2 was not originally included in this family of enzymes due to the lack of sequence homology, the observed structure homology indicates that it is also a member of this new oxidoreductase family. The substrate-binding domain (residues 275–565) is comprised of an 8-stranded mixed β-pleated sheet and 6 α-helices. This domain is positioned over the isoalloxazine ring system of the FAD cofactor and forms the roof of the active site cavity. The motif for this domain is also observed in the structures of VAO andp-cresol methylhydroxylase although there is no significant sequence homology between these enzymes and BCO2. Superposition of 94 α-carbon atoms within the substrate-binding domains of BCO2 and VAO results in an r.m.s. deviation of 2.1 Å. The FAD is deeply buried in the protein structure and is involved in extensive contacts mainly with the FAD-binding domain. The pyrophosphate group is involved in hydrogen bond contacts with main chain atoms of the loop between Gly118 and Gly122. A similar type of interaction has also been observed in the structure of VAO and this loop region has been defined as the PP loop (17Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The cofactor is linked to the protein through a covalent bond between ND1 of the imidazole side chain of His121 (a residue in the PP loop) and the 8-methyl group of the isoalloxazine ring (Fig.2). The histidine side chain approaches the isoalloxazine ring from the si face of the flavin unlike VAO where the covalent histidine originates in the substrate-binding domain and approaches the flavin moiety from there face. Therefore, in BCO2, the PP loop appears to play a critical role in positioning the cofactor correctly within the structure of the enzyme through two factors: the covalent linkage to the isoalloxazine ring and the hydrogen bond interactions with the pyrophosphate moiety. A number of flavoenzymes have been found to contain a covalent linkage between the cofactor and the protein (reviewed by Mewies et al (22Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)). The structures of covalently modified flavoenzymes that have been determined include VAO (17Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), where the covalent linkage is through ND2 of a histidine residue and p-cresol methylhydroxylase (20Mathews F.S. Chen Z.-W. Bellamy H.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) where the linkage is through a tyrosine residue. BCO2 represents the first structure within this family where the protein-flavin linkage is through the ND1 atom of a histidine residue and from the re face of the isoalloxazine ring system. The active site of BCO2 consists of a cavity (with a volume of 450 Å3) bounded on one side by the β-pleated sheet in the substrate-binding domain and, on the opposite side, by the isoalloxazine ring of the cofactor. Two loops in the substrate-binding domain (between β12 and α5 and between α7 and β14) exhibit higher than average temperature factors suggesting a possible entrance for cholesterol to the active site (Fig.3 a). The residues lining the cavity near the pyrimidine moiety of the cofactor are highly hydrophilic and include Arg477, Glu475, Glu551, Glu432, Glu311, Asn516, and Lys554 (Fig. 3 b). The charged nature of this region of the active site is in sharp contrast to that seen in the structure of BCO1 and it is precisely these differences that are likely to play an important role in the reactivity of the flavin cofactor. The region near to the dimethylbenzene ring of the cofactor consists mainly of hydrophobic residues. An extension away from the main cavity and lined by hydrophobic residues is also observed. Three side chains in the active site: Arg477, Glu475, and Ile423 adopt two distinct conformations (Fig. 4). Their movements appear to be coordinated with each other and with alternate positions of two water molecules and one ethanediol in the active site. In one conformation, the guanidinium group of Arg477 is within hydrogen bonding distance from O-4 of the isoalloxazine ring and the hydroxyl O-2 of ethanediol (Fig. 4 b). The second hydroxyl group of ethanediol, O-1, makes contact with N-5 of FAD, and the side chain of Ile423 is directed away from the active site cavity. In the second conformation, the side chain of Arg477 has swung away from the cofactor and contacts the carboxylate group of Glu475 which has also moved away to accommodate the arginine side chain (Fig. 4 a). Two water molecules occupy the original position of Arg477 near O-4 of the cofactor. Furthermore, the ethanediol molecule has adopted an alternate conformation such that O-2 interacts with one of the new water molecule positions and O-1 interacts with the newly positioned Arg477. This alternate conformation of ethanediol results in a repositioning of side chain of Ile423, toward the active site cavity. When Glu475/Arg477/Ile432 adopts the second conformation away from O-4 of the cofactor, a narrow channel extends from the bulk solvent to the substrate cavity and the isoalloxazine ring of the cofactor (Fig. 4 c). This channel, positioned between β11 of the substrate-binding domain and the loop between α3 and β7 from the FAD-binding domain, is lined predominantly by hydrophobic side chains and is filled with a chain of 7 water molecules connected to each other through hydrogen bonds. In contrast, when Glu475/Arg477/Ile432adopt the first conformation the water filled channel is sealed off from the substrate cavity and the cofactor (Fig. 4 d). Both the location and the hydrophobic nature of this channel suggest that it may serve as an entrance for molecular oxygen to the active site during the oxidative half-reaction. A hydrophobic channel has also been observed in the structures of cytochrome c oxidase (23Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar, 24Riistama S. Puustinen A. Garciahorsman A. Iwata S. Michel H. Wikstrom M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bioenerg. 1996; 1275: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Soulimane T. Buse G. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Than M.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1766-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and the role of this channel as the oxygen pathway into the heme-copper site for O-2 reduction has been further supported by mutagenesis and kinetic studies (26Riistama S. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6365-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, in flavoenzyme oxidases, where molecular oxygen is used to reoxidize the reduced flavin, such an oxygen channel has not previously been observed. In the structure of BCO2, control of oxygen access would be modulated by the position of Arg477 which acts as a “gate” adopting an open conformation (Fig. 4, a and c) or a closed conformation (Fig. 4, b and d). Thus the side chain of Arg477 appears to control the entrance of oxygen to the active site in order for the oxidative half-reaction to proceed. The structure further suggests that the position of the gate may be controlled by the presence or absence of the steroid substrate. It has recently been noted that the reaction of reduced BCO2 with dioxygen exhibits a peculiar behavior different from that of other flavoprotein oxidases (8Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Specifically, the reaction of free, reduced BCO2 with molecular oxygen is biphasic; the first phase is fast and sensitive to oxygen concentration and the second phase is slower and insensitive to oxygen concentration. This behavior was proposed to reflect a reversible conversion of two species having substantially different oxygen reactivity. The alternate positions of the side chain of Arg477 and the role of this residue in gating oxygen access provides a rationale for the observed kinetic behavior. The fast phase may reflect the reaction of oxygen with the reduced cofactor through the channel in the “gate open” conformation. The slow phase would then correspond to the case in which oxygen access to the reduced flavin and reaction has to await a rate-limiting conformational change resulting in the opening of the gate. Clearly further mutagenesis and kinetic analysis would need to be carried out in order to confirm the role of Arg477 in controlling access of oxygen to the reduced flavin. Kinetic comparisons of the two forms of cholesterol oxidase (BCO1 and BCO2) reveal significant differences in cholesterol binding (8Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The structural differences observed between these two enzyme forms can be correlated to these observed kinetic differences. In the structures of the BCO1 (27Vrielink A. Lloyd L.F. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 28Vrielink A. Li J. Brick P. Blow D.M. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Water de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1994: 175-184Google Scholar, 29Yue Q.K. Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Vrielink A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4277-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) the substrate-binding site consists of a cavity, situated on there face of the isoalloxazine ring, that houses only the four-ring system of cholesterol. The terpene chain extending from C-17 of the steroid D ring is not accommodated in the buried pocket; rather it is presumed to interact with a series of hydrophobic loops at the surface of the molecule. The structure of BCO2 also contains a large cavity that houses the four-ring system of the steroid substrate (Fig.3 a). However, a further extension from this cavity is of the appropriate size and dimension to bind the terpene portion of the substrate (the volume of cholesterol is 327 Å3 based on van der Waals surface). Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of this extension makes it ideal for van der Waals interactions with the terpene moiety. A model of the cholesterol bound complex is shown in Fig. 3 cand clearly reveals the terpene-binding site. The interactions between the terpene moiety and the residues lining the extension can be correlated with a 10-fold increase in binding affinity observed for cholesterol in the case of the covalent form of the enzyme as compared with the non-covalent form (8Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Comparisons of binding affinities of other steroid substrates that do not have a hydrophobic extension at C-17 of the steroid nucleus reveal significantly lowerK m values than that observed for cholesterol. Interestingly these steroids bind to the non-covalent form of the enzyme with higher affinities than to the covalent enzyme. Further analysis of the modeled cholesterol-bound complex reveals that the best fit occurs when the arginine is in the “gate closed” conformation. This places C-3 and the hydroxyl group of the steroid substrate near to N-5 and O-4, respectively, of the cofactor. Furthermore, the steroid hydroxyl group is within hydrogen bonding distance from the guanidinium side chain of Arg477. In the dehydrogenation reaction, a hydride is transferred from C-3 of the steroid substrate to N-5 of the cofactor resulting in the anionic form of reduced flavin, FADH−. The gate closed conformation places the arginine side chain in a position where it can stabilize the negative charge on the pyrimidine moiety of the cofactor. In addition, concomitant with hydride transfer, a proton is abstracted from the C3-OH of the steroid. In the gate closed conformation, the carboxylate side chain of Glu475 lies 3.3 Å from the modeled steroid C3-OH suggesting it may function as the base for proton abstraction. Since Glu475 is also the proposed base for the isomerization step (see below), the proton abstracted during oxidation must be shuttled to another active site residue. The likely candidate for this proton shuttle would be Glu311, which lies 2.6 Å from Glu475 (Fig. 4 a) and is held in position by interactions with Tyr422 and Lys324. Furthermore, Glu311 lies near to the gated entrance for molecular oxygen. In the gate open conformation, the carboxylate of Glu311 hydrogen bonds to the guanidinium side chain of Arg477 (Fig. 4 b) suggesting that, upon opening of the gate, the Arg477-Glu311 interaction may facilitate proton transfer to the incoming oxygen molecule during the oxidative half-reaction. In addition to oxidation, cholesterol oxidase also carries out an isomerization reaction, shifting the double bond from Δ5to Δ4 of the steroid intermediate. In BCO1 structural (6Li J. Vrielink A. Brick P. Blow D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11507-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,29Yue Q.K. Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Vrielink A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4277-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and mutagenesis and kinetic studies (30Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Bioorg. Medi. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2663-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have indicated that a single glutamate residue (Glu361) functions as the acid/base in proton abstraction from C-4 and reprotonation at C-6 of the steroid. The steroid bound model for BCO2 also reveals a glutamate (Glu475) near to the isomerization center. The position of Glu475 and the alternate conformations observed suggest that it may function in an identical fashion to Glu361 in BCO1. In the gate closed conformation, the carboxylate moiety of Glu475 lies near to C-4 of the steroid A ring, well positioned for proton abstraction. Upon rearrangement of the Arg-Glu pair to the gate open conformation the glutamate carboxylate moves closer to C-6 where reprotonation would occur. In addition, the gate open conformation of Glu475 results in an unfavorable interaction with the C-19 methyl group of the steroid, thus destabilizing the binding of the steroid and promoting product release. Finally, the release of the product and the opening of the gate would enable the binding of oxygen in proximity to C4a of the cofactor where reduction to peroxide is known to occur. Such a sequence of events is consistent with the observed ping-pong mechanism for BCO2 (8Pollegioni L. Wels G. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the structure of BCO2 adopts a different fold from that seen for BCO1. These differences reveal a number of novel features that can be correlated with observed differences in kinetic features between the two enzyme forms. In particular, the structure of BCO2 reveals a substrate-binding site that is able to house an entire cholesterol molecule including the terpene moiety. Furthermore, this structure supports kinetic data used to propose a mechanism for BCO2 catalysis and identifies specific residues important for each of the catalytic events. The structure provides us with a unique view of how molecular oxygen may access the active site of a flavoenzyme and how side chain mobility may control this access during the oxidative half-reaction.

Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). For apoptosis to effectively occur, survival pathways must be inhibited or fail to be activated. In this regard, Akt (also termed protein kinase B or PKB) has been found to be cleaved in a caspase-dependent manner during Jurkat cell apoptosis mediated by Fas ligation, UV irradiation, or etoposide (ETOP)1 (3Widmann C.

Furthermore, the inhibition of Akt signaling can induce apoptosis in some human cancer cell lines (16Yuan Z.Q. Sun M. Feldman R.I. Wang G. Ma X. Jiang C. Coppola D. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q.

Leukemia. 2000; 14: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Importantly, it also seems that Akt signaling can affect the response to chemotherapeutic agents. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation is seen with topotecan, and the re-expression of phosphorylated Akt renders human lung cancer cells less sensitive to topotecan treatment (21Nakashio A. Fujita N. Rokudai S. Sato S. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5303-5309PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, ovarian cancer cells overexpressing constitutively activated Akt are resistant to paclitaxel (22Page C. Lin H.J. Jin Y. Castle V.P. Nunez G. Huang M. Lin J. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 407-416PubMed Google Scholar).The observation that cleavage of Akt occurs during apoptosis (3Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) suggests that either a level of baseline Akt signaling is vital for cell survival or that Akt activation occurs during apoptosis and acts as a “brake” on the process. Consequently, we have studied the behavior of Akt during apoptosis and indeed find activation of Akt and show that this has functional importance.DISCUSSIONProliferation and death (apoptosis) are two sides of the same coin. Although their functions are opposed, they are tightly connected. Deregulation of the oncogenes myc,ElA, or E2F drives cell cycle progression but may also promote apoptosis in certain conditions (36Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The mitotic and proapoptotic properties of c-myc require intact N-terminal transcriptional, DNA binding, and dimerization domains (37Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar,38Amati B. Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Land H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5083-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). However, transcription-defective c-mycS is also capable of promoting apoptosis as well as retaining the ability to promote cell proliferation (39Xiao Q. Claassen G. Shi J. Adachi S. Sedivy J. Hann S.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3803-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The functions of E1A in promoting proliferation and apoptosis are also linked and were both mapped to the N-terminal region that is involved in binding pocket proteins such as Rb (retinoblastoma protein), which is essential in the regulation of cell cycle progression (36Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 40Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Devoto S.H. Kraus V.B. Moran E. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1200-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mutations in E2F that prevent binding to Rb accelerate both cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis (41Shan B. Durfee T. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Conversely, apoptotic stimuli may activate counterbalancing survival functions. The binding of TNFα to TNF receptor-1 activates caspase-8 and NF-κB in a TNF receptor-associated death domain protein-dependent manner (42Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 43Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB strongly protects cells from both TNFα-induced apoptosis and apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents (44Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 45Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar). ETOP activates NF-κB in HT1080I cells, and such activation modulates apoptosis, apparently through the induction of a Bcl-2-like protein, A128. Consequently, it seems that cells can initiate a counter-reaction for proliferation by utilizing apoptosis and vice versa when appropriate signal pathways are activated. Balancing proliferation and apoptosis might be a fail-safe mechanism for cells to prevent either excessive proliferation or apoptosis. Therefore, an outcome of survival or death may depend on signal strength and context in response to an apoptotic stimulus.Besides NF-κB, another major survival factor impacting the apoptotic core machinery is protein kinase B/Akt. In contrast to NF-κB, the activation of Akt in response to apoptotic stimuli has not been reported. This study examines the role of the Akt/protein kinase B pathway in cellular apoptosis induced by two diverse mitochondrial apoptotic stimuli: the potent protein kinase inhibitor (STS) and the DNA damage reagent (ETOP). These agents were chosen because overexpression of Akt has been demonstrated to impair apoptosis induced by either STS (46Goswami R. Kilkus J. Dawson S.A. Dawson G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or ETOP (10Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In response to STS and ETOP, Akt was activated. Although Akt activation occurs early after stimulation, 8 h for STS and 2 h for ETOP, large scale apoptosis begins after 8 h. This is consistent with the theme that the apoptotic machinery has to overcome survival functions to execute cells and is supported by and consistent with reports of late Akt cleavage in certain apoptotic settings (3Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). More importantly, we have demonstrated that this activation has a functional importance in that it delays and diminishes PARP cleavage and apoptosis (Figs. 3 and 4).The PI3K/Akt pathway promotes cell survival through a number of mechanisms. Antiapoptotic signals mediated through this pathway include the inactivation of Bad (8Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar) and caspase-9 (9Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar) and the stimulation of NF-κB activity (10Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 11Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S.

Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). Akt-mediated inhibition of apoptosis seems to occur at a postmitochondrial level, given that Akt overexpression can prevent apoptosis initiated by the microinjection of cytochrome c (47Zhou H. Li X.M. Meinkoth J. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 48Rytomaa M. Lehmann K. Downward J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), although others have found that Akt prevents the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (34Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). We find that Akt activation by STS occurs upstream of mitochondria,i.e. outside of apoptotic core machinery, in that it is not prevented by either caspase inhibition (Fig. 5 A) or Bcl-2/Bcl-xL overexpression (Fig. 6 B). Consequently, we would not expect that all mitochondrial apoptotic signals activate Akt. This is consistent with our observation that no Akt activation is detected in NIH 3T3 cells treated with either UV or ionizing radiation (data not shown) and reflects observations of NF-κB activation in the death receptor apoptotic pathway. Except for the clear protective role of NF-κB activation in TNFα induced apoptosis, its role in other death receptor-induced apoptosis is not clear.These data have implications for cellular transformation. A large and growing number of human tumors are associated with PI3K/Akt amplification or activation including cervical (49Ma Y.Y. Wei S.J. Lin Y.C. Lung J.C. Chang T.C. Whang-Peng J. Liu J.M.

The data presented here add one more potential indication of the importance of Akt activity in tumor progression. Therapy-resistant cancers arising after radiotherapy or chemotherapy present major problems in cancer therapy. Chemotherapeutic agents like ETOP target the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway to execute tumor cells. The ability of ETOP to also activate Akt might lead to the emergence of cancers resistant to therapy. In this regard, overexpression of Akt in ovarian cancer cells led to paclitaxel resistance, which is associated with Bad inactivation and a failure of apoptosis (22Page C. Lin H.J. Jin Y. Castle V.P. Nunez G. Huang M. Lin J. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 407-416PubMed Google Scholar), and the overexpression in lung cancer cells resulted in topotecan resistance (21Nakashio A. Fujita N. Rokudai S. Sato S. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5303-5309PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling with wortmannin enhanced pancreatic carcinoma cell sensitivity to gemcitabine (50Ng S.S.W. Tsao M.S. Chow S. Hedley D.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5451-5455PubMed Google Scholar). If chemotherapy agents such as ETOP induce Akt activity, this is likely to inhibit their desired antitumor effects, particularly in lines in which PI3K/Akt is amplified. The inhibition of Akt activity in these situations might help overcome drug resistance.In view of this, it is important to understand precisely how Akt is activated. Presently, this is not totally clear. Activation requires recruitment to the plasma membrane by ligation of the N-terminal PH-domain to the PI3-kinase products PI 3,4-P2 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. This brings Akt in close proximity to 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK)-1, resulting in the phosphorylation of Thr-308 in the T loop of Akt. Phosphorylation of the Ser-473 in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif is also required for Akt activation, but the putative kinase PDK2 that phosphorylates Ser-473 of Akt has not been clearly identified (30Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). The debate whether PDK1 could also phosphorylate Ser-473 of Akt was settled in the negative by the demonstration of inhibition of phosphorylation of Thr-308 but not Ser-473 in PDK1−/− mouse embryonic stem cells in response to insulin-like growth factor-1 (51Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. Van der K.J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Regardless of the identity of PDK2, our data indicate that STS at 1 µm does not inhibit its activity. Because STS inhibits numerous kinases with IC50 values within the nmor sub-nM range, this finding might offer valuable information for searching this important PDK2.The data presented here indicate that apoptosis-inducing agents including the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide also independently activate PI3K/Akt, and such activation delays apoptosis. Further work will be required to determine the precise mechanism of activation of PI3K/AKt by these agents and the effect of preventing it. Apoptosis is an important cellular response to irreparable damage from exposure to external stimuli or failure to receive survival signals (1Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Common to the process is the activation of caspases, aspartic acid-directed proteases (2Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). For apoptosis to effectively occur, survival pathways must be inhibited or fail to be activated. In this regard, Akt (also termed protein kinase B or PKB) has been found to be cleaved in a caspase-dependent manner during Jurkat cell apoptosis mediated by Fas ligation, UV irradiation, or etoposide (ETOP)1 (3Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Akt is phosphorylated and activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in response to mitogens (especially Ras signaling) and adhesion (4Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 5Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that signaling through PI3K/Akt is necessary for transformation by activated mutant Ras (6Gire V. Marshall C. Wynford-Thomas D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2269-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Akt delivers an antiapoptotic survival signal by several mechanisms including the phosphorylation and inactivation of Bad (8Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar) and caspase-9 (9Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar) as well as stimulation of NF-κB activity through the activation of IKKα (10Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C.

Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that the transforming potential of Akt depends on the protein kinase mTOR (15Aoki M. Blazek E. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been observed in several human cancers including ovarian (16Yuan Z.Q. Sun M. Feldman R.I. Wang G. Ma X. Jiang C. Coppola D. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2324-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), breast (17Page C. Huang M. Jin X. Cho K. Lilja J. Reynolds R.K. Lin J. Int. J.

Furthermore, the inhibition of Akt signaling can induce apoptosis in some human cancer cell lines (16Yuan Z.Q. Sun M. Feldman R.I. Wang G. Ma X. Jiang C. Coppola D. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2324-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 20O'Gorman D.M. McKenna S.L. McGahon A.J. Knox K.A. Cotter T.G. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Importantly, it also seems that Akt signaling can affect the response to chemotherapeutic agents. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation is seen with topotecan, and the re-expression of phosphorylated Akt renders human lung cancer cells less sensitive to topotecan treatment (21Nakashio A. Fujita N. Rokudai S. Sato S. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5303-5309PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, ovarian cancer cells overexpressing constitutively activated Akt are resistant to paclitaxel (22Page C. Lin H.J. Jin Y. Castle V.P. Nunez G. Huang M. Lin J. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 407-416PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that cleavage of Akt occurs during apoptosis (3Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) suggests that either a level of baseline Akt signaling is vital for cell survival or that Akt activation occurs during apoptosis and acts as a “brake” on the process. Consequently, we have studied the behavior of Akt during apoptosis and indeed find activation of Akt and show that this has functional importance. DISCUSSIONProliferation and death (apoptosis) are two sides of the same coin. Although their functions are opposed, they are tightly connected. Deregulation of the oncogenes myc,ElA, or E2F drives cell cycle progression but may also promote apoptosis in certain conditions (36Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The mitotic and proapoptotic properties of c-myc require intact N-terminal transcriptional, DNA binding, and dimerization domains (37Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar,38Amati B. Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Land H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5083-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). However, transcription-defective c-mycS is also capable of promoting apoptosis as well as retaining the ability to promote cell proliferation (39Xiao Q. Claassen G. Shi J. Adachi S. Sedivy J. Hann S.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3803-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The functions of E1A in promoting proliferation and apoptosis are also linked and were both mapped to the N-terminal region that is involved in binding pocket proteins such as Rb (retinoblastoma protein), which is essential in the regulation of cell cycle progression (36Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 40Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Devoto S.H. Kraus V.B. Moran E. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1200-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mutations in E2F that prevent binding to Rb accelerate both cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis (41Shan B. Durfee T. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Conversely, apoptotic stimuli may activate counterbalancing survival functions. The binding of TNFα to TNF receptor-1 activates caspase-8 and NF-κB in a TNF receptor-associated death domain protein-dependent manner (42Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar, 43Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB strongly protects cells from both TNFα-induced apoptosis and apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents (44Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 45Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar). ETOP activates NF-κB in HT1080I cells, and such activation modulates apoptosis, apparently through the induction of a Bcl-2-like protein, A128. Consequently, it seems that cells can initiate a counter-reaction for proliferation by utilizing apoptosis and vice versa when appropriate signal pathways are activated. Balancing proliferation and apoptosis might be a fail-safe mechanism for cells to prevent either excessive proliferation or apoptosis. Therefore, an outcome of survival or death may depend on signal strength and context in response to an apoptotic stimulus.Besides NF-κB, another major survival factor impacting the apoptotic core machinery is protein kinase B/Akt. In contrast to NF-κB, the activation of Akt in response to apoptotic stimuli has not been reported. This study examines the role of the Akt/protein kinase B pathway in cellular apoptosis induced by two diverse mitochondrial apoptotic stimuli: the potent protein kinase inhibitor (STS) and the DNA damage reagent (ETOP). These agents were chosen because overexpression of Akt has been demonstrated to impair apoptosis induced by either STS (46Goswami R. Kilkus J. Dawson S.A. Dawson G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or ETOP (10Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In response to STS and ETOP, Akt was activated. Although Akt activation occurs early after stimulation, 8 h for STS and 2 h for ETOP, large scale apoptosis begins after 8 h. This is consistent with the theme that the apoptotic machinery has to overcome survival functions to execute cells and is supported by and consistent with reports of late Akt cleavage in certain apoptotic settings (3Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). More importantly, we have demonstrated that this activation has a functional importance in that it delays and diminishes PARP cleavage and apoptosis (Figs. 3 and 4).The PI3K/Akt pathway promotes cell survival through a number of mechanisms. Antiapoptotic signals mediated through this pathway include the inactivation of Bad (8Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar) and caspase-9 (9Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar) and the stimulation of NF-κB activity (10Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 11Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar, 12Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). Akt-mediated inhibition of apoptosis seems to occur at a postmitochondrial level, given that Akt overexpression can prevent apoptosis initiated by the microinjection of cytochrome c (47Zhou H. Li X.M. Meinkoth J. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 48Rytomaa M. Lehmann K. Downward J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), although others have found that Akt prevents the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (34Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). We find that Akt activation by STS occurs upstream of mitochondria,i.e. outside of apoptotic core machinery, in that it is not prevented by either caspase inhibition (Fig. 5 A) or Bcl-2/Bcl-xL overexpression (Fig. 6 B). Consequently, we would not expect that all mitochondrial apoptotic signals activate Akt. This is consistent with our observation that no Akt activation is detected in NIH 3T3 cells treated with either UV or ionizing radiation (data not shown) and reflects observations of NF-κB activation in the death receptor apoptotic pathway. Except for the clear protective role of NF-κB activation in TNFα induced apoptosis, its role in other death receptor-induced apoptosis is not clear.These data have implications for cellular transformation. A large and growing number of human tumors are associated with PI3K/Akt amplification or activation including cervical (49Ma Y.Y. Wei S.J. Lin Y.C. Lung J.C. Chang T.C. Whang-Peng J. Liu J.M.

This is consistent with the theme that the apoptotic machinery has to overcome survival functions to execute cells and is supported by and consistent with reports of late Akt cleavage in certain apoptotic settings (3Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). More importantly, we have demonstrated that this activation has a functional importance in that it delays and diminishes PARP cleavage and apoptosis (Figs. 3 and 4). The PI3K/Akt pathway promotes cell survival through a number of mechanisms. Antiapoptotic signals mediated through this pathway include the inactivation of Bad (8Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S.

Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). Akt-mediated inhibition of apoptosis seems to occur at a postmitochondrial level, given that Akt overexpression can prevent apoptosis initiated by the microinjection of cytochrome c (47Zhou H. Li X.M. Meinkoth J. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 48Rytomaa M. Lehmann K. Downward J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), although others have found that Akt prevents the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (34Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). We find that Akt activation by STS occurs upstream of mitochondria,i.e. outside of apoptotic core machinery, in that it is not prevented by either caspase inhibition (Fig. 5 A) or Bcl-2/Bcl-xL overexpression (Fig. 6 B). Consequently, we would not expect that all mitochondrial apoptotic signals activate Akt. This is consistent with our observation that no Akt activation is detected in NIH 3T3 cells treated with either UV or ionizing radiation (data not shown) and reflects observations of NF-κB activation in the death receptor apoptotic pathway. Except for the clear protective role of NF-κB activation in TNFα induced apoptosis, its role in other death receptor-induced apoptosis is not clear. These data have implications for cellular transformation. A large and growing number of human tumors are associated with PI3K/Akt amplification or activation including cervical (49Ma Y.Y. Wei S.J.

The data presented here add one more potential indication of the importance of Akt activity in tumor progression. Therapy-resistant cancers arising after radiotherapy or chemotherapy present major problems in cancer therapy. Chemotherapeutic agents like ETOP target the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway to execute tumor cells. The ability of ETOP to also activate Akt might lead to the emergence of cancers resistant to therapy. In this regard, overexpression of Akt in ovarian cancer cells led to paclitaxel resistance, which is associated with Bad inactivation and a failure of apoptosis (22Page C. Lin H.J. Jin Y. Castle V.P. Nunez G. Huang M. Lin J. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 407-416PubMed Google Scholar), and the overexpression in lung cancer cells resulted in topotecan resistance (21Nakashio A. Fujita N. Rokudai S. Sato S. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5303-5309PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling with wortmannin enhanced pancreatic carcinoma cell sensitivity to gemcitabine (50Ng S.S.W. Tsao M.S. Chow S. Hedley D.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5451-5455PubMed Google Scholar). If chemotherapy agents such as ETOP induce Akt activity, this is likely to inhibit their desired antitumor effects, particularly in lines in which PI3K/Akt is amplified. The inhibition of Akt activity in these situations might help overcome drug resistance. In view of this, it is important to understand precisely how Akt is activated. Presently, this is not totally clear. Activation requires recruitment to the plasma membrane by ligation of the N-terminal PH-domain to the PI3-kinase products PI 3,4-P2 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. This brings Akt in close proximity to 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK)-1, resulting in the phosphorylation of Thr-308 in the T loop of Akt. Phosphorylation of the Ser-473 in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif is also required for Akt activation, but the putative kinase PDK2 that phosphorylates Ser-473 of Akt has not been clearly identified (30Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). The debate whether PDK1 could also phosphorylate Ser-473 of Akt was settled in the negative by the demonstration of inhibition of phosphorylation of Thr-308 but not Ser-473 in PDK1−/− mouse embryonic stem cells in response to insulin-like growth factor-1 (51Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. Van der K.J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Regardless of the identity of PDK2, our data indicate that STS at 1 µm does not inhibit its activity. Because STS inhibits numerous kinases with IC50 values within the nmor sub-nM range, this finding might offer valuable information for searching this important PDK2. The data presented here indicate that apoptosis-inducing agents including the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide also independently activate PI3K/Akt, and such activation delays apoptosis. Further work will be required to determine the precise mechanism of activation of PI3K/AKt by these agents and the effect of preventing it."

Furthermore, in addition to its role as the PTS1 receptor, Pex5p is capable of interacting with several other peroxins. Thus, using the two-hybrid system, in vitro binding assays, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Pex5p has been shown to interact with Pex8p (9Rehling P. Skaletz-Rorowski A. Girzalsky W.

Certainly one of the most important questions regarding the function of Pex5p in the PTS1 import process concerns the kind of interactions that this protein establishes with the peroxisome-resident peroxins. Do these interactions occur simultaneously, or are they spaced in time, reflecting the existence of a chain of events? Another point deserving attention concerns the structure of the peroxisome-resident peroxins interacting with Pex5p. Are these peroxins subunits of stable complexes, or are they monomeric proteins interacting only transiently with other components of the peroxisomal import machinery? Not much is known regarding this issue. In this work we addressed these questions using rat liver peroxisomes as a model. After solubilization of peroxisomal proteins with the mild detergent digitonin, the quaternary structures of Pex5p, Pex12p, Pex13p, and Pex14p were assessed using native gel electrophoresis and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis in combination with coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Our results indicate that Pex5p, Pex12p, Pex14p, and Pex2p (17Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) are subunits of the same protein assembly. Pex13p was also found to be a subunit of a high molecular mass complex. Data suggesting that these two complexes may interact with each other on the peroxisomal membrane are presented. The implications of these findings on the mechanism of peroxisomal biogenesis are discussed. Isolation of highly pure peroxisomes from rat liver by differential centrifugation and Nycodenz gradient purification was performed as described (18Hartl F.-U. Just W.W. Koster A. Schimassek H. Arch.

To raise an antibody against human Pex14p, a cDNA encoding amino acids 1–377 was amplified from human skin fibroblast total RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, using the primers 5′-cgcgtcgacatggcgtcctcggagcaggcaga-3′ and 5′-cgcgcccctagtcccgctcactctc-3′ designed according to the published sequence (15Fransen M.

The 1.1-kilobase cDNA fragment was cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The recombinant plasmid was digested with the restriction enzyme SalI, and the insert was cloned in the pGEX-4T-3 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The human Pex14p fused to glutathione S-transferase was expressed in the XL1 strain of Escherichia coli and obtained as inclusion bodies. These were isolated, and the fusion protein was purified by SDS-PAGE and used to immunize rabbits. Rabbit antibodies directed to amino acid residues 40–403 of human Pex13p (Δ39Pex13p; Ref. 19Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Eckerskorn C., Sá- Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Anal.

A monoclonal antibody (clone 7H10-BD4) directed to the α subunit of mitochondrial ATPase was obtained from Molecular Probes. Rabbit and mouse antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies, respectively (Sigma). The purified GST-Pex14p fusion protein was digested with thrombin (Sigma; 1 mg of protease/10 mg of GST-Pex14p) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mmCaCl2 for 2 h at room temperature. The cleaved Pex14p was then repurified by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of protein was determined. The preparation of maltose-binding protein-Δ39Pex13p (19Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E.

These purified fusion proteins were digested with factor Xa (New England Biolabs; 1 mg of protease/100 mg of fusion protein) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. The cleaved Δ39Pex13p and Pex12p proteins were then repurified by SDS-PAGE. Blue native electrophoresis was performed as described (20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Highly pure peroxisomes (200 µg of protein) were solubilized either in buffer A (50 mm BisTris·HCl, pH 7.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 m 6-aminocaproic acid, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and 1:200 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture) or in buffer B (50 mm BisTris·HCl, pH 7.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 m 6-aminocaproic acid, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 50 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.2, 1% (w/v) digitonin, and 1:200 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min at 4 °C. After a clarifying spin (30 min, 135,000 × g), a 1:10 ratio (v/v) of 5% (w/v) Coomassie Blue G-250 in 0.5 m6-aminocaproic acid was added to the samples before electrophoresis. Proteins were resolved on 4–16% polyacrylamide gradient slab gels with a 3% polyacrylamide “stacking” gel, prepared according to Schagger and Von Jagow (20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The cathode buffer contains 15 mm BisTris·HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm Tricine, and 0.02% (w/v) Coomassie Blue G-250. The anode buffer contains 50 mm BisTris·HCl, pH 7.0. The gels were run for 2 h at 150 V and then for 16 h at 350 V at 4 °C. The second dimension was performed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels exactly as described (20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Imunoprecipitations with the anti-Pex14p antibody were performed using immunoglobulins affinity-purified as follows. 5 ml of anti-Pex14p serum diluted with two volumes of phosphate-buffered saline were pumped three times over a 2-ml column containing 10 mg of GST recombinant protein coupled to 500 mg of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The flow-through was then pumped three times over a 2-ml column containing 10 mg of gel-purified recombinant GST-Pex14p fusion protein coupled to 500 mg of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. After washing the column with phosphate-buffered saline (15 bed volumes), the immunoglobins were eluted with 40 mm sodium citrate, 20 mmNaCl, pH 3.0 and neutralized with 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5. The anti-Pex14p affinity-purified immunoglobins were then coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads at a ratio of 100 µg of protein per 5 mg of resin. Control IgGs used in the immunoprecipitation experiments were isolated from a rabbit non-immune serum by chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose column, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified IgGs were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads at a ratio of 100 µg of protein per 5 mg of resin. Soybean trypsin inhibitor coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (100 µg of protein per 5 mg of resin) was also prepared with the purpose of pre-clearing protein lysates before immunoprecipitation experiments (see below). In a typical immunoprecipitation experiment, 4 mg of highly pure peroxisomes were solubilized in 1 ml of buffer A or buffer B (see above) for 30 min at 4 °C and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 135,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a 65.13 angular rotor (Sorvall). The insoluble material was removed, and the supernatant was gently rocked for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of 5 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose. After this pre-clearing step, the supernatant was removed and incubated with 5 mg of Sepharose beads containing either control immunoglobulins or affinity-purified anti-Pex14p immunoglobulins. After incubation of the suspensions for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with 0.5 ml of the corresponding solubilization buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by incubating the beads in 80 µl of Laemmli sample buffer (21Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar) lacking reducing agents for 30 min at 50 °C. Eight µl of 1 mdithiothreitol were added to the eluate before SDS-PAGE analysis. Highly pure peroxisomes (200 µg) were solubilized in 500 µl of buffer B (without glycerol) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 15 min. The resultant supernatant was then applied on the top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (1.9 ml of 10%, 1.8 ml of 15.5%, 1.7 ml of 21%, 1.5 ml of 25%, 1.2 ml of 30%, 1 ml of 35%, and 0.5 ml of 40% (w/v) sucrose in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) digitonin). After centrifugation at 165,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C in a TST41.14 swing-out rotor (Sorvall), 12 fractions of 0.85 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed by Western blotting, using antibodies directed to Pex5p, Pex12p, Pex13p, and Pex14p. In a typical experiment, 50 mg of purified peroxisomes were solubilized in 8.4 ml of buffer B for 30 min at 4 °C and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 135,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a 65.13 angular rotor (Sorvall). The insoluble material was discarded. The supernatant was mixed with 5.6 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate solution (pH 7.0 with NH4OH), incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet obtained was then solubilized in 3.5 ml of buffer B, incubated on ice during 30 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. To the resultant supernatant, 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 in a buffer containing 50 mm BisTris·HCl, pH 7.0 and 0.1 m potassium acetate, pH 7.2 was added to give a final concentration of 12% (w/v). This sample was incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet obtained (enriched in Pex13p) was solubilized in 500 µl of buffer B (without glycerol) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 15 min. The resultant supernatant was then applied on the top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described above. The Pex13p-enriched fractions (fractions 3 and 4) were pooled. Fifty µl (bed volume) of DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in buffer C (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) digitonin, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1:200 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture) containing 25 mm NaCl were added to this fraction. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with occasional shaking, the DEAE-Sepharose beads were washed with 1 ml of buffer C containing 25 mm NaCl. The protein was then successively eluted with 200 µl of 100, 150, 200, 350, and 500 mm NaCl in buffer C. Pex13p was recovered in the 150 mm NaCl elution step, as revealed by immunoblot analysis using the anti-Pex13p antibody. In a typical experiment, 12 µg of this Pex13p-enriched material were obtained by this procedure. To proceed with the BN-PAGE analysis, an aliquot of 50 µl of the Pex13p-enriched fraction was first dialyzed against 50 ml of buffer B with only 0.1% (w/v) digitonin. Total RNA from human fibroblasts was isolated using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was done using the TitanTM one tube reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction system essentially as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were measured by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as standard, as described (21Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed in 1.0-mm-thick 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Silver staining of polyacrylamide gels was performed as described (23Merril C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Western blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Densitometric analysis of immunoblots and silver-stained gels was carried out using the LKB BROMMA densitometer. MALDI-MS of tryptic fragments of Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands in SDS-PAGE gels was performed by HHMI/Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (New Haven, CT). The molecular mass markers used to calibrate the BN-PAGE gels and the sucrose density gradients were as follows: bovine albumin (66 kDa), rat liver catalase (240 kDa), and rat liver mitochondrial complex V (detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody directed to the α subunit of the mitochondrial ATPase). Digitonin-solubilized complex V from mammals displays an apparent molecular mass of 750 kDa when analyzed by BN-PAGE (24Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The molecular mass markers used in the SDS-PAGE analysis were as follows: soybean trypsin inhibitor (21 kDa), bovine carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), hen egg white ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and rabbit muscle phosphorylase b (97 kDa). Pex12p (25Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Moser H. Wanders R.J. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell.

As a first step to characterize these peroxins in rat liver, we tried to estimate their amounts in nanograms per microgram of total peroxisomal protein. For this purpose, highly pure rat liver peroxisomes and known amounts of recombinant human Pex12p, Δ39Pex13p, and Pex14p were analyzed by Western blotting using the corresponding antibodies (Fig. 1). Densitometric analysis of these blots allowed us to estimate that Pex12p, Pex13p, and Pex14p correspond to 0.06, 0.08, and 0.25% of total peroxisomal protein, respectively. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that these values are underestimated (human recombinant proteins and anti-human peroxin sera were used to infer the peroxisomal levels of rat peroxins), this does not seem to be the case (see below in this section). As a matter of fact, at least for Pex13p, the estimated percentage should be very close to the real value. Indeed, using an independent approach we have shown previously that rat liver Pex13p represents not more than 0.1% of total peroxisomal protein (19Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Eckerskorn C., Sá- Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The peroxisomal pool of rat liver Pex5p comprises 0.06% of total peroxisomal protein (8Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E., Sá- Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32444-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, the relative stoichiometries of all these peroxins in the peroxisomal membrane can now be derived. Using the theoretical molecular masses of rat Pex12p (25Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A.

Hirono Y. Otera H. Ghaedi K. Tateishi K. Tamura S. Okumoto K. Harano T. Mukai S. Fujiki Y. J. Biol.

Van Veldhoven P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7731-7736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and Pex13p (13Gould S.J. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. Bjorkman J. Urquhart A.J. Crane D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (the rat Pex5p and Pex13p sequences are not yet available), a molar ratio of 1:1.7:2.1:7.2 was obtained for Pex5p, Pex12p, Pex13p, and Pex14p, respectively. In a previous study, we were able to show that virtually all Pex5p present in rat liver peroxisomes is part of a 250-kDa protein assembly comprising Pex14p (8Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E., Sá- Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32444-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). No other Pex5p-interacting peroxin was found in this complex. One possible explanation for this result could be related to the fact that high concentrations of Nonidet P-40 and sodium deoxycholate were used in those experiments; although these conditions resulted in a high purification factor and good yield of the Pex5p-Pex14p complex, the possibility that some components of the Pex5p-containing complex were lost during the solubilization step cannot be excluded. Thus, we readdressed this issue, but this time using the mild detergent digitonin. An analysis with our previously used solubilization conditions was also performed as a control. Rat liver peroxisomes were solubilized either with a mixture of Nonidet P-40 and sodium deoxycholate or with digitonin alone. The solubilized proteins were then resolved by blue native gel electrophoresis (20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) followed by a second dimension on SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, when Nonidet P-40 and sodium deoxycholate were used in this experiment, Pex5p migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa, as described previously (8Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E., Sá- Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32444-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This observation can now be extended to rat liver Pex14p; virtually all Pex14p displayed an apparent molecular mass of about 250 kDa. In sharp contrast, both Pex12p and Pex13p migrated mainly as monomeric proteins under these conditions. When rat liver peroxisomes were solubilized with digitonin and subjected to the procedure described above, quite different results were obtained for all the peroxins analyzed. Comigration of Pex5p and Pex14p was still observed (Fig. 2 A). However, the apparent molecular mass of these two proteins was now much higher, above the 750-kDa value of the biggest marker used to calibrate the first dimension gel. Pex12p displayed a dual behavior. A fraction of this peroxin comigrated with Pex5p and Pex14p; the remaining fraction of Pex12p displayed an apparent molecular mass of about 200 kDa (Fig. 2 A). Slightly different relative distributions of Pex12p between these two complexes were observed in independent experiments (data not shown). This finding, together with the fact that a smear of Pex12p connecting the two peaks was always observed in these gels, suggests that the 200-kDa complex represents a breakdown product of the higher Pex12p-containing complex (see also below). Pex13p was also a subunit of a large protein complex (Fig.2 A). The size of the Pex13p-containing complex was similar to the Pex5p-Pex14p-containing complex. However, although there was a significant overlapping between the patterns obtained for these three peroxins, the peak corresponding to Pex13p was slightly shifted toward the higher molecular mass region of the first dimension gel. The behaviors of Pex5p, Pex12p, Pex13p, and Pex14p were also analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation after solubilization of rat liver peroxisomes with digitonin. As shown in Fig.3, Pex5p, Pex14p, and the majority of Pex12p displayed the same sedimentation profile; the three proteins were found in the 400-kDa region of the gradient (lanes 8and 9). In contrast with the results obtained by BN-PAGE, no Pex12p was detected in the 200-kDa region of the sucrose gradient. Instead, a small pool of this peroxin was detected as a monomeric protein (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). Pex13p displayed a heterogeneous behavior. The majority of Pex13p was found in the region of the sucrose gradient corresponding to an approximate molecular mass of 600–700 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 10). However, a smear toward lower molecular mass regions (i.e. 100 kDa; Fig. 3, lane 5) was also observed. There are obvious differences in the behaviors of the peroxins analyzed in these experiments when the results obtained using BN-PAGE and sucrose gradient sedimentation are compared. For example, digitonin-solubilized Pex5p displayed an apparent molecular mass of 400 kDa upon sucrose gradient centrifugation but seemed to be part of a complex with a molecular mass above 750 kDa when BN-PAGE was used. The reasons for these differences are not known at the moment. However, it should be emphasized that BN-PAGE can be used to infer the molecular mass of membrane proteins only when at least one of the two following conditions is fulfilled. 1) The proteins under study bind Coomassie Blue G250, and their pI values are below 8.6; or 2) the proteins have pI values of 5.4 or below (27Schagger H.

https://openalex.org/W2007472609,"Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified two genes, STE24 andRCE1, involved in cleaving the three carboxyl-terminal amino acids from isoprenylated proteins that terminate with a CAAX sequence motif. Ste24p cleaves the carboxyl-terminal “-AAX” from the yeast mating pheromone a-factor, whereas Rce1p cleaves the -AAX from both a-factor and Ras2p. Ste24p also cleaves the amino terminus of a-factor. The mouse genome contains orthologues for both yeast RCE1 and STE24. We previously demonstrated, with a gene-knockout experiment, that mouseRce1 is essential for development and that Rce1 is entirely responsible for the carboxyl-terminal proteolytic processing of the mouse Ras proteins. In this study, we cloned mouseZmpste24, the orthologue for yeast STE24 and showed that it could promote a-factor production when expressed in yeast. Then, to assess the importance ofZmpste24 in development, we generatedZmpste24-deficient mice. Unlike the Rce1knockout mice, Zmpste24-deficient mice survived development and were fertile. Since no natural substrates for mammalian Zmpste24 have been identified, yeast a-factor was used as a surrogate substrate to investigate the biochemical activities in membranes from the cells and tissues of Zmpste24-deficient mice. We demonstrate that Zmpste24-deficient mouse membranes, like Ste24p-deficient yeast membranes, have diminished CAAXproteolytic activity and lack the ability to cleave the amino terminus of the a-factor precursor. Thus, both enzymatic activities of yeast Ste24p are conserved in mouse Zmpste24, but these enzymatic activities are not essential for mouse development or for fertility.

Academic Press, San Diego2000: 155-213Google Scholar). The yeast genes responsible for the farnesylation and methylation steps were identified more than a decade ago (3Powers S. Michaelis S. Broek D.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), but the identification of the genes responsible for the middle processing step, the endoprotease step, remained elusive for years (2Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clarke S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 155-213Google Scholar). Ultimately, however, Boyartchuk and co-workers (5Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) applied a novel genetic selection scheme and identified two yeast genes, RCE1 and STE24(AFC1), involved in the carboxyl-terminal endoproteolytic processing of isoprenylated CAAX proteins. Rce1p is a protease involved in the carboxyl-terminal processing of botha-factor and the yeast Ras protein, Ras2p. Ste24p (Afc1p), a zinc metalloprotease, lacked activity against Ras2p but did processa-factor. Haploid MATa yeast lacking bothRCE1 and STE24 (ste24Δrce1Δ) grew normally but were unable to produce mature a-factor and therefore were sterile (5Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rce1p and Ste24p exhibited subtle differences in substrate specificities (5Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 6Boyartchuk V.L. Rine J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar, 7Trueblood C.E. Boyartchuk V.L. Picologlou E.A. Rozema D. Poulter C.D. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4381-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Both proteins were capable of cleaving the carboxyl terminus of wild-typea-factor, which terminates in CVIA. However, only Ste24p processed an a-factor mutant terminating in CAMQ, and only Rce1p processed an a-factor mutant terminating in CTLM. 2CAMQ is the CAAX sequence in the α-subunit of rabbit muscle phosphorylase kinase; CTLM is theCAAX sequence in yeast Ste18p. 2CAMQ is the CAAX sequence in the α-subunit of rabbit muscle phosphorylase kinase; CTLM is theCAAX sequence in yeast Ste18p. The identification of Ste24p as a CAAX endoprotease was initially surprising because Ste24p had also been described as a protease that cleaves the amino terminus of the a-factor precursor protein (8Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and it seemed improbable that a single protease would recognize and cleave a single protein at two completely different sites. Subsequent studies, however, established that Ste24p does indeed play dual roles in a-factor processing (6Boyartchuk V.L. Rine J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tam A. Nouvet F.J. Fujimura-Kamada K. Slunt H. Sisodia S.S. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition to being a CAAX endoprotease, Ste24p removes the seven amino-terminal amino acids from the a-factor precursor. Ste24 is, however, only the first of two proteases that cleave the amino terminus of a-factor. After the Ste24p-mediated cleavage step, an additional cleavage by Axl1p releases mature biologically active a-factor. When the two CAAX endoproteases were identified in yeast, apparent orthologues already existed in mammalian cDNA data bases. Tam and co-workers (9Tam A. Nouvet F.J. Fujimura-Kamada K. Slunt H.

No a-factor orthologue has been discovered in mammals, and no natural substrates for human ZMPSTE24 have been identified. However, the human enzyme faithfully carried out both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal processing of a surrogate substrate, yeast a-factor, and restored a-factor production in MATaste24Δrce1Δ yeast (9Tam A.

Our laboratory has sought to define the physiologic importance of the mammalian CAAX endoproteases, as well as the CAAXmethyltransferase, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT). We cloned and expressed cDNAs for human and mouseRce1 and showed that the mammalian Rce1 proteins processed the Ras proteins as well as several other CAAX proteins (11Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C.

In the current study, we have turned our attention to cloning mouseZmpste24 and producing Zmpste24-deficient mice. When we initiated this project, we had several physiologic and biochemical issues in mind. First, we wanted to gauge the physiologic importance of Zmpste24 in mammals. WouldZmpste24 be required for embryonic development, as was the case for Rce1 and ICMT? IfZmpste24-deficient mice survived, would they be fertile? From the biochemical perspective, we wanted to determine whether mouse Zmpste24 would be capable of carrying out the carboxyl-terminal processing of a-factor and, if so, whether the mouse enzyme would manifest the same peculiar specificities as the yeast enzyme (e.g. the ability to cleave an a-factor mutant terminating in CAMQ). We also wanted to determine whether the mouse enzyme would cleave the amino terminus of yeast a-factor and, if so, whether this enzymatic activity would be present in detectable levels in the tissues of wild-type mice. Finally, we wanted to determine if mouse Zmpste24 was the only mammalian enzyme capable of carrying out the amino-terminal processing ofa-factor, or whether mammalian cells might contain more than one enzyme with that activity. Our current studies provide insights into each of these issues. A XREFdb query (14Ploger R. Zhang J. Bassett D. Reeves R. Hieter P. Bouguski M. Spencer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) of GenBankTM sequences with yeast STE24 sequences identified a human expressed sequence tag with sequence similarities (I.M.A.G.E. clone 284572, Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Oligonucleotide primers 5′-GAGTTTCAAGCTGATGCATTTGC-3′ and 5′-GAGTTTCAAGCTGATGCATTGC-3′ derived from the human sequence were used to amplify a 382-base pair (bp) fragment (representing sequences fromZmpste24 exons 9 and 10) from a mouse liver cDNA library. The 5′ portion of the mouse Zmpste24 cDNA was generated by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends with oligonucleotide 5′-AGTCTTTAGCCTTCCCAAGTTTCTTGGC-3′ (corresponding to Zmpste24 amino acids 422–430) and the Marathon-Ready mouse liver cDNA kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Oligonucleotides 5′-ACTCTCCGAGGGACGCGTGT-3′ and 5′-CTTAAGAGCATCCAGTCATG-3′ were used to amplify a mouseZmpste24 cDNA. The cDNA was cloned into a TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsblad, CA), and both strands were sequenced. Predicted transmembrane domains were determined with the TMHMM transmembrane domain analysis program (genome.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-1.0/). Amino acid sequences from different species were aligned with MacVector 6.5. Expression of Zmpste24 in different mouse tissues was assessed by hybridizing a 32P-labeled Zmpste24cDNA probe to a mouse Multiple Choice Northern blot (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) and to a mouse multiple-tissue poly(A)+ RNA blot (CLONTECH).

Expression plasmids for mouse Zmpste24 (pMB4), yeast STE24(pMB5), yeast RCE1 (pMB6), and mouse Rce1 (pMB7) were created in the vector pMB1. To produce pMB1, the yeast shuttle vector Yeplac195 (18Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar) was modified by inserting anADH2 promoter and a PGK1 transcriptional terminator into the polylinker. The ADH2 promoter (579 bp upstream of the translational start site) was amplified from W303-1a genomic DNA with oligonucleotides 5′-CAGCTATGACCATGATTACGCCAAGCTTCAAAGGGGCAAAACGTAGGGGCAA-3′ and 5′-TTGATCTATCGATTTCAATTCAATTCAATTTATCTAGACATTGTGTATTACGATATAGTTAATAG-3′. The PGK1 transcriptional termination sequence (478 bp downstream from the PGK1 translational stop codon) was amplified with oligonucleotides 5′-CTATTAACTATATCGTAATACACAATGTCTAGATAAATTGAATTGAATTGAAATCGATAGATCAA-3′ and 5′-CGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTCATATGTCTCTGAATGCCAAGGATGG-3′. pMB1 was assembled by recombination in yeast (19Hudson Jr., H.R. Dawson E.P. Rusjing K.L. Jackson C.H. Lockshon D. Conover D. Lanciault C. Harris J.R. Simmons S.J. Rothstein R. Fields S. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) by transforming yeast strain W303-1a with the ADH2 and PGK1 PCR products and Yeplac195 that had been linearized withHindIII and EcoRI. All expression vectors were created by recombinational cloning after co-transformation of XbaI-cleaved pMB1 and PCR-amplified endoprotease open reading frames. A mouse Zmpste24open reading frame was amplified with oligonucleotides 5′-CTATTAACTATATCGTAATACACAATGGGGATGTGGGCATCGGTGGAC-3′ and 5′-TTGATCTATCGATTTCAATTCAATTCAATTTATCAGTCTTGTTTTGCATTTTTCAGAGC-3′. A mutant Zmpste24 cDNA (pMB9) was also constructed; the mutant lacks the sequences from the 104-bp exon 8, which encodes the zinc-binding HEXXH motif (HEXXH: H, histidine; E, glutamate; X, any amino acid). For this mutant, two fragments of the mouse Zmpste24 cDNA (corresponding to amino acids 1–318 and 354–475) were amplified from Marathon Ready mouse liver cDNA (CLONTECH) with oligonucleotides 5′-CTATTAACTATATCGTAATACACAATGGGGATGTGGGCATCGGTGGAC-3′, 5′-CTATTAACTATATCGTAATACACAATGGGGATGTGGGCATCGGTGGAC-3′, and 5′-TTGATCTATCGATTTCAATTCAATTCAATTTATCAGTCTTGTTTTGCATTTTTCAGAGC-3′ and 5′-TTGATCTATCGATTTCAATTCAATTCAATTTATCAGTCTTGTTTTGCATTTTTCAGAGC-3′. To construct pMB5, a yeast STE24 (YJR117W) open reading frame was amplified from W303-1a genomic DNA with oligonucleotides 5′-CAACTATTAACTATATCGTAATACACAATGTTTGATCTTAAGACGATTCTCG-3′ and 5′-TTGATCTATCGATTTCAATTCAATTCAATTTATTAGTTTTTCTTCTTTTCACTAACATAG-3′. To construct pMB6, the yeast RCE1 (YMR274C) open reading frame was PCR amplified from W303-1a genomic DNA with oligonucleotides 5′-CAACTATTAACTATATCGTAATACACAATGCTACAATTCTCAACATTTCTAG-3′ and 5′-TTGATCTATCGATTTCAATTCAATTCAATTTACTAAAGGGTTATTCTATAACCAGGAGTT-3′. A mouse Rce1 open reading frame was PCR amplified from Marathon Ready mouse liver cDNA (CLONTECH) with oligonucleotides 5′-CAACTATTAACTATATCGTAATACACAATGTCTGTGTTCTCCTGCTTCAGCCTCGCC-3′ and 5′-TTGATCTATCGATTTCAATTCAATTCAATTTATCAGGAGCACAGTAGGGTCTCTGAG-3′. To test the expression vectors (pMB4, pMB5, pMB6, pMB7, pMB8, and pMB9), each was transformed intoMAT a ste24Δrce1Δ yeast (JRY5317). The ability of each expression vector to restore a-factor production was assessed with a standard pheromone diffusion (halo) assay (7Trueblood C.E. Boyartchuk V.L. Picologlou E.A. Rozema D. Poulter C.D. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4381-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The principle underlying the halo assay is that the production of mature a-factor by aMAT a yeast strain results in a zone of growth inhibition (halo) on a lawn of MATα sst2cells. The coding regions of human Rce1 and mouse Zmpste24 were amplified by PCR, as described earlier, and cloned into pACA1 (5Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change the CVIA CAAX box in the a-factor gene (MFA1) to CAMQ or CTLM. The mutant a-factor plasmids were transformed into a MAT a ste24Δrce1Δmfa1Δmfa2Δ strain (JRY5463) (6Boyartchuk V.L. Rine J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains expressing the a-factor mutants and either human RCE1 or mouse Zmpste24 were spotted onto a lawn MATα sst2 cells (JRY3443) and allowed to grow for 2 days at 30 °C. The production of maturea-factor from a mutant a-factor construct was evident from a halo in the lawn of MATα sst2cells. The ability of yeast and mouse endoproteases to process 15-mer a-factor peptides terminating in CAMQ or CVIA was assessed in a coupled proteolysis/methylation assay (5Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N.

A wild-type CVIAa-factor peptide (YIIKGVFWDPA[farnesyl-C]VIA) and a mutant CAMQ a-factor peptide (YIIKGVFWDPA[farnesyl-C]AMQ) were purchased from California Peptide Research (Napa, CA). Membrane fractions were prepared from ste24Δrce1Δ yeast (JRY5317) that had been transformed with pMB4, pMB5, pMB6, pMB7, or pMB9. Yeast membranes (100 µg) were mixed with 4 nmol of peptide and 10 µm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine (55 Ci/mol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) and incubated for 120 min at 37 °C. The methylation reaction was stopped by adding 50 µl of 1.0 m NaOH containing 0.1% SDS. The reaction mixture (90 µl) was spotted onto a pleated 2 × 8-cm filter paper wedged in the neck of a 20-ml scintillation vial containing 5 ml of scintillation fluid (ScintiSafe Econo 1, Fisher). The vials were capped and incubated at room temperature for 5 h to allow the [14C]methanol (formed by base-hydrolysis of methyl esters) to diffuse into the scintillation fluid (20Clarke S. Vogel J.P.

The screening of a strain 129/Sv bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library (Research Genetics) with the 382-bp cDNA fragment resulted in the identification a BAC clone (223 G6) that contained the 3′ portion of mouse Zmpste24. A 9.4-kb SpeI fragment containing Zmpste24 exons 7–9 was subcloned into pBSSK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). These sequences were used to construct a sequence-replacement gene-targeting vector in pKSLoxPNT (23Hanks M. Wurst W. Anson-Cartwright L. Auerbach A.B. Joyner A.L. Science. 1995; 269: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). pKSLoxPNT contains polylinker cloning sites, a thymidine kinase (tk) gene, and a 3-phosphoglycerate kinase-neomycin resistance (PGK-neo) cassette flanked byloxP sites. The long arm (4.6 kb of intron sequences 5′ to exon 8) was amplified from BAC DNA with oligonucleotides 5′-CAAGTGATTCGAGGCTAGCCTGGTCTACG-3′ and 5′-GGCCTTGACCCATCTAATCAAACAACCAGAC-3′ and the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The PCR fragment was cloned into the EcoRI site of pKSLoxPNT. The short arm (2.6 kb of intron sequences 3′ to exon 8) was amplified with oligonucleotides 5′-ACGACGGCGGCCGCGAAACTGGCCTGGTGTTCACTATGTAGC-3′ and 5′-AGCAGCGCGGCCGCGAGGGCACAACACTGTATGTTACCAGG-3′ and cloned into the NotI site. The integrity of the vector was verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. The vector was linearized withXhoI before the electroporation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Mouse ES cells (strain 129/SvJae) (24Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

G418 (final concentration, 200 µg/ml) was added to the medium 24 h after the electroporation. 1-(2′Deoxy-2′fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (final concentration, 0.2 µm) was added to the medium for 4 days, beginning 3 days after the electroporation. Drug-resistant ES cell colonies were picked 10 days after the electroporation, and targeted clones (Zmpste24+/−) were identified by Southern blotting of EcoRI-digested ES cell DNA with a 441-bp 5′-flanking probe (see Fig. 1 A). The 5′ probe, which was amplified from BAC DNA with oligonucleotides 5′-CCCACAACTGTGGACTTTGATGGATCAGG-3′ and 5′-GGTATGCACCACCTTCCCCTGACTACT-3′, detects an 8.0-kb EcoRI fragment in wild-type (Zmpste24+/+) cells. Targeted cells (Zmpste24+/−) were identified by the presence of a 5.0-kb fragment in addition to the 8.0-kb fragment. Targeted clones were also screened by digesting genomic DNA with SpeI and then performing a Southern blot with a 388-bp 3′-flanking probe (see Fig. 1 A). The 3′ probe was amplified from BAC DNA with oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGACTCTTTGGGGTAGTG-3′ and 5′-ACGACGGCGGCCGCGGCTTAGTGGGTCCTGGAAGGAACTTTA-3′. The 3′ probe detects a 9.4-kb SpeI fragment in Zmpste24+/+ cells; Zmpste24+/− cells contained a 4.3-kb fragment in addition to the 9.4-kb fragment. Two targeted clones, each with a single neo integration, were used to generate Zmpste24-deficient mice (25Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J.M. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). All mice had a mixed genetic background (∼50% C57BL/6 and ∼50% 129/Sv). The mice were weaned at 21 days of age, housed in a barrier facility with 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). All mice described herein were examined at 8–12 weeks of age. Zmpste24−/−,Zmpste24+/−, and Zmpste24+/+ embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from 13.5-day mouse embryos (11Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C.

Homozygous knockout cells (Zmpste24−/−) were isolated as described by Mortensen et al. (26Mortensen R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Two lines ofZmpste24−/− ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. At 8 weeks of age, the chimeric mice were sacrificed, and genomic DNA from multiple tissues was analyzed with Southern blots with the 5′ probe. The ability of Zmpste24−/− membranes to cleave the carboxyl terminus of an a-factor peptide, generating mature a-factor, was assessed with a bioassay. 3A. Tam, W. K. Schmidt, and S. Michaelis, manuscript in preparation. Membranes from tissues of Zmpste24+/+ and Zmpste24−/− mice and from Zmpste24+/+ and Zmpste24−/− cells were mechanically disrupted by sonication (Branson sonifier, 10 cycles, output = 5, duty cycle = 50%) in an ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 µm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4 containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, and 3 µg/ml leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin). The samples were then homogenized on ice with a Dounce homogenizer, resuspended in 0.15 m NaCl, and then subjected to centrifugation at 4 °C for 3000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant fluid was spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fluid was discarded and the pellet, representing the membrane fraction, was resuspended in ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, and 3 µg/ml leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin)) at concentrations of 3–14 mg/ml and then frozen at −80 °C. A 100 µm solution of the CAMQ peptide was prepared in methanol. Membranes fromste24Δrce1Δ yeast that expressed STE14 from a 2-µm plasmid (SM3614/pSM1317) were prepared as a source of the prenylprotein methyltransferase (15Romano J.D. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2231-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Each carboxyl-terminal processing reaction contained the a-factor peptide (0.75 µm), membranes from mouse tissues (75 µg/ml),ste24Δrce1Δ/Ste14p yeast membranes (0.1 mg/ml) in a buffer containing 75 mm HEPES, 75 mm NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and 20 µm S-adenosyl-l-methionine. The reactions were assembled in 96-well polystyrene plates in a total volume of 25 µl. After a 2-h incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding copper acetate (final concentration, 2 mm). The production of mature a-factor was detected by plating dilutions of the reaction mixture on a lawn of MATαsst2 cells (SM1086) and allowing the cells to grow for 2 days at 30 °C (27Nijbroek G.L.

https://openalex.org/W2160628268,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pleiotropic cytokine essential for initiation of the immune response to infections and stress. IL-1 interacts with its type I receptor (IL-1RI) and triggers a number of intracellular signaling cascades leading to activation of transcription factors, transcriptional up-regulation of target genes, and mRNA stabilization. IL-1RI-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1) is a membrane proximal serine-threonine kinase involved in IL-1 signaling that becomes phosphorylated and progressively degraded in response to IL-1 induction. We have identified a novel variant of IRAK1, which we have named IRAK1b, that arises from the use of an alternative 5′-acceptor splice site defined by sequence within exon 12 of IRAK1. IRAK1b mRNA exhibits wide tissue expression and is evolutionarily conserved in both mouse and human. IRAK1b can activate the transcription factor nuclear factor κB and interacts with the IL-1 signaling factors Toll-interacting protein and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6. It forms homodimers and heterodimers with the previously described isoform of IRAK1. We show that the IRAK1b protein is kinase-inactive and that, unlike IRAK1, its levels remain constant after IL-1 induction. The presence of an alternative splice variant of IRAK1, which is functionally active and highly stable following IL-1 stimulation, adds further complexity to the control mechanisms that govern IL-1 signaling.

Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Systemically, IL-1 stimulates fever, vasodilation, and muscle contractions; at the cellular level it induces cells to adopt an enhanced “host defense” phenotype by eliciting radical changes in their protein expression profiles by modulating mRNA processing and stability, protein translation, and gene transcription (1Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter is achieved by activating transcription factors, e.g. nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Signaling by IL-1 depends on its engagement of the transmembrane IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) and IL-1RI accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) (Ref. 2Greenfeder S.A. Nunes P. Kwee L. Labow M. Chizzonite R.A.

Depending on cell type, these kinases may include IL-1RI-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1), which is expressed in all tissues (7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), IRAK2, which has a narrower cellular distribution (3Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), and IRAK-M, which is mainly restricted to cells of myeloid origin (8Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has also been implicated as an early component of the IL-1 signaling cascade (9Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once established, the cascade progresses through the stepwise activation/recruitment of several additional intermediates, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), TRAF6 binding protein, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), two TAK1 binding proteins (TAB1 and TAB2), and NF-κB-inducing kinase (10Cao Z.

Finally, the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) is phosphorylated by the resulting IκB kinase complex and degraded. This allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus where it activates transcription of a wide range of genes that are important for immune function and inflammation (16O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J.

The branches of the IL-1 signaling pathway that leads to activation of AP-1 and mRNA stabilization may diverge from the NF-κB-activating branch of the cascade at TAK1/TAB1 (Ref. 17Holtmann H.

However, other studies suggest that the pathways diverge at IRAK1 or even earlier (18Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IRAK1 is a protein of 714 amino acids that has two known functional domains: an N-terminal death domain, which is involved in protein·protein interactions with MyD88 and Toll-interacting protein (Tollip), and a centrally positioned Ser/Thr kinase domain (3Muzio M.

Several studies have shown that the kinase activity is not necessary for IRAK1 to be functional (21Knop J. Martin M.U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Maschera B. Ray K. Burns K. Volpe F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Li X.

In un-stimulated cells IRAK1 is associated with Tollip; however, following stimulation with IL-1, its recruitment to the IL-1·IL-1RI·IL-1RAcP complex is facilitated by the interaction between Tollip and IL-1RAcP (24Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). IRAK1 becomes phosphorylated, dissociates from Tollip, and is degraded by proteasomes (24Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 25Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Studies to date indicate that the phosphorylation of IRAK1 is mediated by IRAK1 itself (7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 20Trofimova M. Sprenkle A.B. Green M. Sturgill T.W. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17609-17612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), although it remains a possibility that additional kinases are also involved (23Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It has furthermore been suggested, but not yet established, that IL-1-mediated degradation of IRAK1 may be the mechanism whereby cells become desensitized after prolonged exposure to IL-1 (25Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Because IRAK1 is also involved in the signaling pathway from Toll receptors induced by lipopolysaccharide (see Ref. 26Li L. Cousart S. Hu J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar for additional references), it has also been suggested that a similar mechanism plays a role in the desensitization of monocytes and neutrophils to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which is a feature of sepsis (26Li L. Cousart S. Hu J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing is one of the mechanisms whereby an increased complexity in the number of functionally distinct protein products may be generated from a fixed pool of genes in the genome (27Black D.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 367-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We have identified a novel alternatively spliced variant of IRAK1 mRNA. It encodes an IRAK1 protein that has functional activity similar to that of the previously described IRAK1 isoform but is biologically distinct in that it is relatively much more stable after IL-1 activation. The existence of alternative forms of IRAK1 with very different capacities to support IL-1 signaling over time has important implications for the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory processes. Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and human embryonic kidney cells (293) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 25 mm HEPES and glutamax-1 (l-alanyl-l-glutamine) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.01 mm nonessential amino acids, and 50 µg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). For protein harvesting 106 cells were used per data point. For transfection experiments 2.5 × 105 cells were used per data point. Treatments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. All experiments were repeated at least twice. For transfection experiments, cells were grown to ∼50% confluence and transfected with 2–3 µg of total DNA using FuGene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In experiments where cells were transfected with varying amounts of expression vectors, the total DNA used in each transfection was held constant by co-transfecting appropriate amounts of empty vector. Cells were treated with medium (control) or IL-1β (10 ng/ml, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD) for 4 h. For luciferase reporter assays, cells were lysed and lysates were assayed for luciferase andRenilla-luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega, Madison, WI). Human tissue total RNA was obtained from CLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). Mouse total RNA was extracted using RNeasy (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA from tissue culture cells was extracted as described elsewhere (28Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. J. Immunol. Meth. 1998; 215: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription of 1 µg of total RNA was performed at 42 °C using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), oligo-(dN)6 primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) and ANTI-RNase RNase inhibitor (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Proportional quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described elsewhere (28Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. J. Immunol. Meth. 1998; 215: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using the GC-RICH PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with forward (5′-AAAGGAGGCCTCCTATGACC-3′) and reverse (5′-ATGATGCAGAGCTG-3′) primers based on sequence from GenBank™ accession number L76191. PCR products were separated in agarose gels and visualized after ethidium-bromide staining. Mouse cDNAs were amplified with forward (5′-AGAAGAGGCCCCCCATGACC-3′) and reverse (5′-CAGGGATGAGCTGCCCGTGG-3′) primers based on sequence from GenBank™ accession number U56773. TheRenilla-luciferase and NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter constructs are described elsewhere (29Jensen L.E. Muzio M. Mantovani A. Whitehead A.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5277-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). cDNAs were amplified using the GC-RICH PCR system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers for amplification of the coding sequence of IRAK1 were derived from GenBank™ accession number L76191. The coding sequences of IRAK1 variants were cloned into the mammalian expression vectors pCI-Neo (Promega), pcDNA4/HisMax (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and p3XFLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma Chemical Co.). A kinase-inactive IRAK1a (kiIRAK1a) clone was generated containing two point mutations (E248A and I326V) in the kinase domain. IRAK1a mutants IRAK1a(S536A), IRAK1a(S541A), IRAK1a(S536A, S541A), IRAK1a(S536A,S541A,Y515F), IRAK1a(K520A), and IRAK1a(K520A,S536A,S541A) were generated using overlapping primers containing the appropriate point mutations and PCR amplification of fragments of the IRAK1a coding sequence. PCR products were cloned into previously generated IRAK1a expression constructs. Primers for amplification of Tollip and TRAF6 coding sequences were derived from GenBank™ accession numbersAJ242972 and U78798, respectively. cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax. The expression vector p3xFLAG-CMV-BAP encoding FLAG-tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP) was obtained from Sigma. Total proteins were extracted on ice in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm para-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 1% Nonidet P-40. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Total protein extracts were separated in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Excess protein binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS. Immunodetection of IRAK1 was performed using polyclonal rabbit anti-IRAK1 (IRAK-1 (H273), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting detection reagents, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). His-tagged proteins were detected using polyclonal rabbit anti-His-probe-(H-15) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with ANTI-FLAG M2 (Sigma) monoclonal antibodies and agarose-conjugated protein A (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 4 °C for 4 h. IRAK-1 (H273) and polyclonal rabbit anti-TRAF6 (TRAF6 (H274), Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for IRAK1- and TRAF6-specific immunoprecipitations, respectively. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. Beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins were separated in NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (SDS-PAGE, Invitrogen). Transfected cell monolayers were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated with methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h prior to addition of 15 µCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After labeling for 1 h, medium was removed and cells were rinsed twice with PBS prior to the addition of methionine-sufficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 10 ng/ml IL-1β. At appropriate times cells were lysed in the presence of 50 mm4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-vinylsulfone (NLVS, proteasome inhibitor, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and proteins were immunoprecipitated with ANTI-FLAG M2 as described above. Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, 35S-labeled proteins were quantified using STORM and ImageQuaNT technologies (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm para-nitrophenylphosphate, 10% (v/v) Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma), and 5 µM ATP). To each sample 2 µg of myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) was added. Each sample was divided into two aliquots, to one of which 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Proteins were separated in 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were detected after Western blotting or autoradiography. Computer analyses were performed through the Baylor College of Medicine search launcher available at searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu. The programs HSPL (prediction of splice sites in human DNA sequences) and FEXH (prediction of internal, 5′- and 3′-exons in human DNA sequences) were used to predict splice sites (30Solovyev V.V. Salamov A.A. Lawrence C.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5156-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) in the IRAK1 sequence. IRAK1 is an essential component of the IL-1 signaling cascade. It has been suggested that degradation of IRAK1 is responsible for desensitization of cellular targets to IL-1 and lipopolysaccharide after prolonged exposure to these agents (25Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 26Li L. Cousart S. Hu J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we generated a range of IRAK1 expression vectors. Primers for amplification of IRAK1 sequences were designed from GenBank™ accession number L76191, and the entire coding sequence was amplified by PCR using proofreading DNA polymerases. The resulting cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI-Neo. Sequencing of four individual clones revealed that two contained an identical deletion of 90 bp (sequence was submitted to GenBank™ under accession numberAF346607). To determine whether these clones represent an alternatively spliced variant of IRAK1 mRNA, we aligned their sequences with that of the known IRAK1 gene sequence (GenBank™ accession number U52112). The 90 bp, which were missing in two of our clones, aligned perfectly with the first 90 bp of IRAK1 exon 12 (Fig.1 A). We then performed computer analysis to predict the likely locations of the exon splice sites involving IRAK1 exons 11–13. The program HSPL (prediction of splice sites in human DNA sequences) predicted one 5′-acceptor site at position +1 of exon 12 and a second 5′-acceptor site at position +91 of exon 12 (Fig. 1 A). The FEXH (prediction of internal, 5′- and 3′-exons in human DNA sequences) program only predicted the 5′-acceptor site at position +91. These data strongly support the possibility of alternative splicing in exon 12 of the IRAK1 gene. Alternative splicing of exon 12 at position +1 or +91 would result in the previously described form of IRAK1 (hereafter referred to as IRAK1a for clarity) and a shorter form, respectively. We have named this shorter putative splice variant IRAK1b. IRAK1 will be used below as a generic term covering both splice variants. The IRAK1b sequence predicts an in-frame deletion of 30 amino acids (residues 514–543) at the C-terminal end of the kinase domain (Fig. 1 B). IRAK1a has previously been shown to be expressed in a wide range of cell types as an ∼3.5-kb mRNA (7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 20Trofimova M. Sprenkle A.B. Green M. Sturgill T.W. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17609-17612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The similarity in size between the IRAK1a and IRAK1b mRNAs precludes their resolution by Northern blot analysis. We therefore chose a RT-PCR approach to identify cell types that express the IRAK1b mRNA. We designed a forward primer corresponding to sequence within IRAK1 exon 11 and a reverse primer corresponding to sequence withinIRAK1 exon 12 downstream of the putative alternative splice site. To test the relative amplification efficiencies of the two IRAK1 cDNAs derived from the alternatively spliced IRAK1 mRNA species, plasmids carrying IRAK1a and IRAK1b coding sequence were co-amplified by PCR, and multiple aliquots were taken for analysis after each of five cycles. Equivalent amplification kinetics during the exponential phase of IRAK1a cDNA and IRAK1b cDNA amplification was confirmed; the ratio of products was also maintained after the plateau phase of amplification had been reached (not shown). Reverse-transcribed total RNA from a range of human tissues was subjected to the above proportional quantitative PCR method. A strong band of 441 bp corresponding to the predicted size of IRAK1a cDNA and a weaker band of ∼350 bp were detected in all samples (Fig.2 A). Because the expected size of the IRAK1b cDNA is 351 bp, we concluded that IRAK1b mRNA is co-expressed with IRAK1a mRNA in all tissues tested. The ratio of cDNA products derived from the IRAK1a to IRAK1b mRNAs was similar in all samples. We next wished to establish whether the putative IRAK1b protein could be detected in protein extracts from HepG2 cells. Cells were transfected with pCI-Neo expression plasmids encoding either IRAK1a or IRAK1b. Because the former becomes hyperphosphorylated when overexpressed and consequently undergoes a shift in electrophoretic mobility (5Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17609-17612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (see below), we used a kinase-inactive variant (kiIRAK1a) for this transfection series. Proteins were extracted from both transfected and untransfected HepG2 cells and IRAK1 proteins detected by immunoblotting. Single bands of 76 and 73 kDa were detected in cell extracts from the kiIRAK1a- and IRAK1b-transfected cells, respectively (Fig. 2 B). These sizes are similar to those predicted for the two isoforms based on their polypeptide sequences. Two bands with mobilities identical to those observed in cells transfected with kiIRAK1a and IRAK1b were also observed in extracts from untransfected cells (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that HepG2 cells endogenously synthesize both IRAK1a (upper band) and IRAK1b (lower band) proteins. The above results indicate that IRAK1b is an alternatively spliced variant of IRAK1 that is expressed at the mRNA level, and probably at the protein level, in a wide range of tissues. The mouse IRAK1a mRNA sequence (IRAK1/mPLK, GenBank™ accession number U56773) was aligned with that of the human IRAK1 mRNA. The two splice sites for IRAK1a and IRAK1b are perfectly conserved in the mouse sequence (not shown). Intriguingly, three amino acid residues, which are present in the region of the human IRAK1 that is spliced out of human IRAK1b, are absent from the mouse gene (Fig. 1 B). A proportional quantitative RT-PCR method similar to the one described above for human IRAK1a and IRAK1b mRNA splice variants was developed for the mouse putative IRAK1 mRNA splice variants. Both cDNA products could be amplified from total RNA extracted from mouse liver, kidney, and testis (Fig. 2 C). The retention of the IRAK1b alternative splice variant in two evolutionarily distant mammalian species suggests that it has an important physiological function. PELLE, the Drosophila homologue of IRAK1, contains death and kinase domains that are similar to those present in IRAK1; however, the PELLE peptide sequence ends immediately after the kinase domain and the full-length protein is only 501 amino acid residues long (31Shelton C.A. Wasserman S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 515-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). PELLE therefore does not contain the C-terminal region, which is subject to alternative splicing in mammalian IRAK1. The presence of this domain in both human and mouse IRAK1 suggests that it serves functions, as yet undefined, that are specific to mammals. In this context it is intriguing that the C-terminal domain incorporates potential further structural diversity via the use of alternative splicing to yield distinct protein products that may themselves have differentiated functions. To determine if IRAK1b is capable of activating NF-κB, HepG2 cells were co-transfected with an NF-κB luciferase reporter, a control luciferase-Renilla reporter, and increasing amounts of IRAK1a or IRAK1b expression constructs. The level of NF-κB activation was evaluated after 24 h by assessment of luciferase/Renilla reporter ratios. Both IRAK1a and IRAK1b result in a concentration-dependent activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3). IRAK1a appears to be more efficient at activating NF-κB than IRAK1b, because ∼20 times less IRAK1a than IRAK1b expression construct is needed to induce equivalent levels of NF-κB activation. The proportional difference in NF-κB activation between IRAK1a and IRAK1b is similar to that previously reported between IRAK1a and either IRAK2 or IRAK-M (8Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), i.e.IRAK1b appears to be as efficient as IRAK2 and IRAK-M at activating NF-κB. The lower efficiency of NF-κB activation by IRAK1b relative to that effected by IRAK1a prompted us to investigate if there are measurable differences in the interactions of IRAK1a and IRAK1b with the downstream signaling component TRAF6. His-tagged IRAK1 proteins were expressed either alone or with His-tagged TRAF6 in 293 cells. TRAF6 was immunoprecipitated from cellular extracts with a TRAF6-specific antibody, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins wer"

Because rhythmic distension of the vessel wall is a component of pulsatile flow, cyclic strain on vessel walls plays an important role in modulating gene expression. Earlier studies from our laboratory showed that ECs under cyclic strain increase their expression of MCP-1 (10Wang D.L. Wung B.S. Shyy Y.J. Lin C.F. Chao Y.J. Usami S. Chien S. Circ.

However, the initial events and the following networks of signaling pathways are still poorly understood. Cyclic strain to ECs activates intracellular second messengers. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is associated with an increase of phosphatidyl inositol turnover and intracellular calcium (17Evans L. Frenkel L. Brophy C.M. Rosales O. Sai Sudhaker C.B. Li G. Du W. Sumpio B.E. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C650-C656Google Scholar). PKC is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG), which is derived either from phosphatidylinositide (PI) or phosphatidylcholine (PC). PKC isoforms in human ECs have been identified that cover PKC-α, PKC-δ, PKC-ε, and PKC-ξ (18Haller Z. Ziegler W. Lindschau C. Luft F.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PKC-α belongs to a Ca2+-dependent group, and the isoforms PKC-ε and PKC-ξ belong to a Ca2+-independent group. Studies have indicated that PKC is involved in shear stress- and cyclic strain-induced gene expression of platelet-derived growth factor and Et-1 in ECs (19Morita T. Kurihara H. Maemura K. Yoshizumi M. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 630-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Morawietz H. Talanow R. Szibor M. Rueckschloss U. Schubert A. Bartling B. Darmer D. Holtz J. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed, PKC-ε is required for fluid shear stress-mediated activation of ERK1/2 in ECs (21Traub O. Monia B.P. Dean N.M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31251-31257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In smooth muscle cells, stretching promotes DNA synthesis via activation of PKC (22Mills I. Cohen C.R. Kamal K. Li G. Shin T. Du W. Sumpio B.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that cyclic strain to ECs increases gene expression of MCP-1, which is regulated by PKC (10Wang D.L. Wung B.S. Shyy Y.J. Lin C.F. Chao Y.J. Usami S. Chien S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 294-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies indicated that cyclic strain induces the Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway and results in an increase of gene expression of MCP-1 and Egr-1 (11Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Chao Y.J. Lin J. Shyy Y.J. Wang D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1462-H1468PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The upstream signaling pathway and/or signaling network that lead to activation of Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 by cyclic strain remain unclear. Among the likely signaling networks, different PKC isoforms have been shown to modulate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway under different stimuli (23Liao D.F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 24Soh, J. W., Lee, E. H., Prywes, E., and Weinstein, I. B. (1999) 19, 1313–1324.Google Scholar). However, direct evidence of any of the PKC isoforms being involved in the signaling pathway during endothelial response to cyclic strain has not been clearly defined. In the present study, we demonstrate that ECs subjected to cyclic strain increase PKC activities and that PKC-α and PKC-ε are sequentially activated for Raf/ERK1/2 activation. PKC-α and PKC-ε contribute to the early and late phase of ERK1/2 activation, respectively, in cyclic strain-treated ECs. The consequence of these PKCs being activated by cyclic strain leads to cellular adaptation including gene induction in ECs. Our results provide direct evidence of PKC isoforms' participation in signaling transduction in ECs under a hemodynamic environment. The strain unit Flexcell FX-2000 (Flexcell, McKeesport, PA) consisted of a vacuum unit linked to a valve controlled by a computer program (25Gilbert J.A. Weinhold P.S. Banes A.J. Link G.W. Jones G.L. J. Biomech. 1994; 27: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Bovine aortic ECs cultured on a flexible membrane base were deformed by a sinusoidal negative pressure that produced an average strain of 12% at a frequency of 1 Hz. ECs were scraped in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 50 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% leupeptin) and sonicated. Total cell lysate was collected, and PKC activity was detected based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that utilizes a synthetic peptide and a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the peptide (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). ECs were scraped into lysis buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors. After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatants and pellets were collected as cytosolic and membrane fractions. For experiments to detect the phosphorylation in PKC, total cell lysate was used. Proteins were extracted in buffer containing SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The PKC isoforms were analyzed with PKC monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories). To detect serine phosphorylation in PKC, antibody to phospho-PKC-α (Ser657) or phospho-PKC-ε (Ser719) (Transduction Laboratories) was used. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using horseradish peroxide-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG and an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For detection of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2), pERK1/2 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was used. For the Raf activation detection, antibody specific to the phosphorylated activation site (Ser402; Transduction Laboratories) of Raf was used. Antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was used as second antibody, and results were obtained using a chemiluminescent detection kit (Tropix Inc.). An Elk1 transduction pathway-reporting system was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) that contains plasmids GAL/Elk1-(307–428) and GAL4-Luc. An MCP-1 promoter construct (−540 base pairs) containing the luciferase reporter gene (26Shyy Y.J. Lin M.C. Lu Y. Petrime M. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8069-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) was also used. Transfection was performed using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid was cotransfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides corresponding to bovine PKC-α or PKC-ε were synthesized by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The sequences of sense, scramble, and antisense to PKC-α were 5′-GTCCCTCGCCGCCTCCTG-3′, 5′-GGTTTTACCATCGGTTCTGG-3′, and 5′-GTCCTCGCCGCTCCCCTG-3′, respectively. The sequences of scramble and antisense to PKC-ε were 5′-TACGCATAACGCGCTGGTGG-3′ and 5′-ATTGAACACTACCAT-3′, respectively. The sequence of the PKC-ε inhibitory peptide was Glu-Ala-Val-Ser-Leu-Lys-Pro-Thr. These oligonucleotides and the inhibitory peptide, characterized as described (21Traub O. Monia B.P. Dean N.M.

ECs were lysed with buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle. After removing cellular debris, the same amount of protein from each sample was incubated with anti-Raf-1 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories). The immune complex was then incubated with protein A/G-agarose for 1 h. The immune complex was washed three times and resuspended in the sample buffer. ECs were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The MAPK activity in the immune complex was analyzed in reaction buffer (10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/liter benzamidine, 25 mmol/liter HEPES, 50 µmol/liter ATP, and 1 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP) containing myelin basic protein. The reaction was terminated with sample buffer containing SDS. The samples were electrophoresed, and the gel was imaged by autoradiography. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Our previous studies demonstrated that PKC is involved in cyclic strain-induced gene expression of Et-1 and MCP-1 in ECs (10Wang D.L. Wung B.S. Shyy Y.J. Lin C.F. Chao Y.J. Usami S. Chien S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 294-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wang D.L. Wung B.S. Peng Y.C. Wang J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the role of PKC in cyclic strain-induced endothelial responses, PKC activity and PKC isoforms in strained ECs were investigated. ECs under cyclic strain rapidly increased their PKC activities. These increased PKC activities remained at elevated levels as the cyclic strain continued up to 6 h (Fig.1 A). PKC activation requires phosphorylation of active sites. To demonstrate that PKCs were activated after cyclic strain, serine phosphorylation of PKC-α (Ser657) and PKC-ε (Ser719) as an indication of PKC activation was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 1 B, ECs under cyclic strain rapidly induced phosphorylation of Ser657 on PKC-α and maintained that at an activated form for up to 3 h. In contrast, the phosphorylation of Ser719 on PKC-ε showed apparent activation after 1 h of strain treatment and maintained that up to 6 h. Immediately following lysis of ECs after strain treatment, the cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated. Different PKC isoforms from each fraction were analyzed. Three major PKC isoforms (i.e. PKC-α, -β, and -ε) were identified with respective antibodies. ECs, after cyclic strain for 5 min, rapidly induced their PKC-α activity as shown by the strong PKC-α migration from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction (Fig.2). These PKC-α then gradually retreated to the cytosolic fraction. The majority of PKC-α returned to the cytosolic fraction at 6 h after continuous cyclic strain. Interestingly, the PKC-ε transmigration was not detected at the early phase but instead became apparent at 1 h, reached maximal activation at 3 h, and remained in an activated form even at 6 h after cyclic strain treatment (Fig. 2). In contrast to the transmigration of PKC-α and PKC-ε from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction, the PKC-β isoform was not activated and remained in the cytosolic fraction during the entire 6-h cyclic strain treatment. These observations are consistent with the sequential pattern of serine phosphorylation on active sites of PKCs shown in Fig.1 B. Our results clearly demonstrate a sequential transmigration of PKC-α and PKC-ε to the membrane fraction in ECs after the onset of cyclic strain. The direct phosphorylation of Raf-1 by PKC isoforms has been suggested as an activation mechanism of PKC on the Raf-1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway (31Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 32Sajan M.P. Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Quon M.J. Burke T.R. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30495-30500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that cyclic strain activates the Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 pathway (14Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. Hypertension. 1996; 28: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that PKC is involved in Raf-1 activation, ECs were pretreated with a PKC inhibitor, calphostin C, followed with cyclic strain treatment. As shown in Fig.3 A, the cyclic strain, while inducing an increased phosphorylation of Raf-1 in its activation site, was significantly blunted by treating ECs with calphostin C. To further elucidate the role of PKC isoforms in the Raf-1/ERK1/2 signaling cascade, the association of each PKC isoform with Raf-1 in strained ECs was assessed by immunoprecipitating Raf-1 with monoclonal antibodies from total cellular extracts of ECs and by immunoblotting with antibodies to PKC-α or PKC-ε. Although an equal amount of Raf-1 was shown in the immune complex, PKC isoform association with Raf-1 occurred in a temporal manner (Fig. 3 B). In ECs under static conditions, some PKC-ε was associated with Raf-1, but PKC-α was not. However, ECs subjected to cyclic strain for 5 min resulted in a rapidly increased association of PKC-α with Raf-1. This association of PKC-α with Raf-1 receded after 3 h of cyclic strain. In contrast, PKC-ε was strongly associated with Raf-1 at this time point. These findings of Raf-1 phosphorylation via PKC and sequential association of PKC isoforms with Raf-1 are consistent with the finding of temporal transmigration of PKC-α and PKC-ε in ECs after cyclic strain treatment. We previously demonstrated that cyclic strain to ECs induces Egr-1 gene expression, which is predominantly mediated via the Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway (15Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To further confirm that the ERK1/2 signaling pathway is involved, ECs after cyclic strain for various intervals were lysed, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 was analyzed with Western blotting using anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 antibody. Cyclic strain to ECs, similar to those ECs after phorbol ester treatment, rapidly induced ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 4 A). This ERK1/2 activity remained in a phosphorylated form as cyclic strain continued. Early and late activation of ERK1/2, corresponding to ECs at 5-min and 3-h treatment of the cyclic strain, were inhibited after treating ECs with calphostin C (Fig. 4 B). Consistently, cyclic strain-induced ERK1/2 kinase activity, as analyzed by32P phosphorylation of myelin basic protein, was inhibited in ECs pretreated with calphostin C (Fig. 4 C). In contrast to the activation of PKC-ε, PKC-α activation is Ca2+-dependent. To differentiate which PKC isoforms contribute to the early phase versus the late but sustained phase of ERK1/2 activity, ECs were pretreated with a specific Ca2+-dependent PKC inhibitor, Go 6976, and then subjected to cyclic strain. As shown in Fig. 4 D, the early phase of cyclic strain-induced ERK1/2 activity was significantly inhibited after Go 6976 treatment of ECs. In contrast, strain-induced ERK1/2 activity in the late but sustained phase was not affected by this inhibitor treatment. These results support that a sequential activation of PKC-α and PKC-ε is involved in cyclic strain-induced ERK1/2 activation in ECs. To further confirm the role of each PKC isoform in strain-induced ERK1/2 activity, ECs were pretreated with antisense to PKC-α or PKC-ε. ECs transfected with an antisense (2 µmol/liter) to a particular PKC isoform significantly reduced the protein expression of that PKC isoform in ECs (Fig.5, A–D). Consistently, antisense to PKC-α and PKC-ε significantly inhibited PKC activity in ECs after cyclic strain for 5 min and 3 h, respectively (Fig.5 E). When ECs were subjected to cyclic strain for 5 min, only those ECs transfected with antisense to PKC-α showed an inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig.6 A). In contrast, ECs transfected with the scramble oligonucleotides did not affect ERK1/2 activity. This indicates that PKC-α is required for early ERK1/2 activity. However, PKC-α did not play a significant role at the late phase of ERK1/2 activation, since antisense PKC-α-transfected ECs did not inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation at 3 h after cyclic strain treatment (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, ECs transfected with an antisense to PKC-ε abolished the strain-induced ERK1/2 activity at this later phase. PKC-ε involved in late phase of ERK1/2 was further confirmed by the inhibition of ERK1/2 activity in strained ECs transfected with the inhibitory peptide to PKC-ε (Fig.6 B). All of these data demonstrate that PKC-α is required for the early phase, while PKC-ε contributes mainly to the late and sustained phase of cyclic strain-induced ERK1/2 activation in ECs.Figure 6PKC -α and PKC -ε sequentially regulate cyclic strain-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. A, ECs were transfected with either sense, antisense, or scrambled (Sc) oligonucleotides (2 µmol/liter) to PKC-α or PKC-ε for 6 h. Two days after transfection, ECs were subjected to cyclic strain for 5 min (S5′). B, ECs were similarly transfected with sense or antisense oligonucleotides (2 µmol/liter) to PKC-α or PKC-ε or inhibition peptide to PKC-ε (5 µmol/liter, PKC-εi) for 6 h. Two days after transfection, ECs were subjected to cylic strain for 3 h (S3h). Total cell lysate was collected for Western analysis using an antibody to pERK1/2. Equal amounts of protein applied to each lane are shown by the ERK for each lane. Results are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When the Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway is triggered, it leads to the activation of downstream transcriptional factors including activator protein-1 and ternary complex factors Elk1/TCF (ternary complex factors). Since PKC isoforms contribute to strain-induced ERK1/2 activity and ERK1/2 activation increases the transcriptional activity of Elk1 by phosphorylation, we thus investigated whether PKC isoforms elicit the transcriptional activity of Elk1. To demonstrate Elk1 activity, plasmid GAL4/Elk1-(307–428), which encodes the fusion protein of the GAL4/DNA-binding domain fused to the activation domain of Elk1, was cotransfected with GAL4-Luc, a chimeric construct consisting of five copies of the GAL-4 binding sequences and the luciferase reporter, into ECs. These ECs were then subjected to cyclic strain. When ECs were transfected with the antisense to PKC-α or PKC-ε, strain-induced Elk1 transcriptional activities were significantly reduced to levels close to that of static control ECs (Fig.7 A). In contrast, ECs transfected with scramble oligonucleotides did not affect the Elk1 induction by cyclic strain. Similarly, ECs transfected with an antisense to PKC-α or PKC-ε attenuated MCP-1 promotor activity (Fig. 7 B). These results demonstrated that cyclic strain to ECs increases ERK1/2 activity, which is subsequently followed by an increase of transcriptional activity of Elk1. These results further confirm the importance of PKC isoforms (-α and -ε) in modulating the signaling pathway in ECs under cyclic strain. Taken together, our results clearly show that PKC isoforms are involved in endothelial responses to cyclic strain. The PKC-ε appears to play an important role for sustained Raf/ERK1/2 activation in ECs constantly under hemodynamic influences. The activation of this PKC isoform and the subsequent signaling pathway followed by gene modulation are crucial for cellular adaptation to a hemodynamic environment. Earlier studies indicated that PKC activities are increased in ECs under shear or cyclic strain treatment (33Takei T. Han O. Ikeda M. Male P. Mills I. Sumpio B.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that PKC is involved in cyclic strain-induced Et-1 and MCP-1 gene expression (10Wang D.L. Wung B.S. Shyy Y.J. Lin C.F. Chao Y.J. Usami S. Chien S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 294-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wang D.L. Wung B.S. Peng Y.C. Wang J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cyclic strain to ECs results in a biphasic increase in DAG (17Evans L. Frenkel L. Brophy C.M. Rosales O. Sai Sudhaker C.B. Li G. Du W. Sumpio B.E. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C650-C656Google Scholar) that corresponds to early transient PKC activity followed by sustained elevated PKC activity (33Takei T. Han O. Ikeda M. Male P. Mills I. Sumpio B.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although PKC involvement in mechanical force-induced endothelial responses has been acknowledged (33Takei T. Han O. Ikeda M. Male P. Mills I. Sumpio B.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), studies have indicated only that specific isoforms PKC-ε and PKC-β are involved in shear-induced endothelial response (21Traub O. Monia B.P. Dean N.M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31251-31257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Hu Y.L. Chien S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mechanisms as to what and how PKC isoforms are involved in cellular responses to mechanical forces remain unclear. The present study shows that PKC-α and PKC-ε are sequential activated and are involved in cyclic strain-induced Raf/ERK1/2 activation. Several lines of evidence support this notion. First, the transmigration of PKC-α and PKC-ε from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction was a sequential event (i.e. PKC-α was involved in an early activation, whereas PKC-ε was activated at a late but sustained phase). Second, ECs treated with a PKC inhibitor abolished the Raf-1 phosphorylation by cyclic strain. Third, a sequential association of PKC-α and PKC-ε with the signaling molecule Raf-1 was shown. Fourth, a PKC inhibitor inhibited strain-induced ERK1/2 activation, indicating a crucial role of PKC in the Raf/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Fifth, ECs treated with a Ca2+-dependent PKC inhibitor (Go 6976) showed an inhibition in the early phase but not the late sustained phase of ERK1/2 activation. Sixth, ECs transfected with the antisense to PKC-α inhibited only early and not late ERK1/2 activation, whereas the antisense or inhibitory peptide to PKC-ε suppressed late, sustained ERK1/2 activation. Consistently, an antisense to PKC-α did not inhibit late ERK1/2 activation. All of these data confirm that PKC-α and PKC-ε are sequentially activated and are required for Raf/ERK1/2 activity. Furthermore, ECs treated with an antisense to each PKC isoform significantly reduced the transcriptional activity of Elk1, a downstream substrate of ERK1/2. As a result of decreasing ERK1/2 activity, antisense to each PKC isoform also inhibited MCP-1 transcriptional activity. All of these results indicate that the sequential activation of PKC-α and PKC-ε is essential for Raf/ERK1/2 activation in cyclic strain-treated ECs. The activation of ERK1/2 and its downstream Elk-1 activation may result in gene induction. PKC-α belongs to the family of conventional protein kinases that are Ca2+-dependent, whereas PKC-ε is a novel protein kinase. It is well recognized that when ECs are subjected to hemodynamic forces, Ca2+ mobilization plays an essential role in endothelial responses (20Morawietz H. Talanow R. Szibor M. Rueckschloss U.

This transient DAG release coupled with Ca2+ mobilization may activate PKC-α during the early response of ECs to cyclic strain. PC hydrolysis, however, provides a sustained source of DAG in growth factor-stimulated cells that is compatible with the signaling activity required for long-term response (38Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; (1992), 258: 607-614Crossref Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). Although PKC-α, -δ, -ε, -ζ, and -τ have been identified in ECs (18Haller Z. Ziegler W. Lindschau C. Luft F.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Traub O. Monia B.P. Dean N.M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31251-31257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), only PKC-ε has been implicated to be involved in shear-induced ERK1/2 activity (21Traub O. Monia B.P. Dean N.M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31251-31257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the present cyclic strain study, PKC-α participated in early ERK1/2 activity. Although signaling events by which each PKC isoform activates ERK1/2 remain to be further characterized, PKC involvement in Raf-1 activation and sequential association of PKC isoforms with Raf-1 indicate that PKC-α and PKC-ε contribute to Raf-1/ERK1/2 activation. In addition, the fact that the antisense to each PKC isoform temporally inhibits ERK1/2 activity also suggests that these two PKC isoforms contribute to Raf-1 activation. PKC-α has been reported to phosphorylate and activate Raf-1 (31Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R.

Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). PKC-α can be down-regulated by treating cells with phorbol ester. However, this down-regulation does not inhibit Raf-1 activation stimulated by growth factor (40App H. Hazan R. Zillberstein A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKC-ε can be activated by PC-derived DAG (41Ha K.S. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10534-10539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Raf-1 via PC hydrolysis and PKC-ε phosphorylation was previously indicated to play a role in maintaining sustained activity of Raf-1/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway (42Cai H. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Rapp U. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). PKC-ε overexpression was shown to induce a sustained phosphorylation of MAPK in epidermal growth factor-treated PC12 cells (43Brodie C. Bogi K. Lazarovici P. Petrovics G. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). Another study suggested that PKC-α and PKC-ε enhance the signaling pathway Raf-1/MEK/ERK/TCF, which converges on the serum response element (24Soh, J. W., Lee, E. H., Prywes, E., and Weinstein, I. B. (1999) 19, 1313–1324.Google Scholar). Our previous study demonstrated that the serum response element in the promoter region of Egr-1 is involved in cyclic strain-induced Egr-1 expression (15Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Based on these previous observations and our current findings, it is strongly suggested that both PKC-α and PKC-ε were involved in Raf-1 activation and contributed to the prolonged ERK1/2 activation. Thus, specific PKC isoforms are important in integrating networks of signaling pathways that consequently modulate gene expression in ECs under hemodynamic conditions. The major finding of the present study is that sequential activation of PKC-α and PKC-ε is part of a mechano-sensitive signaling pathway that leads to activation of ERK1/2 and gene induction. In addition to sequential activation of PKC-α and PKC-ε and their temporal association with Raf-1, our antisense studies also showed that there is sequential activation of PKC isoforms in cyclic strain-treated ECs. The use of antisenses to PKC isoforms has an advantage over the use of PKC inhibitors in terms of specificity (44Ueffing M. Lovric J. Philipp A. Mischak H. Kolch W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2971-2977Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 45Dean N.M. Mckay R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11762-11766Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate the activation of PKC-α at 5 min and a late activation of PKC-ε in ECs under cyclic strain. These results are consistent with an earlier report that PKC-ε is required for shear-induced ERK1/2 activity (21Traub O. Monia B.P. Dean N.M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31251-31257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, shear-induced ERK1/2 activity is transient and returns to basal level by 60 min after shear treatment (21Traub O. Monia B.P. Dean N.M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31251-31257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear, and it could be due to the nature of the forces studied. Steady laminar flow produces a constant shear stress to ECs and does not produce macroscopic strain, whereas our strain system offers cyclical changes of stretch to which ECs may be more sensitive. A moderate but sustained PKC activation in cyclic strain-treated ECs was previously reported (33Takei T. Han O. Ikeda M. Male P. Mills I. Sumpio B.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The present study shows that specific PKC isoforms were involved. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that other PKC isoforms may also contribute to ERK1/2 activation, our results clearly show that PKC-α and PKC-ε are sequentially activated and contribute to ERK1/2 activation in ECs under cyclic strain. Recent studies indicate that PKC activation can be modulated by intracellular redox status. H2O2 treatment of cells causes PKC activation, and H2O2-triggered phosphorylation sites of PKC isoforms have been demonstrated (46Konishi H. Tanaka Y. Matsuzaki H,. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). A recent report of glutathione negatively regulating the activation of cellular PKC isoforms further supports that intracellular redox status affects PKC activation (47Ward N.E. Pierce D.S. Chung S.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12558-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that reactive oxygen species, including H2O2, act as second messengers that contribute to hemodynamic force-induced Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 activation and gene expression (12Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Hsieh H.J. Shyy Y.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Intracellular redox changes may modulate PKC activation in our cyclic strain-treated ECs. Since our strain device produced nonhomogeneity of force on the ECs, the possibility of PKC transmigration as the subsequent effect of H2O2 produced during cyclic strain could not be ruled out. Reactive oxygen species acts as a second messenger in growth factor-treated cells (48Sattler M. Winkler T. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is believed to play a role during hypertension-induced vascular injury (49Berk B.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PKC activation may be a ubiquitous response in ECs subjected to growth factor and hemodynamic stimuli. Our finding of PKC-ε involvement in strain-induced ERK1/2 is also consistent with a previous report of PKC-ε requirement in mechano-sensitive ERK1/2 activation (21Traub O. Monia B.P. Dean N.M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31251-31257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The present study clearly demonstrates that PKC isozymes are essential signaling molecules for transduction of cyclic strain. PKC-α and PKC-ε act as Raf-1 activators that lead to a prolonged effect on the MAPK signaling pathway and gene induction. Recent studies indicate that lack of fluid shear flow triggers apoptosis in ECs (50Traub O. Berk B.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The activation of PKC isozymes by cyclic strain serves not only as a signaling response but is also important for cellular growth and survival. Elucidating the signaling mechanism mediated via PKC isozymes in ECs during hemodynamic changes is key for further understanding of endothelial dysfunction during atherosclerosis, hypertension, and reperfusion-induced vascular injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2001303894,"Similar to native peptide/MHC ligands, bacterial superantigens have been found to bind with low affinity to the T cell receptor (TCR). It has been hypothesized that low ligand affinity is required to allow optimal TCR signaling. To test this, we generated variants of Staphylococcus enterotoxin C3 (SEC3) with up to a 150-fold increase in TCR affinity. By stimulating T cells with SEC3 molecules immobilized onto plastic surfaces, we demonstrate that increasing the affinity of the SEC3/TCR interaction caused a proportional increase in the ability of SEC3 to activate T cells. Thus, the potency of the SEC3 variants correlated with enhanced binding without any optimum in the binding range covered by native TCR ligands. Comparable studies using anti-TCR antibodies of known affinity confirmed these observations. By comparing the biological potency of the two sets of ligands, we found a significant correlation between ligand affinity and ligand potency indicating that it is the density of receptor-ligand complexes in the T cell contact area that determines TCR signaling strength."

Because HCN isoforms are highly homologous in the central region, but diverge more substantially in the N and C termini, we asked whether these latter regions could contribute to the determination of channel properties. To this aim, we analyzed activation/deactivation kinetics and the response to cAMP of heterologously expressed isoforms mHCN1 and rbHCN4 and verified that mHCN1 has much faster kinetics and lower cAMP sensitivity than rbHCN4. We then constructed rbHCN4 chimeras by replacing either the N or the C terminus, or both, with the analogous domains from mHCN1. We found that: 1) replacement of the N terminus (chimera N1–4) did not substantially modify either the kinetics or cAMP dependence of wild-type channels; 2) replacement of the C terminus, on the contrary, resulted in a chimeric channel (4-C1), the kinetics of which were strongly accelerated compared with rbHCN4, and that was fully insensitive to cAMP; 3) replacement of both N and C termini led to the same results as replacement of the C terminus alone.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). HCN channel subunits are the molecular building blocks of native hyperpolarization-activated “pacemaker” (f/h) channels of cardiac and neuronal cells (2DiFrancesco D. Annu. Rev.

A peculiar property of HCN channels is their dual modulation by voltage hyperpolarization and by intracellular cAMP (4DiFrancesco D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 512: 367-376Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar); as in voltage-dependent K+ channels, voltage sensing is localized in the S4 transmembrane domain (5Vaca L. Stieber J. Zong X.

Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 439: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, different isoforms have qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different properties. Activation and deactivation kinetics for example are much faster for HCN1 than HCN2 or HCN4, whereas the HCN1 sensitivity to cAMP is much reduced; further, the activation threshold of HCN2 is more negative than that of either HCN1 or HCN4 (15Altomare C. Bucchi A. Camatini E. Baruscotti M. Viscomi C. Moroni A. DiFrancesco D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Moosmang S. Stieber J. Zong X. Biel M. Hofmann F. Ludwig A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).These differences are important in that they can provide a molecular basis for the diverse properties of native channels in various cell types; it is known for example that the Ih current of hippocampal CA1 neurons has faster kinetics and a reduced cAMP sensitivity relative to the same current recorded in other regions (such as the thalamic relay neurons) or in cardiac myocytes (2DiFrancesco D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 455-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar,3Pape H.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 299-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the If activation threshold in cardiac conduction tissue (Purkinje fiber) is substantially more negative than that in pacemaker cells of the sinoatrial node (17DiFrancesco D. Peracchia C. Handbook of Membrane Channels: Molecular and Cellular Physiology. Academic Press, New York1994: 335-343Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, differential expression of HCN isoforms may represent a basic mechanism underlying the variable kinetic and modulatory features of native f/h channels in different tissues.The observation that different isoforms have different features prompts the question of how kinetic and modulatory properties of HCN channels are determined. Because HCN isoforms are highly homologous in the “core” region (i.e. the TM domains S1 to S6) and in the CNB domain but diverge more substantially at both the N and C termini (18Ludwig A. Zong X. Hofmann F. Biel M. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 9: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we asked whether the most diverging regions could have a role in affecting channel properties.In this work we have investigated the contribution of the N- and C-terminal regions to the channel kinetics and sensitivity to cAMP. To this aim, we used chimeras obtained by the replacement of regions of rbHCN4 with equivalent regions of mHCN1 channels. The results indicate that the C terminus, but not the N terminus, of rbHCN4 plays an important role in determining both the rate of channel activation/deactivation and the cAMP-dependent gating, presumably by an interaction with other intracellular channel regions that do not belong to the N terminus.RESULTSThe rationale behind our experimental approach is shown in Fig.1. A comparison among sequence topologies of the various isoforms of HCN channels (Fig. 1 a) indicates that the isoforms are highly homologous in the core region,i.e. the transmembrane (S) and CNB domains, but differ more substantially in the N terminus and the C terminus. To visualize the difference in homology between terminal regions and S and CNB regions, we constructed a multiple alignment sequence (CLUSTAL X (24Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12835-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and plotted the homology function against multiple alignment amino acid position in Fig. 1 b. The plot clearly indicates a high degree of homology in the region encompassing the 6 S and CNB domains, in which most residues are identical for all 4 isoforms, in contrast with the N- and C-terminal regions in which most substitutions are nonconservative. The protein identity between sequence pairs varies in the range 80–90% in the core region (S1 through the CNBD) and in the ranges 21–37% and 11–21% in the N and C termini, respectively (see Fig. 1 legend).Heterologous expression has indicated that although similar qualitatively, the kinetic and modulatory properties of individual isoforms differ quantitatively (8Santoro B.

The mean time constant at the same voltage was 105.6.0 ± 9.8 ms (n = 8) and 3023.1 ± 348.2 ms (n= 17) for isoforms 1 and 4, respectively. We measured activation curves of mHCN1 and rbHCN4 from several cells (see “Experimental Procedures”) and fitted the mean activation curves in Fig.2 c with a Boltzmann distribution equation. This yielded half-activation voltages, V 12 = −71.7 and −81.2 mV, and inverse slope coefficients, s = 8.6 and 10.0 mV for mHCN1 (n = 8) and rbHCN4 (n = 7), respectively. These results confirm previous work indicating that the range of activation of isoforms 1 and 4 are not too dissimilar (15Altomare C. Bucchi A. Camatini E. Baruscotti M. Viscomi C. Moroni A.

Physiol. 2001; 117: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and plotted in Fig. 2 the mean time constant of activation (d) and deactivation (e) for mHCN1 (τon, n = 9; τoff, n = 7 cells) and rbHCN4 (τon, n = 17; τoff,n = 11 cells). Clearly, both activation and deactivation rates for isoform 4 are severalfold slower than those for isoform 1.We then proceeded to verify whether the isoforms investigated have different degrees of sensitivity to internal cAMP. As shown in the sample records of Fig. 3, macro-patch currents were recorded in the inside-out configuration during voltage-clamp hyperpolarizations to the voltages indicated before and after perfusion of the intracellular side of the patch with 10 µm cAMP.In the patches shown in Fig. 3, cAMP shifted the activation curve of mHCN1 and rbHCN4 currents by 7.6 and 17.4 mV, respectively. The mean shifts induced by 10 µm cAMP on the current activation curve were 5.6 ± 0.5 mV (n = 10) and 16.0 ± 0.9 mV (n = 15) for mHCN1 and rbHCN4, respectively. These data confirm previous evidence indicating a different sensitivity to cAMP of isoforms 1 and 4 (11Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M.

Data obtained with two such chimeras are shown in Fig.4.Figure 4Properties of chimeric channels N1–4 (left) and 4-C1 (right). a, schematic representation. b, mean activation curves; curves for wild-type channels from Fig. 2 are also plotted for comparison in both the left and right panels(mHCN1, filled circles; rbHCN4, open circles, no error bars). Fitting experimental data with the Boltzmann equation yielded values of V 12 = −83.5 ands = 12.0 for N1–4 (filled triangles,n = 7); V 12 = −80.6 mV,s = 12.6 mV for 4-C1 (open triangles,n = 5). c, mean activation time constant curves, τon; N1–4, n = 7 (left); 4-C1, n = 8 (right).d, mean deactivation time constant curves, τoff; N1–4, n = 8 (left); 4-C1, n = 6 (right).

The resulting chimera (N1–4) had activation and deactivation time constant curves similar to those of rbHCN4 (Fig. 4,c and d, left). For example, at −105 mV the activation time constant (τon) was 84.1 ± 9.1 ms and 2519.5 ± 386.0 ms for mHCN1 and rbHCN4, respectively, according to the data in Fig. 2 d. The τon of N1–4 current was 1904.1 ± 108.5 ms, not significantly different from the τon of rbHCN4 (p = 0.33). Similarly at −85 mV the deactivation time constant τoffof N1–4 current was 1634.4 ± 326.4 ms, not significantly different from τoff of rbHCN4 (1746.8 ± 305.2 ms,p = 0.81). In the whole voltage range investigated, differences between activation/deactivation time constants for N1–4 and wild-type rbHCN4 channels did not reach the significance level (p = 0.05).In Fig. 4, right, on the other hand, substitution of the C terminus of rbHCN4 (aa 545–1175) with that of mHCN1 (aa 413–910) led to a chimeric channel (4-C1), the activation and deactivation time constant curves of which clearly diverged from those of the wild-type rbHCN4 channel (c and d, right; note that the wild-type channel curves plotted both in left andright panels are the same as in Fig. 2, d ande). At −95 mV, for example, τon was 1423.7 ± 218.2 ms (n = 8) (compare with 3023.1 ms for rbHCN4), and at −85 mV, τoff was 465.0 ± 97.9 ms (n = 5) (compare with 1746.8 ms for rbHCN4). In the whole voltage range investigated, activation and deactivation time constants were intermediate between those of wild type channels. Interestingly, at the most negative voltages, deactivation of 4-C1 was almost as fast as that of mHCN1 (Fig. 4 d,right).The activation curves for both the N and C replacement chimeras fell close to, and in fact nearly overlapped with, the activation curve for the wild-type rbHCN4 channel (Fig. 4 b). Fitting activation curves with Boltzmann equations yielded half-activation voltagesV 12 = −83.5 and −80.6 mV and inverse slope factors s = 12.0 and 12.6 mV for the N1–4 and 4-C1 channels, respectively. These values can be compared with those for rbHCN4 (V 12 = −81.2 mV, s = 10.0 mV, see Fig. 2). To quantify the similarity between the activation curves of N1–4 and 4-C1 chimeras and wild-type rbHCN4 channels, we ran significance tests at voltages close to half-activation. AtV = −95, −85, and −75 mV, values of the activation curve of N1–4 and 4-C1 were not significantly different from those of rbHCN4 (p > 0.28).In the light of the time constant data (Fig. 4, c andd), the similarity between 4-C1 and rbHCN4 activation curves may seem surprising. However, a recent description of HCN channel voltage gating by an allosteric model has shown that changes in the position of the activation curve are attributable to changes in the voltage dependence of voltage sensors, located in the S4 region (15Altomare C. Bucchi A. Camatini E. Baruscotti M. Viscomi C. Moroni A. DiFrancesco D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the results of Fig. 4 b agree with the view that substitution of the C terminus does not impair the voltage-dependent distribution of “willing”versus “reluctant” voltage sensors.The results above suggest that the C terminus of rbHCN4 has a role in controlling voltage-dependent gating. Because the chimera carrying the C terminus of mHCN1 (4-C1) does accelerate both activation and deactivation kinetics of rbHCN4 but not to the extent of reproducing fully the kinetics of mHCN1, the role of the C terminus cannot be unique, and other channel regions are bound to contribute to determining the kinetic properties of rbHCN4. The N terminus of rbHCN4, on the other hand, could be replaced by the N terminus of mHCN1 without substantial modification of activation/deactivation kinetics, suggesting that the N terminus does not have a similarly crucial role in determining channel kinetics.As a way to investigate if the modifications induced by substitution of the C terminus could depend upon the interaction between C and N termini, we proceeded to construct a chimeric channel in which both rbHCN4 termini were simultaneously replaced with those from mHCN1 (Fig.5, N1–4-C1). This chimera had the same kinetic features of 4-C1. A Boltzmann fit of the mean activation curve for N1–4-C1 yielded values of half-activation voltageV 12 of −83.5 ± 0.4 mV and inverse slope factor s = 11.5 ± 0.4 mV (n = 4), which are comparable with the values obtained for 4-C1. Also, the time constants of activation and deactivation (τon, τoff) of N1–4-C1 were not significantly different from those of 4-C1 in the whole voltage range investigated.Figure 5Lack of effect of N terminus replacement. a, representation of the chimera obtained by replacement of the rbHCN4 C terminus with that from mHCN1 (4-C1) and the double-substitution chimera obtained by replacement of the 4-C1 N terminus with that from mHCN1 (N1–4-C1). b, mean activation curves of 4-C1 (open triangles) and N1–4-C1 (filled squares,n = 4). c and d, activation (τon, n = 5) and deactivation (τoff, n = 8) time constant curves for the two mutants (symbols as in b); the activation curve and τon, τoff curves for 4-C1 are the same as in Fig. 4. Also plotted for comparison are the τon and τoff curves of wild-type mHCN1 and rbHCN4 channels (see Fig. 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, we addressed the issue of the cAMP dependence of the channel open probability by analyzing in inside-out patches the response to cAMP of the three chimeras investigated and comparing their response to that of wild-type channels. As shown in the sample records of Fig.6, the response of N1–4 to cAMP was only moderately reduced with respect to rbHCN4 (mean shift of the activation curve with 10 µm cAMP was 11.6 ± 0.7 mV,n = 4), whereas 4-C1 was totally insensitive to cAMP (the shift was 0 mV in n = 13 patches). The lack of a cAMP-induced shift of the 4-C1 activation curve contrasts with the presence of a reduced but measurable shift of 5.6 ± 0.5 mV obtained for the wild-type mHCN1 channel under similar conditions (Fig.3).Figure 6Action of cAMP on HCN chimeras. Current was recorded in inside-out macro-patches from cells expressing the N1–4 (left), 4-C1 chimera (middle), and the double-substitution chimera N1–4-C1 (right). The cAMP-induced shifts of the current activation curve measured in the three samples shown by a “trace superimposition” method (see “Experimental Procedures”) were 12, 0, and 0 mV (left to right). Mean shifts were 11.6 ± 0.7 mV for N1–4 (n = 4), 0 mV for 4-C1 (n = 13), and 0 mV for N1–4-C1 (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The lack of cAMP dependence of the 4-C1 chimera is especially interesting because it indicates that the sensitivity to cAMP is not entirely determined by the cyclic nucleotide consensus region and suggests the presence of specific interactions between the C terminus and other regions of the channel able to affect the mechanism of cAMP-dependent gating. To verify the possible involvement of the N terminus in this interaction, we tested the responsiveness to cAMP of the double N and C termini replacement chimera N1–4-C1. Like the C replacement mutant, this double mutant was also irresponsive to cAMP (a shift of 0 mV was observed in all of the n = 6 patches analyzed). This favors the view that the cAMP sensitivity involves a coupling mechanism between the C terminus and the core channel region, presumably located in one or more intracellular S-linkers.DISCUSSIONOur results indicate that: 1) replacement of the N terminus of rbHCN4 with that from mHCN1 does not alter channel activation and deactivation kinetics (Fig. 4, left) nor does it modify the channel response to cAMP with respect to the wild-type rbHCN4 channel (Fig. 6, left); 2) replacement of the C terminus, on the other hand, leads to a chimeric channel with faster activation and deactivation kinetics (Fig. 4, right) and with total lack of response to cAMP (Fig. 6, middle).These data suggest that the C terminus of rbHCN4 channels participates in controlling voltage-dependent gating; the gating properties are however not determined by the C terminus alone because the 4-C1 chimera did not acquire the kinetics of mHCN1 fully (Fig. 4,right). This indicates that the C terminus could interact with other adjacent regions of the channel to exert its controlling action. Because replacement of the N terminus of 4-C1 with that of mHCN1 did not have any appreciable effects on channel kinetics (Fig.5), channel regions interacting with the C terminus are unlikely to be located in the N terminus and more likely reside within the intracellular S-linker regions and/or the innermost regions of S domains.An interaction of the C terminus with intracellular channel regions is also required to interpret the different response to cAMP of the mutant channels investigated. If binding of cAMP to the CNB domain were the only process responsible for the cAMP-mediated gating, replacement of the rbHCN4 C terminus with the one from mHCN1 should yield a cAMP dependence analogous to that of the wild-type mHCN1 channel. However, neither the single (4-C1) nor the double rbHCN4 mutant (N1–4-C1) carrying the C terminus of mHCN1 had a measurable sensitivity to cAMP (Fig. 6). Thus, after binding cAMP the C terminus must interact with other channel regions to mediate the action of cAMP. Here again, because replacement of the N terminus did not affect the loss of cAMP dependence of the C-terminal mutant 4-C1, channel sites interacting with the C terminus are unlikely to reside in the N terminus.Our data do not allow us to discriminate whether the C terminus-mediated process affecting voltage gating and that affecting the cAMP action share common intracellular mechanisms. However, until a more specific investigation of the residues involved is performed, this remains an intriguing possibility.Although replacement of the rbHCN4 C terminus by that of mHCN1 caused strong acceleration of activation and deactivation rates, it did not modify the activation curve (Fig. 4 b). This apparent contradiction can in fact be reconciled with a recent allosteric model of voltage gating of HCN channels (15Altomare C. Bucchi A. Camatini E. Baruscotti M. Viscomi C. Moroni A. DiFrancesco D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). According to this model, the position of the activation curve reflects two mechanisms: one is"

The peptides are generated by degradation of cellular proteins in the cytosol and are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) molecules (1Townsend A. Trowsdale J. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A number of proteins, such as calnexin and tapasin (2Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B.

Stable binding of a peptide to a given MHC I allele requires the peptides to be 8–9 amino acid residues long and to possess a sequence motif characteristic of that allele (4Van Bleek G.M. Nathenson S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11032Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Rammensee H.G. Falk K. Rotzsche O. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Since the peptides are generated in the cytosol in the absence of guidance by the MHC I molecules, the mechanism whereby peptides with an appropriate MHC I binding length and sequence are generated is unclear. The proteasomes generate peptides of ∼8–9 amino acid residues, among longer peptides. Such peptides also generally contain the correct hydrophobic carboxyl terminus, which is required for binding to most MHC I alleles (6Snyder H.L. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. J. Exp.

We report here the identification of an aminopeptidase activity of an ER luminal chaperone, which (i) is the most abundant component of the ER lumen (13Koch G. Smith M. Macer D. Webster P. Mortara R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 86: 217PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mazzarella R.A. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Melnick J. Argon Y. Immunol.

Binder R.J. McQuade K.L. Immunity. 1998; 6: 657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and (iii) is an ATPase (17Li Z. Srivastava P.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The ability of this aminopeptidase to trim long peptides for optimal MHC I binding is demonstrated functionally. gp96, hsc70, and hsp90 have been purified as described previously (18Srivastava P.K. Methods. 1997; 12: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse gp96, WTr96 and Ala655 r96, were obtained by expression of murine gp96 cDNA in JM109F′ Escherichia coli. Bacteria were lysed in binding buffer (20 mm phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF) in the presence of lysozyme. The lysate was saturated with 60% ammonium sulfate, and the precipitated proteins were applied to and eluted from ProbondTM metal-binding buffer (Invitrogen). The gp96 preparations (mouse and recombinant) were repurified by HPLC on POROS-HQ column and eluted by a linear gradient from 0 to 1m NaCl. The purified fractions were checked for purity by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The immunoaffinity-purified gp96 was a generous gift of Hansjoerg Schild. gp96 was purified using a recombinant single-chain Fv fragment (scFv antibody) generated from a semi-synthetic phage library using mouse native gp96 molecules as described previously (19Arnold-Schild D. Kleist C. Welschoff M. Opelz G. Rammensee H.-G. Schild H. Terness P. Cancer Res. 2000; 16: 4175Google Scholar). All proteins were quantified using the Bradford assay, and bovine serum albumin was used as the standard (Bio-Rad). gp96 in 20 μl of isoelectric focusing buffer (9.5 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% carrier Ampholines: 1.4% pH 5–7, 0.6% pH 3–10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) was loaded into a capillary tube containing 2.9% acrylamide (Bio-Rad), 2% CHAPS, 9.5 m urea, and 2% Ampholines, pH 5–7/3–10. The proteins were focused for 3200 V·h as described previously (20Ménoret A. Patry Y. Burg C. Le Pendu J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 740PubMed Google Scholar). After extrusion, gels were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide slab and electrophoresed at 200 V. The proteolytic activity of gp96 was tested using various endo- and exoprotease substrates (Novabiochem, Laufelfingen, Switzerland) composed of a mono or a poly amino acid peptide covalently bound to the chromophorep-nitroanilide (pNA). Substrates were incubated with proteins at 37 °C in sterile buffer (5 mmphosphate, 0.7 m NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 at pH 7.0). Hydrolysis of the polypeptide chain was quantified by recording the optical density at 405 nm. EL4 cells were labeled with 51Cr during the 70 min of peptide pulsing at 37 °C and were used as targets in a 4-h 51Cr release assay with VSV8-specific CTLs (as described previously (21Suto R. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1995; 269: 1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar)). Homogeneous preparations of gp96 were previously observed to degrade spontaneously into smaller sized polypeptides at 4 °C (18Srivastava P.K. Methods. 1997; 12: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Srivastava P.K. Deleo A.B. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), thus generating a ladder-like pattern of bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig.1 A), suggesting that either gp96 had a proteolytic activity or that the preparations contained a contaminant. The gradual appearance of incrementally smaller sized bands suggested that the activity was not an endopeptidase, but an exopeptidase. gp96 purified to homogeneity, as judged by a single band on SDS-PAGE after silver staining, was tested for aminopeptidase and endopeptidase activities using synthetic substrates. This led to identification of an aminopeptidase activity associated with gp96 preparation (Fig.1 B). The purified preparation was tested for cathepsin G, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, elastase, and subtilisin activities using their specific substrates; no such activities were detected (Fig.1 B). The aminopeptidase activity was abrogated by inhibitors of aminopeptidases such as bestatin and amastatin but not by cystatin, which does not inhibit aminopeptidases (Fig. 1 C). PMSF, a serine protease inhibitor, was observed to significantly inhibit the aminopeptidase activity of gp96, albeit at relatively higher concentrations of the inhibitor. Interestingly, another aminopeptidase, a rat aminotripeptidase, has been shown previously to be inhibited by bestatin as well as by PMSF (23Sachs L. Marks N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 706: 229Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The aminopeptidase activity of gp96 was observed to be calcium-dependent and optimal at 40 °C and a pH of 6.5 (data not shown). gp96 preparations used in the previous experiments were obtained by the conventional method of purification (18Srivastava P.K. Methods. 1997; 12: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The preparations used in the studies described now were obtained by an entirely independent and different method. gp96 was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using a single chain antibody to gp96 (19Arnold-Schild D. Kleist C. Welschoff M. Opelz G. Rammensee H.-G. Schild H. Terness P. Cancer Res. 2000; 16: 4175Google Scholar). The antibody is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv antibody) generated from a semi-synthetic phage library using mouse native gp96 molecules. The scFv antibody clone H11B was immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose 4B, and hypotonic cell lysates were passed over it. Elution of gp96 was performed using phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.3 m NaCl. Immunoaffinity-purified and conventionally purified gp96 were compared for their specific aminopeptidase activities: no differences were observed (Fig.2 A). The gp96 preparation, isolated as described previously (18Srivastava P.K. Methods. 1997; 12: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Srivastava P.K. Deleo A.B. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and repurified by anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatograpy, was subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis with isoelectric focusing in the first dimension followed by SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Three gels were run at the same time under precisely identical conditions and were found to be superimposable by known markers. Silver staining of one gel revealed two elongated spots, and both spots were confirmed to be gp96 by immunoblotting of a second gel with a monoclonal antibody (specific for gp96 (Fig. 2 B). (The monoclonal antibody 9G10 was not raised nor selected using purified gp96 preparations but by independent methods, see Ref. 24Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. McGuire W.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar.) A third gel was dissected into slices in form of a grid; proteins were eluted from each slice and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and for aminopeptidase activity following renaturation of gp96. As in case of a number of other enzymes (25Trudel J. Grenier J. Asselin A. Electrophoresis. 1998; 10: 1788Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the aminopeptidase activity of gp96 could be partially renatured following electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE. The results in Fig. 2 B show that: (i) all slices that contain gp96 possess an aminopeptidase activity, (ii) an aminopeptidase activity is not detected in any slices other than those that contain gp96, and (iii) gp96 is not detected in any slices other than those that contain an aminopeptidase activity (Fig. 2 C). The aminopeptidase activity of recombinant gp96 was tested. Murine gp96 was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The identity of r-gp96 as gp96 was confirmed by immunoblotting with the 9G10 anti-gp96 antibody (Fig.3 A). The r-gp96 and murine gp96 were assayed for aminopeptidase activity in titrated quantities; the two preparations were observed to have identical specific aminopeptidase activities (Fig. 3 B), thus indicating that the aminopeptidase activity of murine gp96 was not a contaminant but an inherent component of the gp96 polypeptide. To test this point further, we sought to introduce mutations in gp96 that might affect the aminopeptidase activity of gp96. The gp96 sequence was scanned for homology with known aminopeptidases and aminopeptidase active sites for the presence of a common motif. No such motif was detected. However, as the aminopeptidase activity of gp96 showed sensitivity to PMSF, which is a serine protease inhibitor, a serine protease motif GXSXG (26David F. Bernard A.M. Pierres M. Marguet D. J. Biol.

The murine gp96 gene cloned in E. coli was mutated such that the serine at position 655 was altered to an alanine (Ala655r96). The Ala655 r96 mutant was observed to be severely compromised in aminopeptidase activity as compared with the wild type r96 (Fig. 4, A andB). Further evidence of differences in activity of the wild type and Ala655 preparations was observed in an in situ assay of aminopeptidase activity (Fig. 4 B). The wild type and the Ala655 gp96 preparations were stored frozen at −20 °C or incubated for 72 h at 37 °C and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the gels with anti-gp96 monoclonal antibody 9G10. Both preparations, stored at either temperature, showed apparently homogeneous bands of 96 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting of the gels showed that both preparations were stable at −20 °C. However, the wild type preparation had begun to degrade at 37 °C, creating the ladder-like patterns seen in Fig. 1, while the Ala655 mutant preparation was still stable at 37 °C. These results are consistent with the abrogation of the aminopeptidase activity in the Ala655 mutant. These data do not imply that the Ala655, or the GWSG site, constitutes the active site of gp96; rather they simply show that a mutation in the primary structure of gp96 can affect its activity profoundly, thus offering extremely strong evidence that the activity is not a contaminant. ER-resident gp96 shares significant homology with the cytosolic hsp90. Neither hsp90 and the unrelated cytosolic HSP, hsp70, nor a control protein phosphorylase b, showed any detectable aminopeptidase activity at all at any of the titrated quantities (10–50 μg) tested (Fig. 4 C). The possibility that the aminopeptidase activity of gp96 molecules can trim peptides longer than 8 or 9 amino acids to MHC I epitopes was tested directly. The ability of precise 8-mer epitopes to sensitize target cells for recognition and lysis by cognate CTLs, and the inability of longer precursors to do so, was used as an assay. A Kb-restricted CTL clone against the vesicular stomatitis virus nucleocapsid protein epitope NH2-RGYVYQGL-COOH (VSV8) was used (Fig. 5). While sensitization of EL4 cells with VSV8 leads to antigen-specific lysis by VSV8-spcific CTLs, no significant recognition of an amino terminus-extended 19-mer peptide VSV19 (NH2-AATYQRTRALVRGYVYQGL-COOH) was observed (Fig. 5 A). However, treatment of VSV19 with increasing quantities of gp96, but not with an unrelated 93-kDa protein, phosphorylase b, leads to an increasing recognition of sensitized EL4 cells, such that at the maximum concentration tested, the VSV8 and gp96-treated VSV19 show an identical ability to sensitize EL4 cells for recognition by the cognate CTLs (Fig. 5 B). The cytotoxicity is not due to the presence of gp96 in the assay as pulsing of EL4 cells with low molecular mass fractions (less than 10 kDa) of gp96-digested VSV19 confers equal susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing (Fig. 5 C). Our experiments show that the ER-resident gp96 is an aminopeptidase and that it can trim NH2-terminally extended peptides. These results are significant because of the now long held belief that the ER must harbor an aminopeptidase activity that can act on TAP-transported antigenic peptides, which have precise MHC I-binding carboxyl termini but variable and extended amino termini (6Snyder H.L.

The present studies show that gp96 is an aminopeptidase that can trim N-terminally extended precursor peptide for optimal MHC I binding and CTL recognition. Previous studies have indicated that gp96 is a major component of the ER lumen (13Koch G. Smith M. Macer D. Webster P. Mortara R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 86: 217PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mazzarella R.A.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and that it binds with peptides transported into the ER through both TAP-dependent (29Lammert E. Arnold D. Nijenhuis M. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Brunner J. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Schild H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 927Google Scholar) and TAP-independent mechanisms (30Arnold D. Wahl C. Faath S. Rammensee H.G. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 461Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Collectively, these considerations make a compelling case for the proposition that gp96 is responsible for further processing of antigenic peptides in the ER, a phenomenon that is well described (6Snyder H.L. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 7Elliott T. Willis A. Cerundolo V. Townsend A. J. Exp.

Several points are of note in this regard. While our studies show that gp96 can trim VSV19 to VSV8, they do not show nor imply that the aminopeptidase activity of gp96 stops at the precise amino terminus necessary for binding to MHC I. That specificity must come from the protective action of the MHC I molecule itself. Second, we must point toward the relatively low aminopeptidase and ATPase enzymatic activities of gp96 in assays in vitro. The ATPase of gp96 has been previously estimated to be 2.5 × 107 times lower than the corresponding activity of adenylate kinase (17Li Z. Srivastava P.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar); the aminopeptidase activity of gp96 is approximately 5 × 106 times lower than the corresponding activity of the aminopeptidase-M (data not shown). It is our belief that the two enzymatic activities are enhanced or otherwise modulated in vivo by presently unidentified co-factors. Third, gp96 is an aminopeptidase while the closely related hsp90, the cytosolic homologue of gp96, is not, indicating that this activity is not a characteristic of chaperones in general. Hsp90 genes are present and expressed in all forms of life, while gp96 genes, although clearly derived from them (31Csermely P. Schnaider T. Soti C. Prohaszka Z. Nardai G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 129Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 32Srivastava P.K. Maki R.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 167: 109Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 33Maki R.G. Eddy Jr, R.L. Byers M. Shows T.B. Srivastava P.K. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 73Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), are of relatively recent vintage. The presence of aminopeptidase activity in gp96 but not in the parent hsp90 molecules mirrors the pattern of ATPase activity found in gp96 but not in hsp90 molecules (17Li Z. Srivastava P.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These two activities appear to have been incorporated into hsp90 genes, along with the addition of an amino-terminal signal peptide and a carboxyl-terminal ER retention KDEL sequence, possibly for an ER-specific function. Finally, the observation that gp96 harbors ATPase and aminopeptidase activities is surprising, but it is not inconsistent with the multiple enzymatic activities of other HSPs. Protein disulfide isomerase, another chaperone of the ER lumen, is an ATPase and a disulfide isomerase (34Guthapfel R. Gueguen P. Quemeneur E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Lon, a mitochondrial chaperone, is an ATPase as well as a serine protease (26David F. Bernard A.M. Pierres M. Marguet D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results do not permit us to make the case that the aminopeptidase activity of gp96 is essential for antigen presentation by MHC I molecules. The classical genetic tools, which are used so elegantly to make such determinations, are unavailable to us because of the versatile role of HSPs in processes other than antigen presentation. Thus, gp96 knockout mice are embryonic lethal. 2R. de Crom, personal communication. However, our data firmly place gp96 molecules at the scene of the crime and in possession of the tools of the crime."
https://openalex.org/W2048112747,"Deamination of cytosine to uracil and 5-methylcytosine to thymine represents a major mutagenic threat particularly at high temperatures. In double-stranded DNA, these spontaneous hydrolytic reactions give rise to G·U and G·T mispairs, respectively, that must be restored to G·C pairs prior to the next round of DNA replication; if left unrepaired, 50% of progeny DNA would acquire G·C → A·T transition mutations. The genome of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum has been recently shown to encode a protein, Pa-MIG, a member of the endonuclease III family, capable of processing both G·U and G·T mispairs. We now show that this latter activity is undetectable in crude extracts of P. aerophilum. However, uracil residues in G·U mispairs, in A·U pairs, and in single-stranded DNA were efficiently removed in these extracts. These activities were assigned to a ∼22-kDa polypeptide named Pa-UDG (P. aerophilum uracil-DNA glycosylase). The recombinantPa-UDG protein is highly thermostable and displays a considerable degree of homology to the recently described uracil-DNA glycosylases from Archaeoglobus fulgidus andThermotoga maritima. Interestingly, neitherPa-MIG nor Pa-UDG was inhibited by UGI, a generic inhibitor of the UNG family of uracil glycosylases. Yet a small fraction of the total uracil processing activity present in crude extracts of P. aerophilum was inhibited by this peptide. This implies that the hyperthermophilic archaeon possesses at least a three-pronged defense against the mutagenic threat of hydrolytic deamination of cytosines in its genomic DNA.

A particular threat is posed by hydrolytic damage to DNA bases that carry exocyclic amino groups. The most frequent of these is the deamination of cytosine (1Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), which results in the formation of uracil and therefore of G·U mismatches in double-stranded DNA. Because uracil will base pair with adenine during the next round of DNA replication, cytosine deamination will result in a G·C → A·T transition mutation if unrepaired. Because cytosine hydrolysis is greatly enhanced at high temperatures (1Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), hyperthermophilic organisms might be expected to be more susceptible to this type of mutation. However, this does not appear to be the case, as the reported spontaneous mutation rates in thermophilic bacteria are similar to those observed inEscherichia coli (2Jacobs K.L. Grogan D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3298-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, hyperthermophilic organisms are apparently more efficient at repairing hydrolytic and oxidative damage to DNA bases (3Koulis A. Cowan D.A. Pearl L.H. Savva R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 143: 267-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We decided to study how uracil is processed in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (4Volkl P. Huber R. Drobner E. Rachel R. Burggraf S. Trincone A. Stetter K.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 2918-2926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has an optimal growth temperature of 100 °C. In most organisms, uracil is removed from DNA by uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs)1 that are encoded by the UNG gene family (5Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). These highly efficient enzymes remove the modified base from all substrates whether they are G·U mismatches, A·U pairs, or single-stranded. Interestingly some organisms including Drosophila melanogaster appear to lackUNG gene homologues. Several years ago we identified a novel mismatch-specific DNA glycosylase, TDG, which removes uracil and thymine from G·U and G·T mispairs, respectively (6Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Nature. 1989; 339: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Neddermann P. Gallinari P. Lettieri T. Schmid D. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although this enzyme is substantially less efficient than UDG in vitro, it appears to be widespread in nature, at least as far as its activity on G·U mispairs is concerned. E. colicontains the mug gene, which encodes a TDG homologue that can process G·U substrates but not G·T mispairs (9Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic TDG homologues are found also in D. melanogaster andSchizosaccharomyces pombe. 2U. Hardeland, M. Bentele, J. Jiricny, and P. Schär, manuscript in preparation. Because of their strong preference for G·U mispairs over A·U pairs or uracil in single-stranded DNA, these enzymes have been assigned primarily an antimutagenic role in DNA metabolism (9Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, homology searches of the genome sequences available for several hyperthermophilic bacteria revealed neither UNG nor Mug homologues (10Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar,11Fitz-Gibbon S. Choi A.J. Miller J.H. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Swanson R. Kim U.J. Extremophiles. 1997; 1: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, Sandigursky and Franklin (12Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 531-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19146-19149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have recently identified uracil-DNA glycosylases encoded in the genomes of the thermophiles Thermotoga maritima (12Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 531-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) andArchaeoglobus fulgidus (13Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19146-19149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which appear to be distantly related to the Mug class of enzymes. Interestingly, in contrast to the mismatch-specific Mug protein, these enzymes can remove uracil from DNA containing either A·U pairs or G·U mispairs as well as from single-stranded DNA substrates. A recent report by Miller and colleagues (14Yang H. Fitz-Gibbon S. Marcotte E.M. Tai J.H. Hyman E.C. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) described the characterization of a P. aerophilum DNA glycosylase that removes uracil and thymine from G·U and G·T mispairs, respectively. This enzyme was shown to be a homologue of the Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum MIG glycosylase, which belongs to the endonuclease III class of enzymes that normally process saturated thymine residues such as thymine glycol and dihydrothymine (5Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). We set out to examine cell-free extracts of the hyperthermophilic archaeon P. aerophilum to characterize the uracil processing activities present. We now report that uracil-containing DNA in these extracts is processed predominantly by a thermostable UDG homologue,P. aerophilum uracil-DNA glycosylase (Pa-UDG), which is most closely related to the T. maritima andA. fulgidus enzymes. Interestingly, although the activity ofPa-MIG was undetectable in the extracts, we obtained first evidence of the existence of a third uracil processing activity that appears to be, unlike Pa-MIG and Pa-UDG, susceptible to inhibition by the uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) peptide, a generic inhibitor of the UNG-type uracil glycosylases. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). The substrate oligonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Restriction enzymes and UGI were supplied by New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). All other chemicals and reagents used were purchased form Sigma, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Amresco, Epicentre Technologies, or Merck and were of analytical grade purity. The E. coli strain DH5α was used for all cloning experiments and for plasmid amplifications, and the strain BL21(DE3) was used for protein expression (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Vol. 3, Appendix A. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmid pET28-paudg is a derivative of pET28c(+) (Novagen) and was used for bacterial expression of an N-terminal His6-tagged Pa-UDG under the control of the Lac operator and the T7 RNA polymerase. LB and SOC media were prepared as described in Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Vol. 3, Appendix A. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The primers used for the PCR amplification of P. aerophilum genomic DNA containingpaudg were paudg3888s (5′-GATCCATATGGCTAGCGATTTGCAAAAGCTTCAT- GAG-3′) andpaudg4434as 5′-GTACGGATCCTCACTTAGACGGG- TCTAAGAAG-3′) carryingNheI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively (bold), which were used for subsequent cloning of the amplified fragment into the pET-28c(+) vector. paudg-specific sequencing primers were paudg3807s (5′-ACGCCTTTCTCTACAGC3-′), paudg4183s (5′-CCCGTACCTCATACAAC-3′), and paudg4167as (5′-GTTGTATGAGGTACGGG-3′). A T7 promoter-specific primer was used for sequencing across the cloning junctions in the pET28c(+) vector. P. aerophilum cultures were grown in the laboratory of Jeffrey Miller (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). The cell-free extracts were prepared by Mahmud Shivji (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Clare Hall Laboratories, London, United Kingdom) according to the protocol described previously (16Hudepohl U. Reiter W.D. Zillig W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5851-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Aliquots of the extract were stored at −80 °C. The purified recombinant P. aerophilum mismatch-specific DNA glycosylase Pa-MIG (14Yang H. Fitz-Gibbon S. Marcotte E.M. Tai J.H. Hyman E.C. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Hanjing Yang (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). The enzyme was stored at −80 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaCl, and 50% glycerol. The candidate protein coding region PAE0651 was identified in the recently completed genome sequence of P. aerophilum (11Fitz-Gibbon S. Choi A.J. Miller J.H. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Swanson R. Kim U.J. Extremophiles. 1997; 1: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 3S. Fitz-Gibbon, personal communication.Analyses of the P. aerophilum genome were performed with the Genetics Computer Group program package, Version 10, 1999 (17Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar); for other data base searches and comparisons, we used the BLAST, FASTA, ENTREZ, and CLUSTALW services provided at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) Web site (www.ebi.ac.uk). The PAE0651 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using the primerspaudg3888s and paudg4434as containingNheI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites in the bacterial expression vector pET28c(+). The DNA sequence of the resulting plasmid (pET28-paudg) was confirmed by cycle sequencing using primers paudg4183s and paudg4167as and the T7 promoter primer. This cloning strategy places the PAE0651 coding sequence downstream of a vector-derived sequence encoding an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the resulting His6-Pa-UDG fusion protein is therefore MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMASDLQKL …(bold residues indicate the authentic Pa-UDG N terminus lacking the initiator methionine; the thrombin cleavage site is underlined). The pET28-paudg expression construct was transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3) cells by electroporation. Following incubation at 30 °C overnight on selective LB plates supplemented with 2% d-glucose, single colonies were picked and used to inoculate 20 ml of LB medium containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin and 2%d-glucose. Following an overnight incubation at 30 °C, 20 ml of the culture were then used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin, and the culture was grown at 30 °C up to A 600 of 0.7–0.9. The expression ofPa-UDG was then induced with 1 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma). After 5 h of incubation at 30 °C, the cells were centrifuged at 8000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min in a Sorvall SLA-3000 rotor. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml/mg sonication buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm imidazole, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed by sonication on ice (25 × 5-s bursts with intermittent chilling for 10 s). The sonicate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was removed and incubated with gentle shaking for 1 h at 4 °C with 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in sonication buffer. The suspension was then packed into a disposable column from which the unbound proteins were eluted with sonication buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (1 × 10 column volumes of 5 mm imidazole, 2 × 2.5 column volumes of 60 mm imidazole). The histidine-tagged Pa-UDG protein was eluted with 3 × 1 column volumes of sonication buffer containing 250 mmimidazole. The 250 mm fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 liters of binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The dialyzed fraction was loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap SP FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the column was washed with 10 ml of binding buffer. The column was then eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 10–600 mm NaCl. The nearly homogenous Pa-UDG protein eluted as a major peak in fractions containing 150–200 mm NaCl. These fractions were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The concentration was estimated to be ∼1 mg/ml as determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The protein was stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. This preparation was assayed for UDG activity. The uracil glycosylase activity ofP. aerophilum extracts or of the purified enzymes was monitored by means of a standardized “nicking assay” as described by Hudepohl et al. (16Hudepohl U. Reiter W.D. Zillig W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5851-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this assay, removal of uracil or thymine from a fluorescently labeled synthetic 60-mer oligonucleotide DNA substrate generates an abasic site, which can be subsequently cleaved by treatment with hot alkali or apurinic or apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease. This reaction generates a 23-mer fragment that can be resolved from the uncleaved 60-mer by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A 60-mer homoduplex with a G·C base pair at position 23 served as a control. This substrate can be cleaved with the restriction endonuclease AccI to generate the diagnostic 23-mer marker fragment shown in Figs. 1 B, 3, and6 A.Figure 3G·U and G·T mismatch processing by crude extracts of P. aerophilum and by the purified recombinant Pa-MIG protein. The DNA substrates were incubated with either 25 µg of P. aerophilum(Pa) extract or with 10 pmol of Pa-MIG for 1 h at 45 °C. Because of the lack of endonuclease activity in the purified enzyme preparation, the reactions with Pa-MIG were stopped by the addition of NaOH to 100 mm and by heating for 10 min at 99 °C. The 23-mer product bands in lanes 4and 6 thus carry 3′-phosphate groups and migrate faster through polyacrylamide gels than the product in the extract reaction (lane 3), which arose through cleavage of the AP site by a hydrolytic AP endonuclease present in the crude extracts that generates fragments carrying 3′-OH groups.

Incubation conditions varied as indicated in the text. Assays involving protein extracts were subjected to digestion with 1 µl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C; those with purified proteins (Pa-MIG or Pa-UDG) were subjected to hot alkaline treatment by the addition of NaOH to 100 mm and incubation for 10 min at 99 °C. Then 0.5 µl of carrier tRNA (10 mg/ml), 110 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 3 volumes of ice-cold absolute ethanol were added, and the samples were chilled for 1 h at −20 °C. DNA precipitates were then collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C, washed in 180 µl of 70% ethanol, and dried for 2 min in a Speed-Vac. The pellet was dissolved in 10 µl of formamide buffer (90% deionized formamide and 1× Tris borate-EDTA without dye markers), heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and immediately chilled on ice. Finally, the reaction products were separated on denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels (pre-run for 20 min at 450 V) by running in 1× Tris borate-EDTA for 8 min at 450 V and then at 300 V until the bromphenol blue dye (loaded in an adjacent lane) migrated to the bottom of the gel. The bands were visualized on a FluoroImager (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics), and the signals were quantified using the ImageQuant software (Version 1.2, Molecular Dynamics). Spontaneous hydrolytic deamination of cytosines in DNA is greatly enhanced at high temperatures (1Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) and generates uracil bases mispaired with guanines. Because the optimal growth temperature ofP. aerophilum is 100 °C but its spontaneous mutation rate is no higher that that of E. coli (2Jacobs K.L. Grogan D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3298-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we anticipated that this organism should possess an efficient base excision repair mechanism capable of rapid restoration of the original G·C base pairs. We first examined the removal of uracil from DNA in crude extracts of P. aerophilum. This was measured as the efficiency of uracil-directed DNA strand incision upon incubation of different DNA substrates with the protein extract. As shown in Fig.1, the P. aerophilum extracts were capable of specific removal of uracil from the double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate containing a single G·U mispair (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 4) as well as from an A·U base pair and from a single-stranded oligonucleotide (Fig.1 B) albeit with lower efficiency. In all cases, the reaction products migrated at the position of the 23-mer marker, which is indicative of a concerted action of uracil-DNA glycosylase and AP endonuclease activities. The G·U processing efficiency was reduced by ∼10% after the addition of an excess of UGI (Fig. 1 A,lane 4), a small polypeptide that specifically inhibits all prokaryotic and eukaryotic UDG homologues encoded by the UNGgene family (Fig. 1A, lane 6) (19Wang Z. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1163-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wang Z.G. Smith D.G. Mosbaugh D.W. Gene. 1991; 99: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but not enzymes belonging to other classes of uracil-DNA glycosylases such as those represented by E. coli Mug (9Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), Homo sapiensSMUG1 (21Haushalter K.A. Todd Stukenberg M.W. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and H. sapiens MBD4 (22Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). This suggested that uracil processing in the P. aerophilum crude extract may be accounted for by at least two distinct types of DNA glycosylase, a major activity that is not inhibited by UGI and a minor activity that is sensitive to this peptide. However, homology searches of theP. aerophilum genome failed to detect genes encoding any UNG-type proteins. To test the effect of temperature on uracil removal from either the double-stranded G·U substrate or from single-stranded DNA, the nicking assay was repeated at different incubation temperatures. The uracil processing activities present in the P. aerophilumextracts were stable at temperatures up to 90 °C (Fig.2), which was anticipated for enzymes of a hyperthermophile. Interestingly, although the processing efficiency of the single-stranded substrate was largely unaffected by incubation temperature, the 60-mer G·U substrate was processed substantially more efficiently at 70 °C than at lower temperatures. This suggests that the enzymatic activity increases with temperature, with the optimum lying between 70 °C and 90 °C under our assay conditions. The activity increase seen at 70 °C was not due to melting of the oligonucleotide duplex; first, this would imply a further improvement at 90 °C, and second, the single-stranded substrate was processed less efficiently at 70 °C than the G·U heteroduplex. However, melting was probably responsible for the observed activity decrease at 90 °C (Fig. 2, lane 4) as the processing of the G·U substrate decreased to the level seen with the single-stranded oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, lane 8). At 100 °C, deamination of 5-methylcytosines is accelerated in parallel with that of cytosines (1Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Whereas the latter process generates G·U mispairs in double-stranded DNA, the former reaction gives rise to G·T mismatches. Several years ago, we described a mismatch-specific thymine/uracil-DNA glycosylase, TDG, which removes thymine and uracil from G·T and G·U mismatches (8Neddermann P. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We were subsequently able to identify and characterize a bacterial homologue of TDG, named Mug, which removes uracil from G·U mispairs but which has no G·T processing ability (9Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). At about the same time, Fritz and colleagues (23Horst J.P. Fritz H.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5459-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) identified a similar activity in the thermophile M. thermoautotrophicum, named Mth.MIG, which also processes G·U and G·T mispairs in a manner analogous to TDG but which belongs to the endonuclease III family of DNA glycosylases. Notably, the MIG gene homologue was recently identified also in P. aerophilum by Miller and colleagues (14Yang H. Fitz-Gibbon S. Marcotte E.M. Tai J.H. Hyman E.C. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the recombinant protein expressed in E. coli was indeed shown to be a mismatch-specific thymine/uracil-DNA glycosylase. We decided to test whether the Pa-MIG activity could be detected in theP. aerophilum crude extracts. Fig.3 (lanes 4 and 6) shows that purified recombinant Pa-MIG enzyme removes uracil and thymine mismatched with guanine with about equal efficiency. In contrast, no G·T processing activity could be detected in the crude cell extracts (Fig. 3, lane 5) even when the sensitivity of the assay was increased by the use of 32P-labeled 90-mer substrates (data not shown). These results, together with the fact thatPa-MIG enzyme does not remove uracil residues from A·U pairs or from single-stranded DNA, imply that this enzyme does not significantly contribute toward the efficient uracil processing activity observed in the P. aerophilum extracts. During the course of these biochemical studies, the complete sequence of the P. aerophilum genome became available. 4S. T. Fitz-Gibbon, H. Ladner, U.-J. Kim, K. O. Stetter, M. I. Simon, and J. H. Miller, submitted. We searched this genome data base for open reading frames encoding homologues of the UNG or the Mug types of uracil-DNA glycosylases, but we failed to find likely candidates. This situation changed following the identification of a uracil-DNA glycosylase in the thermophilic eubacterium T. maritima, Tm-UDG (12Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 531-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This enzyme was shown to be distantly related to Mug (9Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) but displayed a substrate specificity similar to that detected in the P. aerophilum extracts. We therefore carried out a homology search using the amino acid sequence of Tm-UDG. This yielded an ORF encoding a polypeptide with significant homology to Tm-UDG (12Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 531-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and Af-UDG (13Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. J. Biol.

The regulation of SCD is of physiological importance because the ratio of saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids is thought to modulate membrane fluidity. Differential display analysis of retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells identified SCD as a gene regulated by retinoic acid. Two SCD transcripts of 3.9 and 5.2 kilobases in size were found to be expressed in these cells by Northern blot analysis. All-trans-retinoic acid (all-trans-RA) increased SCD mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner; a ∼7-fold increase was observed with 1 µm all-trans-RA at 48 h.SCD mRNA expression was also increased by 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) as well as 4-(E-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl)benzoic acid (TTNPB), a retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-specific agonist. AGN194301, a RARα-specific antagonist, suppressed the SCDexpression induced by all-trans-RA, TTNPB, and 9-cis-RA. These results indicate the involvement of RARα in the induction of SCD expression by retinoic acid. However, AGN194204, a RXR (retinoid X receptor) pan agonist, also increased SCD mRNA expression. This increase was not blocked by AGN194301, suggesting that an RAR-independent mechanism may also be involved.

Palmitate and stearate are the preferred substrates for this enzyme. They are converted to palmitoleate and oleate, respectively (1Enoch H.G. Catala A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol.

This oxidative reaction also requires the participation of 02, NADPH, cytochromeb 5, and cytochrome b 5reductase. Two SCD genes, SCD1 andSCD2, characterized from both rat and mouse, encode functionally active proteins that share >80% sequence homology (3Thiede M.A. Ozols J. Strittmatter P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SCD1 and SCD2 show different tissue-specific expression patterns, possibly because of marked differences in the promoter sequences of their genes (5Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are also two loci forSCD genes in the human genome, one on chromosome 10 and another on chromosome 17 (6). However, the gene on chromosome 17 appears to be a transcriptionally inactive pseudogene. The gene on chromosome 10 encodes the functionally active 359-amino acid SCD protein. This gene yields two transcripts, 5.2 and 3.9 kb in size, which differ in the length of the 3′-untranslated region.The regulation of SCD by dietary factors, hormones, and peroxisomal proliferators has been studied in mouse and rat (7Ntambi J.M.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1384-1394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of SCD is of physiological importance because changes in this enzyme activity could lead to changes in cell membrane phospholipid composition (8Pan D.A. Hulbert A.J. Storlien L.H. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1555-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Palmitoleic and oleic acids are the predominant unsaturated fatty acids present in fat depots and membrane phospholipids (9Kasturi R. Joshi V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12224-12230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of stearate to oleate is thought to control bilayer fluidity and thereby influence membrane function (10Stubbs C.D. Smith A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 89-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Alteration in membrane fluidity leads to increased cell metabolism and differentiation (11Li J. Ding S.F. Habib N.A. Fermor B.F. Wood C.B. Gilmour R.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A high ratio of oleate to stearate is known to initiate apoptotic cell death in neonatal cardiomyocytes (12de Vries J.E. Vork M.M. Roemen T.H. de Jong Y.F. Cleutjens J.P. van der Vusse G.J. van Bilsen M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1384-1394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, low density lipoprotein rich in oleate showed increased resistance to oxidative damage (13Parthasarathy S. Khoo J.C. Miller E. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3894-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Certain fatty acid derivatives are reported to exert antineoplastic activity by inhibiting SCD (14Hovik K.E. Spydevold O.S. Bremer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a polarized monolayer of highly differentiated epithelial cells located between the choroid and the neural retina in the eye (15Bok D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17: 189-195Crossref Google Scholar). It provides nutrients to the photoreceptor cells and carries out phagocytosis and degradation of rod outer segments tips undergoing circadian shedding. RPE cells are indispensable for the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, the visual pigment chromophore. Retinoic acid (RA), a retinoid not involved in the visual process, is generated as a by-product in neural retina and RPE during the interaction of light with the photoreceptors (16McCaffery P. Mey J. Drager U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12570-12574Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RA is required for many cellular functions, and its biological effects are mediated through retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR) in a ligand-dependent manner (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S32-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify RA-regulated genes in human RPE cells in culture by differential display analysis, SCD was identified as one such gene. Two SCD transcripts (5.2 and 3.9 kb in size) are present in RPE cells, and both are up-regulated by RA. The regulation appears to be at the level of transcription and mediated through RAR and RXR.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we report the identification ofSCD as a gene regulated by RA. We employed the RFDD-PCR technique to analyze RA-regulated gene expression in ARPE-19 cells, a human RPE cell line noted for its ability to retain many structural and functional characteristics of intact RPE (29Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). RFDD-PCR has been reported to eliminate the reproducibility problem associated with standard differential display methods (22Matz M. Usman N. Shagin D. Bogdanova E. Lukyanov S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2541-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Gravesen A. Warthoe P. Knochel S. Thirstrup K. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed the presence of two SCD transcripts, 5.2 and 3.9 kb in size, in ARPE-19 cells, and both transcripts exhibited a time- and concentration-dependent increase in response to RA treatment.The regulation of two SCD genes, SCD1 andSCD2, has been studied in mouse and rat, and both genes are regulated by a number of dietary factors, hormones, and peroxisomal proliferators (10Stubbs C.D. Smith A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 89-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 31Bossie M.A. Martin C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6409-6413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kurebayashi S. Hirose T. Miyashita Y. Kasayama S. Kishimoto T. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2115-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Unlike mouse and rat, there is only one functional SCD gene in the human (6Zhang L. Ge L. Parimoo S. Stenn K. Prouty S.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and the regulation of the human SCD gene has not been investigated previously. We have shown here that the SCD gene is regulated by RA in human RPE cells. The regulation of SCD expression by RA is of potential physiological importance because changes in SCD enzyme activity are reported to modulate the cell membrane phospholipid composition (8Pan D.A. Hulbert A.J. Storlien L.H. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1555-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the ratio of saturated to monounsaturated fatty acids, which is thought to control bilayer fluidity and thereby membrane functions (10Stubbs C.D. Smith A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 89-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). A ∼4-fold increase in SCDmRNA expression induced by all-trans-RA resulted in only a 20% increase in SCD enzyme activity. This may be because of a translational deficiency associated with certain genes in cultured RPE cells. These cells are reported to express a large amount of RPE65 mRNA with no detectable amount of RPE65 protein (33Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Harris E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15751-15757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present, we do not know whether the regulation of SCD by RA extends to other cells and tissues as well as to other organisms, but it is interesting to note that Miller et al. (34Miller C.W. Waters K.M. Ntambi J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

They have postulated that the observed effect could be mediated through RA.Both SCD transcripts, 5.9 and 3.9 kb, were present in RPE and retina from human as well as monkey. Photoreceptor cells are known to contain high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and RPE cells constantly remove large amounts of phospholipid-rich photosensitive membranes by phagocytosis of rod outer segments undergoing circadian shedding (35Ershov A.V. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification ofSCD in RPE cells is quite interesting because it may play an important role in the process of complex lipid metabolism and trafficking in the RPE. Moreover, because of its ability to regulate the expression of SCD, RA may also play a critical role in this process.The regulation of gene expression by RA has been studied extensively. RA effects are mediated through the RAR and RXR (36Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar, 37Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). Each of these families consists of three isotypes: α, β, and γ (38Leroy P. Krust A. Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Garnier J.M. Kastner P. Dierich A. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These retinoid receptors modulate gene expression by binding to DNA sequences known as retinoid response elements, retinoid acid response elements, and retinoid X response elements, present in the regulatory region of the target genes (39Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the RA-induced SCDexpression is inhibited by actinomycin D. Thus, the observed regulation of SCD appears to be at the transcriptional level.Retinoid receptors, RARs, and RXRs form RAR-RXR heterodimers or RXR-RXR homodimers in the presence of retinoid ligands (24Nagpal S. Chandraratna R.A.S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These heterodimers or homodimers complexed with retinoid ligands bind to retinoid acid response elements or retinoid X response elements to regulate the transcription of target genes. Northern blot analysis showed that both RARα and RXRα are present in ARPE-19 cells, and their expression is regulated by RA. Gel shift assays using oligonucleotides containing DR5 and DR1 sequences also support the presence of RAR and RXR in RPE cells. DR5 binds selectively to RAR-RXR heterodimers, whereas DR1 preferentially binds to RXR-RXR homodimers (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S32-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). RPE cell nuclear extracts exhibited good binding activity toward both DR5 and DR1. Interestingly, nuclear extracts prepared from RA-treated cells showed markedly increased binding activity toward both oligonucleotides compared with those from untreated cells. Thus, the RPE cells respond to RA by increasing the expression of both RAR and RXR. However, it should be noted that DR1 could also bind to heterodimers of RXR formed with RAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor, or hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (40Rastinejad F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).SCD expression is induced by all-trans-RA, a RAR-specific natural agonist (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S32-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The RAR antagonist AGN194301, a specific and highly effective antagonist of RARα (26Standeven A.M. Johnson A.T. Escobar M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 138: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), completely blocked the all-trans-RA-induced SCD mRNA expression. Because RARs are believed to act generally as heterodimers with RXRs (41Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 42Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar), the regulation of SCD by RA is most likely mediated through the preferred RAR-RXR heterodimer. The inhibition by AGN194301 suggests the involvement RARα in this process as well. It has been reported that the induction of cellular RA binding protein II and Hoxb-1 genes by RA is meditated through retinoid receptor subtype RARα (43Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this study also demonstrated that RAR-RXR heterodimers are involved in the regulation of these genes.SCD expression in ARPE-19 cells is also induced by 9-cis-RA. This retinoid ligand is able to activate target genes through an RXR homodimer or RAR-RXR heterodimer signaling pathway because of its ability to bind both RXR and RAR (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S32-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The induction ofSCD expression by 9-cis-RA is blocked completely by the RARα antagonist AGN194301. Therefore, it is possible that RARα-RXR heterodimer is involved in the 9-cis-RA-induced SCD mRNA expression.The involvement of RAR is supported further by the observation that TTNPB increased the SCD mRNA expression. TTNPB is a synthetic, highly selective RAR agonist with no affinity for RXR (25Bissonnette R.P. Brunner T. Lazarchik S.B. Yoo N.J. Boehm M.F. Green D.R. Heyman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5576-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). TTNPB induced SCD expression, and the induction was blocked completely by AGN194301, an RARα antagonist. AGN194204, an RXR-specific agonist with no affinity toward RAR (28Le X.F. Groner Y. Kornblau S.M. Gu Y. Hittelman W.N. Levanon D. Mehta K. Arlinghaus R.B. Chang K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21651-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), also increasedSCD mRNA expression; this induction was not blocked by AGN194301, a RARα-specific antagonist. Thus, a mechanism that involves RXR, but not RAR, cannot be ruled out.In summary, we have identified SCD as a gene regulated by RA. Both the (5.2 and 3.9 kb) transcripts of SCD are expressed in human RPE cells, and their expression is greatly increased by RA. The regulation of SCD expression by RA appears to be mediated through RAR and RXR. Because SCD is a regulatory enzyme in the lipid metabolic pathway, its response to RA may play an important role in the pathophysiology of human retinal pigment epithelium. It remains to be elucidated if the regulation of SCD by RA extends to other tissues and cells. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD, EC1.14.99.5),1 a microsomal enzyme, catalyzes the initial desaturation of long chain saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids. Palmitate and stearate are the preferred substrates for this enzyme. They are converted to palmitoleate and oleate, respectively (1Enoch H.G. Catala A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5095-5103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1549-1558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This oxidative reaction also requires the participation of 02, NADPH, cytochromeb 5, and cytochrome b 5reductase. Two SCD genes, SCD1 andSCD2, characterized from both rat and mouse, encode functionally active proteins that share >80% sequence homology (3Thiede M.A. Ozols J. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13230-13235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,4Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SCD1 and SCD2 show different tissue-specific expression patterns, possibly because of marked differences in the promoter sequences of their genes (5Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are also two loci forSCD genes in the human genome, one on chromosome 10 and another on chromosome 17 (6). However, the gene on chromosome 17 appears to be a transcriptionally inactive pseudogene. The gene on chromosome 10 encodes the functionally active 359-amino acid SCD protein. This gene yields two transcripts, 5.2 and 3.9 kb in size, which differ in the length of the 3′-untranslated region. The regulation of SCD by dietary factors, hormones, and peroxisomal proliferators has been studied in mouse and rat (7Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10925-10930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Pan D.A. Hulbert A.J. Storlien L.H. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1555-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 9Kasturi R.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1384-1394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of SCD is of physiological importance because changes in this enzyme activity could lead to changes in cell membrane phospholipid composition (8Pan D.A. Hulbert A.J. Storlien L.H. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1555-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Palmitoleic and oleic acids are the predominant unsaturated fatty acids present in fat depots and membrane phospholipids (9Kasturi R. Joshi V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12224-12230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of stearate to oleate is thought to control bilayer fluidity and thereby influence membrane function (10Stubbs C.D. Smith A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 89-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Alteration in membrane fluidity leads to increased cell metabolism and differentiation (11Li J. Ding S.F. Habib N.A. Fermor B.F. Wood C.B. Gilmour R.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A high ratio of oleate to stearate is known to initiate apoptotic cell death in neonatal cardiomyocytes (12de Vries J.E. Vork M.M. Roemen T.H. de Jong Y.F. Cleutjens J.P. van der Vusse G.J. van Bilsen M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1384-1394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, low density lipoprotein rich in oleate showed increased resistance to oxidative damage (13Parthasarathy S. Khoo J.C. Miller E. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3894-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Certain fatty acid derivatives are reported to exert antineoplastic activity by inhibiting SCD (14Hovik K.E. Spydevold O.S. Bremer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a polarized monolayer of highly differentiated epithelial cells located between the choroid and the neural retina in the eye (15Bok D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17: 189-195Crossref Google Scholar). It provides nutrients to the photoreceptor cells and carries out phagocytosis and degradation of rod outer segments tips undergoing circadian shedding. RPE cells are indispensable for the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, the visual pigment chromophore. Retinoic acid (RA), a retinoid not involved in the visual process, is generated as a by-product in neural retina and RPE during the interaction of light with the photoreceptors (16McCaffery P. Mey J. Drager U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12570-12574Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RA is required for many cellular functions, and its biological effects are mediated through retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR) in a ligand-dependent manner (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S32-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify RA-regulated genes in human RPE cells in culture by differential display analysis, SCD was identified as one such gene. Two SCD transcripts (5.2 and 3.9 kb in size) are present in RPE cells, and both are up-regulated by RA. The regulation appears to be at the level of transcription and mediated through RAR and RXR. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we report the identification ofSCD as a gene regulated by RA. We employed the RFDD-PCR technique to analyze RA-regulated gene expression in ARPE-19 cells, a human RPE cell line noted for its ability to retain many structural and functional characteristics of intact RPE (29Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). RFDD-PCR has been reported to eliminate the reproducibility problem associated with standard differential display methods (22Matz M. Usman N. Shagin D. Bogdanova E. Lukyanov S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2541-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Gravesen A. Warthoe P. Knochel S. Thirstrup K. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed the presence of two SCD transcripts, 5.2 and 3.9 kb in size, in ARPE-19 cells, and both transcripts exhibited a time- and concentration-dependent increase in response to RA treatment.The regulation of two SCD genes, SCD1 andSCD2, has been studied in mouse and rat, and both genes are regulated by a number of dietary factors, hormones, and peroxisomal proliferators (10Stubbs C.D. Smith A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 89-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 31Bossie M.A. Martin C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6409-6413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kurebayashi S. Hirose T. Miyashita Y. Kasayama S. Kishimoto T. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2115-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Unlike mouse and rat, there is only one functional SCD gene in the human (6Zhang L. Ge L. Parimoo S. Stenn K. Prouty S.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and the regulation of the human SCD gene has not been investigated previously. We have shown here that the SCD gene is regulated by RA in human RPE cells. The regulation of SCD expression by RA is of potential physiological importance because changes in SCD enzyme activity are reported to modulate the cell membrane phospholipid composition (8Pan D.A. Hulbert A.J. Storlien L.H. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1555-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the ratio of saturated to monounsaturated fatty acids, which is thought to control bilayer fluidity and thereby membrane functions (10Stubbs C.D. Smith A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 89-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). A ∼4-fold increase in SCDmRNA expression induced by all-trans-RA resulted in only a 20% increase in SCD enzyme activity. This may be because of a translational deficiency associated with certain genes in cultured RPE cells. These cells are reported to express a large amount of RPE65 mRNA with no detectable amount of RPE65 protein (33Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Harris E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15751-15757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present, we do not know whether the regulation of SCD by RA extends to other cells and tissues as well as to other organisms, but it is interesting to note that Miller et al. (34Miller C.W. Waters K.M. Ntambi J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) observed that retinol palmitate feeding increased SCD1 expression in vitamin A-deficient mice. They have postulated that the observed effect could be mediated through RA.Both SCD transcripts, 5.9 and 3.9 kb, were present in RPE and retina from human as well as monkey. Photoreceptor cells are known to contain high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and RPE cells constantly remove large amounts of phospholipid-rich photosensitive membranes by phagocytosis of rod outer segments undergoing circadian shedding (35Ershov A.V. Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification ofSCD in RPE cells is quite interesting because it may play an important role in the process of complex lipid metabolism and trafficking in the RPE. Moreover, because of its ability to regulate the expression of SCD, RA may also play a critical role in this process.The regulation of gene expression by RA has been studied extensively. RA effects are mediated through the RAR and RXR (36Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar, 37Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). Each of these families consists of three isotypes: α, β, and γ (38Leroy P. Krust A. Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Garnier J.M. Kastner P. Dierich A. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These retinoid receptors modulate gene expression by binding to DNA sequences known as retinoid response elements, retinoid acid response elements, and retinoid X response elements, present in the regulatory region of the target genes (39Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the RA-induced SCDexpression is inhibited by actinomycin D. Thus, the observed regulation of SCD appears to be at the transcriptional level.Retinoid receptors, RARs, and RXRs form RAR-RXR heterodimers or RXR-RXR homodimers in the presence of retinoid ligands (24Nagpal S. Chandraratna R.A.S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These heterodimers or homodimers complexed with retinoid ligands bind to retinoid acid response elements or retinoid X response elements to regulate the transcription of target genes. Northern blot analysis showed that both RARα and RXRα are present in ARPE-19 cells, and their expression is regulated by RA. Gel shift assays using oligonucleotides containing DR5 and DR1 sequences also support the presence of RAR and RXR in RPE cells. DR5 binds selectively to RAR-RXR heterodimers, whereas DR1 preferentially binds to RXR-RXR homodimers (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S32-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). RPE cell nuclear extracts exhibited good binding activity toward both DR5 and DR1. Interestingly, nuclear extracts prepared from RA-treated cells showed markedly increased binding activity toward both oligonucleotides compared with those from untreated cells. Thus, the RPE cells respond to RA by increasing the expression of both RAR and RXR. However, it should be noted that DR1 could also bind to heterodimers of RXR formed with RAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor, or hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (40Rastinejad F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).SCD expression is induced by all-trans-RA, a RAR-specific natural agonist (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S32-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The RAR antagonist AGN194301, a specific and highly effective antagonist of RARα (26Standeven A.M. Johnson A.T. Escobar M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 138: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), completely blocked the all-trans-RA-induced SCD mRNA expression. Because RARs are believed to act generally as heterodimers with RXRs (41Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 42Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar), the regulation of SCD by RA is most likely mediated through the preferred RAR-RXR heterodimer. The inhibition by AGN194301 suggests the involvement RARα in this process as well. It has been reported that the induction of cellular RA binding protein II and Hoxb-1 genes by RA is meditated through retinoid receptor subtype RARα (43Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this study also demonstrated that RAR-RXR heterodimers are involved in the regulation of these genes.SCD expression in ARPE-19 cells is also induced by 9-cis-RA. This retinoid ligand is able to activate target genes through an RXR homodimer or RAR-RXR heterodimer signaling pathway because of its ability to bind both RXR and RAR (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S32-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The induction ofSCD expression by 9-cis-RA is blocked completely by the RARα antagonist AGN194301. Therefore, it is possible that RARα-RXR heterodimer is involved in the 9-cis-RA-induced SCD mRNA expression.The involvement of RAR is supported further by the observation that TTNPB increased the SCD mRNA expression. TTNPB is a synthetic, highly selective RAR agonist with no affinity for RXR (25Bissonnette R.P. Brunner T. Lazarchik S.B. Yoo N.J. Boehm M.F. Green D.R. Heyman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5576-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). TTNPB induced SCD expression, and the induction was blocked completely by AGN194301, an RARα antagonist. AGN194204, an RXR-specific agonist with no affinity toward RAR (28Le X.F. Groner Y. Kornblau S.M. Gu Y. Hittelman W.N. Levanon D. Mehta K. Arlinghaus R.B. Chang K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21651-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), also increasedSCD mRNA expression; this induction was not blocked by AGN194301, a RARα-specific antagonist. Thus, a mechanism that involves RXR, but not RAR, cannot be ruled out.In summary, we have identified SCD as a gene regulated by RA. Both the (5.2 and 3.9 kb) transcripts of SCD are expressed in human RPE cells, and their expression is greatly increased by RA. The regulation of SCD expression by RA appears to be mediated through RAR and RXR. Because SCD is a regulatory enzyme in the lipid metabolic pathway, its response to RA may play an important role in the pathophysiology of human retinal pigment epithelium.

Bazan N.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification ofSCD in RPE cells is quite interesting because it may play an important role in the process of complex lipid metabolism and trafficking in the RPE. Moreover, because of its ability to regulate the expression of SCD, RA may also play a critical role in this process. The regulation of gene expression by RA has been studied extensively. RA effects are mediated through the RAR and RXR (36Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar, 37Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). Each of these families consists of three isotypes: α, β, and γ (38Leroy P. Krust A. Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Garnier J.M. Kastner P. Dierich A. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These retinoid receptors modulate gene expression by binding to DNA sequences known as retinoid response elements, retinoid acid response elements, and retinoid X response elements, present in the regulatory region of the target genes (39Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 61-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the RA-induced SCDexpression is inhibited by actinomycin D. Thus, the observed regulation of SCD appears to be at the transcriptional level. Retinoid receptors, RARs, and RXRs form RAR-RXR heterodimers or RXR-RXR homodimers in the presence of retinoid ligands (24Nagpal S. Chandraratna R.A.S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These heterodimers or homodimers complexed with retinoid ligands bind to retinoid acid response elements or retinoid X response elements to regulate the transcription of target genes. Northern blot analysis showed that both RARα and RXRα are present in ARPE-19 cells, and their expression is regulated by RA. Gel shift assays using oligonucleotides containing DR5 and DR1 sequences also support the presence of RAR and RXR in RPE cells. DR5 binds selectively to RAR-RXR heterodimers, whereas DR1 preferentially binds to RXR-RXR homodimers (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S32-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). RPE cell nuclear extracts exhibited good binding activity toward both DR5 and DR1. Interestingly, nuclear extracts prepared from RA-treated cells showed markedly increased binding activity toward both oligonucleotides compared with those from untreated cells. Thus, the RPE cells respond to RA by increasing the expression of both RAR and RXR. However, it should be noted that DR1 could also bind to heterodimers of RXR formed with RAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor, or hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (40Rastinejad F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). SCD expression is induced by all-trans-RA, a RAR-specific natural agonist (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S32-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The RAR antagonist AGN194301, a specific and highly effective antagonist of RARα (26Standeven A.M. Johnson A.T. Escobar M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 138: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), completely blocked the all-trans-RA-induced SCD mRNA expression. Because RARs are believed to act generally as heterodimers with RXRs (41Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 42Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar), the regulation of SCD by RA is most likely mediated through the preferred RAR-RXR heterodimer. The inhibition by AGN194301 suggests the involvement RARα in this process as well. It has been reported that the induction of cellular RA binding protein II and Hoxb-1 genes by RA is meditated through retinoid receptor subtype RARα (43Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this study also demonstrated that RAR-RXR heterodimers are involved in the regulation of these genes. SCD expression in ARPE-19 cells is also induced by 9-cis-RA. This retinoid ligand is able to activate target genes through an RXR homodimer or RAR-RXR heterodimer signaling pathway because of its ability to bind both RXR and RAR (17Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S32-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The induction ofSCD expression by 9-cis-RA is blocked completely by the RARα antagonist AGN194301. Therefore, it is possible that RARα-RXR heterodimer is involved in the 9-cis-RA-induced SCD mRNA expression. The involvement of RAR is supported further by the observation that TTNPB increased the SCD mRNA expression. TTNPB is a synthetic, highly selective RAR agonist with no affinity for RXR (25Bissonnette R.P. Brunner T. Lazarchik S.B. Yoo N.J. Boehm M.F. Green D.R. Heyman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5576-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). TTNPB induced SCD expression, and the induction was blocked completely by AGN194301, an RARα antagonist. AGN194204, an RXR-specific agonist with no affinity toward RAR (28Le X.F. Groner Y. Kornblau S.M. Gu Y. Hittelman W.N. Levanon D. Mehta K. Arlinghaus R.B. Chang K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21651-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), also increasedSCD mRNA expression; this induction was not blocked by AGN194301, a RARα-specific antagonist. Thus, a mechanism that involves RXR, but not RAR, cannot be ruled out. In summary, we have identified SCD as a gene regulated by RA. Both the (5.2 and 3.9 kb) transcripts of SCD are expressed in human RPE cells, and their expression is greatly increased by RA. The regulation of SCD expression by RA appears to be mediated through RAR and RXR. Because SCD is a regulatory enzyme in the lipid metabolic pathway, its response to RA may play an important role in the pathophysiology of human retinal pigment epithelium. It remains to be elucidated if the regulation of SCD by RA extends to other tissues and cells. We are grateful to Todd Duncan and Geetha Kutty for help and valuable suggestions and to Drs. Ignacio Rodriguez and Ernesto Moreira for providing eye tissue RNA samples."
https://openalex.org/W2129100059,"Activity-dependent changes in gene expression involving the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) occur in learning and memory, pain, and drug addiction. This mechanism may also be important for cytomegaloviral infections of the brain. The human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoter/enhancer (hCMV promoter), rate-limiting for productive cytomegalovirus infection, contains five cAMP-response elements (CREs). Indirect evidence suggests that this promoter does not function in unstimulated neurons. Here we test the hypothesis that expression from the hCMV promoter in neurons is induced by membrane depolarization. For these experiments, we infected cultured sympathetic and hippocampal neurons with hCMV-green fluorescent protein (GFP) promoter/reporter constructs using adenoviral gene transfer techniques and measured transgene expression by quantifying GFP fluorescence and GFP mRNA levels. We found that depolarization up-regulates promoter activity by >90-fold. Moreover, our results from pharmacological experiments suggest that this induction occurred through a CREB-dependent pathway. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis of all five CREs in the promoter blocked this up-regulation almost completely, whereas mutating four of them had no effect. We conclude that the hCMV promoter acts as a molecular switch in neurons and is strongly induced by membrane depolarization, neuronal activity, or other stimuli that activate CREB. These results may provide insight into molecular mechanisms of cytomegalovirus-related diseases of the brain."

Incubation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Env-expressing cells with an excess of CD4 and co-recepeptor-bearing target cells resulted in an influx of an impermeant nucleic acid-staining fluorescent dye into the Env-expressing cells. The dye influx occurred concomitant with cell fusion. No influx of dye into target cells was observed if they were incubated with an excess of Env-expressing cells. The permeabilization of Env-expressing cells was also triggered by CD4·co-receptor complexes attached to Protein G-Sepharose beads in the absence of target cells.

White J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5674-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and anchored in the viral membrane by the GP41 transmembrane protein. The surface of the spike, GP120, is associated by non-covalent interactions with each subunit of the trimeric GP41 (6Kowalski M. Potz J. Basiripour L. Dorfman T. Goh W.C. Terwilliger E. Dayton A.

There are striking similarities between structural motifs in GP120-GP41 and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) leading to the notion that the native conformation of GP41 is metastable and it is stabilized by GP120 (7Gallaher W.R.

Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar), which enables the GP41 to bring about the merging membranes (17Munoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K.

The concept of the viral hairpin is based on the structure of the GP41 ectodomain core, which is a six-helix bundle composed of three helical hairpins, each consisting of an N helix paired with an antiparallel C helix (19Chan D.C.

This structure shows similarity to the proposed fusogenic structures of envelope fusion proteins from influenza, Moloney murine leukemia virus, simian parainfluenza virus 5, Ebola virus, and simian immunodeficiency virus, as well to the snarepin fusion machinery involved in intracellular fusion events (23Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Many studies demonstrate that conformational changes in HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein can be induced by soluble CD4 (sCD4). For example, binding of sCD4 to the envelope glycoprotein complexes of particular HIV-1 strains results in dissociation of GP120 from the GP41 glycoprotein (24Moore J.P. McKeating J.A. Weiss R.A. Sattentau Q.J. Science. 1990; 250: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 25Dimitrov D.S. Hillman K. Manischewitz J. Blumenthal R. Golding H.

Some of the variable loops (V1/V2 and V3) on the HIV-1 GP120 glycoprotein change conformation or become more exposed upon sCD4 binding, indicated by the enhanced binding of several anti-GP120 antibodies (28Sullivan N. Sun Y. Sattentau Q. Thali M. Wu D. Denisova G. Gershoni J. Robinson J. Moore J. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regions in GP120 that are exposed upon engagement of CD4 are involved in chemokine-receptor binding (29Trkola A. Dragic T. Arthos J. Binley J.M. Olson W.C. Allaway G.P. Cheng-Mayer C. Robinson J.

To capture GP41 following interaction of GP120-GP41 either with sCD4 or with cellular receptors, Weiss and co-workers (18Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct.

DP178 tagged with an influenza HA epitope (178HA) binds to the N-terminal coiled coil of GP41 in a pre-hairpin conformation, which becomes available when the GP120 clamp is released. The 178HA presumably binds to the N-terminal coiled coil of GP41 in a pre-hairpin conformation, which becomes available when the GP120 clamp is released. Interestingly, in some viral isolates (notably HXB2) this conformation becomes available to DP178 following incubation with sCD4, whereas other isolates require cell surface-expressed CD4 and co-receptor to induce this intermediate. In this study we have triggered conformational changes in HIV-1 Env by incubating HIV-1 Env-expressing cells with either an excess of target cells bearing CD4 and cognate co-receptor or with CD4·co-receptor complexes that were previously attached to beads (31Xiao X.

The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lifted off using cell dissociation buffer, pelleted at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended at a final density of 107cells/ml in lysis buffer, which contained 1% Brij-97, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.2), 20 mmEDTA, protease inhibitors (1 µg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstanin), and 5 mm iodoacetamide. Incubation continued 1–3 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. After the cell lysis, the cell nuclei were pelleted by centrifuging at 17,000 × g for 25 min in a refrigerated Eppendorf centrifuge. Then, 1.5–3 µg of immunoprecipitating antibodies and 15 µl of suspension of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) prewashed with phosphate-buffered saline were added to each 1-ml supernatant. The beads were left overnight for 14 h at 4 °C on a rotator to bind the mAb and conjugated CD4/co-receptor. Then they were washed four times with ice-cold lysis iodoacetamide-free buffer and once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and aliquoted ready for use. The amount of CD4 attached to beads was quantitated by comparing the signal to that of a calibration curve from Western blots of known quantities of sCD4 (36Xiao X. Norwood D. Feng Y.R. Moriuchi M. Jones-Trower A. Stantchev T.S. Moriuchi H. Broder C.C. Dimitrov D.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 68: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Calcein (485/525) and calcein blue (322/435) acetoxymethyl (AM) esters, and Sytox Orange (547/570) were all products from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). To monitor dye redistribution as a result of fusion HIV-1 Env-expressing cells and target cells were loaded with calcein-AM and calcein blue-AM, respectively, as described previously (17Munoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The acetoxymethyl ester penetrates into the cells, where it is hydrolyzed to form the impermeant dye. Images of cells stained with the three dyes were acquired using an Olympus IX70 inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with an 82,000 filter cube from Chroma Technology Corp., a ×20 Ph1 PlanFluor objective (NA = 0.40), and Princeton Instrument, Inc. MicroMax cool CCD with 16-bit 1300 × 1300 pixel Interline chip. To perform kinetic experiments, the Env-expressing cells were washed 3 times with RPMI without serum, overlaid with 1 ml of 0.25 µg/ml Sytox Orange solution in RPMI (without serum), and the Petri dish was placed on the microscope stage thermostated at 37 °C. After reaching thermal equilibrium (within 10 min) about 5000 beads were added expressing CD4·co-receptor complex suspended in 100 µl of RPMI without serum. As the beads touched the cell layer images were acquired. The kinetics of Sytox Orange influx was recorded by acquiring and processing images every minute for 25 min after adding the beads, using MethaMorph 4.0 (Universal Imaging) software (15Jones P.L. Korte T. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In a previous study (15Jones P.L. Korte T. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) we attempted to monitor CD4 and co-receptor-induced conformational changes of cell surface-expressed GP120-GP41 in the context of the fusion reaction using a fluorescent dye, which binds to hydrophobic groups. We reasoned that drastic changes in conformation would expose hydrophobic surfaces on GP120-GP41. Although the observed fluorescence changes maintained the specificity of the fusion reaction, we could not rule out the possibility that those changes are due to perturbations of the membranes of GP120-GP41-expressing cells. We explored this issue further using a high-affinity nucleic acid stain, Sytox Orange, which penetrates only cells with compromised plasma membranes. To provide a sufficient amount of CD4 and co-receptor to drive massive conformational changes in GP120-GP41 we incubated HIV-1IIIB-expressing cells with an excess of NIH3T3.CD4.X4 target cells. Figs. 1, B andC, show redistribution of cytoplasmic dyes calcein blue and calcein green between target cells and Env-expressing cells as a result of HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion. In addition, an influx of Sytox Orange influx into the Env-expressing cells was observed when the target cells were added in excess of Env-expressing cells (Fig.1 D). Interestingly, the calcein blue and green had not completely leaked out of the fused cells, suggesting that the perturbations allowing Sytox influx may be transient. By contrast, when Env-expressing cells were incubated with an equivalent amount of target cells, we observed redistribution of the cytoplasmic dyes between Env-expressing cells and target cells as a result of HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion (Fig. 1, F and G), but no influx of Sytox Orange into either cell (Fig. 1 H). Presumably there was a sufficient amount of CD4 and co-receptor available to drive fusion, without damage to the Env-expressing cells. When Env-expressing cells were added in excess the redistribution of cytoplasmic dyes was observed (Fig. 1, J and K) without leakage from either target or effector cell (Fig.1 L). These data indicate that massive conformational changes induced in GP120-GP41 result in perturbation of the HIV-1 Env-expressing membrane. To characterize this phenomenon in more detail we used CD4 and co-receptor-associated beads to trigger the initial steps of the fusion reaction. Fig. 2 shows the relative amounts of CD4 complexed with CXCR4 or CCR5 attached to beads. Although the amount of CD4 in CD4 × 4 complexes is about 10 times reduced compared with the amount of CD4 in the CD4R5 complexes, these data allow us to quantify the response of GP120-GP41-expressing cells to these complexes at similar levels of CD4. We monitored the Sytox fluorescence increase at 37 °C as a function of time. The fluorescence intensity is a measure of the rate of Sytox influx through the membrane and, hence, for the degree of membrane perturbation. Fig. 3 shows fluorescence changes in HIV-1Ba-L envelope glycoprotein-expressing cells, which occurred because of their interactions with CD4.R5 beads. After 12 min the fluorescence intensity is enhanced in cells, which surround the beads, and after 25 min all the cells in the field are stained with Sytox Orange. We also observe fluorescence increases in cells, which are not bound by beads. These are presumably due to the direct interaction between HIV-1 Env on the cells and CD4·co-receptor complexes, which dissociate from beads as a result of injection of a concentrated CD4/co-receptor/bead suspension at 4 °C into a dilute medium at 37 °C. The integrated fluorescence from individual GP120-GP41Ba-L-expressing cells was monitored at 37 °C as a function of time following addition of beads associated with the CD4.R5 complex or with CCR5 only (Fig.4 A). Each point represents an average of the intensities from 10 to 20 cells in the image area. The changes in the GP120-GP41Ba-L-expressing cells induced by CD4.R5 beads are rapid as compared with those seen with the CCR5 beads that do not trigger conformational changes in GP120-GP41Ba-L in the absence of CD4 (14Salzwedel K. Smith E.D. Dey B. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fig.4 B shows that addition of sCD4, which did not cause a detectable effect, followed by addition of R5 beads did activate the GP120-GP41Ba-L- expressing cells to a similar extent as compared with CD4.R5 beads. This is consistent with the reported activation of co-receptor-dependent fusion following incubation of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-expressing cells with sCD4 (14Salzwedel K. Smith E.D. Dey B. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows the average fluorescence intensity per cell after 25 min of interaction of the beads with HeLa cells expressing the R5 utilizing envelope glycoprotein. The fluorescence intensity observed with beads with the highest amount of CD4.R5 was set to 100 and the intensities induced by the different receptor-associated beads were normalized with respect to that highest intensity. A 10-fold dilution of the level of CD4.R5 complexes on the beads leads to a 70% decrease in the fluorescence intensity induced in cells. Beads containing those complexes at a 100-fold lower amount showed a response in cells, which was close to the background. At similar levels of CD4, the CD4.R5 beads evoked a three times higher response in GP120-GP41Ba-L-expressing cells than CD4.X4 beads. Conversely, in GP120-GP41LAI-expressing cells, the response induced by CD4.X4 beads was 8 times higher as compared with that induced by CD4.R5 beads at similar levels of CD4·co-receptor complexes (Fig.5 B). Thus, the specificity of the response with respect to interactions of the GP120-GP41 with their cognate co-receptor is preserved in this assay. To further examine the specificity of the reaction we applied inhibitors of the GP120-chemokine receptor interaction and of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated fusion. These include MIP-1β and RANTES, and SDF-1α, the natural ligands for CCR5 and CXCR4, respectively (37Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2388) Google Scholar). We also examined the effects of synthetic C peptides (peptides corresponding to the C helix), which potently inhibit membrane fusion by both laboratory adapted strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 (38Jiang S. Lin K. Strick N. Neurath A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), plausibly by interfering with the formation of the viral hairpin intermediate (18Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 40Chen C.H. Matthews T.J. McDanal C.B. Bolognesi D.P. Greenberg M.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3771-3777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.6 shows that MIP-1β, inhibits the response induced by CD4.R5 beads in cells expressing the R5 utilizing envelope glycoprotein in a concentration-dependent manner. RANTES was somewhat less inhibitory: at 1 µg/ml RANTES showed around 30% decrease in the fluorescence response, whereas that concentration of MIP-1β inhibited more than 60%. By contrast, 1 µg/ml SDF-1α did not significantly decrease the CD4.R5-induced response. The peptide C34, which is a potent inhibitor of GP41 coiled-coil formation (41Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), inhibited the response in a concentration-dependent manner. This indicates that the changes in membrane permeability observed when CD4 and co-receptor bearing beads interact with cell surface-expressed GP120-GP41, occur as a result of GP41 coiled-coil formation. Interestingly, the concentration of peptide required for a similar inhibition of Sytox influx was about an order of magnitude higher in the case of DP178, which does not contain the amino acids that bind to the cavity formed by a cluster of residues in the N helix coiled coil (41Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and interacts with the N-terminal peptides with low affinity (42Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway Jr., S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Three amphipatic α-helices in the cytoplasmic domain of GP41 have been shown to perturb lipid bilayers (44Miller M.A. Cloyd M.W. Liebmann J. Rinaldo C.R.J. Islam K.R. Wang S.Z. Mietzner T.A. Montelaro R.C. Virology. 1993; 196: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 45Srinivas S.K. Srinivas R.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Compans R.W. J. Biol.

To examine the possibility that conformational changes induced in the extracytoplasmic domain of GP120-GP41 may lead to perturbations due to secondary associations of these “lytic peptides” with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane we used a GP120-GP41LAI construct truncated at amino acid 752 (33Earl P.L. Koenig S. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 31-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which does not contain any of the lytic peptide sequences but is still fusion competent. Fig.7 shows a similar effect with the truncated GP41 to that seen with the full-length GP41, indicating that certain peptides corresponding to sequences in the extra-cytoplasmic domain of HIV-1 Env are responsible for the observed change in membrane permeability. Fig. 7 shows that HIV-1 Env with a deletion mutation of the GP120-GP41 cleavage site did not produce the effect, indicating that fusion-active GP120-GP41 is required. In this study, we show that interactions of Env-expressing cells with an excess of CD4 and co-receptor-bearing target cells results in the influx of the impermeant dye Sytox into the Env-expressing cells (Fig. 1). The Sytox influx occurs concomitantly with HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion as shown by redistribution of cytoplasmic dyes between target and effector cells. No Sytox influx was observed into the target cells even when incubated with an excess of Env-expressing cells. When the interactions between GP120-GP41, CD4, and co-receptors leading to fusion are limited, minor membrane perturbations are induced at the region of cell-cell contact and the Sytox influx is not observed. Since only a small number of activated Envs are required to drive HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion (47Freed E.O. Delwart E.L. Buchschacher Jr., G.L. Panganiban A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 48Kuhmann S.E. Platt E.J. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7005-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), generally fusion will not be accompanied by leakage. The fact that the concentrations of C-terminal GP41 peptides required to inhibit CD4 and co-receptor-induced leakage (Fig. 6) are higher than those required to inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion (43Kliger Y. Gallo S.A. Peisajovich S.G. Munoz-Barroso I. Avkin S. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) is consistent with the notion that fewer Envs need to be activated for the latter process. However, driving the fusion reaction to an undesired outcome (from the viral entry point of view) revealed an important intermediate, which sheds light on the overall mechanism of HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion. Using CD4 and co-receptor-bearing beads we have measured the kinetics of this first step in the HIV-1 fusion reaction (Figs. 3 and4). The CD4 and co-receptor-induced permeabilization of Env-expressing cells occurred with the same specificity with respect to co-receptor usage as cell fusion (Fig. 5). Natural ligands for the co-receptors and C-terminal GP41 peptide inhibitors of HIV-1 fusion blocked this effect (Fig. 6). While the extent of colocalization of CD4 and co-receptor in cells is very limited in the absence of GP120 (49Singer I.I. Scott S. Kawka D.W. Chin J. Daugherty B.L. DeMartino J.A. DiSalvo J. Gould S.L. Lineberger J.E. Malkowitz L. Miller M.D. Mitnaul L. Siciliano S.J. Staruch M.J. Williams H.R. Zweerink H.J. Springer M.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3779-3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) we were able to attach sufficient amounts of the complexes to beads (Fig. 2) to trigger the fusion reaction. Silver staining of proteins immunoprecipitated by the anti-CCR5 mAb 5C7 showed bands that are not specific to CCR5, because they were immunoprecipitated in CCR5-negative cells (31Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L. Broder C.C. Sattentau Q.J. Dimitrov D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, control experiments with beads attached to the mAB 5C7 containing lysates from cells infected with vaccinia CCR5 or CXCR4 recombinants showed background responses (Figs. 4 and 5) when added to appropriate Env-expressing cells indicating that these contaminants do not contribute to destabilization of Env-expressing membranes. We also excluded the possibility that lipids are present on the bead surface by incorporating bodipy-labeled fluorescent fatty acids into the cells, which become metabolically transformed into phospholipids and glycosphingolipids (43Kliger Y. Gallo S.A. Peisajovich S.G. Munoz-Barroso I. Avkin S. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 50Kasurinen J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1594-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Preparation of beads from these cells showed no fluorescence associated with beads indicating absence of lipids. We can therefore rule out the possibility that the observed increased permeability is due to fusion of Env-expressing cells with portions of CD4-chemokine receptor containing membranes attached to beads. Although the 4G10 and 5C7 mAbs recognize the extracellular domains of the respective co-receptors, the CD4 and co-receptor-attached beads interact with GP120 in a predicted fashion in that GP120 binds specifically to its cognate co-receptor and sCD4 binds to co-receptor attached beads. To attach the C-terminal end of the co-receptor to beads, we have used C9-tagged CCR5 stably expressed in Cf2Th canine thymocytes (51Mirzabekov T. Bannert N. Farzan M. Hofmann W. Kolchinsky P. Wu L. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28745-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Beads attached to the 1D4 antibody, which binds C9 tagged-CCR5-CD4 complex, produced similar responses when added to HIV-1Ba-L-Env-expressing cells as those seen in Figs. 3 and4. How do conformational changes triggered by CD4 and co-receptor cause membrane de-stabilization? The simplest explanation is that the triggering causes a release of the GP41 fusion peptide from a buried position within the GP120-GP41 trimer allowing it to insert into the envelope glycoprotein-expressing membrane. This notion is based on the striking similarities between structural motifs in GP120-GP41 and influenza HA (7Gallaher W.R. Ball J.M. Garry R.F. Griffin M.C. Montelaro R.C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1989; 5: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 8Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Sattentau Q.J. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Although it is generally assumed that the fusion peptide inserts into the target membrane following its release from inside the stem (2Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Calder L.J. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), a number of models hypothesize that the interaction of the fusion peptides with the viral membrane is a necessary step of the fusion process (52Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Schoch C. Blumenthal R. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 95-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 53Kozlov M.M. Chernomordik L.V. Biophys.

J. 2000; 78: 886-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the case of influenza HA, evidence for self-insertion of fusion peptides comes from photolabeling studies (55Weber T. Paesold G. Galli C. Mischler R. Semenza G. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18353-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and electron microscopic observations (56Wharton S.A. Calder L.J. Ruigrok R.W. Skehel J.J. Steinhauer D.A. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the interaction of cell surface-expressed GP120-GP41 with CD4 and cognate co-receptor attached to beads brings about a de-stabilization of the membrane expressing its own GP120-GP41, presumably due to self-insertion of the fusion peptide. Relocation of the fusion peptide to the target membrane following the CD4 and co-receptor-induced conformational changes in GP120-GP41 would initiate de-stabilization of the target, rather than the GP120-GP41-expressing bilayer. Our studies, however, reveal that de-stabilization of the envelope-expressing membrane occurs at an early stage of the HIV-1 cell fusion reaction. A number of studies with synthetic fusion peptides from the N-terminal sequence of HIV-1 GP41 indicate that they are capable of destabilizing membranes causing the release of lipid vesicle contents (57Rafalski M. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7917-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 58Nieva J.L. Nir S. Muga A. Goni F.M. Wilschut J.

Gordon L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1139: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have also observed that adding a synthetic HIV-1 GP41 fusion peptide at concentrations less than 1 µg/ml to cultured cells results in Sytox influx into these cells. The insertion of the peptide into the outer monolayer of the membrane presumably results in a rapid expansion of the area of the outer monolayer (62Longo M.L. Waring A.J. Hammer D.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1430-1439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 63Blumenthal R. Morris S.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The bending stress of the outer monolayer may be relieved by rapid flip-flop of phospholipid (64Raphael R.M. Waugh R.E. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1374-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and peptide from outer to inner monolayer followed by the formation of nanometer-scale pores. The self-insertion models, which have been developed for influenza HA, could readily be applied to GP120-GP41. According to the model proposed by Kozlov and Chernomordik (53Kozlov M.M. Chernomordik L.V. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1384-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), insertion of the fusion peptide into the viral membrane is followed by re-folding of the HA2 core into a trimeric coiled coil, which exerts forces that pull the membrane-associated fusion peptides. The elastic energy derived from the bending of the membrane around HA trimer into a saddle-like shape then drives self-assembly of these trimers. As a result, the viral envelope glycoprotein-expressing membrane will form a dimple within a ring-like cluster of HA2 coiled coils bulging out toward the bound target membrane. Bending stresses in the lipidic top of the dimple will cause local de-stabilization and facilitate membrane fusion. In addition, according to a hypothesis proposed Bentz (54Bentz J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 886-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), a second barrage of conformation changes may result in the expulsion of the fusion peptide and the creation of a hydrophobic defect in the Env-expressing membrane leading to three possible outcomes. 1) Recruitment of lipid from the outer monolayer of the target membrane will result in fusion. 2) Lipid flip-flop from the inner monolayer of the viral envelope glycoprotein-expressing membrane will result in leakage. 3) Lateral diffusion of lipids from the outer monolayer of the viral envelope glycoprotein-expressing membranes will result in healing and no changes are observed. Thus, by forcing the system into a pathway which is unfavorable for HIV-1 entry we have revealed an important intermediate in the HIV-1 fusion cascade. We are grateful to Drs. H. Golding, P. Earl, L. Wu, C. Broder, V. Kewalramani, D. Littman, and NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program for the supply of cell lines and reagents. We also thank Drs.

In the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) leader, a hairpin structure with a palindrome-containing loop is termed the dimer initiation site (DIS), because it triggers in vitro RNA dimerization through base pairing of the loop-exposed palindromes (kissing loops). Controversy remains regarding the region responsible for HIV-2 RNA dimerization. Different studies have suggested the involvement of the transactivation region, the primer binding site, and a hairpin structure that is the equivalent of the HIV-1 DIS hairpin. We have performed a detailed mutational analysis of the HIV-2 leader RNA, and we also used antisense oligonucleotides to probe the regions involved in dimerization. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that the DIS hairpin is the main determinant for HIV-2 RNA dimerization. The 6-mer palindrome sequence in the DIS loop is essential for dimer formation. Although the sequence can be replaced by other 6-mer palindromes, motifs that form more than two A/U base pairs do not dimerize efficiently. The inability to form stable kissing-loop complexes precludes formation of dimers with more extended base pairing. Structure probing of the DIS hairpin in the context of the complete HIV-2 leader RNA suggests a 5-base pair elongation of the DIS stem as it is proposed in current RNA secondary structure models.

For HIV-11 and other retroviruses, it has been observed by electron microscopy that the most stable contact point between the two RNAs is located within a region close to their 5′ends, the so-called dimer linkage structure (DLS) (3Höglund R.

First, RNA dimers have been reported to be preferentially packaged, and the DLS may actually be part of the packaging signal (5Fu W. Rein A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5443-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Darlix J.-L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barre-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Second, the dimeric state facilitates template switching during reverse transcription, thereby minimizing the effects of physical damage to the RNA genome. Third, template switching may allow recombination and thereby increase the genetic diversity and adaptability of retroviruses (reviewed in Ref. 7Götte M. Li X. Wainberg M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Retroviral RNA dimerizes spontaneously in vitro when incubated in cation-containing buffers (6Darlix J.-L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barre-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 8–19). For HIV-1, it was initially suggested that guanine quartets located downstream of the splice donor site, the “downstream DLS,” are responsible for dimerization (8Awang G. Sen D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11453-11457Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C. Darlix J.L. Mougel M. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B.

A. 1993; 90: 3393-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The presence of similar guanine stretches in other retroviruses led to the idea that interstrand guanine tetrad formation may serve as a general mechanism for retroviral dimerization (16Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C. Darlix J.L. Mougel M. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, in vitro studies with bovine leukemia virus and HIV-2 RNA indicated that dimerization occurs independently of the downstream DLS (9Berkhout B. Oude Essink B.B. Schoneveld I. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Katoh I. Yasunaga T. Yoshinaka Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1830-1839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an observation that has also been supported by studies with infectious HIV-1 virus particles (14Haddrick M. Lear A.L. Cann A.J. Heaphy S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Clever J.L. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3407-3414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive mutational analysis of the HIV-1 untranslated leader identified the so-called dimer initiation site (DIS) as an essential motif for in vitro dimerization (15Laughrea M. Jette L. Biochem. 1994; 33: 13464-13474Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8209-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 DIS is located immediately upstream of the splice donor site and consists of a hairpin structure with an exposed palindromic sequence within its loop. According to the proposed model for dimer formation, contact between two DIS hairpins is initiated by base pairing of the palindromes, termed loop-loop kissing (15Laughrea M. Jette L. Biochem. 1994; 33: 13464-13474Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Heat treatment or incubation with the viral nucleic acid-binding nucleocapsid protein, which acts as a chaperone, melts the DIS stem and triggers the formation of a dimer with extended interstrand base pairing. This transition is usually referred to as the conversion of the loose dimer (kissing-loop complex) into the tight dimer form (extended duplex) (23Laughrea M. Jette L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Muriaux D. De Rocquigny H. Roques B. Paoletti J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33686-33692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Whereas the requirements for in vitro dimerization of HIV-1 RNA are well defined, the in vivo mechanism seems more complex. Studies of maturing HIV-1 and Moloney murine leukemia virus particles have indicated the existence of an early and a late dimeric RNA form with a different thermal stability and electrophoretic mobility (5Fu W. Rein A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5443-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fu W. Gorelick R.J. Rein A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5013-5018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two RNA conformations may correspond to the kissing-loop complex and the extended dimer, the loose and tight dimer, respectively. The effect of mutations in the DIS hairpin on virus replication is not very severe, rendering viral infectivity somewhat reduced because of diminished packaging of the RNA genome. Remarkably, packaged RNA exists as dimers with a thermal stability that is similar to that of the wild type genome (21Clever J.L. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3407-3414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Berkhout B. van Wamel J.L.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6723-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sakuragi J.-I. Panganiban A.T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3250-3254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relatively minor dimerization defects have been reported in some studies (14Haddrick M. Lear A.L. Cann A.J. Heaphy S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Laughrea M. Jette L. Mak J. Kleiman L. Liang C. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3397-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate the importance of additional sequence motifs in the viral genome that are essential for in vivo RNA dimerization. The determinants for HIV-2 RNA dimerization are poorly understood. Although the overall structure of the HIV-2 leader RNA is similar to that of HIV-1 (29Berkhout B. Progr. Nucl. Acid. Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including a DIS hairpin motif with a palindromic loop sequence, controversy remains about the region that is essential for HIV-2 dimer formation. Different studies have suggested an involvement of the transactivation region (TAR) hairpin (9Berkhout B. Oude Essink B.B. Schoneveld I. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the primer binding site (PBS) (30Jossinet F. Lodmell J.S. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5598-5604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or the DIS hairpin (26Berkhout B. van Wamel J.L.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6723-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Berkhout B. Progr. Nucl. Acid. Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We performed a detailed mutational analysis to determine which regions are involved in dimerization of the HIV-2 genome. We found that the DIS hairpin mediates efficient RNA dimerization, both as an isolated hairpin and in the context of the HIV-2 leader RNA. Analysis of mutant DIS hairpins indicates that a palindrome in the loop is important for efficient dimerization. Although several 6-mer palindromic sequences do support RNA dimerization, increasing the number of A/U nucleotides within the palindrome reduces the dimerization efficiency. Furthermore, RNA structure probing and phylogenetic analysis of the leader RNA sequence in different viral isolates suggests that the DIS hairpin exists in an extended form with a stem region of 12 base pairs. These results indicate that a very similar RNA dimerization mechanism is operating in all members of the HIV-SIV immunodeficiency viruses. All transcripts were generated using the Ambion Megashortscript T7 transcription kit according to the accompanying protocol. In the case of radioactively labeled transcripts, 1 µl of [α-32P]UTP (0.33 MBq/µl) was added to the transcription mixture. Transcripts were purified on 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by either UV shadowing or autoradiography. Upon overnight elution in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), the RNA was ethanol-precipitated, redissolved in water, and quantified by UV absorbance measurements or scintillation counting. Transcript stock solutions were renatured by heating to 85 °C and slow cooling to room temperature. Aliquots of all transcripts were stored at −20 °C. The templates for transcription were made by PCR amplification of the plasmid HIV-2 Ψ large, which contains a T7 promoter directly upstream of the +1 position of wild type HIV-2 ROD sequence (31Oude Essink B.B. Das A.T. Berkhout B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All primer sequences are listed in Table I. Templates for transcripts starting at the +1 position were generated using the upstream T7 +1 primer and a downstream primer that ends at the position corresponding to the transcript name. Templates for transcription of RNA starting at +126 and +397 were generated using upstream primers starting at the indicated positions to which the T7 promoter sequence had been fused (Table I; T7 +126 and T7 +397) and downstream primers as described above. Templates for transcription of 1/444 DIS mutants were made by PCR mutagenesis, using the upstream T7 +1 primer and downstream primers in which the wild type antisense DIS palindrome sequence was altered to produce the desired mutation (Table I). PCR fragments were excised from agarose gels, purified using the QIAEX II DNA isolation system, and used in T7 transcription.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyPrimer namePrimer sequenceUpstream T7 primersHIV-2 T7 +1GAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGHIV-2 T7 +126GAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGCACGCTTGCTTGCTTAAAAAHIV-2 T7 +397GAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCTCCTAGAAAGGCGCGGGCDownstream/antisense primers20/1AGCCTCTCCGCAGAGCGACC40/21CTCCCAGGGCTCAATCTGCC60/41CTGCTAGTGCTGGAGAGAAC80/61AGGGAACACCCAGGCTCTAC100/81AGTGCTGGTGAGAGTCTAGC124/105GGCCGTCTGCCCAGCACCGG144/125TTTTTAAGCAAGCAAGCGTG165/146CTGGCAGCTTTATTAAGAGG184/165CACACTTAACTTGCTTCTAA217/198ATGACCAGGCGGCGACTAGG237/218GTTACTCAGGTGAACACCGA270/251AAAGCAAGAAGGGTCCTAAC290/271CTGCTAGGGATTTTCCTGCC320/303GTCCCTGTTCAGGCGCCA350/331CGTGTTCCAAGACTTCTCAG379/360TCCTGCCGCCCTTACTGCCT418/399GGCCCGCGCCTTTCTAGGAG426/405TGGTACCTCGGCCCGCGCCT444/425CGCTCCACACGCTGCCTTTG464/445CCGGAGGCCTCTTCTCCTCC484/465GTGTAGGTACTTACCTTCAC507/488AAGCCCTTTCGGCTACAGTT527/508CTGTCTAAAGGTAGGATAGC544/525CTCCCACAATCTTCTACCTGDIS mutagenesis primers1-aThe mutant DIS palindrome sequence is underlined.444 DIS S mutantCGCTCCACACGCTGCCTTTCCTACCTCGG444 DIS SIVsykCGCTCCACACGCTGCCTTTTGTACATCGG444 DIS HIV-1BCGCTCCACACGCTGCCTTTGCGCGCTCGG444 DIS HIV-1A/SIVcpzCGCTCCACACGCTGCCTTTGTGCTCTCGG444 DIS SIVmndCGCTCCACACGCTGCCTTTGTTAACTCGG444 DIS D mutantCGCTCCACACGCTGCCTTTGCTCGG444 DIS UP mutantCGCTCCACACGCTGCCTTTGTCGACTCGG1-a The mutant DIS palindrome sequence is underlined. Open table in a new tab Unless otherwise indicated, ∼2 pmol of radiolabeled RNA was incubated in 10 µl of dimerization buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl) for 10 min at 65 °C, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. 5 µl of native gel loading buffer (30% glycerol with bromphenol blue dye) was added, and samples were analyzed on 4% native polyacrylamide gels containing 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE). Gels were run at 150 V at room temperature followed by drying and autoradiography. In the MgCl2 titration experiments, RNA was incubated either in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA or buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, with 0.1, 1, or 5 mm MgCl2. Approximately 250 ng (2 pmol) of transcript 1/444 in 10 µl of dimerization buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl) was incubated for 10 min at 65 °C in the presence of 50-fold molar excess of 20-mer antisense oligonucleotides (100 pmol), the sequence of which corresponds to the numbering of the given oligonucleotide (Table I). Incubation was followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Samples were analyzed on 0.25 × TBE gels as mentioned previously. 2 µg of target RNA (transcript 1/544) was incubated for 15 min in 100 µl of buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.5 µg of carrier antisense human 18 S ribosomal RNA transcribed from the Ambion control template. For chemical probing, 2 µl of DMS or DEPC was added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by ethanol precipitation, followed by extensive washing in 70% ethanol. Samples were dissolved in 15 µl of water. For enzymatic probing, 0.02 units of RNase One (Promega) or 2 units of RNase T1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 µl of 10% SDS and phenol extraction. The RNA was ethanol-precipitated and redissolved in 15 µl of water. DNA oligonucleotides for primer extension analysis were labeled with γ-ATP as follows: 100 ng of DNA primer 484/509 was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 10 µl of T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm spermidine, pH 8.2) with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2 µl of γ-ATP (0.33 MBq/µl). Approximately 2 ng of labeled primer was added to 0.25 µg of target RNA in hybridization buffer (83 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm KCl). Annealing was performed by heating to 85 °C for 2 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. 5 µl of 3 × concentrated RT buffer (9 mm MgCl2, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm of each dNTP, and 150 µg/ml actinomycin D) was added, together with 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). Reverse transcription was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C and stopped by addition of 15 µl of sequencing stop buffer. Sequence analysis of the template HIV-2 Ψ large, corresponding to the target RNA, was performed with radiolabeled DNA primer 484/509, using the United States Biochemicals T7 sequenase kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of HIV-2 and SIV isolates were downloaded from the HIV data base (hiv-web.lanl.gov/). Secondary structure predictions were performed using the Mfold version 3.0 algorithm (32Zuker M. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999Google Scholar, 33Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Sequences were sent to the Macfarlane Burnet Centre Mfold server (mfold.edu.burnet.au/) and analyzed with standard settings. Radioactively labeled transcripts, mimicking different regions of the untranslated leader RNA of the HIV-2 isolate ROD, were synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase (Fig.1). We will first compare the nested set of transcripts 1/124, 1/379, and 1/444 for their dimerization ability. These mutant transcripts contain one or more of the motifs that have previously been suggested to be responsible for HIV-2 dimerization, namely the TAR hairpin (1/124), the PBS region (1/379), and the DIS hairpin (1/444). An increasing amount of these transcripts (10–1000 ng) was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min and slowly cooled to room temperature in a standard dimerization buffer with 5 mmMgCl2 to promote the formation of tight dimers. Samples were subsequently subjected to electrophoresis on a native TBE gel, followed by autoradiography (Fig. 2). The transcripts containing either the TAR hairpin (1/124) or the TAR hairpin and the PBS region (1/379) dimerize very poorly, even at the highest RNA concentration. In contrast, transcript 1/444 that includes the DIS region forms dimers with very high efficiency. We measured 20% dimers with 50 ng of transcript (35 nm) and up to 80% dimers with 1000 ng of RNA (0.7 µm). This indicates that the leader domain from position 379 to 444, which contains the proposed DIS hairpin structure, is essential for in vitrodimerization of the HIV-2 RNA.Figure 2Concentration-dependent dimerization of HIV-2 transcripts. We compared transcripts 1/124, 1/379, and 1/444, of which 10 (lanes 1, 6, and11Clever J. Sassetti C. Parslow T.G. J.

The samples were analyzed on a 4% native TBE gel followed by autoradiography. The monomer (M) and dimer (D) bands of transcripts 1/124, 1/379, and 1/444 are marked 1,2, and 3, respectively. A weak band comigrates with the M2 band (lanes 6Darlix J.-L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barre-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 7Götte M.

Three additional transcripts 1/184, 126/379, and 126/444 were included, of which the latter two lack the TAR hairpin (Fig. 1). The transcripts were incubated either in TEN buffer with 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA or in a buffer with 40 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and an increasing MgCl2 concentration (0.1, 1, or 5 mm). At 0.1 mm Mg2+, the DIS-containing RNAs 1/444 and 126/444 form dimers, albeit at low efficiency (Fig. 3, lanes 14and 22). In the absence of Mg2+, a certain level of dimerization could also be reached by inclusion of 100 mm Na+ (lanes 13 and 21). Dimerization is barely detectable for any of the other transcripts, even at the highest Mg2+ and Na+ concentrations tested, whereas dimer formation of the DIS containing transcripts 1/444 and 126/444 is strongly enhanced at 5 mm MgCl2. The absence of TAR in transcript 126/444 only decreased the dimerization efficiency marginally, confirming that the TAR hairpin is not essential for DIS-mediated RNA dimerization. These combined results indicate that sequences in the 379/444 region, which overlaps the DIS hairpin, are responsible for HIV-2 RNA dimerization. Furthermore, this dimerization is concentration-dependent and stimulated by 5 mm MgCl2, which is very similar to results obtained for RNA dimerization mediated by the HIV-1 DIS motif (8Awang G. Sen D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11453-11457Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,16Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C. Darlix J.L. Mougel M. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Scanning of transcripts with antisense oligonucleotides provides an alternative way of mapping the sequences involved in dimerization. We incubated transcript 1/444, in dimerization buffer with 5 mm MgCl2, with a series of antisense oligonucleotides that cover the entire transcript length. The transcript and a 50-fold molar excess of DNA oligonucleotide were incubated at 65 °C and DNA/RNA hybrids were allowed to form during slow cooling. The annealing positions of the oligonucleotides on the HIV-2 transcript are indicated in Fig.4. Although it is possible that some oligonucleotides may not remain annealed to the transcript during gel electrophoresis, we observed that several oligonucleotides affected the gel migration of the monomeric transcript. Such effects were more prominent in gels that were run for an extended period (results not shown), but some of the more profound effects are visible in Fig. 4(e.g. with antisense oligonucleotides 80/61 and 320/303–444/425, lane 5 and lanes 15–20, respectively). This change in migration is caused either directly by oligonucleotide binding or indirectly by the induction of a conformational change of the RNA. None of the antisense oligonucleotides that target the TAR hairpin, the poly(A) hairpin, or the PBS affect the level of dimerization. The three oligonucleotides, 418/399, 426/407, and 444/425, that target different parts of the DIS domain inhibit dimerization almost completely. Oligonucleotide 426/407, which shields the entire DIS palindrome sequence, has the most profound effect. To analyze the sequence requirements for efficient dimerization, we synthesized a series of 1/444 transcripts with a mutated DIS palindrome (Fig. 5A). Compared with the wild type transcripts containing the GGUACC palindrome (Fig.5 B, lane 1), we measured a complete inability to form dimers for the substitution mutant GGUAGG and the deletion mutant GΔC that have disrupted palindromes (Fig.5 B, lanes 2 and 7, respectively). This result indicates that the DIS hairpin must contain a 6-mer palindrome in the loop to facilitate dimerization. Furthermore, the formation and/or stability of the dimers is influenced by the composition of the palindrome. Mutant transcripts with the alternative palindromes GCGCGC and GUGCAC that are present in other HIV-SIV viral isolates, or the unnatural palindrome GUCGAC, each with two or less A/U nucleotides in the 6-mer sequence, dimerize at levels that are similar to that of the wild type transcript (lanes 4, 5, and8). In contrast, mutants UGUACA and GUUAAC with four A/U nucleotides in their palindromes form dimers at an extremely low efficiency (lanes 3 and 6). Computer analysis with the Mfold algorithm indicated that all dimerization-defective mutants fold the DIS hairpin as shown in Fig. 5. Transcripts that contain the 379/444 region with the DIS hairpin dimerize efficiently. To test whether this domain is sufficient for dimerization, we synthesized the minimal DIS transcript 397/444. This short transcript is also able to dimerize, illustrating that the isolated DIS element mediates dimer formation (Fig.6, lane 2). Because an unrelated transcript band is running close to the dimer signal, we included an equivalent sample that was heated in formamide before gel electrophoresis to specifically melt the dimer (lane 1). Using a heterodimerization assay, we verified that the slow migrating band seen in our gels is in fact a dimer of two HIV-2 RNA molecules and not an alternative conformation of the RNA. Furthermore, this assay also tested whether the DIS hairpin contains all signals required for optimal dimerization. We incubated the short (397/444) and long (1/444) HIV-2 transcripts, either separately or combined (Fig. 6,lanes 3, 4, and 6, respectively). Both transcripts form homodimers (D1 in lane 3 and D2 in lane 4, respectively), and the heterodimer (D1,2 inlane 6) is seen as an additional band of intermediate gel mobility. Heterodimer formation seems at least as efficient as formation of the D2 homodimer (Fig. 6, lane 6), indicating that the short DIS transcript dimerizes as efficiently as the long transcript. These results further support the idea that the DIS hairpin structure is sufficient for optimal in vitrodimerization. To further prove that the long and short transcripts dimerize in an identical manner, we mixed the short transcript containing the wild type palindrome GGUACC with the GUGCAC palindrome mutant of the long transcript. This mixture yields both homodimers D1 and D2, but no heterodimer is observed (Fig. 6, lane 7), confirming that the DIS motif dimerizes through base pairing of autocomplementary palindromes. We have established that the DIS palindrome is a critical determinant for in vitro dimerization of HIV-2 RNA. The palindrome must be exposed in the context of the complete HIV-2 leader RNA to form the initial loop-loop kissing interaction between two monomers. We examined the secondary structure of the HIV-2 DIS region in transcript 1/544, which runs up to the start codon of the gag open reading frame. In vitro transcribed RNA was renatured and subjected to enzymatic and chemical modification. This was followed by primer extension with a radiolabeled DNA primer to identify modified nucleotides and separation of the cDNA products by electrophoresis on sequencing gels.

https://openalex.org/W2067622424,"The G protein-coupled Ca2+receptor (CaR) possesses an ∼600-residue extracellular domain involved in ligand binding and receptor activation. Based on an alignment of the amino acid sequence of the CaR with that of bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins, the first ∼530 residues of the extracellular domain are believed to form a domain resembling a bilobed Venus's flytrap (VFT). Four insertions in the CaR sequence that do not align with those of bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins correspond to four loops within lobe I of the VFT. We constructed a series of deletion mutants of these four loops and tested their ability to form fully processed CaR as well as their ability to be activated by Ca2+. As many as 21 residues (365) of loop III could be deleted without impairing receptor expression or activation. Deletion of portions of either loops I (50) or IV (438) did not impair receptor expression but significantly reduced Ca2+ activation. Deletion of the entire loop II (117) abolished receptor expression and function, but the replacement of even a single residue within this deletion mutant led to expression of a monomeric form of the receptor showing increased Ca2+sensitivity but reduced maximal activation. Our results reveal that certain residues within loops I and IV are dispensable in formation of the VFT domain but are critical for Ca2+activation of the receptor. In contrast, the residues in loop II are critical for maintaining the inactive state of the CaR. We discuss these results in light of the recently defined crystal structure of the homologous domain of the type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor. The G protein-coupled Ca2+receptor (CaR) possesses an ∼600-residue extracellular domain involved in ligand binding and receptor activation. Based on an alignment of the amino acid sequence of the CaR with that of bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins, the first ∼530 residues of the extracellular domain are believed to form a domain resembling a bilobed Venus's flytrap (VFT). Four insertions in the CaR sequence that do not align with those of bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins correspond to four loops within lobe I of the VFT. We constructed a series of deletion mutants of these four loops and tested their ability to form fully processed CaR as well as their ability to be activated by Ca2+. As many as 21 residues (365) of loop III could be deleted without impairing receptor expression or activation. Deletion of portions of either loops I (50) or IV (438) did not impair receptor expression but significantly reduced Ca2+ activation. Deletion of the entire loop II (117) abolished receptor expression and function, but the replacement of even a single residue within this deletion mutant led to expression of a monomeric form of the receptor showing increased Ca2+sensitivity but reduced maximal activation. Our results reveal that certain residues within loops I and IV are dispensable in formation of the VFT domain but are critical for Ca2+activation of the receptor. In contrast, the residues in loop II are critical for maintaining the inactive state of the CaR. We discuss these results in light of the recently defined crystal structure of the homologous domain of the type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor.

Am. J. Med. 1999; 106: 238-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Activation of the CaR leads to stimulation of phospholipase C and resultant increased phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis. CaR activation mediates inhibition of parathyroid hormone secretion in parathyroid cells and inhibition of Ca2+ reabsorption in the kidney. Inactivating and activating mutations of the CaR cause disorders of [Ca2+]o homeostasis: familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, respectively (2Hendy G.N. D'Souza-Li L. Yang B. Canaff L. Cole D.E. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The CaR is a member of family 3 of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (3Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). In addition to amino acid sequence conservation, the CaR shares with other members of family 3, such as the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), a unique structural feature, namely a large ∼600-residue extracellular amino-terminal domain (ECD). The ECD in typical family 3 members consists of an ∼530-residue domain, which based on limited homology to bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins has been suggested to resemble a bilobed Venus's-flytrap (VFT) (4O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), followed by an ∼70-residue cysteine-rich domain (5Hu J. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16382-16389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Based on an alignment of the human CaR (hCaR) ECD amino acid sequence with that of the mGluR1 ECD and the Escherichia colileucine/isoleucine/valine bacterial periplasmic-binding protein, we previously created a model of residues 36–513 of the hCaR ECD (see figure 6 in Ref. 6Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The model shows a bilobed VFT with lobe I (containing the amino terminus) connected by three strands to lobe II (containing the carboxyl terminus). Four insertions in the hCaR and mGluR1 sequence that could not be aligned with leucine/isoleucine/valine bacterial periplasmic-binding protein could not be modeled, and hence these were shown as unstructured loops (designated I–IV). Loops I–IV were all contained in lobe I in our model. We also showed that the hCaR is an intermolecular disulfide-linked homodimer and identified cysteines 129 and 131, which are located in loop II as the residues involved in covalent dimerization (6Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recently, Kunishima et al. (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) determined the three-dimensional structure of residues 33–522 from the ECD of the rat mGluR1 in two free (unliganded) forms and in a glutamate-bound form. All three forms appear as intermolecular disulfide-linked homodimers with each monomer consisting of a bilobed VFT. The flytrap is closed in the ligand-bound state and either open (free form I) or closed (free form II) in the unliganded state. The sequences corresponding to loops I–IV in our hCaR model are all confirmed to occur in lobe I, and for loops I, III, and IV are shown to be loops connecting regions of secondary structure in the mGluR1 crystal structure. Loop II, which was confirmed to be the site of covalent dimerization (involving the single cysteine 140 in rat mGluR1), appears as a disordered (in the ligand-bound form) or partially disordered (in the free form I) region in the mGluR1 three-dimensional structure. Given that the VFT structure can be formed in leucine/isoleucine/valine bacterial periplasmic-binding protein without the regions corresponding to loops I–IV, we sought to understand the importance of these loops in the formation of the basic VFT structure. We tested the hypothesis that some or all of the residues comprising loops I–IV are unnecessary for VFT formation but might be important for activation of the hCaR. To this end, we constructed a series of deletion mutants of loops I–IV of the hCaR (see Fig. 1) and tested their ability to form fully processed receptor protein as well as their ability to be activated by [Ca2+]o. The hCaR cDNA cloned in the pCR3.1 expression vector was described previously (8Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. Kausik Ray. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, a pair of complementary primers 35–55 bases long was designed for each deletion mutant, with the sequence to be deleted placed in the middle of the primers (the sequences of all primers used are available from the authors upon request). Parental hCaR inserted into pCR3.1 was amplified using Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase with these primers for 16 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After digestion of the parental DNA with DpnI, the amplified DNA with the deletion incorporated was transformed intoE. coli (DH-5 strain). The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using a dRhodamine Terminator cycle sequencing kit and ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Deletion mutations are all designated by loop number (L1, L2, L3, and L4, respectively) followed by “Δ” and the specific range of residues deleted (using the numbering of the hCaR amino acid sequence; see Fig. 1 A). The residues within the indicated range that were not deleted are indicated in single-letter amino acid code between the numbers indicating the deletion range. The L2 Δ117–137 deletion mutant was created by introducing HpaI and Eco47III sites, respectively, before the codon encoding Val115 and after the codon encoding Ser137 in hCaR. The mutant incorporating these sites was digested with both enzymes, and the digestion product was religated to create the deletion mutant. This deletion mutant DNA was then used as template in the next round of mutagenesis to generate the L2 Δ118–137, L2 Δ117-N-137, and L2 Δ117–136 deletion mutants. The L3 Δ371–385 deletion mutant was created in an analogous way by introducing Bst1107.1 and HpaI sites, respectively, before the codon encoding Val370 and after the codon encoding Asn386 in hCaR followed by digestion and religation. This deletion mutant was used as template in the next round of mutagenesis to generate the L3 Δ365–385 deletion mutant. Similarly, the L3 Δ338–385 deletion mutant was obtained by introducing the Bst1107.1 and HpaI sites, respectively, before the codon encoding Val337 and after the codon encoding Asn386 in hCaR. The L3 Δ371–410 deletion mutant was created by introducing the Bst1107.1 sites before the codons encoding Val370 and Tyr411 followed by digestion with Bst1107.1 and religation. To generate loop 4 deletion mutants, the hCaR was used as template to delete from amino acid 438–445 (L4 Δ438–445), 440–444 (L4 Δ440–444), 447–453 (L4 Δ447–453) and to generate the L4 Δ438-NGS-453 deletion mutant. All the DNAs modified were digested, purified with QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and religated with Rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfections were performed using 12 µg of plasmid DNA diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) mixed with diluted LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-lipofectAMINE complex was further diluted in 6 ml of serum-free DMEM and added to 80% confluent HEK-293 cells plated in 75-cm2 flasks. After 5 h of incubation, 15 ml of complete DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids Inc.) was added. 24 h after transfection, the transfected cells were split and cultured in complete DMEM. The PI hydrolysis assay was performed as described previously (9Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection cells from a confluent 75-cm2 flask were split. Typically, one eighth of the cells were plated in one well of a six-well plate, and the whole-cell lysate was prepared 48 h post-transfection for the Western blot assay. The remaining cells were plated in two 12-well plates in complete DMEM containing 3.0 µCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cultured for another 24 h. The culture medium was replaced by 1× PI buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.4 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm LiCl in 25 mm PIPES, pH 7.2) and incubated for 1 h. After the removal of PI buffer, cells were stimulated with different [Ca2+]o in PI buffer for an additional 1 h. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of HCl-methanol (1:1000, v/v)/well. Total inositol phosphates were purified by chromatography on Dowex 1-X8 columns and counted with a liquid scintillation counter (Tri-Carb 2500 TR; Packard Instrument Co.). Graphs of concentration dependence for stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by [Ca2+]o for each transfection were drawn by using GraphPad Prism version 2.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). In each experiment, varying concentrations of [Ca2+]o were tested in duplicate. Graphs shown in this paper represent the mean values (± S.E.) at each [Ca2+]o concentration from at least three independent experiments. Confluent cells in six-well plates were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and scraped on ice in buffer B containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton and a mixture of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 50 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma). The extracts were forced through a 22-gauge needle 5–8 times, and the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and 30–40 µg of each sample were separated on 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins on the gel were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with 0.1 µg/ml protein A-purified monoclonal anti-hCaR antibody (ADD, raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 214–235 of the hCaR protein) (10Goldsmith P.K.

Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution of 1:3000. The hCaR protein and deletion mutants were detected with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell extracts (40 µl) diluted in 40 µl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, were treated with 0.5 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 37 °C. The treated extracts were analyzed by Western blot. A model of the VFT of the human calcium sensing receptor was built using the SegMod algorithm (11Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 507-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) implemented in the program GeneMine. The crystal structure of mGluR (Protein Data Base entry 1EWT) in the “ligand-free form 1” conformation (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) was used as the template. Loop I in the hCaR is comprised of the residues 39–67 (Fig. 1), which connect β-sheet “b” to α-helix “A” in the mGluR1 crystal structure (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). We had shown previously that mutation of either cysteine 60 (within loop I) or cysteine 101 severely impairs the normal expression and function of the hCaR (6Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the mGluR1 crystal structure, the corresponding cysteines are shown to form an intramolecular disulfide that seems critical for receptor expression and function. We reasoned that the deletion of parts of loop I that include cysteine 60 would abolish receptor expression and therefore focused our efforts on the region preceding cysteine 60. We constructed deletion mutants L1 Δ50–59 and L1 Δ48–59 lacking 10 and 12 amino acids, respectively. These deletion mutants and the wild-type (Wt) receptor were transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells, their expression was analyzed by immunoblot, and their ability to respond to [Ca2+]o was analyzed by measuring stimulation of PI hydrolysis (Fig.2). Both the L1 Δ48–59 and L1 Δ50–59 deletion mutants showed dramatically reduced maximal responses to [Ca2+]o and a rightward shift in sensitivity (L1 Δ50–59 about 25% of Wt maximal response with EC50 values of 5.8 ± 1.2 and 2.53 ± 0.07 mm, respectively). Importantly, the expression of these deletion mutants was at least as good as that of the Wt hCaR as seen on immunoblot (Fig. 2, right). Under reducing conditions, the ADD antibody recognizes two major bands of ∼150 and 130 kDa in both Wt and L1 Δ48–59 and L1 Δ50–59 receptors. The ∼150-kDa band represents the fully processed receptor modified withN-linked complex carbohydrates and expressed on the cell surface, and the ∼130-kDa band represents high mannose-modified intracellular forms of the receptor (6Ray K.

Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Srapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 13Ray K. Clapp P. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34558-34567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Both deletion mutant receptors (L1 Δ50–59 and L1 Δ48–59) were, similar to the Wt hCaR, expressed on the cell surface as intermolecular disulfide-linked dimers as revealed by immunoblot under nonreducing conditions (data not shown). In the alignment of the loop I amino acid sequence of the hCaR with rat mGluR1 (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), six additional residues (42) are present in the hCaR. We speculated that these might be deleted without impairing receptor expression or function. Analysis of the L1 Δ42–47 deletion mutant, however, showed that its response to [Ca2+]owas virtually abolished, and its expression was severely impaired in that only the ∼130-kDa band corresponding to the intracellular incompletely processed form of the receptor was observed on immunoblot (Fig. 2). Loop II is comprised of residues 117–137 of the hCaR (Fig. 1). This corresponds to a disordered region between helix B and β-sheet “d” in the mGluR1 crystal structure (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Deletion of this entire region (mutant receptor L2 Δ117–137) almost completely abolished the response to [Ca2+]o (maximal response was 14% of the Wt, Fig. 3,left). As shown in the immunoblot in Fig. 3,right, two bands of ∼130 and ∼118 kDa, distinctly lower than the ∼150- and ∼130-kDa bands seen with the Wt receptor, were detected under reducing conditions in the lysates of cells expressing the L2 Δ117–137 deletion mutant. Under nonreducing conditions, the Wt receptor shows a doublet above the 213-kDa marker corresponding to the dimeric forms of the ∼150- and ∼130-kDa bands. In contrast, the L2 Δ117–137 deletion mutant, under nonreducing conditions, shows persistence of immunoreactive bands representing monomeric forms in addition to a higher molecular size band (Fig. 3, right). The persistence of monomers of the L2 Δ117–137 deletion mutant under nonreducing conditions reflects deletion of cysteines 129 and 131, which we have shown to be responsible for the intermolecular disulfide-linked dimerization of the hCaR (6Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The higher molecular size bands seen under nonreducing conditions for the mutant receptor may reflect aggregated forms as we have observed previously for other mutant forms of the hCaR that fail to express at the cell surface (6Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To define the nature of the ∼130- and ∼118-kDa bands identified by immunoblot under reducing conditions for the L2 Δ117–137 deletion mutant, we tested their sensitivity to digestion with Endo H. In contrast with the Wt receptor for which only the lower ∼130-kDa band was Endo H-sensitive, both of the deletion mutant immunoreactive bands were digested by Endo H (Fig. 4). Thus both mutant bands represent incompletely processed intracellular forms (6Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34558-34567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A faint band (Fig. 4, arrow) resists Endo H digestion and presumably reflects the small proportion of the L2 Δ117–137 deletion mutant that is fully processed and expressed at the cell surface. This likely accounts for the small residual activity (Fig. 3, left) of the mutant receptor. Based on the results obtained with the L2 Δ117–137 deletion mutant, we explored the minimal sequence of loop II necessary to produce activity of the hCaR. Three additional loop II deletion mutants were created in which a single amino acid of loop II was replaced within the L2 Δ117–137 deletion mutant. These were termed L2 Δ118–137 (replacement of Gln117), L2 Δ117-N-137 (replacement of Asn), and L2 Δ117–136 (replacement of Ser). As shown in Fig.5, left, the resulting mutants had ∼40% of the Wt activity as determined by the stimulation of PI hydrolysis. Interestingly, a significant left shift in dose-dependent [Ca2+]o response compared with the Wt hCaR was observed. The maximal response to calcium (at 8 mm) when compared with the wild type was 39, 44, and 34% for L2 Δ118–137, L2 Δ117-N-137, and L2 Δ117–136 deletion mutants, respectively (EC50 values for the L2 Δ118–137, L2 Δ117-N-137, and L2 Δ117–136 deleted mutants were 0.518 ± 0.16, 0.779 ± 0.136, and 0.500 ± 0.093 mm, respectively). The expression pattern of these deletion mutants on immunoblot (Fig. 5, right) differed from both Wt and the L2 Δ117–137 deletion mutant. Under reducing conditions, the ∼118 kDa detected in the L2 Δ117–137 was clearly diminished in the L2 Δ117–136 deletion mutant and was barely detected in the L2 Δ118–137 and L2 Δ117-N-137 mutants. The faint band just above the ∼130-kDa band (Fig. 5, right, arrow) seen for the L2 Δ117–137 deletion mutant was increased in expression in the other three loop II deletion mutants. This band, based on resistance to Endo H, corresponds to the fully processed form of the receptor and persists in monomeric form (arrow) under nonreducing conditions. Loop III is comprised of residues 356–416 of the hCaR and is the longest of the four loops present in lobe I of the VFT domain (Fig. 1). Loop III connects helices L and M in the mGluR1 crystal structure and contains an intramolecular disulfide linking the residues equivalent to cysteines 358 and 395 in the hCaR (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that mutation of either of these cysteines abolishes expression and activity (6Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly then, two deletion mutants we made that each delete one of these cysteines, L3 Δ338–385 and L3 Δ371–410, respectively, abolished activity (Fig.6, left) and expression of the fully processed form (Fig. 6, right) of the hCaR. Alignment of the sequences corresponding to loop III in the hCaR and in rat mGluR1 shows that the hCaR sequence has an insert of about 21 extra amino acids. To test the functional importance of these residues, we made two further deletion mutants denoted as L3 Δ371–385 and L3 Δ365–385, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, left, both deletion mutants were nearly comparable in activity to the Wt hCaR, with the L3 Δ365–385 mutant slightly higher in maximal activity than Wt but not left-shifted as with some of the loop II deletion mutants. The expression of the L3 Δ371–385 and L3 Δ365–385 deletion mutants was also similar to that of the Wt receptor on immunoblot except for a small increase in mobility of the first mutant (Fig. 6,right). Both deletion mutants (L3 Δ371–385 and L3 Δ365–385) were expressed at the cell surface as dimers as revealed by immunoblot under nonreducing conditions (data not shown). Loop IV is the smallest of the four loops and comprises residues 437–449 of the hCaR (Fig. 1). This loop connects helices M and N in the mGluR1 crystal structure and contains an intramolecular disulfide linking cysteines equivalent to 437 and 449 in the hCaR (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that mutation of either of these cysteines causes a modest reduction in receptor activity (14Fan G.F. Ray K. Zhao X.M. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Loop IV also contains an insert in the hCaR not present in mGluR1 corresponding to residues 440–444. To test the function of residues in loop IV we made four distinct deletion mutants designated as L4 Δ440–444, L4 Δ438–445, L4 Δ438-NGS-453, and L4 Δ447–453. As shown in Fig.7, left, all these deletion mutants displayed a dose-dependent response to calcium but with a decrease in maximal activity and right-shift in EC50values. The maximal activity and EC50 values, respectively, were 75% and 4.1 ± 0.06 mm for L4 Δ440–444, 50% and 4.9 ± 0.47 mm for L4 Δ438–445, 35% and 4.5 ± 0.07 mm for L4 Δ438-NGS-453, and 25% and 5.45 ± 0.57 mm for L4 Δ447–453, compared with the Wt hCaR (EC50 value of 2.47 ± 0.08 mm). The expression levels of these deletion mutants on immunoblot (Fig. 7,right) were either comparable with Wt (L4 Δ440–444 and L4 Δ438–445) or slightly diminished (L4 Δ438-NGS-453 and L4 Δ447–453). All these deletion mutants were expressed at the cell surface as dimers (data not shown). The varying consequences of deleting parts of the four loops in lobe I of the hCaR VFT domain reveal clear differences in the functional importance of these parts of the ECD. The deletion of residues 48–59 or 50–59 in loop I drastically reduced receptor activity without significantly impairing receptor expression. This suggests that these residues are not required for VFT formation but that they play an important role in calcium activation of the receptor. One possibility would be that these residues are directly involved in calcium binding. This region contains four acidic amino acids (Asp48, Asp50, Glu56, and Glu59), and acidic amino acids have been speculated to play a role in the low-affinity calcium-binding characteristic of the CaR ECD (15Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). We noticed, moreover, that Asp48, Asp50, and Glu59 correspond to a calcium-binding motif identified in several calcium-binding proteins including troponin C, parvalbumin, and certain integrin repeats (16Springer T.A. Jing H. Takagi J. Cell. 2000; 102: 275-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that these residues are directly involved in calcium binding, we made single missense mutants (D48A,D50A) as well as a triple missense mutant (D48A,D50A,E59A). Because ligand-binding assays for the CaR have not been developed, we could not assess calcium binding to these or other mutants directly, so instead we tested their response to calcium in the PI assay. All these missense mutants showed expression and calcium activation equivalent to Wt, 2G. R. Cruz, unpublished observations. suggesting that this region in loop I is not involved directly in calcium binding. Instead, we speculate that this portion of loop I is required for a change in conformation that occurs after calcium binding, and that is critical for receptor activation. Consistent with this possibility, the corresponding region in the mGluR1 crystal structure was noted to form part of the dimer interface (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The extent of the dimer interface involving loop I doubles from three to six of these residues in going from the free to the ligand-bound form. In contrast to the deletion of loop I residues 48–59, the deletion of residues 42–47 abolished both activation and expression of the fully processed form of the receptor. This was somewhat surprising given that these residues are an “extra” insert in loop I of the hCaR compared with the mGluR sequence but suggests that this region is critical for folding and VFT formation in the CaR. A further indication of the possible functional importance of residues in loop I is that three distinct loss-of-function mutations within this loop, P39A, S53P, and P55L, have been identified in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (2Hendy G.N. D'Souza-Li L. Yang B. Canaff L. Cole D.E. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Considerable previous evidence suggested that loop II is a critical region for CaR activation. We have shown that when both cysteines 129 and 131 in loop II are mutated, the CaR is expressed as a monomer, when analyzed by immunoblot under denaturing but nonreducing conditions (6Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This monomeric form of the CaR is lower in maximal activity than Wt but is left-shifted in its concentration dependence for calcium activation. Similar left shifts in calcium sensitivity are observed for naturally occurring missense mutations in the hCaR in the disease autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (2Hendy G.N. D'Souza-Li L. Yang B. Canaff L. Cole D.E. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Most of these mutations are located in the ECD, and loop II is by far the most frequent site with six mutations thus far identified between Ala116 and Cys129(2Hendy G.N. D'Souza-Li L. Yang B. Canaff L. Cole D.E. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Random saturation mutagenesis of loop II also yielded multiple mutants with increased sensitivity to calcium (17Jensen A.A. Spalding T.A Burstein E.S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Brann M.R. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Bräuner-Osborne H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29547-29555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Deletion of residues 117–137 comprising essentially all of loop II resulted in a drastic reduction in activity. Although the basis for the two bands seen on immunoblots of the L2 Δ117–137 deletion mutant is not completely clear, their sensitivity to Endo H digestion supports the idea that most of the mutant receptors are not fully processed nor do they reach the cell surface. This accounts for the sharp reduction in activity and indicates that loop II is required for the proper folding and processing of the CaR. Replacement of even a single amino acid, specifically Gln117, Asn, or Ser, in this loop II deletion mutant led to a major increase in expression of the fully processed form of the CaR and in response to calcium. In all three cases, although maximal activity was reduced, a left shift in calcium sensitivity was observed, reinforcing the importance of loop II in regulating calcium responsiveness of the CaR. It is highly unlikely that the increase in sensitivity to calcium observed in various loop II mutants reflects a direct role for loop II as a calcium-binding site. Neither the nature of the missense mutations in loop II nor the effect of deleting most of the loop as in the L2 Δ118–137 deletion mutant, for example, is consistent with such a role. Instead, the crystal structure of the mGluR1 receptor (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) offers a possible explanation for the role of loop II in receptor activation. Although most of loop II is disordered in the ligand-bound mGluR1 crystal structure, the first seven residues of loop II undergo a conformational change in the free form to become an α-helical extension of helix B. Helices B and C form the largest surface of the dimer interface and undergo a 70° rotation between the free and ligand-bound forms of the receptor. In the free inactive form of mGluR1, the proximal portion of loop II, in addition to becoming an extension of helix B, becomes part of an extended dimer interface (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Our present results with the loop II deletion mutants, interpreted in conjunction with the structural information from the crystal structures of the free, inactive, and ligand-bound active forms of mGluR1, suggest that loop II plays a role in maintaining the inactive form of the CaR. We speculate that changes in loop II that still permit folding and trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface lead to increased calcium sensitivity by removing a constraint to receptor activation. Perhaps this is caused by the reduction or abolition of the α-helical extension of helix B, thereby reducing the size of the dimer interface in the free inactive form of the receptor and making it easier to undergo the rotation that characterizes the transition from the inactive to active form of the receptor. Loop III contains a sequence “insert” in the CaR not found in mGluR. The sequence of this insert is the least conserved within the ECD of the CaR among various species (1Brown E.M. Am. J. Med. 1999; 106: 238-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may not be under evolutionary pressure because of a conserved function. Consistent with this possibility, deletion of as many as 21 residues corresponding to this insert in loop III had a minimal effect on either receptor expression or activation. These results do not of course exclude a functional role of this region in CaR, e.g. interaction with another protein that modulates CaR localization, but they do suggest that both CaR formation and activation can occur without this segment of the VFT. Loop IV deletion mutants that abolish the presumptive intramolecular disulfide involving cysteines 437 and 449 reduced but did not abolish receptor expression and activation. This is consistent with previous results on missense mutations of the respective cysteines (14Fan G.F. Ray K. Zhao X.M. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and suggests that this disulfide is important in the folding and formation of the VFT structure. Interestingly, deletion of a five-amino acid insert in the CaR loop IV not found in mGluR did not compromise receptor expression but did cause moderate reduction in receptor activation along with a right shift in calcium sensitivity. Deletion of this insert is unlikely to have abolished the cysteine 437–449 disulfide, because the same disulfide is found in mGluR lacking the insert. Instead, we suggest that the effect of this deletion in loop IV reflects a role for this loop in receptor activation. Although loop IV is not part of the dimer interface in the mGluR1 crystal structure, it appears to be close to loop II and thus may be indirectly involved in receptor activation. In summary, we have identified sequences within loops I and IV in lobe I of the hCaR VFT that are required for calcium activation, but not expression of the receptor, and sequences within loop II, the deletion of which increases calcium sensitivity of the receptor. A substantial portion of loop III of the receptor can be deleted without affecting expression or activation. These results form the basis for future studies directed at understanding how ligand binding to the ECD of family 3 G protein-coupled receptors leads to receptor activation.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)1 subfamily consists of three mammalian isoforms: PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ (reviewed in Ref. 2Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr.

The PPARs are receptors for a wide range of both natural and xenobiotic compounds including fatty acids, eicosanoids, hypolipidemic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and hypoglycemic drugs (2Desvergne B.

All three PPARs heterodimerize with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to bind single-spaced direct repeat (DR1) response elements (5′-AGGNCA A AGGTCA-3′) to which a 5′ AACT extension appears to be important for polarity and selectivity of recognition (2Desvergne B.

Consequently, studies of PPARγ action have implications in diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, reproduction, and cancer. Cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, EC 4.1.1.32) is expressed in several tissues where it participates in glucose and lipid homeostasis (reviewed in Refs. 23Tilghman S.M. Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley & Sons, New York1976: 47-91Google Scholar and 24Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). PEPCK has long been recognized as a critical gluconeogenic enzyme in the liver and kidney. Indeed, recent homologous recombination experiments confirmed the expectation that the gluconeogenic function of PEPCK is essential for life (25She P. Shiota M. Shelton K.D. Chalkley R. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6508-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). 2R. W. Hanson, personal communication. PEPCK is also expressed in adipocytes, which lack the terminal two enzymes of gluconeogenesis (23Tilghman S.M. Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley & Sons, New York1976: 47-91Google Scholar, 24Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev.

Consequently, adipocyte PEPCK functions in a pathway known as glyceroneogenesis (24Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Glyceroneogenesis accounts for 10–60% of triglyceride production during fasting in humans (27Kalhan S.C. Mahajan S. Burkett E. Reshef L. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12928-12931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Adipocyte PEPCK and glyceroneogenesis are induced during fasting to increase the production of 3-glycerophosphate for the reesterification of free fatty acids released by lipolysis. Although there is a net increase in fatty acid release, this apparent futile cycle prevents an all-out release that would otherwise cause ketoacidosis. An additional role of hepatic PEPCK in lipid homeostasis was recently discovered in mice with a liver-specific ablation of the PEPCK gene. These mice develop fatty livers apparently because glyceroneogenesis is an important function of PEPCK in hepatocytes (25She P. Shiota M. Shelton K.D. Chalkley R. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6508-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 27Kalhan S.C. Mahajan S. Burkett E. Reshef L. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12928-12931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).2 Because of the need to regulate both gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis, PEPCK gene expression is tightly controlled at the level of transcription by a variety of hormones involved in nutrient homeostasis (24Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Work in many laboratories has shown that, in general, the same effectors control PEPCK in both adipocytes and hepatocytes (24Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 28Beale E.G. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3330-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One notable difference is that PPARγ regulates adipocyte but not hepatocyte PEPCK (29Devine J.H. Eubank D.W. Clouthier D.E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Hammer R.E. Beale E.G. J. Biol.

A second difference is that glucocorticoids repress PEPCK transcription in adipocytes but induce it in hepatocytes (24Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Physiologically, this latter tissue-specific difference causes stress hormones such as cortisol to increase fuel release in both tissues by stimulating hepatocyte and inhibiting adipocyte PEPCK (24Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 32Hanson R.W. Garber A.J. Reshef L. Ballard F.J. Am. J. Clin.

Both sites bind recombinant PPARγ/RXR with similar affinities (30Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), yet paradoxically, these two sites have strikingly different functions. The distal site, PCK2, is absolutely required for the expression of the PEPCK promoter in adipose tissue of transgenic mice and is thus the key element of an adipocyte-specific enhancer (29Devine J.H. Eubank D.W. Clouthier D.E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Hammer R.E. Beale E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13604-13612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This site is also the only response element for thiazolidinedione action on the PEPCK gene. 3M. Glorian, E. Duplus, E. G. Beale, D. K. Scott, D. K. Granner, and C. Forest, submitted for publication.PCK2 could also mediate fatty acid induction of PEPCK in adipocytes, although this is not yet proven (13Duplus E. Glorian M. Forest C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In contrast, the proximal site, gAF1/PCK1, is neither a thiazolidinedione response element nor does it developmentally regulate adipocyte-specific PEPCK promoter expression in transgenic mice (29Devine J.H. Eubank D.W. Clouthier D.E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Hammer R.E. Beale E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13604-13612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).3 However, other studies suggest that gAF1/PCK1 plays an important role in regulating PEPCK gene expression in fully differentiated cells. First, the gAF1/PCK1 element is part of a complex hormone response unit in hepatoma cells (37Imai E. Stromstedt P.-E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 38Sugiyama T. Wang J.C. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

It is named gAF1 (glucocorticoid-Accessory Factor1 site) because it is required for full glucocorticoid responsiveness (37Imai E. Stromstedt P.-E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 38Sugiyama T. Wang J.C. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3446-3454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is also called PCK1 to reflect its similarity to PCK2 (30Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, gAF1/PCK1 is bound by a variety of nuclear receptors including COUP-TFs, HNF4, RAR/RXR, and PPARα that activate the PEPCK promoter (39Lucas P.C. O'Brien R.M. Mitchell J.A. Davis C.M.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Second, glucocorticoids inhibit fibrate and thiazolidinedione-induced PEPCK gene expression in adipocytes (31Glorian M. Franckhauser-Vogel S. Robin D. Robin P. Forest C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but when gAF1/PCK1 is mutated, glucocorticoids no longer inhibit fibrate-induced PEPCK reporter activation (42Franckhauser-Vogel S. Glorian M. Forest C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 127: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, gAF1/PCK1 is an inhibitory element in adipocytes. Because gAF1/PCK1 binds multiple nuclear receptors and functions in glucocorticoid and retinoic acid signaling in the liver and adipose tissues, we postulated that gAF1/PCK1 regulates adipocyte PEPCK transcription by binding nuclear receptors other than PPARγin vivo. In this study, we compared the functions of the two PPARγ binding elements. We report that COUP-TFII binds gAF1/PCK1 and inhibits PPARγ/RXR activation via PCK2 in fibroblasts and preadipocytes. During adipogenesis PPARγ/RXR replaces COUP-TFII on gAF1/PCK1. Moreover, an intact gAF1/PCK1 element inhibits maximal PPARγ/RXR activation of the PEPCK promoter in transfection assays. We suggest that gAF1/PCK1 is a multifunctional element that mediates tissue-specific inhibition of PEPCK transcription.

A Renilla luciferase vector, pRL-CMV, from Promega (Madison, WI), was included in all experiments as a transfection efficiency control. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed using the dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Luminescence was measured with an Analytical Luminescence Laboratories Monolight 2010 luminometer (PharMingen, San Diego, CA).

Briefly, rat PEPCK double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were end labeled by filling the 3′-recessed ends with [α-32P]dATP or -dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using the large fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). The −467 to −352 PEPCK probe was generated by including 60 µCi of [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol) into a 10-µl PCR reaction using a subclone of the rat PEPCK gene (GenBank™ accession no.

The gel was dried and exposed to a phosphor screen overnight. When antiserum was used, binding reactions were incubated with 1 µl of antiserum for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the labeled fragments. PEPCK promoter-luciferase vectors were constructed using the pGL3-basic firefly luciferase vector fromPromega. The wild type PEPCK-luciferase vector utilized the sameBsmI (−1330 bp)/BglII (+69 bp) rat PEPCK promoter fragment described previously (29Devine J.H. Eubank D.W. Clouthier D.E. Tontonoz P.

Here we report the identification of Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation site of CCaMK by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight-mass spectrometry. Thr267 was confirmed as the Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation site by post-source decay experiments and by site-directed mutagenesis. The purified T267A mutant form of CCaMK did not show Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation, autophosphorylation-dependent variable calmodulin affinity, or Ca2+/calmodulin stimulation of kinase activity. Sequence comparison of CCaMK from monocotyledonous plant (lily) and dicotyledonous plant (tobacco) suggests that the autophosphorylation site is conserved.

These signaling events are orchestrated by calcium-binding proteins that decode information contained in the spatial and temporal patterns of the Ca2+ signals. In addition to calmodulin, a major transducer of Ca2+ signals, plants contain Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)1-dependent protein kinases and a large family of Ca2+-dependent but CaM-independent protein kinases (CDPKs) and CDPK-related protein kinases. Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation and Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation are believed to participate in numerous aspects of plant growth and development (2Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N.

Several Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases have been known to exist in animal systems, and numerous reports have appeared in the literature about their characterization and functional significance. However, not much is known about the Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases in plants (7Watillon B. Kettmann R. Boxus P. Burny A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1381-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Lu Y.T. Hidaka H. Feldman L.J. Planta. 1996; 199: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Liu Z. Xia M.

A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The chimeric Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) reported from plants has a C-terminal visinin-like domain (9Liu Z. Xia M. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) unlike all the other Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases reported so far. CCaMK is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, and it is developmentally regulated (11Poovaiah B.W. Xia M. Liu Z. Wang W. Yang T. Sathyanarayanan P.V. Franceschi V.R. Planta. 1999; 209: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Apart from the C-terminal visinin-like domain, CCaMK has a serine-threonine kinase domain and an autoinhibitory domain overlapping with the CaM binding domain. The CaM binding domain of CCaMK is highly similar to mammalian Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (12Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although there are several reports on Ca2+and Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation in plants and their role in plant growth and development, the precise molecular nature of Ca2+ and Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation is not well understood. In the present study, we identify and characterize the Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation site of CCaMK by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and PSD experiments. The threonine 267 was found to be phosphorylated upon Ca2+ stimulation, and the T267A mutant did not show Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation. Furthermore, Ca2+/CaM-stimulated kinase activity and autophosphorylation-dependent CaM affinity changes were absent in the mutant. Identification of Thr267 as the Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation site of CCaMK is an important step in the understanding of the molecular nature of transduction of Ca2+ signals into phosphorylation signals in plants. We show that a synthetic peptide (amino acid residues 257–340) containing the autophosphorylation site and CaM-binding site could kinetically mimic the high affinity (phosphorylated) and low affinity (unphosphorylated) binding of CCaMK to CaM. CCaMK cDNA from Lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb cv. Nellie white) and deletion mutants were cloned into the pET3b expression vector (Novagen) and expressed in Escherichia coli. These proteins were purified as described previously (12Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of CCaMK was performed in the presence of 0.2 mm Ca2+ as described below. The phospholabeled protein was precipitated using chloroform/methanol (13Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). The protein pellets were dried under a vacuum. The pellets were dissolved in 25 mm NH4HCO3, and freshly prepared trypsin (0.025 µg/µl in 25 mmNH4HCO3) was added (14Neville D.C.A. Rozanas C.R. Price E.M. Gruis D.B. Verkman A.S. Townsend R.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2436-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was placed in a water bath at 37 °C for 18 h. The tryptic fragments were then dried under a Speed Vac. IMAC for the purification of phosphopeptides was performed as described (14Neville D.C.A. Rozanas C.R. Price E.M. Gruis D.B. Verkman A.S. Townsend R.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2436-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The IMAC column was prepared using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) (packed bed volume was 0.5 ml) in a 10-ml Polyprep column (Bio-Rad) using gravity flow. The column was washed with 2 ml of water followed by 2 ml of 0.1m EDTA to remove bound divalent metal ions. The column was then washed sequentially with 2 ml of water, 2 ml of 0.1 macetic acid, and 2 ml of 0.1 m ferric chloride in 0.1m acetic acid to load the column with Fe3+ions. 1 m acetic acid (2 ml) was then used to elute unbound Fe3+ ions. The tryptic digests of autophosphorylated CCaMK were dissolved in 100 µl of 0.2 m acetic acid and loaded onto an IMAC column. The column was then washed with 4 column volumes of 0.1 m acetic acid followed by sequential washes with 2 column volumes of water and 0.1% ammonium acetate (adjusted to pH 8.0 with ammonium hydroxide). Bound peptides were eluted with 4 column volumes of 0.1% ammonium acetate adjusted to pH 9.5 with ammonium hydroxide. The peptides eluted using 0.1% ammonium acetate, pH 8.0, was used as a control in MALDI-TOF analysis because the majority of phosphopeptides are eluted at pH 9.5. The eluted fraction was dried under a Speed Vac. The fractions were dissolved in 50 µl of 5% acetonitrile in water containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid and were used for MALDI analysis. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a PE Biosystems Voyager system DE/RP mass spectrometer equipped with a reflectron and nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm. Before analyzing the IMAC-derived phosphopeptides, a computer-generated tryptic peptide list (allowing three partials) was prepared from CCaMK amino acid sequence using the GPMAW 4.11 program (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark). The IMAC fractions were analyzed in the linear positive ion delayed extraction mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4HCCA) as the matrix. The IMAC-derived peptides were further concentrated using C18 ZipTip microcolumns (Millipore, Bedford, MA) following the manufacturer's protocol for peptide concentration and clean up. The concentrated peptides were eluted from the Zip Tip with the matrix solution (50/50 ACN/H2O with 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid saturated with 4HCCA) and spotted directly onto the MALDI target plate and allowed to air dry. MALDI spectra were obtained using laser fluence ∼20% above threshold. The accelerating voltage in the ion source was 25 kV; the delay time used was 150 ns; the grid voltage was set to 93.5% of the accelerating voltage; and the guide wire voltage was set to 0.15% of the accelerating voltage. Typically 256 laser shots were averaged for each spectrum. MALDI spectra were calibrated externally using a standard peptide mixture. The spectra obtained were compared with the computer-generated list of peptides to identify phosphopeptides by looking for an 80-Da shift corresponding to the addition of HPO3 to the –OH group of a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue. The PSD experiment was performed in the reflectron positive ion-delayed extraction mode, with an accelerating voltage of 25 kV, delay time of 200 ns, grid voltage of 65%, mirror voltage ratio of 1.12, and guide wire voltage of 0.1%. The timed ion selector was set at m/z 2164 to obtain the PSD spectrum. Potato calmodulin PCM1 cDNA cloned into the pET3b expression vector was labeled using [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described (12Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled CaM was purified from E. coli using phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography (12Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The oligonucleotide primers used for generating T267A mutant (Thr mutated at Ala at the amino acid residue 267 in the CCaMK expression construct) were 5′- GATTTCAGCTTTGAGGAGCACGCGTGGAAGACCATAACTTCATC-3′ and 5′-GATGAAGTTATGGTCTTCCACGCGTGCTCCTCAAAGCTGAAATC-3′. The sequence of the T267A mutant was confirmed by using the automated DNA sequencing facility available at Washington State University. CCaMK and mutant were incubated under autophosphorylating conditions (in the presence of Ca2+) and in the absence of Ca2+ (1Sathyanarayanan P.V. Cremo C.R. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30417-30422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). CaM binding to CCaMK and T267A was assessed by spotting the reaction mixture onto nitrocellulose filters (Millipore) followed by incubating the filters with35S-CaM (0.5 × 106 cpm/µg) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk plus either 1 mm Ca2+or 5 mm EGTA as described (1Sathyanarayanan P.V. Cremo C.R. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30417-30422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). An increase in the Ca2+-dependent binding of 35S-CaM (autophosphorylated versus unphosphorylated kinase and mutant) was plotted using SIGMAPLOT. An 84-amino acid peptide (257–340, LAGD FSFEEHTWKT ITSSAKDLIS SLLSVDPYKR PTANDLLKHP WVIGDSAKQE LIEPEVVSRL RSFNARRKLR AAAIASVLSS) containing the Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation site (Thr267) and the calmodulin-binding site (residues 311–340) was synthesized using Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer 431A in the Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Biotechnology at Washington State University. This peptide was used as a substrate for the wild-type kinase in the phosphorylation assays. The phosphorylated peptides were purified using IMAC and used in the filter binding assays as described above. The autophosphorylation assay of CCaMK and mutant protein were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and either 2.5 mm EGTA or 0.2 mm CaCl2. The reaction mixtures were analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE, and the [32P]PO4 incorporation was measured by isolating the protein bands from the gels and counting them using a scintillation counter. The data were analyzed using the parameter-stimulated autophosphorylation index (SAP) (1Sathyanarayanan P.V. Cremo C.R. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30417-30422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and plotted using SIGMAPLOT software (Jandel Scientific). For the concentration dependence on autophosphorylation studies, CCaMK at various concentrations (0.18–1.8 µm) were used in the autophosphorylation reactions as described. The [32P]PO4 incorporation in the presence of 0.2 mm CaCl2 was measured using a scintillation counter as mentioned above. The regression analysis of data was performed using SIGMAPLOT. The fit to the data and data were plotted using the same software. GS peptide was used as a substrate to study kinase activity of wild-type and mutant CCaMK. Phosphorylation assays (20 µl) were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and either 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 µm calmodulin, 100 µm GS peptide or 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 µm calmodulin, and 100 µm GS peptide (12Takezawa D.

Spotting the reaction mixture onto 2.1-cm diameter Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose filter circles terminated the reactions. The P-81 filter circles were washed four times in 500 ml of cold 0.5% phosphoric acid (10 min per wash). The filters were then washed with 200 ml of acetone at room temperature for 5 min. The filter circles were dried at room temperature, and [32P]PO4incorporation was measured using a scintillation counter. The fold increase in the [32P]PO4 incorporation (Ca2+/CaM versus EGTA/CaM) is plotted as an indicator of kinase activity using SIGMAPLOT software. Substrate phosphorylation by the T267A mutant was carried out in 20-µl reactions for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and either 2.5 mm EGTA and 100 µm histone IIAS or 0.2 mm CaCl2 and 100 µm histone IIAS (12Takezawa D.

The reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad). Incorporation of [32P]PO4into the substrate was determined by counting the excised protein bands in a scintillation counter. The coordinates of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 1 (CaMK 1) crystal structure (15Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), Protein Data Bank code 1A06, was obtained from Professor John Kuriyan's laboratory web site (Rockefeller University). Modeling of kinase and calmodulin binding domains of CCaMK (residues 1–340) was carried out using MODELLER (16Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment of CCaMK kinase and calmodulin domain and CaM kinase 1 was produced by ClustalW at the web site of the European Bioinformatics Institute. The two sequences have 31% sequence identity and 67% similarity determined by GAP program (GCG package). Amino acid sequences of mammalian CaM kinases (17Picciotto M.R. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. J.

Phosphopeptides from the tryptic digests of autophosphorylated CCaMK were purified using IMAC and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. We could not detect any strong signals in the MALDI spectrum, and the IMAC-derived peptides were further concentrated using a C18 ZipTip. The ZipTip-concentrated peptides were analyzed in the linear positive ion mode, and several peaks were obtained. Tentatively, we identified three phosphopeptides (Table I) by comparing the m/z values of the peaks from the MALDI spectrum with the computer-generated list. We could identify three tryptic peptides starting at residue 253 out of 4 predicted peptides having three or fewer cleavage sites. The major signal in our MALDI spectrum (Fig.1, A and B) corresponds to [M + H]+ of peptide Gln253–Lys269 with a single threonine as the only possible phosphorylation site, since previous work (12Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) has shown that only threonines are phosphorylated upon Ca2+stimulation. The peak (m/z 2167.7) was absent in the control (peptides eluted by 0.1% ammonium hydroxide, pH 8.0), and we identified Gln253–Lys269 as a phosphopeptide. The other two phosphopeptides (residues Gln253–Lys276 and Gln253–Lys289) appeared as small peaks in the spectrum.Table IMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identification of the phosphopeptides isolated from IMAC of the tryptic digests of autophosphorylated CCaMKAmino acid residues of phosphopeptidesMass (m/z) (theoretical)Mass (m/z) (observed)Difference (theoretical-observed)253QQRILAGDFSFEEHTpWK2692172.292167.734.56253QQRILAGDFSFEEHTpWKTITSSAK2762861.072855.575.5253QQRILAGDFSFEEHTpWKTITSSAKDLISSLLSVDPYK2894292.714286.616.1 Open table in a new tab Tryptic peptide Gln253–Lys269 containing phosphorylated Thr267 residue represented the strongest signal in the MALDI spectrum of IMAC-derived peptides. This peak was further analyzed in the reflectron positive ion mode with timed ion selector set atm/z 2164 to obtain the PSD spectrum. The PSD spectrum (Fig.1 C) showed the appearance of a peak at m/z of 2064.7 at high laser fluence (difference of 99.3 Da) suggesting the metastable loss of H3PO4 (loss of 98 Da (20Asara J.M. Allison J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)). The peak expected at −80 Da (loss of HPO3) was more weakly observed. The site-directed mutant T267A (threonine mutated to alanine) was prepared from the CCaMK expression vector using the site-directed mutagenesis kit, and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The T267A mutant was expressed in E. coli and purified as described (12Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol.

Wild-type and mutant CCaMK were autophosphorylated in the presence and in the absence of calcium as described. The 32[P]PO4 incorporation was measured, and the Ca2+ stimulation of autophosphorylation was expressed as SAP index (1Sathyanarayanan P.V. Cremo C.R. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol.

The interaction between calmodulin and the wild-type and mutant form of the kinase was studied using 35S-CaM filter binding experiments. The autophosphorylated wild-type kinase showed about a 7-fold increase in the 35S-CaM binding, whereas phosphorylation-dependent increase in the35S-CaM binding was absent in the T267A mutant (Fig.3). To determine the importance of Thr267 phosphorylation in the increased affinity for CaM, a peptide (amino acid residues 247–340) containing the autophosphorylation site and calmodulin-binding site was used in the35S-CaM filter binding experiments. The phosphorylated peptide showed about a 5-fold increase in 35S-CaM binding as compared with the unphosphorylated peptide (Fig. 3). The Ca2+/CaM stimulation of kinase activity of wild-type and mutant was tested using GS peptide as a substrate. The wild-type showed about a 6-fold increase in the kinase activity in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, whereas T267A mutant did not show any increase in kinase activity upon Ca2+/CaM stimulation (Fig.4). CaM-dependent activation of the T267A kinase activity was studied by determining the32[P]PO4 incorporation into histone IIAS by T267A in the presence of increasing concentrations of CaM (Fig.5). Higher concentrations of CaM did not stimulate the kinase activity of T267A.Figure 5Ca2+/calmodulin activation of the substrate phosphorylation of T267A.

The catalytic site sequences, activation loop, and the CaM-binding sequences show many conserved regions (Fig.6). The autophosphorylation site of the CCaMK from plants is marked with asterisk. The homology model of CCaMK is based on the 2.5-Å crystal structure of CaMK I (Protein Data Bank code 1A06) and assumes that the two sequences share a common tertiary structure. This assumption is supported by the high degree of sequence identity. The resulting homology model of CCaMK reflects the structure of the template molecule, CaMK I, in positions of conserved sequence, which includes most of the protein. However, amino acids 1–9, 54–63, 164–181, and 317–374 are missing from the crystal structure, and as a result the corresponding amino acids are less well defined in the homology model. Fig. 7shows the ribbon diagram of the resulting homology model with the region of interest highlighted by color. The red region in Fig. 7 is the catalytic region; the yellow area is the peptide fragment determined to be phosphorylated by the MALDI/TOF experiments, and the threonine believed to be phosphorylated is shown in magenta. The importance of Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation in regulating the activity of CCaMK was previously reported from our laboratory (1Sathyanarayanan P.V. Cremo C.R. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol.

Janus kinase interferon interleukin signal transducer and activator of transcription nuclear localization signal hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine green fluorescent protein band 4.1-ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) monoclonal antibody amino acid(s) In vertebrates the Janus or JAK1 proteins form a family of four tyrosine kinases (Tyk2, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3) that function in membrane-proximal signaling events initiated by a variety of extracellular factors binding to cell surface receptors. Notably, receptors that bind helical-bundled cytokines rely primarily on JAK kinases to activate and integrate signaling circuits (1Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). In such receptor complexes JAK proteins are specifically targeted to the cytoplasmic regions of transmembrane receptor subunits and are brought together through ligand-induced clustering and conformational changes of the subunits (3Yeh T.C. Pellegrini S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Catalytic activation of the JAK occur via their reciprocal trans-phosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain. The activated enzymes then proceed to phosphorylate the receptor subunit(s) that act as recruitment sites for SH2-containing substrates, notably the STAT family of transcription factors (5Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 6Decker T. Kovarik P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The domain organization, structure, and mode of regulation of JAK family members have been extensively studied in recent years. These proteins can be subdivided into a large amino-terminal region (N), a kinase-like domain that plays a regulatory role, and a tyrosine kinase domain. Investigations from several groups including ours have identified the N region as involved in recognition and association with the receptor. Originally subdivided into 5 boxes of homology (JH7-JH3), the amino-terminal region was shown to contain a divergent band 4.1 domain, called the FERM or JEF domain, flanked by a SH2-related domain (7Bork P. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 162-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Trends Biochem.

Commun. 2000; 278: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Functional or structural information on these two domains in JAK are lacking.The FERM domain is present in proteins of large functional diversity (10Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 751-769Crossref Google Scholar) and notably in the ERM protein family (ezrin, radixin, and moesin), where it mediates intramolecular binding as well as intermolecular association with transmembrane proteins (11Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Conceivably, in JAK proteins the FERM domain carries the molecular determinant of receptor binding.To date, all functional features of JAK proteins point to their involvement in events that take place at the level of complexes associated with the cell surface membrane. Interestingly, in a recent study JAK2 was identified as the kinase that associates with and phosphorylates the ATPase p97, a member of the AAA family (ATPases associated with different cellular activities), which is involved in membrane fusion and assembly of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum (12Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lavoie C. Chevet E. Roy L. Tonks N.K., A., F. Posner B.I. Paiement J. Bergeron J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13637-13642Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, JAKs have been observed in the nuclear compartment. Endogenous JAK2 was found in the nucleus of rat pancreatic cells (14Sorenson R.L. Stout L.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4092-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic as well nuclear immunoreactivity was detected for JAK1 and JAK2 ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Immunogold electron microscopy confirmed the presence of endogenous JAK2 in nuclei of rat hepatocytes (15Lobie P.E. Ronsin B. Silvennoinen O. Haldosén L.-A. Norstedt G. Morel G. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4037-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Abundant JAK2 was detected by immunoblots on nuclear fractions prepared from rat liver cells (16Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here, we have studied the subcellular distribution of the tyrosine kinase Tyk2 in human cells, and we have addressed the question of the mechanism of nuclear import and of the potential role of the kinase in the nucleus. We demonstrate that Tyk2 is localized throughout the cell, including in the nuclear compartment, with the exclusion of nucleoli. We present evidence that nuclear localization of Tyk2 requires an Arg-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS)-like motif located within the FERM domain. A mutant form of Tyk2 anchored to the plasma membrane of Tyk2-deficient cells was shown to rescue transcriptional and anti-vesicular stomatitis virus responses to interferon (IFN)-α, ruling out a role of the nuclear Tyk2 pool in these cytokine-induced biological activities.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we provide evidence that the tyrosine kinase Tyk2 is localized in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Tyk2 resides in the nucleus provided that an Arg-rich motif, mapping around aa 219–240 within the FERM domain, is present. Although the motif resembles a bipartite NLS, point mutations in the first basic cluster (R220–221/AA) were without effect. Alanine substitutions of R231–233-235 in the second cluster partially impaired nuclear localization. Deletion of the 22-aa motif totally abolished nuclear localization. When moved out of its natural context or when fused to GFP, this motif did not act as a NLS, suggesting that it is required but not sufficient and that other regions in Tyk2 possibly contribute to its strength (26Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 31Savory J.G.A. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Haché R.J.G. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).The capacity of exogenous Tyk2 to sustain the IFNAR1 protein level and to rescue IFN-α signaling in Tyk2-deficient cells correlated with its ability to reside in the nucleus. This apparent paradox can be reconciled, given that the NLS-like motif maps within the JH6 box, which was previously shown to be part of the IFNAR1 interaction region (18Richter M.F. Duménil G. Uzé G. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24723-24729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, disruption of the NLS-like sequence is expected to affect binding to IFNAR1 as well as nuclear localization. The IL-12R β1 binding domain in Tyk2 has not been mapped. Yet, the finding that the mutant deleted of the NLS-like motif failed to be activated in response to IL-12 strongly suggests that the same region in Tyk2 is involved in interaction with both IFNAR1 and the β1 chain. Furthermore, our data showed that the receptor-engaged wild-type Tyk2 pool is more prone to phosphorylation (Fig. 4) with respect to the non-engaged one, probably due to a different conformation and/or localization.We have addressed the question of the role of nuclear Tyk2 by studying the function of a membrane-bound form of the protein modified by amino-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation. Given the properties of the Lck-derived motif, the mbTyk2 protein should be directed to discrete microdomains of the plasma membrane, the lipid rafts (37Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this modification did not appear to greatly affect the ability of the kinase to associate with the IFN-α/β receptor, which at least in part is localized in caveolin-rich membrane domains (38Takaoka A. Mitani Y. Suemori H. Sato M. Yokochi T. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Science. 2000; 288: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The full rescuing capacity of the mbTyk2 protein excludes a role of this kinase in the nuclear import mechanism of the activated STAT proteins (32Lau J. Parisien J.-P. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7278-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y.

A. 2000; 97: 10418-10423Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The possibility that nuclear Tyk2 intervenes in the dephosphorylation of nuclear STAT, for example by activating a nuclear tyrosine phosphatase (39Haspel R.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), was tested by comparing the duration of STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation in wild-type and mbTyk2-expressing cells upon long term IFN-α treatment. STAT dephosphorylation occurred with similar kinetics in both cell types (data not shown), ruling out a role of nuclear Tyk2 in STAT inactivation.A number of cytokines and cytokine receptors, including the IFN families, have been found in the nuclear compartment of a variety of cell types (14Sorenson R.L. Stout L.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4092-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 15Lobie P.E. Ronsin B. Silvennoinen O. Haldosén L.-A. Norstedt G. Morel G.

Subramaniam P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These findings have no clear biological significance yet, but they raise the possibility that JAK proteins could reach the nucleus when complexed to receptors. This is unlikely, since it was found through the study of mutant forms that nuclear localization of Tyk2 did not require the integrity of the receptor binding domain (Table II). Our data support a model where the enzyme can reside in the nucleus independently of its association to cytokine receptors. Little is known of the post-activation fate of JAK proteins. Dephosphorylation by tyrosine phosphatases and catalytic inactivation through the binding of cytokine-induced suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins can down-regulate JAK activity (21Yeh T.C. Dondi E. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 45Hilton D.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1568-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced activation of the receptor-kinase complex may be followed by receptor endocytosis and dissociation of the kinase from the receptor, an event that may cause unmasking of the NLS and consequent transport to the nucleus. We do not favor this model since we did not detect accumulation of Tyk2 in the nucleus in response to IFN-α or IL-12, even in cells overexpressing IL-12 receptors.Given that the known function of Tyk2 is exerted at the membrane, one possibility is that nuclear sequestration of Tyk2 is a mechanism that controls and/or limits its availability. This mechanism has been described for a number of proteins (26Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 46Cornell R.B. Nothwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 47Shimada Y. Gulli M.-P. Peter M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In such a scenario, the nucleus might serve as a reserve compartment for inactive protein. One interesting example of a regulated sorting mechanism through the nucleus has been recently described for the yeast Ste5 scaffold protein, involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (48Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A Ste5 mutant that cannot transit to the nucleus was found to be unable to localize at the periphery, where it performs its function. The possibility that the fraction of Tyk2 that is not engaged with receptors is directed into the nucleus via the exposed NLS is not supported by our data, since Tyk2 mutants that are unable to interact with IFNAR1, such as Δ1–51 and ΔJH4, are not exclusively nuclear. This suggests that the nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning of the protein is completely, or in large part, independent of the receptor and may rely upon intramolecular interactions or interactions with anchoring molecules that in turn could modulate the exposure of the region containing the NLS-like motif. Consistent with this model, the smaller truncation mutant (aa 1–384), spanning the JH7 to JH5 regions, is wholly nuclear. Import of Tyk2 in the nucleus may be counterbalanced by an active export mechanism. So far, we have been unable to demonstrate leptomycin D-sensitive nuclear export or to locate an obvious leucine-rich export sequence.Through the functional study of the membrane-targeted Tyk2 form, we have found that nuclear Tyk2 is dispensable for IFN-α-induced transcriptional and anti-vesicular stomatitis virus responses. We obviously cannot rule out a potential role of Tyk2 in nuclear events induced by other IFN subtypes or upon infection with other viruses in activities that are cell type-restricted or redundantly performed by other kinases. JAK proteins are now widely recognized as participants of a variety of signaling cascades, and the role of Tyk2 is not limited to IFN-α/β- and IL-12-induced pathways (49Ju H., J., V.V. Liang H. Harris M.B. Zou R. Venema R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 257-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Karaghiosoff M. Neubauer H. Lassnig C. Kovarik P. Schindler H. Pircher H. McCoy B. Bogdan C. Decker T.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 50: 39466-39473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The nuclear Tyk2 pool may be mobilized or locally activated in response to specific stimuli in a cell cycle-dependent manner or according to the physiological state of the cell. Many proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine have been found in the nucleus (52Cans C. Mangano R. Barila D. Neubauer G. Superti-Furga G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1203-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Some of these represent culmination of cytoplasmic events, as is the case for the translocated STATs, but it will be important to establish whether tyrosine phosphorylation cascades involving JAK kinases can occur within the nucleus. In vertebrates the Janus or JAK1 proteins form a family of four tyrosine kinases (Tyk2, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3) that function in membrane-proximal signaling events initiated by a variety of extracellular factors binding to cell surface receptors. Notably, receptors that bind helical-bundled cytokines rely primarily on JAK kinases to activate and integrate signaling circuits (1Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). In such receptor complexes JAK proteins are specifically targeted to the cytoplasmic regions of transmembrane receptor subunits and are brought together through ligand-induced clustering and conformational changes of the subunits (3Yeh T.C. Pellegrini S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Catalytic activation of the JAK occur via their reciprocal trans-phosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain. The activated enzymes then proceed to phosphorylate the receptor subunit(s) that act as recruitment sites for SH2-containing substrates, notably the STAT family of transcription factors (5Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 6Decker T. Kovarik P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The domain organization, structure, and mode of regulation of JAK family members have been extensively studied in recent years. These proteins can be subdivided into a large amino-terminal region (N), a kinase-like domain that plays a regulatory role, and a tyrosine kinase domain. Investigations from several groups including ours have identified the N region as involved in recognition and association with the receptor. Originally subdivided into 5 boxes of homology (JH7-JH3), the amino-terminal region was shown to contain a divergent band 4.1 domain, called the FERM or JEF domain, flanked by a SH2-related domain (7Bork P. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 162-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 54-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Kampa D. Burnside J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Functional or structural information on these two domains in JAK are lacking. The FERM domain is present in proteins of large functional diversity (10Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 751-769Crossref Google Scholar) and notably in the ERM protein family (ezrin, radixin, and moesin), where it mediates intramolecular binding as well as intermolecular association with transmembrane proteins (11Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Conceivably, in JAK proteins the FERM domain carries the molecular determinant of receptor binding. To date, all functional features of JAK proteins point to their involvement in events that take place at the level of complexes associated with the cell surface membrane. Interestingly, in a recent study JAK2 was identified as the kinase that associates with and phosphorylates the ATPase p97, a member of the AAA family (ATPases associated with different cellular activities), which is involved in membrane fusion and assembly of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum (12Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lavoie C. Chevet E. Roy L. Tonks N.K., A., F. Posner B.I. Paiement J. Bergeron J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13637-13642Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, JAKs have been observed in the nuclear compartment. Endogenous JAK2 was found in the nucleus of rat pancreatic cells (14Sorenson R.L. Stout L.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4092-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic as well nuclear immunoreactivity was detected for JAK1 and JAK2 ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Immunogold electron microscopy confirmed the presence of endogenous JAK2 in nuclei of rat hepatocytes (15Lobie P.E. Ronsin B. Silvennoinen O. Haldosén L.-A. Norstedt G. Morel G. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4037-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Abundant JAK2 was detected by immunoblots on nuclear fractions prepared from rat liver cells (16Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here, we have studied the subcellular distribution of the tyrosine kinase Tyk2 in human cells, and we have addressed the question of the mechanism of nuclear import and of the potential role of the kinase in the nucleus. We demonstrate that Tyk2 is localized throughout the cell, including in the nuclear compartment, with the exclusion of nucleoli. We present evidence that nuclear localization of Tyk2 requires an Arg-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS)-like motif located within the FERM domain. A mutant form of Tyk2 anchored to the plasma membrane of Tyk2-deficient cells was shown to rescue transcriptional and anti-vesicular stomatitis virus responses to interferon (IFN)-α, ruling out a role of the nuclear Tyk2 pool in these cytokine-induced biological activities. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we provide evidence that the tyrosine kinase Tyk2 is localized in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Tyk2 resides in the nucleus provided that an Arg-rich motif, mapping around aa 219–240 within the FERM domain, is present. Although the motif resembles a bipartite NLS, point mutations in the first basic cluster (R220–221/AA) were without effect. Alanine substitutions of R231–233-235 in the second cluster partially impaired nuclear localization. Deletion of the 22-aa motif totally abolished nuclear localization. When moved out of its natural context or when fused to GFP, this motif did not act as a NLS, suggesting that it is required but not sufficient and that other regions in Tyk2 possibly contribute to its strength (26Kaffman A.

This apparent paradox can be reconciled, given that the NLS-like motif maps within the JH6 box, which was previously shown to be part of the IFNAR1 interaction region (18Richter M.F. Duménil G.

Thus, disruption of the NLS-like sequence is expected to affect binding to IFNAR1 as well as nuclear localization. The IL-12R β1 binding domain in Tyk2 has not been mapped. Yet, the finding that the mutant deleted of the NLS-like motif failed to be activated in response to IL-12 strongly suggests that the same region in Tyk2 is involved in interaction with both IFNAR1 and the β1 chain.

The full rescuing capacity of the mbTyk2 protein excludes a role of this kinase in the nuclear import mechanism of the activated STAT proteins (32Lau J. Parisien J.-P. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 31Savory J.G.A. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Haché R.J.G. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The capacity of exogenous Tyk2 to sustain the IFNAR1 protein level and to rescue IFN-α signaling in Tyk2-deficient cells correlated with its ability to reside in the nucleus. This apparent paradox can be reconciled, given that the NLS-like motif maps within the JH6 box, which was previously shown to be part of the IFNAR1 interaction region (18Richter M.F. Duménil G. Uzé G. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24723-24729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, disruption of the NLS-like sequence is expected to affect binding to IFNAR1 as well as nuclear localization. The IL-12R β1 binding domain in Tyk2 has not been mapped. Yet, the finding that the mutant deleted of the NLS-like motif failed to be activated in response to IL-12 strongly suggests that the same region in Tyk2 is involved in interaction with both IFNAR1 and the β1 chain. Furthermore, our data showed that the receptor-engaged wild-type Tyk2 pool is more prone to phosphorylation (Fig. 4) with respect to the non-engaged one, probably due to a different conformation and/or localization. We have addressed the question of the role of nuclear Tyk2 by studying the function of a membrane-bound form of the protein modified by amino-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation. Given the properties of the Lck-derived motif, the mbTyk2 protein should be directed to discrete microdomains of the plasma membrane, the lipid rafts (37Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this modification did not appear to greatly affect the ability of the kinase to associate with the IFN-α/β receptor, which at least in part is localized in caveolin-rich membrane domains (38Takaoka A. Mitani Y. Suemori H. Sato M. Yokochi T. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Science. 2000; 288: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The full rescuing capacity of the mbTyk2 protein excludes a role of this kinase in the nuclear import mechanism of the activated STAT proteins (32Lau J. Parisien J.-P. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7278-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y.

A. 2000; 97: 10418-10423Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The possibility that nuclear Tyk2 intervenes in the dephosphorylation of nuclear STAT, for example by activating a nuclear tyrosine phosphatase (39Haspel R.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), was tested by comparing the duration of STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation in wild-type and mbTyk2-expressing cells upon long term IFN-α treatment. STAT dephosphorylation occurred with similar kinetics in both cell types (data not shown), ruling out a role of nuclear Tyk2 in STAT inactivation. A number of cytokines and cytokine receptors, including the IFN families, have been found in the nuclear compartment of a variety of cell types (14Sorenson R.L. Stout L.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4092-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 15Lobie P.E. Ronsin B. Silvennoinen O. Haldosén L.-A. Norstedt G. Morel G.

Subramaniam P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These findings have no clear biological significance yet, but they raise the possibility that JAK proteins could reach the nucleus when complexed to receptors. This is unlikely, since it was found through the study of mutant forms that nuclear localization of Tyk2 did not require the integrity of the receptor binding domain (Table II). Our data support a model where the enzyme can reside in the nucleus independently of its association to cytokine receptors. Little is known of the post-activation fate of JAK proteins. Dephosphorylation by tyrosine phosphatases and catalytic inactivation through the binding of cytokine-induced suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins can down-regulate JAK activity (21Yeh T.C. Dondi E. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 45Hilton D.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1568-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced activation of the receptor-kinase complex may be followed by receptor endocytosis and dissociation of the kinase from the receptor, an event that may cause unmasking of the NLS and consequent transport to the nucleus. We do not favor this model since we did not detect accumulation of Tyk2 in the nucleus in response to IFN-α or IL-12, even in cells overexpressing IL-12 receptors. Given that the known function of Tyk2 is exerted at the membrane, one possibility is that nuclear sequestration of Tyk2 is a mechanism that controls and/or limits its availability. This mechanism has been described for a number of proteins (26Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 46Cornell R.B. Nothwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 47Shimada Y. Gulli M.-P. Peter M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In such a scenario, the nucleus might serve as a reserve compartment for inactive protein. One interesting example of a regulated sorting mechanism through the nucleus has been recently described for the yeast Ste5 scaffold protein, involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (48Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A Ste5 mutant that cannot transit to the nucleus was found to be unable to localize at the periphery, where it performs its function. The possibility that the fraction of Tyk2 that is not engaged with receptors is directed into the nucleus via the exposed NLS is not supported by our data, since Tyk2 mutants that are unable to interact with IFNAR1, such as Δ1–51 and ΔJH4, are not exclusively nuclear. This suggests that the nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning of the protein is completely, or in large part, independent of the receptor and may rely upon intramolecular interactions or interactions with anchoring molecules that in turn could modulate the exposure of the region containing the NLS-like motif. Consistent with this model, the smaller truncation mutant (aa 1–384), spanning the JH7 to JH5 regions, is wholly nuclear. Import of Tyk2 in the nucleus may be counterbalanced by an active export mechanism. So far, we have been unable to demonstrate leptomycin D-sensitive nuclear export or to locate an obvious leucine-rich export sequence. Through the functional study of the membrane-targeted Tyk2 form, we have found that nuclear Tyk2 is dispensable for IFN-α-induced transcriptional and anti-vesicular stomatitis virus responses. We obviously cannot rule out a potential role of Tyk2 in nuclear events induced by other IFN subtypes or upon infection with other viruses in activities that are cell type-restricted or redundantly performed by other kinases. JAK proteins are now widely recognized as participants of a variety of signaling cascades, and the role of Tyk2 is not limited to IFN-α/β- and IL-12-induced pathways (49Ju H., J., V.V. Liang H. Harris M.B. Zou R. Venema R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 257-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Karaghiosoff M. Neubauer H. Lassnig C. Kovarik P. Schindler H. Pircher H. McCoy B. Bogdan C. Decker T.

The nuclear Tyk2 pool may be mobilized or locally activated in response to specific stimuli in a cell cycle-dependent manner or according to the physiological state of the cell. Many proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine have been found in the nucleus (52Cans C. Mangano R. Barila D. Neubauer G. Superti-Furga G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1203-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Some of these represent culmination of cytoplasmic events, as is the case for the translocated STATs, but it will be important to establish whether tyrosine phosphorylation cascades involving JAK kinases can occur within the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W2054999309,"The Na+/dicarboxylate co-transporter, NaDC-1, couples the transport of sodium and Krebs cycle intermediates, such as succinate and citrate. Previous studies identified two functionally important amino acids, Glu-475 and Cys-476, located in transmembrane domain (TMD) 9 of NaDC-1. In the present study, each amino acid in TMD-9 was mutated to cysteine, one at a time, and the accessibility of the membrane-impermeant reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) to the replacement cysteines was determined. Cysteine substitution was tolerated at all but five of the sites: the A461C mutant was not present at the plasma membrane, whereas the F473C, T474C, E475C, and N479C mutants were inactive proteins located on the plasma membrane. Cysteine substitution of four residues found near the extracellular surface of TMD-9 (Ser-478, Ala-480, Ala-481, and Thr-482) resulted in proteins that were sensitive to inhibition by MTSET. The accessibility of MTSET to the four substituted cysteines was highest in the presence of the transported cations, sodium or lithium, and low in choline. The four mutants also exhibited substrate protection of MTSET accessibility. The MTSET accessibility to S478C, A481C, and A480C was independent of voltage. In contrast, T482C was more accessible to MTSET in choline buffer at negative holding potentials, but there was no effect of voltage in sodium buffer. In conclusion, TMD-9 may be involved in transducing conformational changes between the cation-binding sites and the substrate-binding site in NaDC-1, and it may also form part of the translocation pathway through the transporter."

The results with wild type and E173Q, H145A, and D214A mutants are consistent with chemical catalysis being rate-determining in turnover. All mutants exhibitedK d values (3.5–8.5 µm) for AcCoA that were similar to wild type enzyme, indicating no functional role for these residues in AcCoA binding. The E173Q mutant demonstrated a ∼500–600-fold decreases in k cat andk cat/K m,H3, consistent with Glu-173 acting as the general base catalyst as proposed previously. No significant effect was observed on substrate binding steps. His-145 was identified as a residue in the peptide binding cleft that must be unprotonated (pK a = 5.8) for peptide binding and likely hydrogen-bonds to the Ser-10 hydroxyl of histone H3. His-145 also contributes to lowering the pK a value (by 0.8 units) of general base Glu-173 through a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the carboxylate side chain.

The acceptor site is the ε-amino group of lysine side chains within the amino-terminal tails of the core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. At least four gene families of HATs have been identified in mammals (1Mizzen C.A. Allis C.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin.

The GCN5 family of HATs are part of a larger superfamily of enzymes capable of acetyl transfer to amine-containing substrates (referred to as GNATs, for GCN5-likeN-acetyltransferases).

After the discovery of HAT activity in a related Tetrahymena enzyme (14Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). In yeast, GCN5 promotes both global histone acetylation (i.e. genome wide) and gene loci-specific histone acetylation (9Zhang W. Bone J.R. Edmondson D.G. Turner B.M. Roth S.Y.

In mammals where global acetylation is less pronounced than in yeast, gcn5 appears to be an essential gene (19Xu W. Edmondson D.G. Evrard Y.A. Wakamiya M. Behringer R.R. Roth S.Y. Nat.

Given the importance of these enzymes in controlling transcription by both global and loci-specific acetylation, understanding the molecular mechanisms of catalysis, regulation, and substrate specificity has become a requisite part of understanding the biological functions of these enzymes and the development of specific inhibitors. To date, GCN5 is the best characterized HAT in terms of its catalytic mechanism and structure. With both GCN5 and PCAF, the basic mechanism was shown to involve the initial formation of a ternary complex before any chemical events occur (20Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.-H. Howard R.

It was demonstrated that conserved Glu-173 (yeast GCN5 numbering) is functioning as the general base catalyst, abstracting a proton from the ε-amino group of the bound lysine-containing substrate (20Tanner K.G.

This effectively increases the nucleophilicity of the amine nitrogen for efficient attack at the carbonyl carbon of bound acetyl-CoA, thus transferring the acetyl moiety to histone.

The structures of PCAF and GCN5 from several species revealed an α/β globular fold where two roughly orthogonal hydrophobic troughs were found along the surface of the protein. The structure of the dead-end complex ofTetrahymena GCN5 with CoA and peptide identified these troughs as the binding sites for H3 histone peptide and coenzyme A (25Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Zhou J. Mo Y. Li X. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Nature. 1999; 401: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The conserved glutamic acid resides within a deep hydrophobic pocket, near the junction where Lys-14 of substrate and the thiol of CoA meet. The crystal structures are consistent with the biochemical evidence that demonstrated that the reaction is ordered and that a conserved glutamate residue acts as the general base. However, many mechanistic questions remain. The structure determinations have provided some additional insight into the possible roles played by other conserved residues that line the active site and the substrate-binding grooves. We have undertaken a detailed kinetic analysis to provide biochemical and kinetic evidence for the functional role of several invariant residues. Here we examine the functions of His-145, Asp-214, and Glu-173 in yeast GCN5 using site-directed mutagenesis, pH analysis, steady state and pre-steady state kinetics, equilibrium dialysis, and isotope partitioning methods. Our findings are discussed in terms of previous structural and biochemical data. Histone H3 peptide, ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLC (representing the 20 amino-terminal residues of human histone H3 and an additional carboxyl-terminal cysteine), and the corresponding H3 peptide with phosphoserine at position 10 were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Lab at the Baylor College of Medicine. [3H]Acetyl-CoA (1.88 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Acetyl-CoA was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. P81 phosphocellulose disks were from Life Technologies, Inc. Dispo-Equilibrium Dialyzers were from Amika Corp. All other reagents were from Sigma, Pierce, or Fisher. Mutations in the catalytic domain of yGCN5 were generated using the Bio-Rad Muta-gene method, and oligonucleotides harboring the desired mutations are as follows: 5′- GAAAACAATTTGTGCGAATTC-3′ for E173Q; 5′-AGCGTAATTAGCTGCATATGT-3′ for D214A; 5′-AGCGTAATTATTTGCATATGT-3′ for D214N; 5′-CATGGAAAGAGCACTTCGATC-3′ for H145A; and 5′-ATCGAAAGGTTTATATGTTAT-3′ for R164K. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The catalytic domain (amino acids 99–262) of yGCN5, and single amino acid substituted forms, were recombinantly expressed in BL21-DE3 bacteria by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction for 4 h at 25 °C using the T7 polymerase-based expression system as described (27Kim Y. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Following chromatography on S-Sepharose, fractions containing yGCN5 or the desired mutant protein (assessed by SDS-PAGE and HAT activity) were pooled and concentrated and then subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on G-75 Sephadex. Purified fractions (greater than 90% purity), determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and concentrated and stored at −20 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). yGCN5 HAT activity was measured using [3H]acetyl-CoA and histone H3 peptide or the phosphorylated (Ser-10) H3 peptide as substrates using a radioactive P81 filter binding assay as described previously (20Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.-H. Howard R. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Bi-substrate kinetic analyses were performed on the E173Q, D214A, and H145A mutants at AcCoA concentrations spanning 0.1 to 40 µm and H3 peptide concentrations spanning 25 to 600 µm. The data were fit to the sequential (ternary complex) mechanism equation (Equation 1), using the algorithms of Cleland (29Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 273-387PubMed Google Scholar) and the computer program KinetAssyst (IntelliKinetics, State College of Pennsylvania), using a nonlinear least squares approach. v=Vm·[A]·[B]/((Kia·Kb)+(Kmo·[B])+(Kmb·[A])+([A]·[B]))Equation 1 Equilibration conditions were 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 15–20 µm yGCN5. Equilibration was performed using Dispo-Equilibrium Dialyzers (Amika Corp.), which contain two 75-µl chambers separated by a 5-kDa cut-off dialysis membrane. The K d value for AcCoA in the presence of yGCN5 was determined by aliquoting 5–400 µmAcCoA (20–40 cpm 3H/pmol) into the buffer chamber, and yGCN5 into the sample chamber. After 40 h of equilibration on a level shaker, samples were recovered from each chamber and counted by liquid scintillation to determine the amount of radioactivity in the buffer chamber ([AcCoA]free) and the sample chamber ([AcCoA]free + [AcCoA·yGCN5]) in order to determine the amount of bound AcCoA. The data were fit to Equation 2and are presented in hyperbolic form. [AcCoA·yGCN5]=([yGCN5]tot·[AcCoA]free)/(Kd+[AcCoA]free)Equation 2 Pulse-chase experiments were done in order to obtain information regarding both kinetic and equilibrium aspects of the yGCN5·AcCoA (30Rose I.A. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 31Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L. Litwin S. J. Biol.

Experiments were performed at 24 ± 1 °C, in 5 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 and 9.5, by preparing solutions containing 37.5 µl of 1.0 µm [3H]acetyl-CoA and 20 µm wild type yGCN5 (pulse) and 20 µl of 10 mm unlabeled AcCoA and 0.0–4.0 mm histone H3 peptide (chase). Under these conditions, the unlabeled AcCoA and histone H3 peptide react slowly yet spontaneously and therefore must be mixed immediately before use. Additionally, the equilibrium conditions for the pulse solution were chosen such that nearly all of the [3H]acetyl-CoA is bound to yGCN5 as determined by equilibrium dialysis. 5–10 s after preparing the chase solution, 12.5 µl of the chase was added to the pulse solution to obtain 50 µl of 15 µm yGCN5, 0.75 µm[3H]acetyl-CoA, 2.5 mm AcCoA, and 0–1.0 mm histone H3 peptide. The reactions were rapidly mixed for ∼5 s with a pipette; 40 µl of the reaction volume was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose, and the amount of [3H]acetyl-H3 peptide was determined as described above (20Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.-H. Howard R. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To determine the amount of radioactivity incorporated into [3H]acetyl-H3 peptide after the initial partitioning event, control experiments were performed at 24 ± 1 °C, in 5 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 and 9.5, by preparing solutions containing of 3.33 mm unlabeled AcCoA, 1.0 µm [3H]acetyl-CoA, and 20 µm yGCN5 (pulse) and 20 µl of 0.0–4.0 mmhistone H3 peptide (chase). Under these conditions, both the [3H]acetyl-CoA and the unlabeled AcCoA are in rapid equilibrium with yGCN5, such that the labeled substrate is effectively diluted with unlabeled substrate. After pre-equilibrating the reaction solutions to 24 ± 1 °C, 12.5 µl of the chase was added to the pulse solution to obtain 50 µl of 15 µm yGCN5, 0.75 µm [3H]acetyl-CoA, 2.5 mmAcCoA, and 0–1.0 mm histone H3 peptide, the identical reaction conditions as the actual pulse-chase experiment. As before, the reactions were rapidly mixed for ∼5 s with a pipette; 40 µl of the reaction volume was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose, and the amount of [3H]acetyl-H3 peptide was determined. The amount of labeled product generated in these control experiments was used to correct for the amount of labeled product obtained in the partitioning samples after the initial partitioning event due to enzymatic turnover of the diluted labeled substrate. The percent of the total labeled substrate partitioned to product in the initial partitioning event versus initial [H3 peptide] was plotted, and the data were fit to Equation 3, [*P]=[*Pmax]*[B]/([B]+KB′)Equation 3 where [B] is the initial concentration of histone H3 peptide, [*P] is the percent of complex ([3H]acetyl-CoA·yGCN5) partitioned as product ([3H]acetyl-H3 peptide); [*P max] is the maximum percent of complex that can be trapped as product when [B] is increased infinitely, and K′B is the concentration of B that results in half-maximal partitioning. The rate-limiting step for wild type yGCN5 was examined using a Hi-Tech quench-flow device (Hi-Tech Ltd., Salisbury, UK). Experiments under single turnover conditions were performed using 20 and 30 µm yGCN5, 0.5 µm AcCoA, and 200 µm H3 peptide at 24 ± 1 °C, pH 7.5 (concentrations given are post-mixing). Two concentrations of wild type yGCN5 were used to ensure that maximal rate was achieved for the single turnover reaction. After various reaction times between 0.01 and 10 s, the reactions were quenched with 2 n HCl, and the amount of [3H]acetyl-H3 peptide was determined using the filter binding assay by spotting 50 µl of the 200-µl reaction slug on P81 phosphocellulose paper and washing away the free acetyl-CoA in sodium bicarbonate (20Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.-H. Howard R. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Variations in the dilution of the slug were corrected versus an internal control of total3H radioactivity by spotting 50 µl of the reaction slug onto P81 phosphocellulose paper and allowing it to dry without washing prior to scintillation counting. Control experiments with yGCN5 and [3H]acetyl-CoA quenched prior to the addition of H3 peptide yielded insignificant counts, consistent with the lack of an acetyl-enzyme intermediate being involved in the reaction. Data were fit to a first-order exponential using Kaleidagraph version 3.0.5 by Abelbeck Software: [product] =Ae(−kt) + B, where A is the amplitude of the exponential first-order rate of product formation; k is the first-order rate constant;t is time, and B is the total amount of product. Quench flow experiments under multiple turnover conditions were performed using 5–10 µm yGCN5 and 50 µm[3H]acetyl-CoA, which were rapidly mixed with 200–500 µm H3 peptide at 24 ± 1 °C, pH 7.5 (concentrations given are post-mixing). After various reaction times between 0.01 and 4.0 s, the reactions were quenched with 2n HCl, and the amount of [3H]acetyl-H3 peptide was determined as described above. Due to a linear increase in product formation and the lack of an apparent burst or lag phase, data were fit to a linear least squares fit. Because of the slower catalytic rates of the mutated forms of yGCN5, pre-steady state experiments were conducted on the bench top without the use of the quench-flow device. Single turnover experiments were performed using 20–50 µm yGCN5 mutants, 0.5 µm AcCoA, and 500 µm histone H3 peptide at 24 ± 1 °C, pH 7.5. As with wild type yGCN5, increased concentrations of enzyme were used to guarantee that the maximal reaction rate was achieved. The reactions were quenched after various reaction times ranging from 0 to 4 h and were analyzed as described for wild type yGCN5. Multiple turnover experiments were performed using 5–10 µm mutated yGCN5, 100 µm AcCoA, and 500 µm histone H3 peptide for reaction times ranging from 0 to 30 min. As a control to ensure enzyme stability, the mutated forms of yGCN5 were assayed for HAT activity after preincubation at 24 ± 1 °C for the length of time of the longest experimental data point. At different pH values spanning 5.6–10, thek cat/K m,H3 values for wild type yGCN5 and the H145A mutant were determined at saturating levels of AcCoA (100 µm), and varying histone H3 peptides (25–300 µm). In addition, at pH values spanning 6.5–9.5, the k cat/K m, AcCoA values were determined at near-saturating levels of H3 peptide (1.5 mm) while varying AcCoA (0.5–2 µm). A 50 mm Tris, 50 mmBis-Tris, and 100 mm sodium acetate (TBA) buffer was employed to keep the ionic strength constant over the pH range examined. Typically full saturation curves were fit to the basic Michaelis-Menten equation. For the pH profiles however, initial velocities were measured at varied sub-saturating concentrations for the substrate of interest. Consequently, the data were fit to a modified Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 4) in order to directly obtain statistically valid values fork cat/K m,H3 andk cat/K m,AcCoA. v0=(kcat/Km·[S])/(1+([S]/Km))Equation 4 Once thek cat/K m,H3 andk cat/K m,AcCoAvalues were obtained at the indicated pH, each parameter was fit to Equation 5 or 6. kcat/Km=C/(1+H/Ka)Equation 5 kcat/Km=C/(1+H/Ka1)(1+H/Ka2)Equation 6 where C is the pH-independent value,K a1 andK a2 are individual ionization constants, and H is the proton concentration. Initial kinetic analyses of wild type yGCN5 and the highly homologous human PCAF were previously published (21Tanner K.G. Langer M.R. Denu J.M.

These analyses indicated an ordered Bi-Bi kinetic mechanism as follows: AcCoA binds to the free HAT enzyme; H3 histone binds second to form a ternary complex; chemistry occurs by facilitating the transfer of the acetyl group from AcCoA to the ε-amino group acceptor of Lys-14 of histone H3, generating CoA and Ac-Lys-14 H3 histone products; Ac-Lys-14 histone H3 is released from the ternary complex; and CoA is released to regenerate the free HAT (21Tanner K.G.

In addition, biochemical analysis of an E173Q mutant of yGCN5 implicated the invariant Glu-173 as the general base, abstracting a proton from Lys-14 of histone H3 to facilitate acetyl transfer from AcCoA (20Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.-H. Howard R. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of Tetrahymena GCN5 (tGCN5) bound to coenzyme A, and tGCN5 bound to both coenzyme A and a histone H3 peptide (representing the amino-terminal tail of histone H3) has recently been solved (25Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Zhou J. Mo Y. Li X. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Nature. 1999; 401: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These structures have provided valuable structural information that are consistent with Glu-173 functioning as the general base in catalysis and that have suggested the involvement of other conserved residues in catalysis or substrate binding. For example, the conserved Asp-214 of yGCN5 resides on a conformationally flexible loop. Its location near the presumed active site had suggested a potential role in catalysis, perhaps as a general base and/or general acid catalyst (Fig. 1) (24Lin Y. Fletcher C.M. Zhou J. Allis C.D. Wagner G. Nature. 1999; 400: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Zhou J. Mo Y. Li X. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Nature. 1999; 401: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition to Glu-173 and Asp-214, which may be involved in acetyl transfer to histone H3, His-145 appeared to be within hydrogen bonding distance of Ser-10 of histone H3 peptide in the structure of the ternary complex (Fig. 1) (25Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Zhou J. Mo Y. Li X. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Nature. 1999; 401: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Ser-10 of histone H3 has been demonstrated to be phosphorylated during mitosis (33Wei Y. Mizzen C.A. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bowen J. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Ser-10 on histone H3 has been demonstrated to be synergistically coupled to acetylation of Lys-14 and is mediated by an increased affinity for the phosphorylated substrate by wild type yGCN5 (36Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Due to the proximity of His-145 to Ser-10 of histone H3 peptide, we hypothesized that this His residue may play a role in peptide binding and possibly in recognition of the phosphorylated substrate. To elucidate the functions of Glu-173, Asp-214, and His-145, we generated and kinetically characterized the E173Q, D214A(D214N), and H145A mutated forms of yGCN5. As one of the conclusions from this analysis, we provide data for an isomerization step in the catalytic mechanism subsequent to AcCoA binding and prior to H3 peptide binding (Scheme FS1).

Larsson H. Humble L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13681-13684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pump belongs to the family of type-II P-type ATPases, including Na+,K+-ATPase, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (2Mφller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). One of the major themes for the reaction mechanisms of these ion pumps is to answer the question where the channel-like structure and the binding sites of cations are located in the pump molecules. The structure-function relationship for these ion pumps has been extensively studied by the site-directed mutagenesis technique. In the sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase, several acidic or polar amino acid residues in the fourth (M41), fifth (M5), sixth (M6), and eighth (M8) transmembrane segments (Glu309, Glu771, Asn796, Thr799, Asp800, and Glu908 in the Ca2+-ATPase) are involved in high affinity binding with Ca2+ (3Clarke D.M.

In the Na+,K+-ATPase, several acidic amino acid residues located in the M4, M5, M6, and M8 transmembrane segments of the α-subunit (Glu327, Glu778, Asp803, Asp807, and Asp925 in rat α2) were demonstrated as the candidates for the sites recognizing or interacting with Na+ and K+ (5Jewell-Motz E.A.

Takeguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).In conjunction with the cation binding and transport, the M5/M6 hairpins (i.e. the M5 and M6 transmembrane segments, and the extracellular loop between them) of the Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase α-subunits gain attention on account of their very unique characters: (i) They do not by themselves traverse the membrane in translation experiments in vitro, and any sequence in the M5/M6 domains of H+,K+-ATPase does not act as either signal anchor or stop transfer sequences (11Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the carboxyl-terminal third of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, which contains the putative M5, M6, M7, M8, and M9 segments, only M5 and M9 have topogenic function, whereas the other three segments do not have this function in translation/insertion experiments in vitro (12Xie Y.

(ii) The M5/M6 hairpins are released from the membrane into the luminal side after trypsin digestion of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase in the absence of K+ (13Gatto C. Lutsenko S. Shin J.M. Sachs G.

These results altogether suggest that the M5/M6 hairpins of the Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase α-subunits are surrounded with other transmembrane segments and are intimately associated with K+. It is proposed that these amphipathic characters of the M5/M6 hairpins are important for the transport of ions.In gastric H+,K+-ATPase, the M6 segment contains cysteine residues reported to be the major binding sites of the benzimidazole derivatives, which are irreversible inhibitors of gastric H+,K+-ATPase (15Besancon M. Simon A. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22438-22446Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16Lambrecht N. Corbett Z. Bayle D. Karlish S.J.D. Sachs G. J. Biol.

Bayle D. Karlish S.J.D. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13719-13728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Rather, the covalent binding of the inhibitor with these cysteines interferes with the conformational changes of the ATPase. Therefore, it is likely that the M6 segment is close to the structural center important for the function of gastric H+,K+-ATPase.In the present study, we focused on the M6 segment of gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and studied the role of the side chain of each amino acid residue from Cys815 to Leu833 in the M6 segment in the partial reactions of H+,K+-ATPase to determine the affinity for cations. For this purpose, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis, which had been used previously to study the structure-function relationships of specific domain(s) of membrane proteins, including ion pumps and ion channels, especially for the binding site of drugs, ligands, and proteins (17Rice W.J.

In addition, Glu822 is involved in determining the affinity for K+ in the K+-ATPase activity (7Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem.

The negative charge of this glutamic acid was proposed to inhibit the dephosphorylation step of H+,K+-ATPase in the absence of K+, and it was proposed that K+ stimulates the dephosphorylation by neutralizing the negative charge (30Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Stekhoven F.M.A.H.S. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is very interesting that amino acid residues such as Leu819, Glu822, Asp826, and Leu833, which are important for the function of H+,K+-ATPase, are predicted to be located on the same side of the putative α-helical structure of the M6 segment along the transmembrane direction (Fig. 8 A). Ile827, which is also important for the function of H+,K+-ATPase, is localized about 90° apart from these clustered important amino acid residues of Leu819, Glu822, Asp826, and Leu833 on the helical wheel model. On the other hand, the K+-ATPase activity was not suffered when the amino acid residues localized on the other side of the M6 segment such as Thr817, Phe820, Cys824, Phe828, and Cys832 were replaced by alanine (Fig. 8 A). Based on these findings and the following discussion, we present a hypothesis that Leu819, Glu822, Asp826, and Leu833 face the putative ion channel-like structure (or putative ion-translocating pore), which consists of several transmembrane segments, M4, M5, and M6. The side chain of Ile827, which is close to Asp826, may support this structure. Similar helical wheel models were previously presented for the M4 segments of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase (31Mense M. Dunbar L.A. Blostein R. Caplan M.J. J. Bol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).We also found that two groups of amino acid residues that are involved in different reaction steps of H+,K+-ATPase show a unique distribution; that is, amino acid residues involved in the phosphorylation step such as Asp826, Ile827, and Leu833 are located in the carboxyl-terminal half (cytoplasmic side) of the M6 segment, whereas those involved in the K+-dependent dephosphorylation step such as Leu819 and Glu822 are located in the amino-terminal half (luminal side) of the M6 segment (Fig. 8 B).Phosphorylation of mutants at positions of Ile821, Leu823, Thr825, and Pro829 was impaired at 0 °C, but it was considerably recovered at 10 °C. It takes longer time for mutants I821A, L823A, T825A, and P829A to reach the steady state of phosphorylation than the wild-type. Therefore, the rate of phosphorylation of these mutants was significantly decreased by mutations. It is also noted that the steady-state phosphorylation levels of these mutants were lower compared with that of the wild-type.Next, we discuss the role of bulkiness of the side chains at the position of amino acids 819, 826, 827, and 833 on the function of H+,K+-ATPase. At the position of amino acid 819, mutations of Leu to Ala and Gly abolished the K+-ATPase activity and K+-dependent dephosphorylation. These mutants showed much lower or almost no sensitivity to K+ in the dephosphorylation step. However, a mutation to Met and Val partly retained the K+-ATPase activity and K+-dependent dephosphorylation (Table II and Fig. 3 C). These mutants showed intermediate affinity for K+ between the wild-type and the alanine mutant. Therefore, the bulkiness of the side chain at this position is very important for the K+-dependent dephosphorylation and determining the affinity for K+, and small side chains cannot support the function.At the position of amino acid 826, not only the Ala mutation but also the isosteric mutation to Asn and the isocharge mutation to Glu abolished the K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation (7Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, both the present residue size of Asp and negative charge at this position are very important to retain the phosphorylation capacity. It is also noteworthy that the K+-ATPase activity was not recovered when Glu822 was replaced by Asp in combination with the mutation of Asp826 to Glu (Table II). Therefore, there is no compensation of the size of the side chain between Glu822 and Asp826. These two amino acids may play different roles in the binding (or coordination) of ions in the ion pocket as reported for the roles of Asn796 and Asp800 of sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase (32Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Z. Lewis D. Strock C. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8757-8767Google Scholar). There are two Ca2+-binding pockets, the sites I and II. Asn796 is involved in coordination of one Ca2+in the site II, whereas Asp800 is involved in coordination of Ca2+ both in the sites I and II.At the position of amino acid 827, a mutation of Ile to Ala abolished the K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation, whereas mutations to Val and Met partly retained the K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation. Therefore, the bulkiness of the side chain at this position is important for the phosphorylation, and small side chains cannot support the function.Leu833 is localized at the end of the M6 segment (at the boundary between the M6 segment and cytoplasmic loop). Mutations of Leu to Gly and Ala significantly decreased the expression level, suggesting that this residue is involved in correct membrane insertion of the α-subunit. No K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation were observed in these mutants. On the other hand, the Val and Met mutants were expressed at the level of 60–80% of the wild-type and partly retained the K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation. Therefore, the bulkiness of the side chain at this position is primarily important for the stable expression of the α-subunit and is also likely to be involved in the phosphorylation.Rice and MacLennan (17Rice W.J. MacLennan D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) performed scanning mutagenesis of amino acid residues in the transmembrane segments, including the M6 of sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase. They found a motif, (E/D)GLPA(T/V), in the M4 and M6 segments, which is partly conserved in other P-type ATPases. In rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase, the sequence in the M6 segment corresponding to this motif is 826DIFPSV831, which is not well conserved. The same group also highlighted Asn796, Asp800, and Gly801 of sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase as residues important for Ca2+ transport (3Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 4Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2767-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Pro803 as a residue important for determining the affinity for Ca2+(35Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding amino acid residues in rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase are Glu822, Asp826, Ile827, and Pro829, respectively. Although Glu822 is not conserved between H+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase, this residue is also important for determining the affinity for K+ in H+,K+-ATPase. Asp826 and Ile827 are also important for K+-ATPase activity and its phosphorylation step. It should be noted, however, that the requirement for the bulkiness of the side chain at the position of amino acid 827 in gastric H+,K+-ATPase is apparently different or opposite from that at the position of amino acid 801 in Ca2+-ATPase. Ca2+-ATPase requires small amino acid (Gly or Ala) at the position of 801 to retain its activity; the Ca2+-transport, Ca2+-ATPase, and ATP-dependent phosphorylation activities were abolished when Gly801 was replaced by Val (34Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2767-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas H+,K+-ATPase requires bulky amino acids such as Ile, Met, and Val at the position of 827 to retain its activity; the K+-ATPase and ATP-dependent phosphorylation activities were abolished when Ile827 was replaced by Ala (Table I). It is also noteworthy that Leu793 of sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase was not pointed out as a residue important for Ca2+ transport, whereas the corresponding residue, Leu819, of gastric H+,K+-ATPase is important for the function of H+,K+-ATPase, especially determining the affinity for K+ in the dephosphorylation step. This difference in the role of Leu residue at the corresponding positions may reflect the difference in the reaction with K+ between H+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase, namely, gastric H+,K+-ATPase transports K+ whereas Ca2+-ATPase does not.Several mutations were also introduced into amino acid residues on the M6 segment of ouabain-resistant Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, and the ability of the mutants to confer ouabain resistance to ouabain-sensitive HeLa cells were studied (5Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13523-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 36Feng J. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4218-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Argüello J.M. Whitis J. Lingrel J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Among them, the role of Asp804 of Na+,K+-ATPase is different from that of the corresponding amino acid of gastric H+,K+-ATPase, Glu822. Asp804 of Na+,K+-ATPase was not replaceable with other amino acids (Leu, Asn, Glu). On the other hand, Glu822 of gastric H+,K+-ATPase was replaceable with Ala and Asp whereas mutants E822L and E822Q lost K+-ATPase activity (7Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that mutant E822A of gastric H+,K+-ATPase showed a very low affinity for K+ in the dephosphorylation step, while keeping a normal phosphorylation activity (Figs. 3 B and2 B). These differences of the role between Asp804 of Na+,K+-ATPase and Glu822 of gastric H+,K+-ATPase may reflect the differences in the specificity for transporting ions and stoichiometry between these two ATPases. Asp808 of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was not replaced with Ala or Leu, whereas alanine mutants for Thr807, Ser814, and Tyr817 were active. So far, there have been no reports for the roles of all the amino acid residues on the M6 segment on the Na+,K+-ATPase function.In conclusion, we identified five amino acid residues important for the H+,K+-ATPase function in the M6 segment. Almost all of these amino acid residues are exclusively localized on the one side of the putative α-helical structure. Of these five amino acids, three located in the cytoplasmic half of the M6 segment are involved in the phosphorylation step whereas two located in the luminal half are involved in the dephosphorylation step. Furthermore, mutations of Ile821, Leu823, Thr825, and Pro829 to alanine significantly decreased the rate of phosphorylation. H+,K+-ATPase is the proton pump responsible for gastric acid secretion (1Wallmark B. Larsson H. Humble L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13681-13684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pump belongs to the family of type-II P-type ATPases, including Na+,K+-ATPase, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (2Mφller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). One of the major themes for the reaction mechanisms of these ion pumps is to answer the question where the channel-like structure and the binding sites of cations are located in the pump molecules. The structure-function relationship for these ion pumps has been extensively studied by the site-directed mutagenesis technique. In the sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase, several acidic or polar amino acid residues in the fourth (M41), fifth (M5), sixth (M6), and eighth (M8) transmembrane segments (Glu309, Glu771, Asn796, Thr799, Asp800, and Glu908 in the Ca2+-ATPase) are involved in high affinity binding with Ca2+ (3Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 4Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6262-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the Na+,K+-ATPase, several acidic amino acid residues located in the M4, M5, M6, and M8 transmembrane segments of the α-subunit (Glu327, Glu778, Asp803, Asp807, and Asp925 in rat α2) were demonstrated as the candidates for the sites recognizing or interacting with Na+ and K+ (5Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13523-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In gastric H+,K+-ATPase, Glu345 in the M4 segment, Glu797 in the M5 segment, and Glu822in the M6 segment of the α-subunit were responsible for determining the affinity for K+ (6Asano S. Tega Y.

(Tokyo). 2000; 127: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Glu345 is also involved in determining the pH sensitivity of gastric H+,K+-ATPase (10Asano S. Furumoto R. Tega Y. Matsuda S. Takeguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In conjunction with the cation binding and transport, the M5/M6 hairpins (i.e. the M5 and M6 transmembrane segments, and the extracellular loop between them) of the Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase α-subunits gain attention on account of their very unique characters: (i) They do not by themselves traverse the membrane in translation experiments in vitro, and any sequence in the M5/M6 domains of H+,K+-ATPase does not act as either signal anchor or stop transfer sequences (11Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the carboxyl-terminal third of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, which contains the putative M5, M6, M7, M8, and M9 segments, only M5 and M9 have topogenic function, whereas the other three segments do not have this function in translation/insertion experiments in vitro (12Xie Y. Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Bellovino D. Morimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2563-2573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). (ii) The M5/M6 hairpins are released from the membrane into the luminal side after trypsin digestion of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase in the absence of K+ (13Gatto C. Lutsenko S. Shin J.M. Sachs G. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13737-13740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). (iii) The M5/M6 hairpins are stabilized in the membrane in the presence of K+ (13Gatto C. Lutsenko S. Shin J.M. Sachs G. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13737-13740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These results altogether suggest that the M5/M6 hairpins of the Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase α-subunits are surrounded with other transmembrane segments and are intimately associated with K+. It is proposed that these amphipathic characters of the M5/M6 hairpins are important for the transport of ions. In gastric H+,K+-ATPase, the M6 segment contains cysteine residues reported to be the major binding sites of the benzimidazole derivatives, which are irreversible inhibitors of gastric H+,K+-ATPase (15Besancon M. Simon A. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22438-22446Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16Lambrecht N. Corbett Z. Bayle D. Karlish S.J.D. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13719-13728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These cysteine residues are themselves not involved in the enzyme function (16Lambrecht N. Corbett Z. Bayle D. Karlish S.J.D. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13719-13728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Rather, the covalent binding of the inhibitor with these cysteines interferes with the conformational changes of the ATPase. Therefore, it is likely that the M6 segment is close to the structural center important for the function of gastric H+,K+-ATPase. In the present study, we focused on the M6 segment of gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and studied the role of the side chain of each amino acid residue from Cys815 to Leu833 in the M6 segment in the partial reactions of H+,K+-ATPase to determine the affinity for cations.

Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Z. Lewis D. Strock C. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8757-8767Google Scholar). There are two Ca2+-binding pockets, the sites I and II. Asn796 is involved in coordination of one Ca2+in the site II, whereas Asp800 is involved in coordination of Ca2+ both in the sites I and II.At the position of amino acid 827, a mutation of Ile to Ala abolished the K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation, whereas mutations to Val and Met partly retained the K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation. Therefore, the bulkiness of the side chain at this position is important for the phosphorylation, and small side chains cannot support the function.Leu833 is localized at the end of the M6 segment (at the boundary between the M6 segment and cytoplasmic loop). Mutations of Leu to Gly and Ala significantly decreased the expression level, suggesting that this residue is involved in correct membrane insertion of the α-subunit. No K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation were observed in these mutants. On the other hand, the Val and Met mutants were expressed at the level of 60–80% of the wild-type and partly retained the K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation. Therefore, the bulkiness of the side chain at this position is primarily important for the stable expression of the α-subunit and is also likely to be involved in the phosphorylation.Rice and MacLennan (17Rice W.J. MacLennan D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) performed scanning mutagenesis of amino acid residues in the transmembrane segments, including the M6 of sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase. They found a motif, (E/D)GLPA(T/V), in the M4 and M6 segments, which is partly conserved in other P-type ATPases. In rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase, the sequence in the M6 segment corresponding to this motif is 826DIFPSV831, which is not well conserved. The same group also highlighted Asn796, Asp800, and Gly801 of sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase as residues important for Ca2+ transport (3Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 4Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2767-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Pro803 as a residue important for determining the affinity for Ca2+(35Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding amino acid residues in rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase are Glu822, Asp826, Ile827, and Pro829, respectively. Although Glu822 is not conserved between H+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase, this residue is also important for determining the affinity for K+ in H+,K+-ATPase. Asp826 and Ile827 are also important for K+-ATPase activity and its phosphorylation step. It should be noted, however, that the requirement for the bulkiness of the side chain at the position of amino acid 827 in gastric H+,K+-ATPase is apparently different or opposite from that at the position of amino acid 801 in Ca2+-ATPase. Ca2+-ATPase requires small amino acid (Gly or Ala) at the position of 801 to retain its activity; the Ca2+-transport, Ca2+-ATPase, and ATP-dependent phosphorylation activities were abolished when Gly801 was replaced by Val (34Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2767-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas H+,K+-ATPase requires bulky amino acids such as Ile, Met, and Val at the position of 827 to retain its activity; the K+-ATPase and ATP-dependent phosphorylation activities were abolished when Ile827 was replaced by Ala (Table I). It is also noteworthy that Leu793 of sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase was not pointed out as a residue important for Ca2+ transport, whereas the corresponding residue, Leu819, of gastric H+,K+-ATPase is important for the function of H+,K+-ATPase, especially determining the affinity for K+ in the dephosphorylation step. This difference in the role of Leu residue at the corresponding positions may reflect the difference in the reaction with K+ between H+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase, namely, gastric H+,K+-ATPase transports K+ whereas Ca2+-ATPase does not.Several mutations were also introduced into amino acid residues on the M6 segment of ouabain-resistant Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, and the ability of the mutants to confer ouabain resistance to ouabain-sensitive HeLa cells were studied (5Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13523-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 36Feng J. Lingrel J.B.

Biophys. 1999; 367: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Among them, the role of Asp804 of Na+,K+-ATPase is different from that of the corresponding amino acid of gastric H+,K+-ATPase, Glu822. Asp804 of Na+,K+-ATPase was not replaceable with other amino acids (Leu, Asn, Glu). On the other hand, Glu822 of gastric H+,K+-ATPase was replaceable with Ala and Asp whereas mutants E822L and E822Q lost K+-ATPase activity (7Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that mutant E822A of gastric H+,K+-ATPase showed a very low affinity for K+ in the dephosphorylation step, while keeping a normal phosphorylation activity (Figs. 3 B and2 B). These differences of the role between Asp804 of Na+,K+-ATPase and Glu822 of gastric H+,K+-ATPase may reflect the differences in the specificity for transporting ions and stoichiometry between these two ATPases. Asp808 of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was not replaced with Ala or Leu, whereas alanine mutants for Thr807, Ser814, and Tyr817 were active. So far, there have been no reports for the roles of all the amino acid residues on the M6 segment on the Na+,K+-ATPase function.In conclusion, we identified five amino acid residues important for the H+,K+-ATPase function in the M6 segment. Almost all of these amino acid residues are exclusively localized on the one side of the putative α-helical structure. Of these five amino acids, three located in the cytoplasmic half of the M6 segment are involved in the phosphorylation step whereas two located in the luminal half are involved in the dephosphorylation step. Furthermore, mutations of Ile821, Leu823, Thr825, and Pro829 to alanine significantly decreased the rate of phosphorylation. In this study, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of all the amino acid residues in the M6 segment of gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, which is regarded as one of the major transmembrane segments involved in ion recognition and transport. Single replacements of Leu819, Asp826, Ile827, or Leu833 with alanine abolished the K+-ATPase activity. In addition, Glu822 is involved in determining the affinity for K+ in the K+-ATPase activity (7Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and its dephosphorylation step as shown in the present study. The negative charge of this glutamic acid was proposed to inhibit the dephosphorylation step of H+,K+-ATPase in the absence of K+, and it was proposed that K+ stimulates the dephosphorylation by neutralizing the negative charge (30Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Stekhoven F.M.A.H.S. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is very interesting that amino acid residues such as Leu819, Glu822, Asp826, and Leu833, which are important for the function of H+,K+-ATPase, are predicted to be located on the same side of the putative α-helical structure of the M6 segment along the transmembrane direction (Fig. 8 A). Ile827, which is also important for the function of H+,K+-ATPase, is localized about 90° apart from these clustered important amino acid residues of Leu819, Glu822, Asp826, and Leu833 on the helical wheel model. On the other hand, the K+-ATPase activity was not suffered when the amino acid residues localized on the other side of the M6 segment such as Thr817, Phe820, Cys824, Phe828, and Cys832 were replaced by alanine (Fig. 8 A). Based on these findings and the following discussion, we present a hypothesis that Leu819, Glu822, Asp826, and Leu833 face the putative ion channel-like structure (or putative ion-translocating pore), which consists of several transmembrane segments, M4, M5, and M6. The side chain of Ile827, which is close to Asp826, may support this structure. Similar helical wheel models were previously presented for the M4 segments of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase (31Mense M. Dunbar L.A. Blostein R. Caplan M.J. J. Bol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We also found that two groups of amino acid residues that are involved in different reaction steps of H+,K+-ATPase show a unique distribution; that is, amino acid residues involved in the phosphorylation step such as Asp826, Ile827, and Leu833 are located in the carboxyl-terminal half (cytoplasmic side) of the M6 segment, whereas those involved in the K+-dependent dephosphorylation step such as Leu819 and Glu822 are located in the amino-terminal half (luminal side) of the M6 segment (Fig. 8 B). Phosphorylation of mutants at positions of Ile821, Leu823, Thr825, and Pro829 was impaired at 0 °C, but it was considerably recovered at 10 °C. It takes longer time for mutants I821A, L823A, T825A, and P829A to reach the steady state of phosphorylation than the wild-type. Therefore, the rate of phosphorylation of these mutants was significantly decreased by mutations. It is also noted that the steady-state phosphorylation levels of these mutants were lower compared with that of the wild-type. Next, we discuss the role of bulkiness of the side chains at the position of amino acids 819, 826, 827, and 833 on the function of H+,K+-ATPase. At the position of amino acid 819, mutations of Leu to Ala and Gly abolished the K+-ATPase activity and K+-dependent dephosphorylation. These mutants showed much lower or almost no sensitivity to K+ in the dephosphorylation step. However, a mutation to Met and Val partly retained the K+-ATPase activity and K+-dependent dephosphorylation (Table II and Fig. 3 C). These mutants showed intermediate affinity for K+ between the wild-type and the alanine mutant. Therefore, the bulkiness of the side chain at this position is very important for the K+-dependent dephosphorylation and determining the affinity for K+, and small side chains cannot support the function. At the position of amino acid 826, not only the Ala mutation but also the isosteric mutation to Asn and the isocharge mutation to Glu abolished the K+-ATPase activity and phosphorylation (7Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, both the present residue size of Asp and negative charge at this position are very important to retain the phosphorylation capacity. It is also noteworthy that the K+-ATPase activity was not recovered when Glu822 was replaced by Asp in combination with the mutation of Asp826 to Glu (Table II). Therefore, there is no compensation of the size of the side chain between Glu822 and Asp826. These two amino acids may play different roles in the binding (or coordination) of ions in the ion pocket as reported for the roles of Asn796 and Asp800 of sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase (32Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Z. Lewis D. Strock C. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C.

Although this sequence strongly resembles a prenylation motif, human ECE-1 did not appear to be prenylated when labeled in vivousing various isoprenoid precursors in cell lines expressing ECE-1. We used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the role of the CXAW motif and determined that the conserved cysteine residue of the CXAW motif in ECE-1, Cys755, is critical for proper folding of the enzyme, its export from the endoplasmic reticulum, and its maturation in the secretory pathway. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the conserved tryptophan residue of the sequence CEVW appears to be important for endoplasmic reticulum export and is essential for enzyme activity. Deletion of Trp758 or substitution with alanine greatly slowed maturation of the enzyme, and resulted in more than a 90% loss of enzyme activity relative to the wild type. Conservative substitution of the tryptophan with phenylalanine did not reduce activity, whereas replacement with tyrosine, methionine, or leucine reduced enzyme activity by 50%, 75%, and 85%, respectively.

The overall amino acid sequence identity of ECE-1 to ECE-2, NEP, KELL, and PEX is 59, 39, 31, and 37%, respectively, and increases to 74, 54, 36, and 49% when comparing only the last 250 carboxyl-terminal residues. The greatest amount of identity lies in the residues involved in zinc binding and catalysis. These proteins also contain 10 conserved cysteine residues in their carboxyl-terminal extracellular domain. The extent of amino acid similarity indicates a common structure and catalytic mechanism for these proteins. The carboxyl terminus of each of these metalloproteases terminates in a highly conserved tetrapeptide sequence CXAW. Most frequently a charged (E/R) or uncharged polar residue (Q/S) follows the cysteine, and is in turn followed by a hydrophobic residue (V/L/I) preceding the Trp. The CXAW sequence resembles a possible CAAXprenylation motif where “C” is cysteine, “A” is an aliphatic residue, and “X” is any amino acid. A GenBank™/EMBL Data bank search for proteins terminating in CAAX, and containing the conserved zinc-binding motif of metalloproteases, HEXXH, revealed only members of the NEP/ECE family. The conservation of this sequence suggests that it might play an important role in these proteins. We wanted to investigate the function of the CXAW motif for this family of proteases using ECE-1 as an example. ECE-1 is responsible for the final proteolytic processing step in the biosynthesis of endothelins (ETs) (5Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M.

The enzyme therefore plays a key role in maintaining vascular tone by catalyzing the production of ET, making it an important target for the treatment of pathological conditions such as cardiovascular and renal diseases. One potential role for the CXAW sequence is that it serves as a novel prenylation site, possibly involving a unique prenyltransferase. Prenylation, a post-translational lipid modification necessary for the association of proteins with membranes as well as for specific protein-protein interactions, involves the covalent attachment of a 15-carbon farnesyl or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid moiety through a thioether linkage to the CAAX motif cysteine (for review, see Refs. 14Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar and 15Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The nature of the isoprenyl group is primarily dependent upon the amino acid in the X position. Well characterized CAAX motifs include the sequences CAAM, CAAS, or CAAA, which confer the addition of a farnesyl moiety to proteins, and CAAL and CAAI, specific for geranylgeranyl addition (reviewed in Refs. 14Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar and 15Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The topology of the NEP/ECE family proteins suggests that the CXAW sequence would be an unusual location for prenylation to occur since they are type II transmembrane proteins with a lumenal carboxyl terminus. The question of prenylation was particularly interesting because there are no known examples of prenylation of a lumenal CAAX motif. In addition, we wanted to investigate the importance of the conserved tryptophan residue in this motif. The sequence CAAW has not been identified as a common prenyltransferase substrate, yet the tryptophan in this tetrapeptide is completely conserved throughout the NEP/ECE family of proteases In the present study, we wished to analyze the tetrapeptide CXAW sequence of ECE-1, CEVW, and determine a possible role for the motif. In order to investigate whether the sequence serves as a prenylation signal, in vitro and in vivoprenylation assays were developed to assess prenylation of ECE-1. Additionally, site-directed mutations of the CXAW motif of ECE-1 were constructed to characterize the role of the highly conserved cysteine and tryptophan residues. Phosphoramidon, Pefabloc, pepstatin, and leupeptin were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [3H]Mevalonolactone (50–60 Ci/mmol), [3H]Farnesol (60 Ci/mmol), and [3H]Geranylgeraniol (60 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Tran35S-label and [3H]mevalonolactone (20–40 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]Farnesyl pyrophosphate and [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia, Inc. Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and endoglycosidase H (endo H) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Polyoxyethylene-10-lauryl ether (C12E10) was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Human big ET-1 (1–38) was purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Biotinylated hexapeptides were synthesized by American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). Precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels were from Novex. All oligonucleotides were custom synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The stable CHO cell line expressing ECE-1a, CHO/ECE-1a, was maintained in the same medium as above including 1 mg/ml G418. Pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown in EGM-2 growth medium supplied by the manufacturer (Clonetics). The cDNA for full-length ECE-1a was provided by M. Yanagisawa and transfected into CHO cells to make a stable cell line expressing ECE-1 (5Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). A flag-tagged construct of ECE-1a was constructed by placing the flag epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the amino terminus of full-length ECE-1a immediately after the start methionine. This construct was then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pZeoSV(Invitrogen). Mutagenesis was performed on the wild type flag-ECE-1a cDNA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and cassettes containing each mutation were subcloned using SpeI and KpnI into a wild type pZeoSV/flag-ECE-1a plasmid that had not been subjected to mutagenesis Biotinylated hexapeptides HKCEVW, TKCVIM, TKCVLS, and TKCVIL were incubated in reaction buffer with CHO cell lysate as a source of prenyltransferase enzymes. CHO cells were grown to confluence, trypsinized, and resuspended in homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1m NaCl, 0.1 m sucrose, 1 mmPefabloc, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 50 µg/ml leupeptin), Dounce-homogenized, and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min. Cell lysate and hexapeptides were incubated with 0.67 µm[3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate or 1 µm[3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, 20 µm ZnCl2) with or without 5 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of acetic acid and streptavidin beads, and prenylation of the peptides analyzed by a Microbeta counter (Wallac). To facilitate cellular uptake of mevalonolactone, CHO cells and the stable cell line CHO/ECE-1a were transfected with 1 µg of a plasmid encoding the mevalonate transporter, pMev (ATCC), using LipofectAMINE 2000 following the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days following transfection, cells were incubated with 20 µm lovastatin for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with 150 µCi of [3H]mevalonolactone (50–60 Ci/mmol) (ARC) in the presence of 40 µm lovastatin for 16 h. Plates were washed with cold PBS, and cells were scraped into PBS and pelleted. The cells were resuspended in 10 mmNaH2PO4 buffer, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 50 µg/ml leupeptin, Dounce-homogenized, and passed through a 25-gauge needle to lyse cells. The cells were solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C, and the lysate was precleared by incubating with protein A Staphyloccus aureus (PAS) beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted, and the precleared lysate was incubated with the monoclonal anti-ECE-1 antibody ECE-6 (a kind gift from Dr. B.-M. Loffler, F. Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) or with a polyclonal anti-Ras antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Antibody conjugates were immunoprecipitated with PAS beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times in 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100 buffer, one time with 100 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, and one time with 10 mm NaH2PO4 without detergent. Beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were subjected to 4–20% or 8% SDS-PAGE (Novex). Gels were fixed in 30% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid, soaked in Enlightening (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). CHO cells, CHO/ECE-1a cells, or HUVECs were grown to 80% confluence and incubated with 50 µm lovastatin for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with 150 µCi of [3H]farnesol (60 Ci/mmol) or 150 µCi of [3H]geranylgeraniol (60 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 50 µm lovastatin for 16 h. Plates were washed with cold PBS, and cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 50 µg/ml leupeptin). After preclearing samples with PAS, immunoprecipitation and analysis of ECE and Ha-Ras was carried out as described above. CHO cells were transfected with the wild type and mutantpZeoSV/flag-ECE-1a constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 following the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days after transfection, cells were incubated for 1 h in methionine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and then labeled with Tran35S-label methionine (50 µCi/ml) for 5 h. Plates were washed with cold PBS, and cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Lysates were vortexed, and a post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. The post-nuclear supernatant was precleared by incubating with PAS beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Flag-ECE-1a was immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times in RIPA buffer and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography as described above. To monitor expression levels of flag-ECE-1a proteins, 10-µl aliquots of the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Novex), immunoblotted with a polyclonal anti-ECE antibody, and detected by ECL following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CHO cells were transfected with the WT and mutant pZeoSV/flag-ECE-1a constructs as described above. Two days following transfection, cells were incubated for 1 h in methionine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and labeled with Tran35S-label (100 µCi/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C. Plates were washed twice with PBS and chased in DMEM/F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum containing excess cold methionine and cysteine at 3 mm each. At the appropriate time points, plates were washed with PBS and cells were lysed with RIPA buffer. A control sample for each was continuously labeled with 50 µCi/ml Tran35S-label for 4 h. Cell lysates were prepared with an anti-flag M2-agarose affinity gel, subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography as described above. Wild type flag-ECE-1a and the ECE-1a mutant, SEVW, were immunoprecipitated from transfected CHO cells 48 h after transfection using an anti-flag M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) as described above. The immune complexes were heated in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) at 100 °C for 10 min. Samples were then incubated with and without 3,000 units of endo H or 3,000 units of PNGase F overnight at 37 °C following the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). The reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer, and samples were run on 8% Novex SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, immunoblotted with a polyclonal anti-ECE antibody, and detected by ECL following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CHO cells were transfected with the wild type and mutant pZeoSV/flag-ECE-1a constructs as described above. Three days after transfection, cells were washed and scraped into PBS, collected by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g, resuspended in homogenization buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m sucrose, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, and 50 µg/ml leupeptin), Dounce homogenized, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and again centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was solubilized in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.25% C12E10, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 50 µg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C overnight. Unsolubilized membranes were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. Aliquots were subsequently used for activity assays. Solubilized membrane fractions were diluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% C12E10, and incubated with 0.1 µmbig ET-1-(1–38) in reaction buffer (100 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.8, 0.1% C12E10, 1 mm Pefabloc, 50 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin A). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h and stopped by adding EDTA to give a final concentration of 5 mm. The final mixture was then analyzed for the amount of ET-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The NEP/ECE subfamily of metalloproteases has considerable amino acid sequence homology, and all the members terminate in a unique tetrapeptide CXAW. Table I illustrates the CXAW sequence homology between the seven known mammalian family members as well as a metalloprotease found inCaenorhabditis elegans, 2GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank accession no.AAC46806.1. which has 32% amino acid sequence identity to ECE-1. The conservation of this sequence indicated that it might play an important role in these proteins, possibly as a novel prenylation site. To test this, we performed in vitro prenylation assays using as substrate a biotinylated hexapeptide corresponding to the native sequence, HKCEVW. Briefly, biotinylated hexapeptides were incubated with CHO cell lysate, as a source of prenyltransferase enzymes, and either3[H]farnesyl pyrophosphate or3[H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Hexapeptides containing known prenylation sequences were included as positive controls (TKCVIM and TKCVLS for farnesyl transferase, and TKCVIL for geranylgeranyl transferase). A small percentage of the HKCEVW peptide (less than 5% relative to the control hexapeptide) was radiolabeled when incubated with 3[H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (data not shown). The weak prenylation suggested that the sequence can serve as a prenyltransferase substrate. We therefore assessed whether ECE-1 could be prenylated in vivo.Table ISequence homology of conserved carboxyl-terminal CXAW Motifs in ECE/NEP metalloproteasesMetalloproteaseCXAW sequenceECE-1 (all isoforms)CEVWECE-2CEVWNeprilysinCRVWKell Blood GroupCQLWPEXgene productCRLWECEL1 (XCE)CSVWDINECSVWSEPCRIWC. elegansmetalloproteaseCQVW Open table in a new tab CHO cells stably expressing the ECE-1 isoform, ECE-1a (CHO/ECE-1a), were metabolically labeled with the isoprenoid precursor [3H]mevalonolactone. To facilitate the cellular uptake of the mevalonolactone, a vector encoding the mevalonate transporter,pMev (16Kim C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23113-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was transfected into the cells. As a positive control for prenylation, a plasmid encoding Ha-Ras was transiently co-transfected with the pMev plasmid into CHO cells. In addition, CHO cells transfected with pMev alone served as a negative control. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were preincubated with lovastatin at 40 µm (a concentration known to inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase; Ref. 17Hayes J.S. Lawler O.A. Walsh M.-T. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23707-23718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to deplete the intracellular pool of mevalonate and its metabolites. Cells were then incubated with [3H]mevalonolactone for 16 h in the presence of lovastatin. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” cell lysates were prepared, and ECE-1a and Ha-Ras were immunoprecipitated and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Fig. 1 A shows the autoradiograph of the labeled immunoprecipitates. Labeling and prenylation of Ha-Ras was evident, as shown by a single band of the approximate molecular mass of 23 kDa (Fig. 1 A,lane 2). By contrast, labeling of ECE-1a, which has a molecular mass of ∼130 kDa when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, was not observed (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). Exposure of the gel for 40 days also revealed no labeling. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitate complex using a polyclonal antibody to ECE-1 confirmed the presence of ECE-1a (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). These results indicated that ECE-1a cannot be metabolically labeled in vivo by a mevalonolactone derivative. Four isoforms of human ECE-1 (1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d) have been cloned. All of these are encoded by one gene and share a common carboxyl-terminal portion, but each is expressed from one of four distinct promoters, which regulate expression of four unique amino termini (18Valdenaire O.

Although the carboxyl terminus containing the CEVW sequence is identical in each of the isoforms, the amino-terminal sequences may be responsible for differences in tissue specificity of expression as well as differences in subcellular localization.

Cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]farnesol or [3H]geranylgeraniol as precursors for farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, respectively (27Andres D.A. Crick D.C. Finlin B.S. Waechter C.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 116: 107-123PubMed Google Scholar, 28Corsini A. Farnsworth C.C. McGeady P. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 116: 125-144PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike mevalonolactone, the alcohol derivatives are readily taken up by the cells, providing a method to metabolically label the primary HUVECs without the need to transfect the pMev transporter. Cells were labeled overnight with [3H]farnesol or [3H]geranylgeraniol in the presence of lovastatin, lysed, ECE-1-immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Ha-Ras was used as a positive control for labeling and prenylation from HUVECs labeled with [3H]farnesol. As shown in Fig. 1 C, only Ha-Ras appears to be prenylated migrating as a single band of ∼23 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). ECE-1 did not appear to be labeled by either [3H]farnesol (Fig. 1 C, lane 3) or [3H]geranylgeraniol (data not shown), indicating that it may not be modified by prenylation. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to assess the role of the CXAW motif and its effect on protein modification and enzyme activity. To simplify discussion of the mutants, the nomenclature used refers to the amino acid substitution in the CXAW sequence as summarized in TableII. The ECE-1a mutant, SEVW, refers to the replacement of Cys755 of the CXAW motif with serine. ΔCEVW refers to deletion of the CEVW sequence by introducing a stop codon at Cys755. The mutants CEVL and CEVM refer to mutations constructed to create possible prenylation sites where the tryptophan residue has been replaced by a preferred residue, either leucine for geranylgeranylation (CEVL mutant) or methionine for farnesylation (CEVM mutant). To further evaluate the role of the conserved Trp758, the CEV mutant was constructed in which the tryptophan residue was deleted. Conservative substitutions of Trp758 were also produced with phenylalanine (CEVF) and tyrosine (CEVY). Finally, the aromatic residue was removed by replacing Trp758 with alanine (CEVA).Table IINomenclature of site-directed mutations of the ECE-1a CXAW MotifECE-1a mutationCXAW sequenceWild typeCEVWC755SSEVWΔC755-W758ΔCEVWW758LCEVLW758MCEVMΔW758CEVW758FCEVFW758YCEVYW758ACEVA Open table in a new tab A construct of ECE-1a containing a flag epitope tag at the amino terminus was used for the mutagenesis.

We found that Hgs associated physically with transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1), which mediate the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and serum response factor, respectively, leading to transactivation via the serum-response element and cyclic AMP-response element.

Several proteins support neuronal survival and activities. Recently, some researchers have indicated that the central nervous system has the potential for partial recovery from injury. Neurotrophic factors play important roles in the maintenance of neuronal survival and normal brain function in the central nervous system (1Bothwell M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 223-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), with much evidence indicating that a lack of neurotrophic factor(s) causes cell death. Furthermore, various studies have indicated that neurotrophic factor(s) may protect the nervous system from cell death initiated by disease or injury. Recently, many kinds of neurotrophic factors have been found and identified in the central nervous system, while some have been only newly discovered and are still to be characterized. Neurotrophic factors are produced by various kinds of cells, depending on the developmental stage, and some are increased at the sites of injury (2Nieto-Sampedro M. Lewis E.R. Cotman C.W.

It is therefore hoped that neurotrophic factors may have a possible therapeutic role in degenerative diseases of the nervous system (9Hefti F. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1418-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Understanding how neurons die and how neurotrophic factors prevent this cell death may be helpful for the development of clinically useful compounds. In the case of nerve growth factor, the receptors are TrkA and p75 (10Farde J.M. Barde Y.-A. BioEssays. 1993; 20: 137-145Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor induces cell death in some cells that express only p75 (11Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G. Miller F.D. J.

Receptor studies are necessary to elucidate the functions of these factors. Other kinds of receptors, such as G-protein-coupled receptor proteins, also exist in the brain. These receptor proteins are coupled to signal cascades and have biological functions (19Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 20Grewal S.S. York R.D. Stork P.J.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar).We have been studying neuronal survival using a 13-mer brain injury-derived neurotrophic peptide (BINP).1 BINP enhances the survival of cholinergic and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in cultures from P14 rats (21Hama T. Ogura A. Omori A. Murayama M. Kunota M. Sekiguchi S. Ishiguro M. Maruyama M. Hatanaka H. Sato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29067-29070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It also rescues hippocampal neurons from cell death caused by glutamate in cultures from E18 rats (21Hama T. Ogura A. Omori A. Murayama M. Kunota M. Sekiguchi S. Ishiguro M. Maruyama M. Hatanaka H. Sato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29067-29070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Recently, we successfully characterized BINP-binding sites in rat brain. The results of binding studies using rat brain synaptosomes and an 125I-labeled BINP analogue indicate that BINP-binding sites are not uniformly distributed, being higher in the septum and hippocampus and quite low in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex (22Maruyama M. Sato K. Ohtake A. Ogura A. Hama T. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments with an 125I-labeled BINP analogue showed bands corresponding to 40, 50, and 100 kDa on autoradiography after SDS-PAGE (22Maruyama M. Sato K. Ohtake A. Ogura A. Hama T. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).To study the function of BINP receptor proteins, we have developed a monoclonal antibody against BINP-binding protein (receptor) by immunizing mice with septal synaptosomes (23Hama T. Maruyama M. Neuroscience. 2000; 98: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies were screened for their inhibition of the binding of125I-labeled BINP analogue to rat brain synaptosomes. We have obtained a monoclonal antibody (mAb) named 6A22 that recognizes by immunoprecipitation a 40-kDa protein, which was also identified by a cross-linking experiment. The cross-linking experiment shows that mAb 6A22 competes for binding between the 125I-labeled BINP analogue and the 40-kDa protein. Immunohistochemical studies show that mAb 6A22 recognizes the extracellular part of a protein in the plasma membrane of neurons and that no glial cells are stained by mAb 6A22 in cultured cells from rat hippocampus (23Hama T. Maruyama M. Neuroscience. 2000; 98: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). mAb 6A22 abolishes the protective effect of BINP against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. These findings suggest that the antigen of mAb 6A22 is p40BBP, the 40-kDa binding protein (receptor) on the cell surface that mediates the action of BINP. As BINP-binding proteins have been observed on cultured neurons from rat brain in both binding (22Maruyama M. Sato K. Ohtake A. Ogura A. Hama T. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and immunohistochemical studies with mAb 6A22 (23Hama T. Maruyama M. Neuroscience. 2000; 98: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), elucidating the mechanism of BINP action in neurons is important for the understanding of how neurons survive in the adult brain. The study of BINP-binding protein should provide information on the protein interactions in neurons that regulate cell survival or death. Therefore, we attempted the expression cloning of the 40-kDa binding protein, p40BBP, using mAb 6A22 antibody and have cloned a cDNA. To confirm the physiological role of this mAb 6A22 antigen, we tried to find a neuronal cell line that has p40BBP and to investigate whether BINP protects these cells from death.DISCUSSIONThe products of the cloned cDNA:pCEVrBBP, expressed on the cell surface, showed specific binding of BINP, and the mRNA for p40BBP is specific in brain. From these results, it is concluded the cloned cDNA codes the 40-kDa brain-specific BINP-binding protein (receptor), p40BBP.The protein coded by the cloned cDNA is a novel protein based on a sequence homology search of a protein data bank. A cDNA fragment, which shows homology to a portion of the p40BBP (amino acid residues 165–285) but for which no function has been identified, was reported in human uterus cDNA. In the human genome, a homologous sequence (85%) exists in chromosome 3 but has not yet been reported to code a protein. Hydropathy analysis and the program for transmembrane segment analysis (30Kihara D. Shimizu T. Kanehisa M. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) predict 2–4 transmembrane domains. From a protein motif search using the Prosite domain search, the motifs for tyrosine kinase and phosphorylation sites by tyrosine kinase were not found in this newly cloned protein. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor was selected as the most homologous protein from the ψ-BLAST search of a protein data base. When the Print protein motif fingerprint protein data base (31Wallace J.C. Henikoff S. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 249-254PubMed Google Scholar, 32Attwood T.K. Beck M.E. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Attwood T.K. Flower D.R. Lewis A.P. mAbey J.E. Morgan S.R. Scordis P. Selley J. Wright W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was searched using the BLIMPS searching program, motif fingerprints of G-protein-coupled receptor protein (GPCR), GPCRRHODOPSN1, -4, and -5 were found. The Print data base includes blocks that are multiply aligned in gapped segments corresponding to the most highly conserved regions. GPCRRHODOPSIN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the rhodopsin-like GPCR superfamily. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 11 opsins; the motifs encode each of the 7 hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions. There are a large number of partial matches. Olfactory receptors mostly fail to match motifs 6, 4, and 2. The prostaglandin and thromboxane receptors fail to match motif 5, and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors tend not to match well with motif 1. The fingerprint does not recognize the pheromone, cAMP, secretin-like, or metabotropic glutamate receptors. They are characterized by their own transmembrane fingerprints and constitute discrete GPCR families. However, p40BBP does not seem to have 7 transmembrane domains. Thus, it does not appear to belong to any known receptor family of neurotrophic factors, cytokines, or neurotransmitters.NG108-15 cells possess p40BBP and the 50- and 100-kDa proteins that were identified by cross-linking experiments using a125I-labeled BINP analogue. The NG108-15 cell line is a neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid. NG108-15 cells have many neuronal properties (34Higashida H. kato T. Kano-Tanaka K. Okuya M. Tanaka T. Brain Res. 1981; 214: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35MacDermot J. Higashida H. Wilson S.P. Matsuzawa H. Minna J. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1135-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and lasalocid causes their death. Lasalocid (X-537A), a polyether ionophore compound isolated fromStreptomyces lasaliensis in 1951 (36Berger J. Rachlin A.I. Scott W.E. Sternbach L.H. Goldberg M.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1951; 73: 5295-5298Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar), is a lipid-soluble material that facilitates the transport of divalent and monovalent ions through biological membranes (37Westley J.W. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1977; 22: 177Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 38Reed P.W. Westley J.W. Biology. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1982: 185-302Google Scholar, 39Aebi R. Zootecnica International. 1989; 3: 31-35Google Scholar). Its neurotoxic action has already been studied in mouse and rat cerebral cultures (40Safran N. Shainberg A. Haring R. Gurwitz D. Shahar A. Toxicol. in Vitro. 1993; 7: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 41Safran A. haring R. Gurwitz D. Shainberg A. Halili I. Levy A. Bogin E. Shahar A. NeuroToxicology. 1996; 17: 883-896PubMed Google Scholar). In rat dissociated cerebral cultures, lasalocid selectively acted on neurons but did not injure non-neuronal cells in the same culture even at higher concentrations (40Safran N. Shainberg A. Haring R. Gurwitz D. Shahar A. Toxicol. in Vitro. 1993; 7: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). BINP prevents NG108-15 cell death caused by lasalocid.In hippocampus cultures, about 60% of neurons are stained by mAb 6A22, whereas BINP treatment protects ∼60% of these neurons from the effects of glutamate. Immunostaining by mAb 6A22 on slices was also not observed on all neurons, and no glial cells were stained. In addition, after administration of kainic acid, an agent that causes excitatory damage in the brain, the level of immunostaining in the surviving hippocampal neurons was increased. As the neurotrophic protein containing BINP was purified from an injured site of rat brain, it appeared that injury caused by an excitatory amino acid induced the expression of p40BBP. Increased immunostaining by 6A22 in surviving neurons may support the hypothesis that the expression of p40BBP leads to the survival of neurons under condition of excitatory neurotoxicity. In addition, mRNA for p40BBP increased after birth. All of these results suggest that p40BBP is involved in the physiological mechanism for the survival of neurons, not at the developmental stage but rather in response to injury in the mature brain. The lack of BINP-binding protein(s) may explain the vulnerability of neurons.The value of K d that was obtained from COS7 cells transfected with pCEVrBBP is larger than the K dobtained for rat hippocampal synaptosomes. Cross-linking experiments have suggested that the BINP receptor proteins are 40-, 50-, and 100-kDa proteins in cultured cells from rat brain and NG108-15 cells. This finding suggests that p40BBP may require associated protein(s) for high affinity and signal transduction. p40BBP is specific for brain and is believed to play a role in the regulation of neuronal death, because the ligand BINP supports neuronal survival and protects hippocampal neurons from death. When a search was conducted for the amino acid sequence of BINP using a protein data base, a chicken proteosome chain 1 precursor was hit as the most homologous protein, whereas a rat or mouse proteasome subunit X showed 69% homology. However, because a proteasome subunit is not released from the large proteasome, the 13-mer peptide BINP may not appear in the brain, and the proteasome subunit would not be a precursor of BINP peptide. Therefore another protein should be a native ligand of p40BBP. Although this native ligand protein in the brain has not yet been identified and is currently under investigation, this p40BBP and its ligand system is expected to have an important role in the central nervous system. Receptor protein(s) disorder has recently been reported for some diseases (42Takahashi M. Shirakawa O. Toyooka K. Kitamura N. Hashimoto T. Maeda K. Koizuimi S. Wakabayashi K. Takahashi H. Someya T. Nawa H. Mol. Psychiatry. 2000; 5: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Further studies on this receptor and ligand system should provide valuable molecular information concerning normal brain function and brain diseases. The normal functioning of the central nervous system presupposes well balanced interactions between different biochemically and structurally linked neuronal systems. Several proteins support neuronal survival and activities. Recently, some researchers have indicated that the central nervous system has the potential for partial recovery from injury. Neurotrophic factors play important roles in the maintenance of neuronal survival and normal brain function in the central nervous system (1Bothwell M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 223-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), with much evidence indicating that a lack of neurotrophic factor(s) causes cell death. Furthermore, various studies have indicated that neurotrophic factor(s) may protect the nervous system from cell death initiated by disease or injury. Recently, many kinds of neurotrophic factors have been found and identified in the central nervous system, while some have been only newly discovered and are still to be characterized. Neurotrophic factors are produced by various kinds of cells, depending on the developmental stage, and some are increased at the sites of injury (2Nieto-Sampedro M. Lewis E.R. Cotman C.W.

Zootecnica International. 1989; 3: 31-35Google Scholar). Its neurotoxic action has already been studied in mouse and rat cerebral cultures (40Safran N. Shainberg A. Haring R. Gurwitz D. Shahar A. Toxicol. in Vitro. 1993; 7: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 41Safran A. haring R. Gurwitz D. Shainberg A. Halili I. Levy A. Bogin E. Shahar A. NeuroToxicology. 1996; 17: 883-896PubMed Google Scholar). In rat dissociated cerebral cultures, lasalocid selectively acted on neurons but did not injure non-neuronal cells in the same culture even at higher concentrations (40Safran N. Shainberg A. Haring R. Gurwitz D. Shahar A. Toxicol. in Vitro. 1993; 7: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). BINP prevents NG108-15 cell death caused by lasalocid.In hippocampus cultures, about 60% of neurons are stained by mAb 6A22, whereas BINP treatment protects ∼60% of these neurons from the effects of glutamate. Immunostaining by mAb 6A22 on slices was also not observed on all neurons, and no glial cells were stained. In addition, after administration of kainic acid, an agent that causes excitatory damage in the brain, the level of immunostaining in the surviving hippocampal neurons was increased. As the neurotrophic protein containing BINP was purified from an injured site of rat brain, it appeared that injury caused by an excitatory amino acid induced the expression of p40BBP. Increased immunostaining by 6A22 in surviving neurons may support the hypothesis that the expression of p40BBP leads to the survival of neurons under condition of excitatory neurotoxicity. In addition, mRNA for p40BBP increased after birth. All of these results suggest that p40BBP is involved in the physiological mechanism for the survival of neurons, not at the developmental stage but rather in response to injury in the mature brain. The lack of BINP-binding protein(s) may explain the vulnerability of neurons.The value of K d that was obtained from COS7 cells transfected with pCEVrBBP is larger than the K dobtained for rat hippocampal synaptosomes. Cross-linking experiments have suggested that the BINP receptor proteins are 40-, 50-, and 100-kDa proteins in cultured cells from rat brain and NG108-15 cells. This finding suggests that p40BBP may require associated protein(s) for high affinity and signal transduction. p40BBP is specific for brain and is believed to play a role in the regulation of neuronal death, because the ligand BINP supports neuronal survival and protects hippocampal neurons from death. When a search was conducted for the amino acid sequence of BINP using a protein data base, a chicken proteosome chain 1 precursor was hit as the most homologous protein, whereas a rat or mouse proteasome subunit X showed 69% homology. However, because a proteasome subunit is not released from the large proteasome, the 13-mer peptide BINP may not appear in the brain, and the proteasome subunit would not be a precursor of BINP peptide. Therefore another protein should be a native ligand of p40BBP. Although this native ligand protein in the brain has not yet been identified and is currently under investigation, this p40BBP and its ligand system is expected to have an important role in the central nervous system. Receptor protein(s) disorder has recently been reported for some diseases (42Takahashi M. Shirakawa O. Toyooka K. Kitamura N. Hashimoto T. Maeda K. Koizuimi S. Wakabayashi K. Takahashi H. Someya T. Nawa H. Mol. Psychiatry. 2000; 5: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Further studies on this receptor and ligand system should provide valuable molecular information concerning normal brain function and brain diseases. The products of the cloned cDNA:pCEVrBBP, expressed on the cell surface, showed specific binding of BINP, and the mRNA for p40BBP is specific in brain. From these results, it is concluded the cloned cDNA codes the 40-kDa brain-specific BINP-binding protein (receptor), p40BBP. The protein coded by the cloned cDNA is a novel protein based on a sequence homology search of a protein data bank. A cDNA fragment, which shows homology to a portion of the p40BBP (amino acid residues 165–285) but for which no function has been identified, was reported in human uterus cDNA. In the human genome, a homologous sequence (85%) exists in chromosome 3 but has not yet been reported to code a protein. Hydropathy analysis and the program for transmembrane segment analysis (30Kihara D. Shimizu T. Kanehisa M. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) predict 2–4 transmembrane domains. From a protein motif search using the Prosite domain search, the motifs for tyrosine kinase and phosphorylation sites by tyrosine kinase were not found in this newly cloned protein. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor was selected as the most homologous protein from the ψ-BLAST search of a protein data base. When the Print protein motif fingerprint protein data base (31Wallace J.C. Henikoff S. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 249-254PubMed Google Scholar, 32Attwood T.K. Beck M.E. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Attwood T.K. Flower D.R. Lewis A.P. mAbey J.E. Morgan S.R. Scordis P. Selley J. Wright W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was searched using the BLIMPS searching program, motif fingerprints of G-protein-coupled receptor protein (GPCR), GPCRRHODOPSN1, -4, and -5 were found. The Print data base includes blocks that are multiply aligned in gapped segments corresponding to the most highly conserved regions. GPCRRHODOPSIN is a 7-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the rhodopsin-like GPCR superfamily. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment of 11 opsins; the motifs encode each of the 7 hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions. There are a large number of partial matches. Olfactory receptors mostly fail to match motifs 6, 4, and 2. The prostaglandin and thromboxane receptors fail to match motif 5, and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors tend not to match well with motif 1. The fingerprint does not recognize the pheromone, cAMP, secretin-like, or metabotropic glutamate receptors. They are characterized by their own transmembrane fingerprints and constitute discrete GPCR families. However, p40BBP does not seem to have 7 transmembrane domains. Thus, it does not appear to belong to any known receptor family of neurotrophic factors, cytokines, or neurotransmitters. NG108-15 cells possess p40BBP and the 50- and 100-kDa proteins that were identified by cross-linking experiments using a125I-labeled BINP analogue. The NG108-15 cell line is a neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid. NG108-15 cells have many neuronal properties (34Higashida H. kato T. Kano-Tanaka K. Okuya M. Tanaka T.

Lasalocid (X-537A), a polyether ionophore compound isolated fromStreptomyces lasaliensis in 1951 (36Berger J. Rachlin A.I. Scott W.E. Sternbach L.H. Goldberg M.W. J. Am. Chem.

 Last week, the Institut Curie announced the discovery of newly identified mutation in
 BRCA1, human gene linked to elevated risk for breast and ovarian cancer, with broadside against Myriad Genetics, which has developed an automated test for mutations in this gene and the related
 BRCA2. Because Myriad9s test doesn9t pick up defects like the newly identified mutation, Curie claimed, it represents a potential danger to French cancer patients. The attack is the opening volley in battle over Myriad9s right to market its test in Europe."
