https://openalex.org/W3207698452,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can damage cerebral small vessels and cause neurological symptoms. Here we describe structural changes in cerebral small vessels of patients with COVID-19 and elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the vascular pathology. In brains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected individuals and animal models, we found an increased number of empty basement membrane tubes, so-called string vessels representing remnants of lost capillaries. We obtained evidence that brain endothelial cells are infected and that the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (M pro ) cleaves NEMO, the essential modulator of nuclear factor-κB. By ablating NEMO, M pro induces the death of human brain endothelial cells and the occurrence of string vessels in mice. Deletion of receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 3, a mediator of regulated cell death, blocks the vessel rarefaction and disruption of the blood–brain barrier due to NEMO ablation. Importantly, a pharmacological inhibitor of RIPK signaling prevented the M pro -induced microvascular pathology. Our data suggest RIPK as a potential therapeutic target to treat the neuropathology of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3205561268,"Glucose consumption is generally increased in tumor cells to support tumor growth. Interestingly, we report that glycogen accumulation is a key initiating oncogenic event during liver malignant transformation. We found that glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) catalyzing the last step of glycogenolysis is frequently downregulated to augment glucose storage in pre-malignant cells. Accumulated glycogen undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, which results in the assembly of the Laforin-Mst1/2 complex and consequently sequesters Hippo kinases Mst1/2 in glycogen liquid droplets to relieve their inhibition on Yap. Moreover, G6PC or another glycogenolysis enzyme-liver glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL) deficiency in both human and mice results in glycogen storage disease along with liver enlargement and tumorigenesis in a Yap-dependent manner. Consistently, elimination of glycogen accumulation abrogates liver growth and cancer incidence, whereas increasing glycogen storage accelerates tumorigenesis. Thus, we concluded that cancer-initiating cells adapt a glycogen storing mode, which blocks Hippo signaling through glycogen phase separation to augment tumor incidence."

https://openalex.org/W3205008568,"Abstract Current inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapies are ineffective in a high proportion of patients. Combining bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, quantitative histopathology and in situ localization across three cohorts of patients with IBD (total n = 376), we identify coexpressed gene modules within the heterogeneous tissular inflammatory response in IBD that map to distinct histopathological and cellular features (pathotypes). One of these pathotypes is defined by high neutrophil infiltration, activation of fibroblasts and vascular remodeling at sites of deep ulceration. Activated fibroblasts in the ulcer bed display neutrophil-chemoattractant properties that are IL-1R, but not TNF, dependent. Pathotype-associated neutrophil and fibroblast signatures are increased in nonresponders to several therapies across four independent cohorts (total n = 343). The identification of distinct, localized, tissular pathotypes will aid precision targeting of current therapeutics and provides a biological rationale for IL-1 signaling blockade in ulcerating disease."
https://openalex.org/W3206602749,"NLRP6 is important in host defense by inducing functional outcomes including inflammasome activation and interferon production. Here, we show that NLRP6 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon interaction with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in vitro and in cells, and an intrinsically disordered poly-lysine sequence (K350-354) of NLRP6 is important for multivalent interactions, phase separation, and inflammasome activation. Nlrp6-deficient or Nlrp6K350-354A mutant mice show reduced inflammasome activation upon mouse hepatitis virus or rotavirus infection, and in steady state stimulated by intestinal microbiota, implicating NLRP6 LLPS in anti-microbial immunity. Recruitment of ASC via helical assembly solidifies NLRP6 condensates, and ASC further recruits and activates caspase-1. Lipoteichoic acid, a known NLRP6 ligand, also promotes NLRP6 LLPS, and DHX15, a helicase in NLRP6-induced interferon signaling, co-forms condensates with NLRP6 and dsRNA. Thus, LLPS of NLRP6 is a common response to ligand stimulation, which serves to direct NLRP6 to distinct functional outcomes depending on the cellular context."
https://openalex.org/W3205234844,"Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis overlapping with frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) is a fatal and currently untreatable disease characterized by rapid cognitive decline and paralysis. Elucidating initial cellular pathologies is central to therapeutic target development, but obtaining samples from presymptomatic patients is not feasible. Here, we report the development of a cerebral organoid slice model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that recapitulates mature cortical architecture and displays early molecular pathology of C9ORF72 ALS/FTD. Using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and biological assays, we reveal distinct transcriptional, proteostasis and DNA repair disturbances in astroglia and neurons. We show that astroglia display increased levels of the autophagy signaling protein P62 and that deep layer neurons accumulate dipeptide repeat protein poly(GA), DNA damage and undergo nuclear pyknosis that could be pharmacologically rescued by GSK2606414. Thus, patient-specific iPSC-derived cortical organoid slice cultures are a reproducible translational platform to investigate preclinical ALS/FTD mechanisms as well as novel therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3205043031,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on mRNA plays critical roles in various cellular processes. However, the landscape and dynamics of m6A modification in hematopoietic system remain unknown. Here, we delineate a comprehensive m6A landscape across hematopoietic hierarchy and uncover that IGF2BP2 is required for preserving the function of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Our data reveal a cell-type-specific m6A landscape in hematopoiesis. m6A modifications arise mostly in the early stage of hematopoiesis and prefer to play distinct roles for determining mRNA fates in HSCs and committed progenitors. Mechanistically, increased m6A-IGF2BP2 expression controls transcriptional state and maintenance of HSCs. IGF2BP2 deficiency induces quiescence loss and impairs HSC function. Moreover, IGF2BP2 loss increases mitochondrial activity of HSCs by accelerating Bmi1 mRNA decay, leading to de-repression of mitochondria-related genes. Collectively, our results present a fascinating portrait of m6A modification of hematopoietic hierarchy and reveal a key role of IGF2BP2 in maintaining HSC function by restraining mitochondrial activity."
https://openalex.org/W3205042410,"The pace of progress in biomedical research directly depends on techniques that enable the quantitative interrogation of interactions between proteins and other biopolymers, or with their small-molecule ligands. Time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay platforms offer high sensitivity and specificity. However, the paucity of accessible and biocompatible luminescent lanthanide complexes, which are essential reagents for TR-FRET-based approaches, and their poor cellular permeability have limited broader adaptation of TR-FRET beyond homogeneous and extracellular assay applications. Here, we report the development of CoraFluors, a new class of macrotricyclic terbium complexes, which are synthetically readily accessible, stable in biological media and exhibit photophysical and physicochemical properties that are desirable for biological studies. We validate the performance of CoraFluors in cell-free systems, identify cell-permeable analogs and demonstrate their utility in the quantitative domain-selective characterization of Keap1 ligands, as well as in isoform-selective target engagement profiling of HDAC1 inhibitors in live cells."
https://openalex.org/W3206783061,"Multimodal measurements of single-cell profiles are proving increasingly useful for characterizing cell states and regulatory mechanisms. In the present study, we developed PHAGE-ATAC (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin), a massively parallel droplet-based method that uses phage displaying, engineered, camelid single-domain antibodies ('nanobodies') for simultaneous single-cell measurements of protein levels and chromatin accessibility profiles, and mitochondrial DNA-based clonal tracing. We use PHAGE-ATAC for multimodal analysis in primary human immune cells, sample multiplexing, intracellular protein analysis and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in human cell populations. Finally, we construct a synthetic high-complexity phage library for selection of antigen-specific nanobodies that bind cells of particular molecular profiles, opening an avenue for protein detection, cell characterization and screening with single-cell genomics."
https://openalex.org/W3205424648,"To successfully perform goal-directed navigation, animals must know where they are and what they are doing-e.g., looking for water, bringing food back to the nest, or escaping from a predator. Hippocampal neurons code for these critical variables conjunctively, but little is known about how this ""where/what"" code is formed or flexibly routed to other brain regions. To address these questions, we performed intracellular whole-cell recordings in mouse CA1 during a cued, two-choice virtual navigation task. We demonstrate that plateau potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons rapidly strengthen synaptic inputs carrying conjunctive information about position and choice. Plasticity-induced response fields were modulated by cues only in animals previously trained to collect rewards based on available cues. Thus, we reveal that gradual learning is required for the formation of a conjunctive population code, upstream of CA1, while plateau-potential-induced synaptic plasticity in CA1 enables flexible routing of the code to downstream brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W3206212320,"Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) is a heme-binding protein implicated in a wide range of cellular functions. We previously showed that PGRMC1 binds to cytochromes P450 in yeast and mammalian cells and supports their activity. Recently, the paralog PGRMC2 was shown to function as a heme chaperone. The extent of PGRMC1 function in cytochrome P450 biology and whether PGRMC1 is also a heme chaperone are unknown. Here, we examined the function of Pgrmc1 in mouse liver using a knockout model and found that Pgrmc1 binds and stabilizes a broad range of cytochromes P450 in a heme-independent manner. Proteomic and transcriptomic studies demonstrated that Pgrmc1 binds more than 13 cytochromes P450 and supports maintenance of cytochrome P450 protein levels posttranscriptionally. In vitro assays confirmed that Pgrmc1 KO livers exhibit reduced cytochrome P450 activity consistent with reduced enzyme levels. Mechanistic studies in cultured cells demonstrated that PGRMC1 stabilizes cytochromes P450 and that binding and stabilization do not require PGRMC1 binding to heme. Importantly, Pgrmc1-dependent stabilization of cytochromes P450 is physiologically relevant, as Pgrmc1 deletion protected mice from acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Finally, evaluation of Y113F mutant Pgrmc1, which lacks the axial heme iron-coordinating hydroxyl group, revealed that proper iron coordination is not required for heme binding, but is required for binding to ferrochelatase, the final enzyme in heme biosynthesis. PGRMC1 was recently identified as the causative mutation in X-linked isolated pediatric cataract formation. Together, these results demonstrate a heme-independent function for PGRMC1 in cytochrome P450 stability that may underlie clinical phenotypes.

Cytochromes P450 are an essential superfamily of heme-containing monooxygenase enzymes that catalyze biosynthetic reactions, detoxify xenobiotic compounds, and metabolize pharmaceutical drugs (1Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York, NY2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These enzymes have a characteristic catalytic cycle that allows for the safe activation of molecular oxygen to react with substrates (1Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York, NY2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Cytochromes P450 are found in all kingdoms of life (1Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York, NY2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In mammals, the liver is the primary site of expression (1Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Cytochromes P450: A success story.Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (REVIEWS3003)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochromes P450 rely on protein–protein interactions between a cytochrome P450 and cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and, in some cases, cytochrome b5 (CYB5) to transfer electrons to the cytochromes P450 to complete catalysis (1Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York, NY2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Regulation of cytochrome P450 activity is crucial to maintain homeostasis and metabolize xenobiotics (1Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York, NY2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Although the transcriptional regulation of cytochrome P450 activity is well-studied, the posttranslational control of cytochrome P450 activity is yet to be fully understood (1Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York, NY2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) participates in protein–protein interactions with cytochromes P450 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and human cells (3Hughes A.L.

Given the large number of human and mouse cytochromes P450 (57 and 102, respectively), this broad range of reported functions for PGRMC1 is consistent with a common role in cytochrome P450 biology (14Nelson D.R. Zeldin D.C. Hoffman S.M. Maltais L.J. Wain H.M. Nebert D.W. Comparison of cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes from the mouse and human genomes, including nomenclature recommendations for genes, pseudogenes and alternative-splice variants.Pharmacogenetics. 2004; 14: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). However, the extent of PGRMC1-cytochrome P450 binding in mammals and the mechanism by which PGRMC1 affects cytochrome P450 activity are unknown. PGRMC1 is a heme-binding membrane protein, and despite its name, PGRMC1 binding to heme is better understood than its binding to progesterone (15Kaluka D. Batabyal D. Chiang B.Y. Poulos T.L. Yeh S.R. Spectroscopic and mutagenesis studies of human PGRMC1.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 1638-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As a type I transmembrane protein, PGRMC1 binds heme in a cytoplasmic CYB5-like domain (16Cahill M.A. Progesterone receptor membrane component 1: An integrative review.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 105: 16-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). While this domain is structurally similar to CYB5, the characteristics of heme binding are distinctly different. CYB5 is an electron carrier that binds heme in a hexacoordinate fashion with histidine residues coordinating the heme iron molecule (17Sligar S.G. Egeberg K.D. Sage J.T. Morikis D. Champion P.M. Alteration of heme axial ligands by site-directed mutagenesis: A cytochrome becomes a catalytic demethylase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7896-7897Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PGRMC1 binds heme in a pentacoordinate fashion with the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue coordinating the iron in the heme molecule, making it unlikely that PGRMC1 is an electron carrier (18Kabe Y. Nakane T. Koike I. Yamamoto T. Sugiura Y. Harada E. Sugase K. Shimamura T. Ohmura M. Muraoka K. Yamamoto A. Uchida T. Iwata S. Yamaguchi Y. Krayukhina E. et al.Haem-dependent dimerization of PGRMC1/Sigma-2 receptor facilitates cancer proliferation and chemoresistance.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The significance of PGRMC1 heme binding remains to be elucidated. PGRMC1 has a paralog in mammals, named progesterone receptor membrane component 2 (PGRMC2), with which it shares 60% amino acid identity. In a landmark study, the Saez lab demonstrated that PGRMC2 functions as a heme chaperone and plays a critical role in mitochondrial homeostasis in mouse brown adipose tissue (19Galmozzi A. Kok B.P. Kim A.S. Montenegro-Burke J.R. Lee J.Y. Spreafico R. Mosure S. Albert V. Cintron-Colon R. Godio C. Webb W.R. Conti B. Solt L.A. Kojetin D. Parker C.G. et al.PGRMC2 is an intracellular haem chaperone critical for adipocyte function.Nature. 2019; 576: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Heme chaperones are necessary because of the reactive nature of free heme. They sequester heme when it is taken up from the environment or synthesized in the mitochondria. PGRMC2 is required for delivery of newly synthesized heme from the mitochondria to the nucleus (19Galmozzi A. Kok B.P. Kim A.S. Montenegro-Burke J.R. Lee J.Y. Spreafico R. Mosure S. Albert V. Cintron-Colon R. Godio C. Webb W.R. Conti B. Solt L.A. Kojetin D. Parker C.G. et al.PGRMC2 is an intracellular haem chaperone critical for adipocyte function.Nature. 2019; 576: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that in addition to its demonstrated role in cytochrome P450 biology, PGRMC1 may also function as a heme chaperone. PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 have overlapping but different subcellular localizations. Both proteins are found in the endoplasmic reticulum (16Cahill M.A. Progesterone receptor membrane component 1: An integrative review.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

PGRMC2 is found in the nucleus where it delivers heme to the nuclear receptor Rev-Erb (19Galmozzi A. Kok B.P. Kim A.S. Montenegro-Burke J.R. Lee J.Y. Spreafico R. Mosure S. Albert V. Cintron-Colon R.

Here, we examined the function of PGRMC1 in mouse liver using a knockout model and found that PGRMC1 binds and stabilizes a broad range of cytochromes P450 in a heme-independent manner, defining a nonheme chaperone function for this family of proteins. To study the function of PGRMC1 in vivo, we generated mice with a conditionally targeted Pgrmc1 allele. The conditional allele contains loxP sites flanking exons 1 and 2 of Pgrmc1 with a neomycin resistance cassette (Fig. S1A). Mice carrying the conditionally targeted allele were crossed to mice expressing Sox2-Cre recombinase to produce whole body Pgrmc1 knockout (KO) mice. Male and female whole body Pgrmc1 KO mice are viable. Because Pgrmc1 is X-linked (22Gerdes D. Wehling M. Leube B. Falkenstein E. Cloning and tissue expression of two putative steroid membrane receptors.Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 907-911PubMed Google Scholar) and cytochrome P450 expression is known to be sexually dimorphic (23Meibohm B. Beierle I. Derendorf H. How important are gender differences in pharmacokinetics?.Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2002; 41: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), only male Pgrmc1 KO mice were examined in this study. A complete blood count and full clinical chemistry were performed on Pgrmc1 KO mice (Tables S1.1 and S1.2). While some hematology parameters (red blood cell count, hematocrit, and hemoglobin) were 10% lower in the KO mice, the mice were not anemic as the values were within reference range (24Otto G.P. Rathkolb B. Oestereicher M.A. Lengger C.J. Moerth C. Micklich K. Fuchs H. Gailus-Durner V. Wolf E. Hrabe de Angelis M.

Med. 2015; 65: 96-113PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the KO mice had 8% less plasma cholesterol than wild-type (WT) mice. This value indicates that the KO mice had a greater challenge maintaining systemic cholesterol homeostasis, but this was a subclinical phenotype (24Otto G.P. Rathkolb B. Oestereicher M.A. Lengger C.J. Moerth C. Micklich K. Fuchs H. Gailus-Durner V. Wolf E. Hrabe de Angelis M.

In summary, Pgrmc1 KO mice were in good health both clinically and physically. Both PGRMC1 and cytochromes P450 are highly expressed in human and murine liver, so we focused our study on this tissue. Knockout of Pgrmc1 protein was confirmed in Pgrmc1 KO mouse liver by western blotting using an anti-PGRMC1 antibody raised against human PGRMC1 (amino acids 43–195) (Fig. 1, A and B) (1Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York, NY2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 3Hughes A.L. Powell D.W. Bard M. Eckstein J.

Liver size and liver tissue histology were both normal (Fig. S1, B and C) (26Thoolen B. Maronpot R.R. Harada T. Nyska A. Rousseaux C. Nolte T. Malarkey D.E. Kaufmann W. Kuttler K. Deschl U. Nakae D. Gregson R. Vinlove M.P. Brix A.E. Singh B. et al.Proliferative and nonproliferative lesions of the rat and mouse hepatobiliary system.Toxicol. Pathol. 2010; 38: 5S-81SCrossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, a marker of liver injury, was not elevated (Table S1.2). Liver metabolite amounts assayed were similar to control values (Table S1.3), except for a small decrease in glutamine (9%). Overall, the livers of Pgrmc1 KO mice were healthy. Our previous studies demonstrated that PGRMC1 binds cytochromes P450 in yeast and human cells (3Hughes A.L. Powell D.W. Bard M. Eckstein J. Barbuch R. Link A.J. Espenshade P.J. Dap1/PGRMC1 binds and regulates cytochrome P450 enzymes.Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 143-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To test whether Pgrmc1 binds cytochromes P450 in mouse liver, Pgrmc1 KO mice were infected with AAV8 GFP or AAV8 Flag-Pgrmc1 to express the protein in the liver for 8 days (Fig. S2, A and B). A Flag affinity purification was performed on detergent-solubilized liver membrane fractions from these mice (Fig. S2C), and bound proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Flag-Pgrmc1 binding partners (Tables S2.1 and S2.2) included 32 proteins, of which 13 (41%) were cytochromes P450. In fact, the most enriched gene ontology (GO) term among the candidate binding partners was “exogenous drug catabolic process” (p = 4.35 × 10−14), which reflects the cytochromes P450 (Fig. 1C). The second most enriched GO term was “oxidation-reduction process” (p = 6.70 × 10−13), which reflects the cytochromes P450 and additional proteins involved in electron transfer reactions, such as lathosterol oxidase and retinol dehydrogenase. Binding of Flag-Pgrmc1 to Cyp1a2, Cyp2e1, Cyp3a, and Cyp51a in the liver membrane fraction was validated by western blotting; binding to Cyp2f2 was not confirmed (Fig. 1D). In each confirmed instance, Flag-Pgrmc1 bound to 0.2% to 2% of cytochrome P450 protein in the liver membrane fraction (Fig. S2D). This coimmunoprecipitation experiment demonstrated that Flag-Pgrmc1 binds cytochromes P450 and, more broadly, may bind enzymes involved in redox processes in mouse liver. We consistently noted an increase in levels of cytochromes P450 expression in Flag-Pgrmc1-expressing KO liver as compared with GFP-expressing KO liver (Figs. 1D and S2E). To determine if Pgrmc1 affects cytochrome P450 protein levels globally, we performed quantitative mass-spectrometry proteomics with isobaric tagging on liver membrane samples from WT and Pgrmc1 KO mice and detected a total of 936 proteins in both of two biological replicates (Tables S3.1--S3.6). We detected 23 cytochromes P450 (Fig. 2A, Table S3.1), a comparable number to a previous proteomic study that surveyed cytochromes P450 in mouse liver (27Hersman E.M. Bumpus N.N. A targeted proteomics approach for profiling murine cytochrome P450 expression.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2014; 349: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Differentially expressed proteins were defined as those increased or decreased by at least 20% and a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 2 (Tables S3.2 and S3.3). Five core proteasomal subunits were more abundant (20–26% increase) in Pgrmc1 KO samples. Pgrmc1 was the least abundant protein (70% decrease), with its detection in the Pgrmc1 KO samples likely an artifact of coisolation interference during the mass spectrometry run (28Sandberg A. Branca R.M. Lehtio J. Forshed J. Quantitative accuracy in mass spectrometry based proteomics of complex samples: The impact of labeling and precursor interference.J. Proteomics. 2014; 96: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Among the other four decreased proteins (21–38%) in Pgrmc1 KO samples were three cytochromes P450, including Cyp2f2, Cyp7b1, and Cyp3a13. While not all detected cytochromes P450 met the cutoff criteria for significant change and signal-to-noise ratio, the P450 family tended to be decreased in Pgrmc1 KO liver (Fig. 2A). Protein expression of Cyp1a2, Cyp2f2, Cyp7b1, Cyp51a, Cyp2e1, and Cyp3a was confirmed to be decreased in Pgrmc1 KO mouse liver membranes by western blotting (Fig. 2, B and C). Quantitative proteomics revealed a 14 to 38% reduction in protein across these specific cytochromes P450, and western blotting revealed a 22 to 70% reduction. Together, these complementary methods show that Pgrmc1 functions to maintain protein levels of these cytochromes P450. Although Pgrmc1 binds to cytochromes P450, Pgrmc1 may also affect protein levels indirectly by reducing cytochrome P450 transcript levels in the liver. To investigate this, we performed RNA-seq on WT and Pgrmc1 KO liver. Expression of 16,318 genes was measured, including 83 cytochromes P450 (Fig. 2D, Tables S4.1–S4.3). mRNAs more abundant in Pgrmc1 KO livers were also enriched for the GO terms, “exogenous drug catabolic process” (p = 2.46 × 10−3) and “oxidation-reduction process” (p = 2.07 × 10−3) (Fig. 2E). Notably, Pgrmc1 binding partners were enriched for these same GO terms (Fig. 1C). For the subset of the 83 cytochromes P450 detected in the RNA-seq data (Table S4.4), 15% were more abundant in Pgrmc1 KO samples compared with wild-type, and 83% did not change. These data indicate that loss of Pgrmc1 does not reduce cytochrome P450 transcript amounts. In fact, loss of Pgrmc1 leads to the upregulation of transcripts involved in drug metabolism and redox processes, indicating that Pgrmc1 does not reduce cytochromes P450 levels through transcriptional regulation. Our in vivo data indicate that Pgrmc1 regulates cytochrome P450 protein levels through some posttranscriptional mechanism. We next sought to establish whether Pgrmc1 regulates cytochromes P450 protein levels by altering protein stability. We chose CYP1A2 because it bound Flag-Pgrmc1 in vivo and is a constitutively expressed cytochrome P450 that metabolizes pharmaceutical drugs and other xenobiotics (29Zhou S.F. Wang B. Yang L.P. Liu J.P. Structure, function, regulation and polymorphism and the clinical significance of human cytochrome P450 1A2.Drug Metab. Rev. 2010; 42: 268-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We generated human PGRMC1 KO cells by CRISPR-editing SV589 fibroblasts (30Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. The human LDL receptor: A cysteine-rich protein with multiple Alu sequences in its mRNA.Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Knockout of PGRMC1 was validated by sequencing and western blotting (Fig. S3A). When the PGRMC1 KO cells were transfected with Flag-PGRMC1, overexpressed PGRMC1 was twofold higher than endogenous PGRMC1 (Fig. S3B). Next, we sought to validate the PGRMC1-CYP1A2 binding observed in mouse liver using human cells. Specific binding between Flag-PGRMC1 and CYP1A2-1XMyc was confirmed by Flag coimmunoprecipitation in PGRMC1 KO cells (Fig. S3C). To test the effect of PGRMC1 on CYP1A2 stability, PGRMC1 KO cells were transfected with CYP1A2-1XMyc with or without Flag-PGRMC1. At 48 h posttransfection, cells were exposed to the irreversible translation inhibitor eme"

https://openalex.org/W3205867583,"The human hand is unique in the animal kingdom for unparalleled dexterity, ranging from complex prehension to fine finger individuation. How does the brain represent such a diverse repertoire of movements? We evaluated mesoscale neural dynamics across the human ""grasp network,"" using electrocorticography and dimensionality reduction methods, for a repertoire of hand movements. Strikingly, we found that the grasp network represented both finger and grasping movements alike. Specifically, the manifold characterizing the multi-areal neural covariance structure was preserved during all movements across this distributed network. In contrast, latent neural dynamics within this manifold were surprisingly specific to movement type. Aligning latent activity to kinematics further uncovered distinct submanifolds despite similarities in synergistic coupling of joints between movements. We thus find that despite preserved neural covariance at the distributed network level, mesoscale dynamics are compartmentalized into movement-specific submanifolds; this mesoscale organization may allow flexible switching between a repertoire of hand movements."
https://openalex.org/W3206552073,"While there is extensive evidence for genetic variation as a basis for treatment resistance, other sources of variation result from cellular plasticity. Using multiple myeloma as an example of an incurable lymphoid malignancy, we show how cancer cells modulate lineage restriction, adapt their enhancer usage and employ cell-intrinsic diversity for survival and treatment escape. By using single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiling, we show that distinct transcriptional states co-exist in individual cancer cells and that differential transcriptional regulon usage and enhancer rewiring underlie these alternative transcriptional states. We demonstrate that exposure to standard treatment further promotes transcriptional reprogramming and differential enhancer recruitment while simultaneously reducing developmental potential. Importantly, treatment generates a distinct complement of actionable immunotherapy targets, such as CXCR4, which can be exploited to overcome treatment resistance. Our studies therefore delineate how to transform the cellular plasticity that underlies drug resistance into immuno-oncologic therapeutic opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W3207910758,"As single-cell datasets grow in sample size, there is a critical need to characterize cell states that vary across samples and associate with sample attributes, such as clinical phenotypes. Current statistical approaches typically map cells to clusters and then assess differences in cluster abundance. Here we present co-varying neighborhood analysis (CNA), an unbiased method to identify associated cell populations with greater flexibility than cluster-based approaches. CNA characterizes dominant axes of variation across samples by identifying groups of small regions in transcriptional space-termed neighborhoods-that co-vary in abundance across samples, suggesting shared function or regulation. CNA performs statistical testing for associations between any sample-level attribute and the abundances of these co-varying neighborhood groups. Simulations show that CNA enables more sensitive and accurate identification of disease-associated cell states than a cluster-based approach. When applied to published datasets, CNA captures a Notch activation signature in rheumatoid arthritis, identifies monocyte populations expanded in sepsis and identifies a novel T cell population associated with progression to active tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W3205428223,"The current COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the importance of obtaining reliable methods for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. A highly specific and sensitive diagnostic test able to differentiate the SARS-CoV-2 virus from common human coronaviruses is therefore needed. Coronavirus nucleoprotein (N) localizes to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus and is required for viral RNA synthesis. N is the most abundant coronavirus protein, so it is of utmost importance to develop specific antibodies for its detection. In this study, we developed a sandwich immunoassay to recognize the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. We immunized one alpaca with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N and constructed a large single variable domain on heavy chain (VHH) antibody library. After phage display selection, seven VHHs recognizing the full N protein were identified by ELISA. These VHHs did not recognize the nucleoproteins of the four common human coronaviruses. Hydrogen Deuterium eXchange-Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis also showed that these VHHs mainly targeted conformational epitopes in either the C-terminal or the N-terminal domains. All VHHs were able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells or on infected hamster tissues. Moreover, the VHHs could detect the SARS variants B.1.17/alpha, B.1.351/beta, and P1/gamma. We propose that this sandwich immunoassay could be applied to specifically detect the SARS-CoV-2 N in human nasal swabs."
https://openalex.org/W3205081199,"Micronutrient (MN) deficiency among children is recognised as a major public health problem in Ethiopia. The scarcity of MNs in Ethiopia, particularly in pastoral communities, might be severe due to poor diets mitigated by poor healthcare access, drought, and poverty. To reduce MNs deficiency, foods rich in vitamin A (VA) and iron were promoted and programs like multiple micronutrient powder (MNP), iron and vitamin A supplements (VAS) and or deworming have been implemented. Nationally for children aged 6-23 months, consumption of four or more food groups from diet rich in iron and VA within the previous 24 hours, MNP and iron supplementation within seven days, and VAS and >75% of deworming within the last 6 months is recommend; however, empirical evidence is scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the recommended MN intake status of children aged 6-23 months in the emerging regions of Ethiopia.Data from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2016 were used. A two-stage stratified sampling technique was used to identify 1009 children aged 6-23 months. MN intake status was assessed using six options: food rich in VA or iron consumed within the previous 24 hours, MNP or iron supplementation with the previous seven days, VAS or deworming within six months. A multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression analysis was computed, and a p-value of < 0.05 and Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were used to identify the individual and community-level factors.In this analysis, 37.3% (95% CI: 34.3-40.3) of children aged 6-23 months had not received any to the recommended MNs sources. The recommended MNs resulted; VAS (47.2%), iron supplementation (6.0%), diet rich in VA (27.7%), diet rich in iron (15.6%), MNP (7.5%), and deworming (7.1%). Antenatal care visit (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4-2.8), work in the agriculture (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3-3.8) and children aged 13 to 23 months (AOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.4) were the individual-level factors and also Benishangul (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3-4.9) and Gambella regions (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0-3.4) were the community-level factors that increased micronutrient intake whereas residence in rural (AOR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.1-0.9) was the community-level factors that decrease micronutrient intake.Micronutrient intake among children aged 6-23 months in the pastoral community was low when compared to the national recommendation. After adjusting for individual and community level factors, women's occupational status, child's age, antenatal visits for recent pregnancy, residence and region were significantly associated with the MN intake status among children aged 6-23 months."

Improvements on these outcome measures were inter-related such that PSS change scores were negatively correlated with all other change scores, FMI change scores were positively correlated with MHC-SF and UWES-S change scores, the latter of which was positively correlated with MHC-SF change scores (all p values < .01). Finally, observed improvements in all of these outcomes were positively related to informal practice quality while improved FMI scores were related to formal practice (all p values < .05).A 5-week mindfulness-based program correlates with improving psychological wellbeing and study engagement in medical students.

It plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of various hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer. Mutations in PIM1, especially in its kinase domain, can induce abnormal structural changes and thus alter functionalities that can lead to disease progression and other complexities. Herein, we have performed an extensive analysis of the PIM1 mutations at sequence and structure level while utilizing state-of-the-art computational approaches. Based on the impact on PIM1, numerous pathogenic and destabilizing mutations were identified and subsequently analyzed in detail. Finally, two amino acid substitutions (W109C and F147C) in the kinase domain of PIM1 were selected to explore their impact on the PIM1 structure in a time evolution manner using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 200 ns. MD results indicate significant conformational altercations in the structure of PIM1, especially upon F147C mutation. This study provides a significant insight into the PIM1 dysfunction upon single amino acid substitutions, which can be utilized to get insights into the molecular basis of PIM1-associated disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3205359523,"Aberrant protein glycosylation has been shown to have a significant contribution in aggressive cancer, including pancreatic cancer (PC). Emerging evidence has implicated the involvement of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in PC aggressiveness; however, the contribution of glycosylation on self-renewal properties and maintenance of CSC is understudied. Here, using several in vitro and in vivo models lacking C1GALT1 expression, we identified the role of aberrant O-glycosylation in stemness properties and aggressive PC metastasis. A loss in C1GALT1 was found to result in the truncation of O-glycosylation on several glycoproteins with an enrichment of Tn carbohydrate antigen. Mapping of Tn-bearing glycoproteins in C1GALT1 KO cells identified significant Tn enrichment on CSC glycoprotein CD44. Notably, a loss of C1GALT1 in PC cells was found to enhance CSC features (side population-SP, ALDH1+, and tumorspheres) and self-renewal markers NANOG, SOX9, and KLF4. Furthermore, a loss of CD44 in existing C1GALT1 KO cells decreased NANOG expression and CSC features. We determined that O-glycosylation of CD44 activates ERK/NF-kB signaling, which results in increased NANOG expression in PC cells that facilitated the alteration of CSC features, suggesting that NANOG is essential for PC stemness. Finally, we identified that loss of C1GALT1 expression was found to augment tumorigenic and metastatic potential, while an additional loss of CD44 in these cells reversed the effects. Overall, our results identified that truncation of O-glycans on CD44 increases NANOG activation that mediates increased CSC activation."

In contrast, reports on herbivores feeding on carnivorous plants and related defenses of the plants under attack are rare. Here, we studied the interaction of a pitcher plant, Nepenthes x ventrata, with a generalist lepidopteran herbivore, Spodoptera littoralis, using a combination of LC/MS-based chemical analytics, choice and feeding assays. Chemical defenses in N. x ventrata leaves were analyzed upon S. littoralis feeding. A naphthoquinone, plumbagin, was identified in Nepenthes defense against herbivores and as the compound mainly responsible for the finding that S. littoralis larvae gained almost no weight when feeding on Nepenthes leaves. Plumbagin is constitutively present but further 3-fold increased upon long-term (> 1 day) feeding. Moreover, in parallel de novo induced trypsin protease inhibitor (TI) activity was identified. In contrast to TI activity, enhanced plumbagin levels were not phytohormone inducible, not even by defense-related jasmonates although upon herbivory their level increased more than 50-fold in the case of the bioactive jasmonic acid-isoleucine. We conclude that Nepenthes is efficiently protected against insect herbivores by naphthoquinones acting as phytoanticipins, which is supported by additional inducible defenses. The regulation of these defenses remains to be investigated."

New approaches to predict and prevent acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs are urgently needed. Here, we show that dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32000 (DARPP-32) physically recruits ERBB3 (HER3) to EGFR to mediate switching from EGFR homodimers to EGFR:ERBB3 heterodimers to bypass EGFR TKI-mediated inhibition by potentiating ERBB3-dependent activation of oncogenic signaling. In paired LUAD patient-derived specimens before and after EGFR TKI-refractory disease progression, we reveal that DARPP-32 and kinase-activated EGFR and ERBB3 proteins are overexpressed upon acquired resistance. In mice, DARPP-32 ablation sensitizes gefitinib-resistant xenografts to EGFR TKIs, while DARPP-32 overexpression increases gefitinib-refractory LUAD progression in gefitinib-sensitive lung tumors. We introduce a DARPP-32-mediated, ERBB3-dependent mechanism the LUAD cells use to evade EGFR TKI-induced cell death, potentially paving the way for the development of therapies to better combat therapy-refractory LUAD progression."

The purpose of this study was to survey subscribers to Calm, a popular mindfulness meditation app, to explore perceived improvements in sleep and mental health, evaluate what components of the app were associated with improvements in sleep and mental health, and determine whether improvements differed based on sleep quality. Calm subscribers who had used a sleep-related component in the last 90 days completed a Web-based investigator-developed survey and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The survey included questions about using Calm for sleep, sleep disturbances, mental health diagnoses (i.e., anxiety, depression, PTSD) and perceived impacts of the app. Participants reported on the extent to which they felt that using Calm had improved their sleep and mental health. Most participants reported sleep disturbance, and almost half reported a mental health diagnosis. The majority of participants reported that using Calm helped them fall asleep, stay asleep, and get restful sleep. All sleep components were associated with perceived improvements in sleep disturbance. Severity of sleep disturbance moderated relationships between using Calm components and reporting improved sleep. Among subscribers with mental health diagnoses, most reported that Calm helped improve symptoms. Perceived improvement in anxiety and depression was associated with using Calm's meditation components but not Sleep Stories or music/soundscapes. Severity of sleep disturbance did not moderate relationships between using Calm components and reporting mental health improvements. Given the accessibility of app-based meditation, research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of meditation apps to improve sleep disturbance. While some sleep content may be helpful for sleep, more research is needed to test what specific content affects mental health."
https://openalex.org/W3205308777,"Inflammation is broadly recognized as an important factor in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI), but pharmacological approaches to alleviate inflammation in AKI have not been proved successful in clinical trials. Macrophage infiltration into renal tissue promotes inflammatory responses that contribute to the pathogenesis of AKI. Suppression of renal tissue inflammatory responses is postulated to improve renal injury of patients and animals. Rhodomeroterpene (RMT) is a novel meroterpenoid isolated from the Rhododendron genus that was shown to exert anti-inflammatory action in vivo or in vitro in this study. We investigated the treatment effects of RMT on LPS-induced sepsis and two different AKI models. The results showed that pretreatment with RMT (30 mg kg−1 d−1, ip, for 3 days) significantly inhibited acute inflammatory responses in LPS-induced septic mice. In both renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R) and sepsis-induced AKI models, RMT (30 mg kg−1 d−1, ip, for 3 days) ameliorated renal function and injury and alleviated inflammation by reducing the infiltration of immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that RMT inhibits inflammatory responses in macrophages. The anti-inflammatory effects of RMT may be due to the inactivation of the IKK/NF-κB and PI3K/PDK1/Akt inflammatory signaling pathways in macrophages. Collectively, our findings indicate that RMT ameliorates renal injury and alleviates the renal inflammatory state in different AKI models, suggesting that RMT may be a potential agent for the treatment of AKI."

This study aims to assess the prevalence and factors associated with electronic cigarette use, as well as the relationship between their use and anxiety among adolescents and young adults in Lagos, Nigeria.An online cross-sectional study among participants aged between 15-35 years. The survey had three sections: sociodemographic information, the pattern of e-cigarette use, and a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with e-cigarette use. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analysis was done using STATA-15.0 software.Data from a total of 949 respondents was analysed. Participants had a mean age of 23.36 years (±3.97) and were predominantly female (55.64%). The prevalence of e-cigarette ever-use was 7.9% (95% CI: 5.8,10.0). Older age and being male were independently associated with higher odds of e-cigarette use. After adjusting for age and sex, alcohol use (p<0.001), friend's use (p<0.001), and other tobacco product or substance use (p:0.05) remained significantly associated with higher odds of e-cigarette use. There was no association between anxiety levels and e-cigarette use.These findings suggest a higher likelihood of e-cigarette use among alcohol consumers, poly-tobacco or substance users and individuals with friends who use e-cigarettes. Health providers and policy makers in Nigeria might consider preventive measures aimed at young adults with the identified risk factors, as well as close monitoring of trends in e-cigarette use in the coming years."
https://openalex.org/W3205700498,"Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) caused by TMEM43 p.S358L is a fully penetrant heart disease that results in impaired cardiac function or fatal arrhythmia. However, the molecular mechanism of ACM caused by the TMEM43 variant has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we generated knock-in (KI) rats harboring a Tmem43 p.S358L mutation and established induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients based on the identification of TMEM43 p.S358L variant from a family with ACM. The Tmem43-S358L KI rats exhibited ventricular arrhythmia and fibrotic myocardial replacement in the subepicardium, which recapitulated the human ACM phenotype. The four-transmembrane protein TMEM43 with the p.S358L variant (TMEM43S358L) was found to be modified by N-linked glycosylation in both KI rat cardiomyocytes and patient-specific iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. TMEM43S358L glycosylation increased under the conditions of enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by pharmacological stimulation or age-dependent decline of the ER function. Intriguingly, the specific glycosylation of TMEM43S358L resulted from the altered membrane topology of TMEM43. Moreover, unlike TMEM43WT, which is mainly localized to the ER, TMEM43S358L accumulated at the nuclear envelope of cardiomyocytes with the increase in glycosylation. Finally, our comprehensive transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the regional differences in gene expression patterns between the inner and outer layers observed in the wild type myocardium were partially diminished in the KI myocardium prior to exhibiting histological changes indicative of ACM. Altogether, these findings suggest that the aberrant accumulation of TMEM43S358L underlies the pathogenesis of ACM caused by TMEM43 p.S358L variant by affecting the transmural gene expression within the myocardium."

It has also transformed HIV infection into a manageable chronic condition. However, first-line antiretroviral treatment failure continues to grow especially in resource limited settings. Despite this, determinants of first-line antiretroviral treatment failure are not well studied in Ethiopia.To identify determinants of first-line antiretroviral treatment failure among adult patients on antiretroviral therapy in Mettu Karl Specialized Hospital, South West Ethiopia, in 2020.A hospital based case-control study was conducted from October to November 2020. Simple random sampling technique was used to select participants. Interviewer administered questionnaire and record review were used for data collection. Data were entered into epi data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used. At the end, variables with P-value < 0.05 at 95% confidence intervals for adjusted odds ratio were considered statistically significant determinants of first line treatment failure.A total of 113 cases and 339 controls were included in the study with response rate of 98.6%. Sixty-four (56.6%) of cases and 183 (54.0%) of controls were females. Baseline WHO clinical stage III and IV (AOR = 1.909, 95% CI: (1.103, 3.305), baseline body mass index<18.5kg/m2(AOR = 2.208,95% CI:(1.257,3.877),baseline CD4 cell count <100cells/mm3 (AOR = 3.016, 95% CI: (1.734, 5.246), having history of TB co-infection (AOR = 1.855, 95% CI: (1.027, 3.353), having history of lost to follow up (AOR = 3.235, 95% CI: (1.096, 9.551), poor adherence to medication (AOR = 7.597, 95% CI: (4.059, 14.219) and initiation of treatment after two years of diagnosis with HIV (AOR = 4.979, 95% CI: (2.039, 12.158) were determinants of first-line antiretroviral treatment failure.In this study several variables were found to be determinants of first-line antiretroviral treatment failure. Concerned bodies should give more attention to early diagnosis of HIV, early enrollment in chronic HIV care and early initiation of ART before patients develop advanced WHO clinical stages. In addition, focus has to be given for patients with low CD4 count. Regular screening for TB, counseling on optimal adherence to medication and enhancing nutritional status of patients with low body mass index are also crucial to prevent first-line antiretroviral treatment failure."
https://openalex.org/W3207701001,"Trabecular meshwork constitutes the conventional outflow pathway and controls intraocular pressure by regulating aqueous outflow. Mechanical stimulation has been studied as one of the triggers to regulate aqueous outflow in trabecular meshwork, but it is not well understood. We investigated that how transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4) functions in human trabecular meshwork cells (HTMC) and affects intraocular pressure (IOP). HTMC were treated with TRPV4 siRNA, followed by incubation for 24 hours. We confirmed the suppression of TRPV4 mRNA expression and the reduction of Ca 2+ influx by the TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A in TRPV4 siRNA-treated HTMC. TRPV4 siRNA-treated HTMC exhibited a significant reduction in Ca 2+ influx and production of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin (PG) E 2 induced by mechanical stretch, and direct activation of TRPV4 by GSK1016790A increased production of arachidonic acid, PGE 2 , and PGD 2 and inhibited gel contraction. Furthermore, TRPV4-deficient mice had higher IOP than wild-type mice, and GSK1016790A administration lowered IOP. These results suggest that TRPV4 mediates the cellular response induced by trabecular meshwork stretch, leading to IOP reduction through the production of prostaglandins and inhibition of cell contraction. Targeting TRPV4 may have therapeutic benefits that lead to lowering IOP in glaucoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W3206540807,"What are the cognitive mechanisms supporting non-symbolic and symbolic order processing? Preliminary evidence suggests that non-symbolic and symbolic order processing are partly distinct constructs. The precise mechanisms supporting these skills, however, are still unclear. Moreover, predictive patterns may undergo dynamic developmental changes during the first years of formal schooling. This study investigates the contribution of theoretically relevant constructs (non-symbolic and symbolic magnitude comparison, counting and storage and manipulation components of verbal and visuo-spatial working memory) to performance and developmental change in non-symbolic and symbolic numerical order processing. We followed 157 children longitudinally from Grade 1 to 3. In the order judgement tasks, children decided whether or not triplets of dots or digits were arranged in numerically ascending order. Non-symbolic magnitude comparison and visuo-spatial manipulation were significant predictors of initial performance in both non-symbolic and symbolic ordering. In line with our expectations, counting skills contributed additional variance to the prediction of symbolic, but not of non-symbolic ordering. Developmental change in ordering performance from Grade 1 to 2 was predicted by symbolic comparison skills and visuo-spatial manipulation. None of the predictors explained variance in developmental change from Grade 2 to 3. Taken together, the present results provide robust evidence for a general involvement of pair-wise magnitude comparison and visuo-spatial manipulation in numerical ordering, irrespective of the number format. Importantly, counting-based mechanisms appear to be a unique predictor of symbolic ordering. We thus conclude that there is only a partial overlap of the cognitive mechanisms underlying non-symbolic and symbolic order processing."
https://openalex.org/W3206581591,"Inflammatory microenvironment after transplantation affects the proliferation and causes senescence of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) thus compromising their clinical efficacy. Priming stem cells with herbal extracts is considered very promising to improve their viability in the inflammatory milieu. Aesculus indica (A. indica) is used to treat many inflammatory diseases in Asia for decades. Herein, we explored the protective role of A. indica extract on human adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hADMSCs) against Monosodium Iodoacetate (MIA) induced stress in vitro. A. indica ameliorated the injury as depicted by significantly enhanced proliferation, viability, improved cell migration and superoxide dismutase activity. Furthermore, reduced lactate dehydrogenase activity, reactive oxygen species release, senescent and apoptotic cells were detected in A. indica primed hADMSCs. Downregulation of NF-κB pathway and associated inflammatory genes, NF-κB p65/RelA and p50/NF-κB 1, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin 1 (IL-1β), Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) were observed in A. indica primed hADMSCs as compared to stressed hADMSCs. Complementary to gene expression, A. indica priming reduced the release of transcription factor p65, inhibitory-κB kinase (IKK) α and β, IL-1β and TNF-α proteins expression. Our data elucidates that A. indica extract preconditioning rescued hADMSCs against oxidative stress and improved their therapeutic potential by relieving inflammation through regulation of NF-κB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3206711726,"The closure of cognitive psychology labs around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic has prevented in-person testing. This has caused a particular challenge for speech production researchers, as before the pandemic there were no studies demonstrating that reliable overt speech production data could be collected via the internet. Here, we present evidence that both accurate and reliable overt articulation data can be collected from internet-based speech production experiments. We tested 100 participants in a picture naming paradigm, where we manipulated the word and phonotactic frequency of the picture names. We compared our results to a lab-based study conducted on different participants which used the same materials and design. We found a significant word frequency effect but no phonotactic frequency effect, fully replicating the lab-based results. Effect sizes were similar between experiments, but with significantly longer latencies in the internet-collected data. We found no evidence that internet upload or download speed affected either naming latencies or errors. In addition, we carried out a permutation-style analysis which recommends a minimum sample size of 40 participants for online production paradigms. In sum, our study demonstrates that internet-based testing of speech production is a feasible and promising endeavour, with less challenges than many researchers (anecdotally) assumed."
https://openalex.org/W3207826710,"Cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is an important nucleotide signaling molecule that plays a key role in osmotic regulation in bacteria. c-di-AMP is produced from two molecules of ATP by proteins containing a diadenylate cyclase (DAC) domain.

As both high and low levels of c-di-AMP have a negative impact on bacterial growth, the cellular levels of this signaling nucleotide are tightly regulated. Here we investigated how the activity of the B. subtilis CdaA is regulated by the phosphoglucomutase GlmM, which has been shown to interact with the c-di-AMP cyclase. Using the soluble B. subtilis CdaACD catalytic domain and purified full-length GlmM or the GlmMF369 variant lacking the C-terminal flexible domain 4, we show that the cyclase and phosphoglucomutase form a stable complex in vitro and that GlmM is a potent cyclase inhibitor. We determined the crystal structure of the individual B. subtilis CdaACD and GlmM homodimers and of the CdaACD:GlmMF369 complex. In the complex structure, a CdaACD dimer is bound to a GlmMF369 dimer in such a manner that GlmM blocks the oligomerization of CdaACD and formation of active head-to-head cyclase oligomers, thus suggesting a mechanism by which GlmM acts as a cyclase inhibitor.

Recently, another structure of the cytoplasmic catalytic domain of the L. monocytogenes CdaA enzyme (Δ100CdaA) has been reported with a c-di-AMP bound between two monomers, which based on the crystal cell packing were arranged in an active dimer of dimer configuration (30Heidemann J.L.

These findings are consistent with the idea that CdaA (DacA) enzymes will need to form higher oligomers to achieve an active enzyme configuration. Hence, factors influencing the ability of c-di-AMP cyclases to rearrange into an active conformation or to form higher oligomers will be able to regulate the activity of these enzymes. The genetic arrangement and operon structure coding for the “housekeeping” c-di-AMP cyclase CdaA (DacA) is conserved in Firmicutes (29Gundlach J. Mehne F.M. Herzberg C. Kampf J. Valerius O. Kaever V.

Two genes, coding for the membrane-linked CdaA regulator CdaR (also named YbbR in some bacteria) and cytoplasmically located peptidoglycan precursor synthesis enzyme GlmM, are found downstream and in an operon with cdaA (29Gundlach J.

Through recent studies in B. subtilis, L. monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis, and S. aureus, it is has become apparent that these three genes are not only cotranscribed but that the encoded proteins also form a complex and that CdaR and GlmM can regulate the activity of the c-di-AMP cyclase CdaA (29Gundlach J.

However, the molecular mechanisms on how the CdaA cyclase activity is regulated by these proteins are not yet known, and this was further investigated as part of this study. GlmM is a phosphoglucomutase enzyme catalyzing the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is subsequently used to produce the essential peptidoglycan precursor UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine (35Barreteau H.

In B. subtilis, L. monocytogenes, and L. lactis, a protein–protein interaction between CdaA and GlmM has been detected using bacterial two-hybrid assays performed in Escherichia coli (29Gundlach J.

In B. subtilis this interaction has been further confirmed by in vivo protein cross-linking and pull-down assays (29Gundlach J. Mehne F.M. Herzberg C. Kampf J. Valerius O. Kaever V. Stülke J. An essential poison: Synthesis and degradation of cyclic di-AMP in Bacillus subtilis.J.

Microbiol. 2020; 22: 2771-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The first evidence that GlmM serves as negative regulator of CdaA/DacA activity came from an L. lactis strain that produces a GlmM variant that is thought to form a stronger interaction with CdaA; this strain produces lower cellular c-di-AMP levels than the bacteria expressing wild-type GlmM (31Zhu Y.

Microbiol. 2016; 99: 1015-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activity of the soluble recombinant S. aureus DacA catalytic domain (DacACD) could be blocked almost completely by the addition of purified GlmM protein in in vitro assays, and the recombinant proteins were shown to form a stable complex that could be purified via size-exclusion chromatography (28Tosi T. Hoshiga F. Millership C. Singh R. Eldrid C. Patin D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Thalassinos K. Freemont P. Gründling A. Inhibition of the Staphylococcus aureus c-di-AMP cyclase DacA by direct interaction with the phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM.PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15e1007537Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the activity of GlmM was not affected by the interaction with DacACD (28Tosi T. Hoshiga F. Millership C. Singh R. Eldrid C. Patin D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Thalassinos K. Freemont P.

Inhibition of the Staphylococcus aureus c-di-AMP cyclase DacA by direct interaction with the phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM.PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15e1007537Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additional mass spectrometry and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses suggested that the complex is composed of a DacACD dimer and a GlmM dimer (28Tosi T. Hoshiga F. Millership C. Singh R. Eldrid C. Patin D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Thalassinos K. Freemont P. Gründling A. Inhibition of the Staphylococcus aureus c-di-AMP cyclase DacA by direct interaction with the phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM.PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15e1007537Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the individual S. aureus DacACD and GlmM dimers revealed that the S. aureus DacACD protein assumed an “inactive” dimer conformation. GlmM had the typical four-domain fold of phosphoglucomutases with a flexible C-terminal domain 4 and the dimer was “M-shaped,” characteristic for this class of enzymes (28Tosi T. Hoshiga F. Millership C. Singh R. Eldrid C. Patin D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Thalassinos K. Freemont P. Gründling A. Inhibition of the Staphylococcus aureus c-di-AMP cyclase DacA by direct interaction with the phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM.PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15e1007537Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, a high-resolution structure of the complex could not be obtained, and only a model for the complex could be proposed by fitting the individual DacACD and GlmM dimer structures into the SAXS envelope (28Tosi T. Hoshiga F. Millership C. Singh R. Eldrid C. Patin D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Thalassinos K. Freemont P. Gründling A. Inhibition of the Staphylococcus aureus c-di-AMP cyclase DacA by direct interaction with the phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM.PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15e1007537Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on this, a model was proposed in which GlmM could potentially block the activity of the DacACD cyclase by preventing the formation of higher oligomers. Here, we set out to provide atomic resolution information on the CdaA:GlmM complex to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of how GlmM can control the activity of the c-di-AMP cyclase enzyme. Using the purified B. subtilis CdaA catalytic domain (CdaACD) and purified full-length GlmM or the truncated GlmMF369 variant lacking the flexible C-terminal domain 4, we show that the two proteins form a stable complex in vitro and that GlmM and GlmMF369 are potent inhibits of the cyclase. Crystal structures of the B. subtilis CdaACD cyclase, the GlmM phosphoglucomutase, and the CdaACD:GlmMF369 complex were obtained, revealing dimer conformations of the individual proteins as well as a dimer of dimer conformation in the complex structure. More importantly, from the complex structure the mechanism by which binding of GlmM inhibits the cyclase activity become"

Thus, we investigated: (1) whether appropriate soil quality indicators (SQIs) could be identified in soils of Great Britain, (2) whether conventional soil classification or aggregate vegetation classes (AVCs) could predict SQIs and (3) to what extent do soil types and/ or AVCs act as major regulators of SQIs. Factor analysis was used to group 20 soil attributes into six SQI which were named as; soil organic matter (SOM), dissolved organic matter (DOM), soluble N, reduced N, microbial biomass, DOM humification (DOMH). SOM was identified as the most important SQI in the discrimination of both soil types and AVCs. Soil attributes constituting highly to the SOM factor were, microbial quotient and bulk density. The SOM indicator discriminated three soil type groupings and four aggregate vegetation class groupings. Among the soil types, only the peat soils were discriminated from other groups while among the AVCs only the heath and bog classes were isolated from others. However, the peat soil and heath and bog AVC were the only groups that were distinctly discriminated from other groups. All other groups heavily overlapped with one another, making it practically impossible to define reference values for each soil type or AVC. The two-way ANOVA showed that the AVCs were a better regulator of the SQIs than the soil types. We conclude that conventionally classified soil types cannot predict the SQIs defined from large areas with differing climatic and edaphic factors. Localised areas with similar climatic and topoedaphic factors may hold promise for the definition of SQI that may predict the soil types or AVCs."

Pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 in vitro mimicked the EPAC1-/- phenotype. In addition, EPAC1 regulated tumor necrosis factor-α–triggered vWF secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a manner dependent upon inflammatory effector molecules PI3K and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, EPAC1 activation reduced inflammation-triggered vWF release, both in vivo and in vitro.

We found that EPAC1 gene deletion elevated the secretion of vWF in endotoxemic mice. Inactivation of EPAC1 potentiated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-triggered vWF release. I942 had the capability to reduce the secretion of vWF during inflammation both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic studies indicated that activation of host PI3K/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) can attenuate the efficacy of the EPAC-specific inhibitor and limit vWF secretion during inflammation. In testing the constitutive plasma levels of vWF, we observed no difference between WT and EPAC1-KO mice (Fig. 1A). The difference in vWF mRNA expression between these two mouse strains was not significant (Fig. 1B). To further explore the EPAC1 function on inflammation-triggered vWF expression and secretion in vivo, WT and EPAC1-KO mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg/kg/d, i.p.) or PBS for 2 h. The results showed that exposure to LPS increased the plasma levels of vWF; compared with their LPS-treated WT counterparts, the plasma levels of vWF were higher in LPS-treated EPAC1-KO mice (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). However, the change in vWF mRNA expression in lung and liver tissues was not significant (Fig. 1B). LPS-treated EPAC1-KO mice showed thrombosis, and microthrombi were detected in the lungs of LPS-treated EPAC1-KO mice but were almost absent in LPS-treated WT mice (Table 1, Figures 1, C and D, and Fig. S1A).Table 1Detection of microthrombi in miceGroupNumber of animalsScore of microthrombiaThe left lungs were collected for RNA extraction, and the right lungs were fixed for histopathology studies.

Open table in a new tab Because vWF performs critical functions in primary hemostasis, a tail bleeding time test was conducted (53Peyvandi F. Garagiola I. Baronciani L. Role of von Willebrand factor in the haemostasis.Blood Transfus. 2011; 9 Suppl 2: s3-s8PubMed Google Scholar). The bleeding time of LPS-treated EPAC1-KO mice was shorter than that of LPS-treated WT mice (Fig. 1E). The total blood loss, assessed by its hemoglobin content, corresponded closely with the observed bleeding time of LPS-treated EPAC1-KO and WT mice (Fig. 1F). Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were also detected. There was no significant difference between the groups (Fig. S2). These results suggested that EPAC1 controls the primary hemostasis of endotoxemic mice through altering the concentration of vWF in the plasma. However, variations in prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, which are routine coagulation screening tests for secondary hemostasis, were not observed in this study.

To prevent road crashes, warnings and predictions of increased crash risk based on drivers' conditions are important. However, in on-road driving, the relationship between drivers' physiological condition and crash risk remains unclear due to difficulties in the simultaneous measurement of both. This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between drivers' physiological condition assessed by autonomic nerve function (ANF) and an indicator of rear-end collision risk in on-road driving. Data from 20 male truck drivers (mean ± SD, 49.0±8.2 years; range, 35-63 years) were analyzed. Over a period of approximately three months, drivers' working behavior data, such as automotive sensor data, and their ANF data were collected during their working shift. Using the gradient boosting decision tree method, a rear-end collision risk index was developed based on the working behavior data, which enabled continuous risk quantification. Using the developed risk index and drivers' ANF data, effects of their physiological condition on risk were analyzed employing a logistic quantile regression method, which provides wider information on the effects of the explanatory variables, after hierarchical model selection. Our results revealed that in on-road driving, activation of sympathetic nerve activity and inhibition of parasympathetic nerve activity increased each quantile of the rear-end collision risk index. The findings suggest that acute stress-induced drivers' fatigue increases rear-end collision risk. Hence, in on-road driving, drivers' physiological condition monitoring and ANF-based stress warning and relief system can contribute to promoting the prevention of rear-end truck collisions."
https://openalex.org/W3205147443,"Studying the tight activity regulation of platelet-specific integrin αIIbβ3 is foundational and paramount to our understanding of integrin structure and activation. αIIbβ3 is essential for the aggregation and adhesion function of platelets in hemostasis and thrombosis. Structural and mutagenesis studies have previously revealed the critical role of αIIbβ3 transmembrane (TM) association in maintaining the inactive state. Gain-of-function TM mutations were identified and shown to destabilize the TM association leading to integrin activation. Studies using isolated TM peptides have suggested an altered membrane embedding of the β3 TM α-helix coupled with αIIbβ3 activation. However, controversies remain as to whether and how the TM α-helices change their topologies in the context of full-length integrin in native cell membrane. In this study, we utilized proline scanning mutagenesis and cysteine scanning accessibility assays to analyze the structure and function correlation of the αIIbβ3 TM domain. Our identification of loss-of-function proline mutations in the TM domain suggests the requirement of a continuous TM α-helical structure in transmitting activation signals bidirectionally across the cell membrane, characterized by the inside-out activation for ligand binding and the outside-in signaling for cell spreading. Similar results were found for αLβ2 and α5β1 TM domains, suggesting a generalizable mechanism. We also detected a topology change of β3 TM α-helix within the cell membrane, but only under conditions of cell adhesion and the absence of αIIb association. Our data demonstrate the importance of studying the structure and function of the integrin TM domain in the native cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W3206607069,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the state-of-the-art for automated assessment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) from medical image data. However, these methods lack interpretability, mainly focus on image texture, and cannot completely grasp the analyzed anatomies' shapes. In this study we assess the informative value of quantitative features derived from segmentations in order to assess their potential as an alternative or extension to CNN-based approaches regarding multiple aspects of KOA. Six anatomical structures around the knee (femoral and tibial bones, femoral and tibial cartilages, and both menisci) are segmented in 46,996 MRI scans. Based on these segmentations, quantitative features are computed, i.e., measurements such as cartilage volume, meniscal extrusion and tibial coverage, as well as geometric features based on a statistical shape encoding of the anatomies. The feature quality is assessed by investigating their association to the Kellgren-Lawrence grade (KLG), joint space narrowing (JSN), incident KOA, and total knee replacement (TKR). Using gold standard labels from the Osteoarthritis Initiative database the balanced accuracy (BA), the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC), and weighted kappa statistics are evaluated. Features based on shape encodings of femur, tibia, and menisci plus the performed measurements showed most potential as KOA biomarkers. Differentiation between non-arthritic and severely arthritic knees yielded BAs of up to 99%, 84% were achieved for diagnosis of early KOA. Weighted kappa values of 0.73, 0.72, and 0.78 were achieved for classification of the grade of medial JSN, lateral JSN, and KLG, respectively. The AUC was 0.61 and 0.76 for prediction of incident KOA and TKR within one year, respectively. Quantitative features from automated segmentations provide novel biomarkers for KLG and JSN classification and show potential for incident KOA and TKR prediction. The validity of these features should be further evaluated, especially as extensions of CNN-based approaches. To foster such developments we make all segmentations publicly available together with this publication."

Therefore, we investigated the effects of oxygen concentration fluctuations on the glucose metabolism of cancer cells.The glucose metabolism of oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2 and HSC-3) and normal epithelial (HaCaT) cells cultured under normoxic (21% oxygen) or hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions was measured using a pH-stat system under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The acidic end-products and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by glucose metabolism were also measured.Under normoxic conditions, the metabolic activity of hypoxically cultured cancer cells was significantly increased, and the production of acids other than lactate was upregulated, while the normal cells did not respond to rapid increases in oxygen levels. ROS production was higher in normoxic conditions in all cells, especially the hypoxically cultured HSC-3 cells.Rapid increases in oxygen levels might enhance the glucose metabolism of hypoxically cultured cancer cells by mainly activating the TCA cycle and electron transport system, which might activate cancer cells through the ATP and ROS generation."
https://openalex.org/W3207683603,"The pre-mRNA processing factor 4 kinase (PRP4K, also known as PRPF4B) is an essential gene. However, reduced PRP4K expression is associated with aggressive breast and ovarian cancer phenotypes including taxane therapy resistance, increased cell migration and invasion in vitro, and cancer metastasis in mice. These results are consistent with PRP4K being a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Increased cell migration and invasion is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but how reduced PRP4K levels affect normal epithelial cell migration or EMT has not been studied. Depletion of PRP4K by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) in non-transformed mammary epithelial cell lines (MCF10A, HMLE) reduced or had no effect on 2D migration in the scratch assay but resulted in greater invasive potential in 3D transwell assays. Depletion of PRP4K in mesenchymal triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) resulted in both enhanced 2D migration and 3D invasion, with 3D invasion correlated with higher fibronectin levels in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cells and without changes in E-cadherin. Induction of EMT in MCF10A cells, by treatment with WNT-5a and TGF-β1, or depletion of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3e (eIF3e) by shRNA, resulted in significantly reduced PRP4K expression. Mechanistically, induction of EMT by WNT-5a/TGF-β1 reduced PRP4K transcript levels, whereas eIF3e depletion led to reduced PRP4K translation. Finally, reduced PRP4K levels after eIF3e depletion correlated with increased YAP activity and nuclear localization, both of which are reversed by overexpression of exogenous PRP4K. Thus, PRP4K is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor negatively regulated by EMT, that when depleted in normal mammary cells can increase cell invasion without inducing full EMT."

The development of pallet pooling is an essential component for the transformation and upgrade of the logistics industry in China. Pallet pooling can, however, lead to a conflict over potential benefits among the players. One of the main problems of pallet pooling in China is the reasonable benefit allocation mechanism has not been formed. The pallet pooling system (PPS) with participation of the third-party platform (PPSWPTPP) is one of the pilot modes of pallet pooling in China. Based on evolutionary game theory and a penalty mechanism for breach of contract, this paper constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model of the PPSWPTPP. Eight propositions are set in two basic scenarios regarding whether pallet pooling is adapted to the logistics market to study the stability and dynamic evolution process of the players in the PPSWPTPP. Theoretical and numerical simulation results indicate that these will affect the smooth development of the PPS. The suitable setting of penalties and bonuses, the precise estimation of the pooling benefits, the intention intensity of the players to the pallet pooling, and whether to adapt to the logistics market demand are explored."

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was performed in C57BL/KsJ-db/db null (BKS-db/db,) mice, high-fat diet (HFD)-fed NONcNZO10/LtJ (NZO) mice, C57BL/6 db/db null (B6-db/db) mice and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Food consumption, body weight, fat mass, fast blood glucose level, circulating insulin and adiponectin and glucose tolerance test were analyzed. The liver and pancreatic tissues were subjected to H&E and immunohistochemistry staining and islet cells to flow cytometry for apoptotic analysis. RYGB resulted in sustained normoglycemia and improved glucose tolerance in young prediabetic BKS-db/db mice (at the age of 6 weeks with hyperglycemia and normal insulinemia) and HFD-fed NZO and B6-db/db mice. Remarkably, RYGB improved liver steatosis, preserved the pancreatic β-cells and reduced β-cell apoptosis with increases in circulating insulin and adiponectin in young prediabetic BKS-db/db mice. However, RYGB neither reversed hyperglycemia in adult diabetic BKS-db/db mice (12 weeks old) nor attenuated hyperglycemia in STZ-induced diabetic mice. These results demonstrate that gastric bypass improves hyperglycemia in genetically modified prediabetic mice; however, it should be performed prior to β-cells exhaustion."

https://openalex.org/W3206063289,"Systematic evaluation of cortical differences between humans and macaques calls for inter-species registration of the cortex that matches homologous regions across species. For establishing homology across brains, structural landmarks and biological features have been used without paying sufficient attention to functional homology. The present study aimed to determine functional homology between the human and macaque cortices, defined in terms of functional network properties, by proposing an iterative functional network-based registration scheme using surface-based spherical demons. The functional connectivity matrix of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) among cortical parcellations was iteratively calculated for humans and macaques. From the functional connectivity matrix, the functional network properties such as principal network components were derived to estimate a deformation field between the human and macaque cortices. The iterative registration procedure updates the parcellation map of macaques, corresponding to the human connectome project's multimodal parcellation atlas, which was used to derive the macaque's functional connectivity matrix. To test the plausibility of the functional network-based registration, we compared cortical registration using structural versus functional features in terms of cortical regional areal change. We also evaluated the interhemispheric asymmetry of regional area and its inter-subject variability in humans and macaques as an indirect validation of the proposed method. Higher inter-subject variability and interhemispheric asymmetry were found in functional homology than in structural homology, and the assessed asymmetry and variations were higher in humans than in macaques. The results emphasize the significance of functional network-based cortical registration across individuals within a species and across species."

https://openalex.org/W3207391064,"Handgrip strength (HGS) is an alternative tool to evaluate respiratory muscle function. HGS cutoff value indicating extubation success or failure has not been investigated. This study aimed to determine HGS cutoff value to predict successful extubation.A prospective study was conducted. Patients requiring intubated mechanical ventilation with intubation ≥ 48 hours in medical wards were recruited. HGS test was performed at 10 minutes before and 30 minutes after spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) was measured at 10 minutes before SBT.Ninety-three patients (58% men) were included. Mean age was 71.6 ± 15.2 years. Weaning failure rate was 6.5%. The area under the ROC curve of 0.84 for the best HGS cutoff value at 10 minutes before SBT was 12.7 kg, with 75.9% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity (P = 0.005). The best HSG cutoff value at 30 minutes after SBT was 14.9 kg, with the area under the ROC curve of 0.82, with 58.6% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity (P = 0.009). The best RSBI cutoff value was 43.5 breaths/min/L, with the area under the ROC curve of 0.46, 33.3% sensitivity and 66.6% specificity (P = 0.737).HGS may be a predictive tool to guide extubation with better sensitivity and specificity than RSBI. A prospective study is needed to verify HGS test as adjunctive to RSBI in ventilator weaning protocol."
