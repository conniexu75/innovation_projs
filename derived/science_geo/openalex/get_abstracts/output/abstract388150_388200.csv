https://openalex.org/W149620357,"Previous electrophoretic studies have been reported on the plasma and serum proteins of man and of various animals, often in connection with a pathology involving the blood proteins of the animal in question. However, among the animals studied, there seldom exists a strict basis of comparison, since different investigators have carried out their experiments in different buffers of varying pH and ionic strength. Moreover, various optical devices have been used to resolve the protein concentration gradients. It was the purpose of this investigation to determine the electrophoretic constituents of plasma, under identical conditions in so far as possible, of a variety of easily accessible animal species in order to ascertain differences in composition. Extensive studies of any given animal or determinations made under varying conditions were not attempted. In the species of animals examined, a complexity and variation of proteins that are both interesting and provocative of thought have been revealed."

https://openalex.org/W94834957,"The methylation of guanidoacetic acid by liver slices is accelerated by methionine; choline, under these conditions, exerts no significant accelerating effect (1). In view of the fact that homocystine plus choline can replace methionine for growth (2), and of the isotope experiments which proved the transfer in viva of the methyl groups of choline to creatine,(3) it has been suggested, from indirect evidence, that the pathway of the methyl group to creatine is more direct from methionine than from choline.(4) More specific evidence is desirable, especially as neither homocystine nor homocysteine has been identified in animal tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1987593304,"A comparison of penicillin excretion when equivalent quantities of the drug are given orally or parenterally indicates that approximately 60 per cent. urinary excretion occurs after parenteral administration, whereas 14 per cent. urinary excretion occurs following oral ingestion. That destruction by gastric acidity is not primarily responsible for this difference is indicated by the fact that administration of penicillin directly into the duodenum does not greatly alter the amount of penicillin excretion. Evidence indicating that the majority of orally administered penicillin is destroyed by the body proper is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2045499257,"A simple method is described for producing avirulent mouse brain antigens for complement-fixation tests in human encephalitides, by application of heat at 60 degrees C for 30 minutes. The heated antigens retain for most of the viruses employed a sufficiently high titer to warrant their use, since they are also specific, not anticomplementary, can be lyophilized and moreover, are avirulent, and thus can be handled with safety."

Asparagine, glutamine, one or more amino acids and undetermined compounds are synthesized. Ammonia does not accumulate until these constituents have reached a relatively high level."
