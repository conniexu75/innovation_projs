Here, we report that IκBα, when not bound to NF-κB, is constitutively transported to the nucleus, and we confirm that the interaction of IκBα with NF-κB retains IκBα in the cytoplasm. Nuclear import of IκBα does not result from passive diffusion but from a specific energy-dependent transport process that requires the ankyrin repeats of IκBα. Nuclear accumulation of IκBα is dependent on importins α and β as well as the small GTPase Ran, which are also responsible for the nuclear import mediated by basic nuclear localization sequences (NLS). However, these proteins are not sufficient to promote IκBα nuclear translocation. Factor(s) can be removed selectively from cell extracts with ankyrin repeats of IκBα which strongly reduce import of IκBα but not of proteins containing basic NLS. These findings indicate that IκBα is imported in the nucleus by a piggy-back mechanism that involves additional protein(s) containing a basic NLS and able to interact with ankyrin repeats of IκBα.

These factors share a Rel homology domain responsible for the dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding functions (3Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin.

In most unstimulated cells, NF-κB dimers are held in an inactive state in the cytoplasm by IκB inhibitory proteins that mask their nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (5Ganchi P.A. Sun S.C.

In response to various stimuli, recently identified protein kinase cascades are activated, resulting in the phosphorylation of IκB proteins on two serine residues at their amino-terminal domain (9Verma I.M.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). This modification triggers polyubiquitination of IκB proteins, which then undergo rapid degradation via the 26 S proteasome (1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the NLS of NF-κB is exposed, and the transcription factor translocates to the nucleus where it activates responsive genes (15Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). In particular, NF-κB induces efficient resynthesis of IκBα through the activation of IκBα mRNA transcription (16Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 17Le Bail O. Schmidt Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 18Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized IκBα accumulates in the nucleus where it negatively regulates NF-κB-dependent transcription by inhibiting the NF-κB/DNA interaction and by transporting NF-κB back to the cytoplasm (19Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This latter function of IκBα is conferred by a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence, located in its COOH-terminal region, which is homologous to the nuclear export signal found in HIV-1 Rev and PKI (the inhibitor of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A) (20Arenzana-Seisdedos F.

Biol. 1996; 6: 848-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Such nuclear export sequences are specifically recognized by the nuclear protein CRM1 (exportin-1) (24Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 25Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W.

IκBα is composed of a surface-exposed NH2-terminal region, not essential for binding to RelA (p65), followed by a central, protease-resistant domain containing five ankyrin repeats and a compact, highly acidic COOH-terminal region connected to the core by a flexible linker (28Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the central ankyrin domain and the linker region are essential for the interaction of IκBα with Rel factors (28Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4159-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Hatada E.N. Naumann M.

Cell. 1992; 68: 1109-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). IκBα lacks an SV40 large T antigen- or nucleoplasmin-like NLS (basic NLS) or any other motif described to serve as NLS (8Zabel U. Henkel T. Silva M.S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Besides the ability of newly synthesized IκBα to localize in the nucleus, it has been reported that IκBα overexpressed from a transfected plasmid or microinjected into the cytoplasm also distributes to both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (8Zabel U. Henkel T. Silva M.S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 20Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its molecular mass (37 kDa), which is below the theoretical cutoff of the nuclear pore complex, led to the hypothesis that IκBα might enter the nucleus by diffusion (8Zabel U. Henkel T. Silva M.S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 32Cressman D.E. Taub R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2567-2573PubMed Google Scholar). Different pathways have been described to account for the nuclear import of various types of karyophilic proteins (33Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W.

Proteins carrying a basic amino acid stretch NLS interact with a heterodimeric NLS receptor composed of two subunits, importins α and β or karyopherins α and β1 (35Iovine M.K. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R.

Recognition of karyophilic substrates by these karyopherins β leads to the targeting of karyophilic proteins to the nuclear pore complex, a specialized and elaborated structure of the nuclear envelope through which the exchange of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm occurs (34Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Karyopherin β family members share a common NH2-terminal binding motif for RanGTP (52Görlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), a small GTPase essential for most nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways (53Melchior F. Guan T. Yokoyama N. Nishimoto T.

Science. 1997; 276: 1842-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ran is thought to be distributed asymmetrically between the nucleus and cytoplasm with the GTP-bound form in the nucleus and the GDP-bound form in the cytoplasm. Both GTPase Ran and the factor p10 or NTF2 (57Nehrbass U. Blobel G. Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 58Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J.

A. 1994; 91: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) mediate the translocation of karyopherin-karyophilic protein complexes in the nucleus. Interaction of these complexes with RanGTP in the nucleus promotes the release of karyophilic proteins in this compartment and subsequent recycling of the NLS receptors (42Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 60Rexach M. Blobel G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to characterize precisely the requirements for nuclear localization of IκBα as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying this transport process. We found that NF-κB-free IκBα localizes constitutively in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, and we confirm that the interaction of IκBα with NF-κB retains IκBα in the cytoplasm. Moreover we demonstrate that the nuclear import of IκBα does not result from passive diffusion but rather from an energy-dependent process that is mediated by the ankyrin repeats of IκBα. Nuclear import of IκBα requires importins α and β (karyopherins α and β1) as well as the GTPase Ran. However, these proteins are not sufficient to promote IκBα nuclear translocation. Factor(s) can be removed selectively from cell extracts with ankyrin repeats of IκBα which strongly reduce import of IκBα but not of proteins containing a basic amino acid stretch NLS. These findings indicate that IκBα is imported in the nucleus by a piggy-back mechanism that involves additional protein(s) containing a basic NLS and able to interact with ankyrin repeats of IκBα. Adherent or S3 suspension HeLa cells were maintained in exponential growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient expression experiments, HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (20Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured subsequently for 24 h before analysis. HeLa cell cytosol was prepared as described by Paschal and Gerace (58Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). 109exponentially growing HeLa S3 cells were collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with lysis buffer (5 mmHepes, pH 7.4; 5 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.4; 2 mm magnesium acetate; 1 mm EGTA; 2 mm dithiothreitol; and protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin; and 200 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Uptima)). The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 volume of lysis buffer and disrupted in a tight fitting stainless steel homogenizer (as judged by phase-contrast microscopy). The homogenate was diluted with 0.1 volume of 10 × transport buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 110 mmpotassium acetate, pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged further at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant (∼20 mg/ml as measured with the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad)) was aliquoted, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. To prepare depleted cytosol, 100 μl of HeLa cell cytosol (2 mg of proteins) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of GST or 20 μg of GST-IκBα(68–243) immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mixtures were subsequently centrifuged, and the postcentrifugation supernatant is defined as depleted cytosol. Digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were prepared according to Adam et al. (62Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were permeabilized with 55 μg/ml digitonin (Sigma) in transport buffer. A standard 50-μl nuclear import assay was performed in transport buffer containing an energy-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.4 unit/ml creatine phosphokinase), 15 μg/ml BSA-NLS-FITC, 30 μl of HeLa cell cytosol (∼20 mg/ml), and 40 μg/ml or 10 μg/ml SV5-tagged versions of wt IκBα or GST-IκBα(68–243), respectively. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 45 min at 30 °C. Similar results were obtained with an untagged version of IκBα (data not shown). Peptides containing the SV40 large T antigen wt NLS (cgggPKKKRKVED) or reverse NLS (SLN; cgggDEVKRKVED) were synthesized with an NH2-terminal Cys for chemical coupling reactions followed by a (Gly)3 linker. BSA was conjugated to peptides and FITC according to Görlich et al. (38Görlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the resulting fusion proteins contain more than 10 NLS or SLN peptides. For indirect immunofluorescence analysis, transfected HeLa cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.025% glutaraldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Monoclonal antibodies to SV5-Pk-tag (63Hanke T. Szawlowski P. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or to IκBα (10B (28Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell.

Niemann H. Louvard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) were applied for 30 min followed by a 30-min incubation with Texas red or FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson). Coverslips were mounted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50% glycerol. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis were performed with a TCS4D confocal microscope based on a DM microscope interfaced with a mixed gas argon-krypton laser (Leica Laser Technik). Fluorescence acquisitions were performed with the 488 nm and 568 nm laser lines to excite FITC and Texas red dyes, respectively, with a × 100 oil immersion PL APO objective. Data presented on a same figure were registered at the same laser and multiplier settings. To quantify fluorescence intensity, optical slices of 20 different cells/condition were recorded as 512 × 512-pixel images with the same preset parameters. A region of interest corresponding to the nuclear area was then created in each cell, and the mean density was calculated within this area using NIH image software. For measurement of IκBα or GST-IκBα(68–243) nuclear content, values obtained with nuclei incubated in the absence of IκBα or GST-IκBα(68–243) and stained with both primary and secondary antibodies were considered as negative controls and subtracted from the values obtained for nuclei incubated with the import substrate. For measurement of BSA-NLS-FITC nuclear content, areas registered outside the cells were considered as background. All data were saved in different series, and statistical analysis (mean intensities and standard deviation) was performed. DNA encoding the SV5-tagged version of IκBα sequences for amino acids 1–317 or 68–317 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the pcDNA3-IκBα ctag vector (20Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P.

Sequences encoding amino acids 68–265 or 68–243 of IκBα were amplified using pcDNA3-IκBα ctag vector as a template and cloned into theBamHI/EcoRI restriction sites of pcDNA3 ctag (pcDNA3-IκBα ctag without theBamHI/EcoRI-wt IκBα fragment) generating pcDNA3-IκBα(68–265) ctag or pcDNA3-IκBα(68–243) ctag, respectively. The corresponding BamHI/XbaI restriction fragments were inserted intoBamHI/XbaI-cleaved pEGFP-C1 vector generating pEGFP-IκBα(68–265) ctag or pEGFP-IκBα(68–243) ctag, respectively. The plasmid encoding 4NβC has been described previously (65Kroll M. Conconi M.A. Desterro M.J.P. Marin A. Thomas D. Friguet B. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Rodriguez M.S.

To generate the SV5-tagged GST-IκBα(68–243) in bacteria, aBamHI/EcoRI restriction fragment encoding amino acids 68–243 of IκBα was generated using pcDNA3-IκBα(68–243) ctag and inserted intoBamHI/EcoRI-cleaved pGEX ctag vector (63Hanke T.

Recombinant SV5-tagged wt IκBα was produced and purified as described previously (66Rodriguez M.S. Michalopoulos I. Arenzana S.F. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2413-2419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or pGEX-IκBα(68–243) ctag plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α or BL21(DE3) respectively. Cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.4 and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Recombinant GST or SV5-tagged GST-IκBα(68–243) were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluted with glutathione, and dialyzed at 4 °C against transport buffer. The protein concentration was determined with the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and the sample was aliquoted, quick frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. NF-κB p65 (amino acids 12–317) was expressed in bacteria and purified as described (67Matthews J.R. Nicholson J. Jaffray E. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Hay R.T.

Dasso, and Ran wt was purified as described (NIH, Bethesda; 69). Expression and purification of RanQ69L were performed essentially as described (70Klebe C. Nishimoto T. Wittinghofer F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11923-11928Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using the expression vector provided by C. Dingwall (Stony Brook, NY). His-tagged p10 expression and purification were done as described (41Moroianu J. Hijikata M. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6532-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) using the p10 expression vector provided by G. Blobel (The Rockefeller Institute, New York). To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the nuclear accumulation of IκBα, we first addressed the question of whether the ability of IκBα to be imported into the nucleus depends on cell activation. In unstimulated HeLa cells, IκBα was distributed throughout both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas NF-κB p65 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig.1 A). This result suggests that even in the absence of cell activation, a fraction of IκBα which does not interact with p65 is expressed in the nucleus. To confirm this result, HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a tagged version of IκBα which could be detected with an anti-tag antibody (Fig. 1 B, panel a). Overexpressed IκBα displayed a cytoplasmic as well as a nuclear localization in HeLa cells. This distribution has also been observed recently in fibroblasts lacking Rel proteins (66Rodriguez M.S. Michalopoulos I. Arenzana S.F. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2413-2419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the ability of IκBα to be expressed in the nucleus is not dependent on the presence of endogenous NF-κB family members. To establish whether the nuclear localization of IκBα was caused by serum activation of the cells, transfected HeLa cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 1 h, leading to the complete disappearance of the protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 1 B, panel b). Cycloheximide was then removed, and cells were incubated for 2 additional h without serum. Under this unstimulated condition, newly synthesized IκBα accumulated in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B, panel c), indicating that nuclear localization of overexpressed IκBα could occur in the absence of stimulation of HeLa cells. Cells were then incubated with tumor necrosis factor-α for 30 min leading to degradation of IκBα (Fig.1 B, panel d). Tumor necrosis factor-α was then removed, and newly synthesized IκBα again accumulated in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (Fig. 1 B, panel e). These results show that in HeLa cells, endogenous as well as overexpressed IκBα can localize to the nucleus in the absence of cell stimulation or after treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α. To establish whether nuclear localization of IκBα was caused by passive diffusion or by a specific nuclear import mechanism, properties of IκBα nuclear transport were analyzed using semipermeabilized cells (62Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C with recombinant wt IκBα in the presence of HeLa cytosol, an energy source (ATP, GTP, and an ATP-regenerating system)"
https://openalex.org/W2318149005,"Yeast two-hybrid system was employed to isolate novel proteins that physically interact with PU.1, a member of Ets family transcription factors. Sequence analyses of several isolated clones positive for β-galactosidase activity revealed that one of these clones was confirmed to encode a transcriptional coactivator, CREB binding protein (CBP). GST binding assay showed that the interacting sites were located at the transcriptional activation domain of PU.1 through 74 – 122 and the region spanning residues 1283 – 1915 of CBP. CBP potentiated PU.1-mediated transcription of the reporter gene driven by the multimerized PU.1-binding sites, suggesting that CBP functions as a coactivator for PU.1. Considering that CBP is a limited cellular component to function as a coactivator for several transcription factors, CBP may mediate synergistic and antagonistic interactions between PU.1 and other transcription factors during the process of hematopoietic cell differentiation."

Four invariant carboxylates and a histidine residue are predicted to lie at the C-terminal end of three β-strands and line the active site cleft. Site-directed mutagenesis of murine ppGaNTase-T1 reveals that conservative mutations at these 5 positions result in products with no detectable enzyme activity (D156Q, D209N, and H211D) or <1% activity (E127Q and E213Q).

https://openalex.org/W2324699102,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 has been implicated as a drug resistance factor in tumor cells grown as spheroids or confluent monolayers. Here, we show that p27Kip1 overexpression also induces resistance to drug-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity in human leukemic cells growing in suspension. The anti-apoptotic effect of p27Kip1 is not restricted to DNA-damaging agents but extends to the tubulin poison vinblastin, agonistic anti-Fas antibodies and macromolecule synthesis inhibitors. To further identify at which level this protein interferes with the cell death pathway, we investigated its influence on caspase activation and mitochondrial changes. Exposure of mock-transfected U937 cells to 50 μM etoposide activates procaspase-3 and the long isoform of procaspase-2 and induces mitochondrial potential decrease and cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol. All these events are prevented by p27Kip1 overexpression. p27Kip1 does not modulate Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1 and Bax protein level in leukemic cells but suppresses Mcl-1 expression decrease observed in mock-transfected U937 cells undergoing etoposide-induced cell death. We conclude that p27Kip1 prevents cell death upstream of the final pathway common to many apoptotic stimuli that involves cytochrome c release from mitochondria and activation of downstream caspases."
https://openalex.org/W2331937314,"Testicular germ cell tumours are hypersentive to chemotherapy and cell lines derived from these tumours are chemosensitive in vitro. We have previously shown that these cell lines express undetectable levels of the suppressor of apoptosis Bcl-2 and relatively high levels of the apoptosis inducer Bax (Chresta et al., 1996). To determine whether the absence of Bcl-2 in these cell lines makes them highly susceptible to drug-induced apoptosis, Bcl-2 was expressed ectopically in the 833K testicular germ cell tumour cell line. Stable overexpressing clones were isolated and three clones were studied further. Surprisingly, Bcl-2 overexpressing cells were sensitized to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis compared to the parental and vector control cells. Analysis of potential mechanisms of sensitization revealed there was a reciprocal downregulation of the endogenously expressed Bcl-XL in the Bcl-2 overexpressing clones. Downregulation of Bcl-XL to the same extent using antisense oligonucleotides enhanced etoposide-induced apoptosis by twofold. Our results indicate that Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL have different abilities to protect against chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in testicular germ cell tumours. In contrast to findings in some tumour cell types, Bcl-2 did not act as a gatekeeper to prevent entry of p53 to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2008774314,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB, a mitogen that stimulates bone resorption, increases the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that induces osteoclast recruitment. The mechanisms involved in IL-6 induction by PDGF BB are poorly understood. We examined the effect of PDGF BB on IL-6 expression in cultures of osteoblasts from fetal rat calvariae (Ob cells). PDGF BB increased IL-6 mRNA and heterogeneous nuclear RNA levels, the rate of transcription, and the activity of base pairs (bp) −2906 to +20 IL-6 promoter fragments transiently transfected into Ob cells. Deletion analysis revealed two responsive regions, one containing an activator protein-1 (AP-1) site located between bp −276 and −257, and a second, less well defined, downstream of −257. Targeted mutations of a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE), and nuclear factor-IL-6 and nuclear factor-κB binding sites in a bp −257 to +20 IL-6 construct that was transfected into Ob cells, revealed that the CRE also contributed to IL-6 promoter induction by PDGF BB. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed AP-1 and CRE nuclear protein complexes that were enhanced by PDGF BB. Supershift assays revealed binding of Jun and Fos to AP-1 and CRE sequences and binding of activating transcription factor-2 to CRE. In conclusion, PDGF BB induces IL-6 transcription in osteoblasts by regulating nuclear proteins of the AP-1 complex and activating transcription factor-2.

PDGF is the product of two genes, PDGF A and B, encoding two distinct chains, which form PDGF AA and BB homodimers or PDGF AB heterodimers (1Hart C.E. Mason B. Curtis D.A. Osborn S. Raines E. Ross R.

Cells of the osteoblast lineage express the PDGF A gene and, to a lesser extent, the PDGF B gene, although PDGF BB has the greatest activity and has been studied more extensively for its biological properties (2Rydziel S.

In bone, PDGF stimulates the replication of cells of the osteoblastic lineage, and it does not acutely enhance the differentiated function of the osteoblast (8Canalis E. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 9Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PDGF also increases bone resorption, most likely by increasing the number of osteoclasts, an effect associated with an increase in the bone eroded surface (10Cochran D.L. Rouse C.A. Lynch S.E. Graves D.T. Bone. 1993; 14: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Hock J.M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1423-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although PDGF may act directly on skeletal cells, some effects may be mediated by other cytokines present in the bone microenvironment. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that enhances bone resorption by increasing osteoclast formation and recruitment (12Roodman G.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 13Jilka R.L. Hangoc G. Girasole G. Passeri G. Williams D.C. Abrams J.S. Boyce B. Broxmeyer H. Manolagas S.C.

Hormones that increase bone resorption, such as parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and IL-1 enhance IL-6 production in skeletal cells, indicating that it may be an important intermediary in their effects on bone resorption (14Feyen J.H.

Furthermore, IL-6 and IL-1 play an important role in the osteoporosis of the estrogen deficient state, and levels of IL-6 and its soluble receptor are elevated in conditions of increased bone resorption, such as multiple myeloma and estrogen deficiency (13Jilka R.L.

Recently, we demonstrated that PDGF BB increases IL-6 synthesis in osteoblast cultures by activating protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium-dependent pathways (22Franchimont N. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5469-5475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved were not determined, and the induction of IL-6 by PDGF BB may play a central role in the effects of PDGF on bone remodeling. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms involved in the induction of IL-6 expression by PDGF BB in cultures of osteoblast enriched cells from 22-day fetal rat calvariae (Ob cells). We also determined the regulatory elements of the rat IL-6 gene promoter responsible for the stimulatory effect of PDGF BB on IL-6 expression. The culture method used was described in detail previously (23McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Parietal bones were obtained from 22-day old fetal rats immediately after the mothers were sacrificed by blunt trauma to the nuchal area. This project was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center. Cells were obtained by five sequential digestions of the parietal bone, using bacterial collagenase (CLS II, Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ). Cell populations harvested from the third to the fifth digestions were previously shown to express osteoblastic characteristics and were cultured as a pool (23McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Ob cells were plated at a density of 8000–12,000 cells/cm2 and cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C, maintaining a pH of 7.5. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit, Fort Collins, CO). For RNA and nuclear protein analyses, cells were grown to confluence (∼50,000 cells/cm2), transferred to serum-free medium for 20–24 h, and then exposed to test agents in serum-free medium for 30 min to 4 h as indicated in the text and figure legends. For the nuclear run-on experiment, subconfluent cultures of Ob cells were trypsinized, subcultured at a 1:8 dilution, and grown to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were serum-deprived for 24 h and treated for 15 and 30 min in serum-free DMEM. For transient transfections, cells were grown to 70% confluence, transfected in 10% fetal bovine serum, serum-deprived, and treated. Recombinant human PDGF BB (Austral, San Ramon, CA) was added directly to the culture medium. Cycloheximide (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and diluted 1:1000 in culture medium; an equal amount of ethanol was added to control cultures. Total cellular RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Kit per the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The RNA recovered was quantitated by spectrophotometry, and equal amounts of RNA from control or test samples were loaded on a formaldehyde agarose gel following denaturation. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide to visualize ribosomal RNA (rRNA), documenting equal RNA loading of the various experimental samples. RNA was then blotted onto Gene Screen Plus charged nylon membrane (DuPont), and the uniformity of transfer was documented by revisualization of rRNA. A 900-base pair (bp)BamHI-PstI restriction fragment of rat IL-6 cDNA, and a 700-bp BamHI-SphI fragment of a mouse 18 S rRNA cDNA clone (both from ATCC, Rockville, MD) were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis (24Northemann W. Braciak T.A. Hattori M. Lee F. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16072-16082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 and 18 S rRNA cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP (50 μCi each at a specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol; DuPont) using the random hexanucleotide primed second strand synthesis method (25Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5193) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out at 42 °C for 16–48 h, and posthybridization washes were performed at 65 °C in 1× SSC for IL-6 and 0.1× SSC for 18 S. The bound radioactive material was visualized by autoradiography on Kodak X-AR5 film (Eastman Kodak), employing Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screens (DuPont). To examine changes in IL-6 hnRNA, a sense strand intron 2-specific amplimer, 5′-GAATTGGGAATTCTCTGCTG-3′ and an antisense strand intron 2 amplimer, 5′-GAAGGCCAAGAGATCTTACT-3′, were synthesized in accordance with published sequences (24Northemann W. Braciak T.A. Hattori M. Lee F. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16072-16082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 hnRNA levels were determined by reverse transcription-PCR (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology: Preparation and Analysis of RNA. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1995: 4.10.5-4.10.9Google Scholar). For this purpose, total RNA from control and test samples was prepared as described for Northern analysis. One μg of RNA was treated with amplification grade DNase I and reverse-transcribed in the presence of the IL-6 intron 2 specific antisense primer at 42 °C for 30 min with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The newly transcribed cDNA was amplified by 22 PCR cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min in the presence of the IL-6 intron 2-specific sense primer described, Taq DNA polymerase, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont). The PCR products were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and visualized by autoradiography. An internal DNA standard at a concentration of 20 fg was included in the PCR to correct for variations in amplification. The standard was obtained by amplification of SV40 promoter sequences in the pGL2-Basic plasmid DNA (Promega, Madison, WI) using the composite sense primer 5′-GAATTGGGAATTCTCTGCTGattagtcagcaaccatagtc-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GAAGGCCAAGAGATCTTACTggttccatcctctagaggat-3′. The uppercase letters indicate IL-6 sequences, and the lowercase letters represent pGL2-Basic plasmid sequences. To examine changes in the rate of transcription, nuclei were isolated by Dounce homogenization in a Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (27Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). Nascent transcripts were labeled by incubation of nuclei in a reaction buffer containing 500 μμ each adenosine, cytidine, and guanosine triphosphates, 150 units of RNasin (Promega), and 250 μCi [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, DuPont) (27Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated by treatment with DNase I and proteinase K, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Linearized plasmid DNA containing 1 μg of cDNA was immobilized onto GeneScreen Plus by slot blotting according to the manufacturer's directions (DuPont). The plasmid vector pGL2-Basic (Promega) was used as a control for nonspecific hybridization, and a mouse 18 S rRNA cDNA clone was used to estimate uniformity of the loading. Equal counts per min of [32P]RNA from each sample were hybridized to cDNAs at 42 °C for 72 h and washed in 1× SSC at 58 °C for 30 min. Hybridized cDNAs were visualized by autoradiography. To determine changes in promoter activity, chimeric constructs of the 5′ flanking region of the IL-6 promoter and a luciferase reporter gene (kindly provided by Dr. G. Fey, Erlanghen, Germany) were tested (28Baffet G. Braciak T.A. Fletcher R.G. Gauldie J. Fey G.H. Northemann W. Mol. Biol. Med. 1991; 8: 141-156PubMed Google Scholar, 29Franchimont N. Rydziel S. Canalis E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1797-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ob cells were cultured to approximately 70% confluence and transiently transfected by calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation as described (29Franchimont N. Rydziel S. Canalis E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1797-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cotransfection with a construct containing the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase gene (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to control for transfection efficiency. After 4 h, cells were exposed for 3 min to 10% glycerol. Ob cells were allowed to recover in serum-containing DMEM for 24 h, serum-deprived for 20–24 h, and exposed to control or test medium for 1–4 h as described in the text and figure legends. Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline and harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was measured using Galacton reagent (Tropix, Bedford, MA), both in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was corrected for β-galactosidase activity, and data are expressed as treated:control ratios. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the method of gene splicing by overlap extension or using the Morph Mutagenesis kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) (30Horton R.M. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. 15. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 251-261Google Scholar). The Morph Mutagenesis kit was used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to create targeted mutations of the cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE), within the multiple response element (MRE), and of the nuclear factor for IL-6 (NF-IL-6) binding site. Gene splicing by overlap extension was used to create mutations of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) site. For this purpose, wild-type and mutant constructs were generated by PCR using a 5′ primer containing a sequence corresponding to bp −257 to −249 of the rat IL-6 promoter (5′-AGGCGAGCTCAAAGAAAGA-3′) and a 3′ primer that included bp +6 to +20 of the rat IL-6 gene (5′-CCGCTCGAGACAGAATGA-3′). A chimeric construct containing bp −257 to + 20 of the IL-6 promoter was used as a template. Mutant sense and antisense primers, used to synthesize the intermediate products, contained two or three altered bases, creating the desired targeted mutations (29Franchimont N. Rydziel S. Canalis E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1797-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized wild-type and mutated IL-6 promoter fragments were cloned into the plasmid pGL3-Basic (Promega), containing the luciferase reporter gene. Sequences of the wild-type and mutated constructs generated either by the Morph Mutagenesis kit or by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using the Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). For gel shift assays, nuclear extracts from control and treated cultures were prepared as described (31Scott V. Clark A.R. Docherty K. Harwood A.J. Methods in Molecular Biology. 31. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 339-347Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline, suspended in Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol buffer, allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, and lysed with 10% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). Following centrifugation, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in a Hepes/KOH buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors at 4 °C, incubated for 30 min, and centrifuged, and the supernatant stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by DC protein assay in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Synthetic oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc., or National Biosciences Inc., Plymouth, MN) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts and labeled oligonucleotides were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The specificity of binding was determined by the addition of homologous or mutated unlabeled synthetic oligonucleotides in 100-fold excess (31Scott V. Clark A.R. Docherty K. Harwood A.J. Methods in Molecular Biology. 31. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 339-347Google Scholar). DNA-protein complexes were resolved on nondenaturing, nonreducing 4% polyacrylamide gels, and the complexes were visualized by autoradiography. For gel supershift assays, rabbit affinity purified antibodies to Fos and Jun family of nuclear factors, activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), and other cyclic AMP response element-binding proteins (CREB-1, CREM-1, ATF-1, ATF-3, and ATF-4) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were incubated for 1 h with nuclear extracts at room temperature, prior to the addition of synthetic oligonucleotides and electrophoretic resolution. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical differences were determined by analysis of variance and post hoc examination by the Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welch F test (32Wall F.J. Statistical Data Analysis Handbook. 1st Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1986Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of total RNA from serum-deprived confluent Ob cells revealed limited expression of IL-6 transcripts. Confirming our initial observation, PDGF BB at 3.3 nm caused a marked time-dependent stimulation of IL-6 mRNA levels, which was maximal after 60 min (Fig. 1). To determine whether the induction of IL-6 was dependent on protein synthesis, Ob cells were treated with PDGF BB in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide at 3.6 μm. Cycloheximide did not prevent the effect of PDGF BB (Fig. 2). To analyze the mechanisms involved in the regulation of IL-6, we examined the effects of PDGF BB on IL-6 hnRNA and on the rate of transcription of the IL-6 gene. PDGF BB markedly increased IL-6 hnRNA after 30 min, and the effect was sustained for 120 min (Fig. 3). PDGF BB at 3.3 nm increased the rate of IL-6 transcription, as determined by a nuclear run-on assay on nuclei from Ob cells, by 2–3-fold after 15 min (not shown) and by 6-fold after 30 min (Fig.4).Figure 2Effect of PDGF BB at 3.3 nm on IL-6 mRNA levels, in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (Cx) at 3.6 μm, in cultures of Ob cells treated for 1 h. Total RNA from control (C) or PDGF BB-treated (BB) cells was subjected to Northern blot analysis and hybridized with an α-32P-labeled IL-6 cDNA. IL-6 transcripts of 1.2 and 2.4 kilobase pairs were visualized by autoradiography. Blots were stripped and rehybridized with an α-32P-labeled 18 S rRNA cDNA. IL-6 transcripts are shown in the upper panel, and 18 S rRNA transcripts are shown in the lower panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Effect of PDGF BB at 3.3 nm on IL-6 hnRNA levels in cultures of Ob cells treated for 30–240 min.Total RNA from control (C) or PDGF BB-treated (BB) cells was extracted, and 1 μg was subjected to reverse transcription-PCR in the presence of IL-6 sense and antisense intron 2 primers and α-32P-dATP.

The effects of PDGF BB at 3.3 nm were tested initially for 1–4 h on a bp −276 to +20 fragment of the rat IL-6 promoter. After 2 h, PDGF BB caused a 3.5-fold increase in promoter activity, an effect sustained for 4 h (Fig. 5). To characterize the regulatory elements involved, 5′ deletion constructs of the IL-6 promoter ranging from bp −2906 to +20 to bp −34 to +20 were tested in six independent experiments. 5′ Deletions from bp −2906 to bp −276 of the IL-6 promoter resulted in a decrease in basal activity (not shown) but did not preclude the response to PDGF BB, which induced the bp −276 to +20 promoter construct by about 3-fold (Fig. 6). Deletion to bp −257, with the consequent removal of an AP-1 site, resulted in a partial loss of the stimulatory effect by PDGF BB, so that it increased the activity of the bp −257 to +20 IL-6 construct 2-fold (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the AP-1 site between −276 and −257 is in part responsible for the effect of PDGF BB, and that additional sequences contained in the bp −257 to +20 region of the IL-6 promoter play a role in the response to PDGF BB. To define additional elements responsible for the regulation of IL-6 by PDGF BB, a bp −257 to +20 fragment of the IL-6 promoter was cloned into pGL3-Basic, and targeted mutations of the known consensus sequences of CRE, NF-IL-6, and NF-κB binding sites were made and tested. PDGF BB at 3.3 nmincreased the activity of the bp −257 to +20 wild-type IL-6 construct by 1.5–2-fold (Fig. 7). Targeted mutations of NF-IL-6 and NF-κB did not result in a change in the response to PDGF BB. In contrast, a mutation of the CRE resulted in a total loss of the IL-6 promoter response to PDGF BB (Fig. 7).Figure 6Effect of PDGF BB on IL-6 promoter activity in transiently transfected Ob cells.

https://openalex.org/W2089692277,"The remarkable specificity of an antibody molecule has been used to accomplish highly selective functional group transformations not attainable by current chemical methods. An antibody raised against an amine-oxide hapten catalyzes the reduction of a diketone to a hydroxyketone with greater than 75:1 regioselectivity for one of two nearly equivalent ketone moieties. The antibody-catalyzed reaction is highly stereoselective, affording the hydroxyketone in high enantiomeric excess. Similarly, the reduction of ketones containing branched and aryl substituents, including the highly symmetrical 1-nitrophenyl-3-phenyl-2-propanone, was enantioselective. The simple strategy presented herein may find general applicability to the regio- and stereoselective reduction of a broad range of compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2324752099,"Mitogenic signals initiated at the plasma membrane are transmitted to the nucleus through an intricate signalling network. We identified the protooncoprotein Cot as a new component of mitogenic signalling cascades, which activates both the classic cytoplasmic cascade and the SAPK stress pathway. Wildtype and activated Cot phosphorylate and activate MEK-1 and SEK-1 in vitro. These findings are consistent with the sequence homology between Cot and the rat gene Tpl-2. Expression of oncogenic Cot in 293, NIH3T3 and PC12 cells leads to in vivo phosphorylation of endogenous c-Jun and Erk-1/2 suggesting that the serine/threonine kinase Cot functions beside c-Raf-1 and Mos as a direct activator of MEK-1. Furthermore, we have examined the biological effects of Cot on the phenotype of fibroblastic and neuronal cells. In order to test a potential c-Raf-1 dependency of Cot transformation, the effect of oncogenic Cot on Raf revertant CHP25 cells was determined. Cot could restore the transformed phenotype indicating that Cot transformation is not dependent on active c-Raf-1 and that Cot is not a target for the putative Raf inhibitor, which is presumably active in the revertant cell line. Expression of oncogenic versions of Raf as well as v-Mos leads to differentiation of PC12 cells. Cot also induces neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. These data are consistent with the role of Cot in the classic mitogenic cascade and suggest that the simultaneously activated JNK/SAPK stress pathway has no antagonistic effects in this context."

The vertebrate enzymes are α2β2 tetramers, whereas theCaenorhabditis elegans enzyme is an αβ dimer, the β subunit being identical to protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). We report here that the processed Drosophila melanogaster α subunit is 516 amino acid residues in length and shows 34 and 35% sequence identities to the two types of human α subunit and 31% identity to the C. elegans α subunit. Its coexpression in insect cells with the Drosophila PDI polypeptide produced an active enzyme tetramer, and small amounts of a hybrid tetramer were also obtained upon coexpression with human PDI. Four of the five recently identified critical residues at the catalytic site were conserved, but a histidine that probably helps the binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the Fe2+ and its decarboxylation was replaced by arginine 490. The enzyme had a higherK m for 2-oxoglutarate, a lower reaction velocity, and a higher percentage of uncoupled decarboxylation than the human enzymes. The mutation R490H reduced the percentage of uncoupled decarboxylation, whereas R490S increased the K m for 2-oxoglutarate, reduced the reaction velocity, and increased the percentage of uncoupled decarboxylation.

An α subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase has also been cloned from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (7Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This forms an active enzyme in insect cell coexpression experiments with both the C. elegans and human PDI polypeptides, but surprisingly, the enzymes containing the subunit are αβ dimers (7Veijola J.

The C. elegans PDI polypeptide also forms an active prolyl 4-hydroxylase with the human α subunits, but these enzymes are α2β2 tetramers (8Veijola J. Annunen P. Koivunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Assembly of a tetramer or dimer must therefore depend on the properties of the α subunit. It is currently unknown whether other nonvertebrate prolyl 4-hydroxylases are likewise dimers rather than tetramers. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase requires Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate (2Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 3Kivirikko K.I.

A search for conserved amino acid residues within sequences of several 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases and prolyl 4-hydroxylase α subunits from various species, together with extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies on the human α(I) subunit, have identified five amino acid residues that are critical at the cosubstrate binding sites of prolyl 4-hydroxylases (4Helaakoski T.

Three of these, His-412, Asp-414, and His-483 (numbered according to the human α(I) subunit), are involved in binding of the Fe2+ atom, whereas Lys-493 binds the C-5 carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate (10Lamberg A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). His-501 is an additional critical residue, probably involved in both the binding of the C-1 carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate to the Fe2+ atom and the decarboxylation of this cosubstrate (11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to clone the α subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase from Drosophila melanogaster and to characterize the corresponding enzyme. Special emphasis was given to comparison of the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of theDrosophila α subunit with those of the human α(I) and α(II) subunits and the C. elegans α subunit, to identify conserved and nonconserved residues and regions, and to the question of whether the Drosophila enzyme is an α2β2 tetramer or an αβ dimer. The amino acid sequence of the Drosophila α subunit was found to show several distinct differences as compared with those of the other species studied, and the Drosophila enzyme was found to have some unique catalytic properties that appear related to these differences. A sequence homology search in FlyBase indicated the presence of a 179-nucleotide-long sequence (DM59D7T, FlyBase ID no. FBgn0015713) homologous to those of the vertebrate prolyl 4-hydroxylase α subunits. PCR primers PKA5 (5′-AAATGGAGGTTCCACGGCAG-3′) and PKA3 (5′-CCGATCCCATAGTTTGCCAC-CTG-3′) were synthesized based on this sequence and used to obtain a 160-bp PCR product from a cDNA pool generated from D. melanogastermRNA. The purified PCR product was 32P-labeled and used to screen a D. melanogaster larva λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH). This screening yielded seven positive clones among 600,000 recombinants, two of which, termed Dα2 and Dα6, were characterized in detail. The nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (12Sanger K. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52599) Google Scholar) with the Sequenase enzyme (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Vector-specific or sequence-specific primers (Pharmacia) were used. DNASIS and PROSIS (version 6.0) (Pharmacia) were used to analyze the nucleotide and amino acid sequence data. The cleavage site of the signal pepide was predicted using the computational parameters of von Hejne (13von Hejne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar). An expression construct for theDrosophila α subunit was obtained by digesting the Dα2 clone with EcoRI. This fragment, which covers the whole coding region, 62 bp of the 5′-untranslated region and 12 bp of the 3′-untranslated region, was ligated to the transfer vector pVL1392 (14Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Arginine 490 (codon CGT) was converted to histidine (CAT) or serine (AGT) to produce the transfer vectors for the recombinant baculoviruses DαH and DαS, respectively. The mutagenesis steps were performed in a pSP72 vector (Promega) containing the Dα2 clone, using a PCR-based method (QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). To construct a baculovirus transfer vector for theDrosophila PDI polypeptide, a PCR product containing 9 bp of the 5′-untranslated region, the whole coding region, and 227 bp of the 3′-untranslated region, was amplified using sequence-specific (15McKay R.R. Zhum L.Q. Shortridge R.D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) primers DRO1 (5′-GTGACCGCAATGAAATTCCTG-3′) and DRO4 (5′-GCAAAAAGCTTCGATGGCTAC-3′) from a cDNA pool generated fromD. melanogaster mRNA, and the fragment was ligated to the SmaI site of the pVL1393. Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured as monolayers in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Bioclear) at 27 °C. The recombinant baculovirus transfer vectors were cotransfected into Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold, PharMingen) by calcium phosphate precipitation (16Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Expression Vector System, Procedures and Methods Manual. PharMingen, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). The resultant viral pools were collected 4 days later, plaque-purified, and amplified (16Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Expression Vector System, Procedures and Methods Manual. PharMingen, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). The recombinant viruses coding for the Drosophila α subunit, its R490H and R490S mutants, and the Drosophila PDI polypeptide were termed Dα, DαH, DαS, and Dβ. Other recombinant baculoviruses used were human α(I), C. elegans α, human PDI, and C. elegans PDI coding for the corresponding prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunits (7Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P.

A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells were cultured as described above, either as monolayers or in suspension in spinner flasks (Techne Laboratories, Princeton, NJ), and were infected at a multiplicity of 5. For the production of an enzyme tetramer/dimer, the Dα, DαH, DαS, human α(I), orC. elegans α, and the human, C. elegans, orD. melanogaster PDI viruses were used in a ratio 1:1. The cells were harvested 3 days after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a solution of 0.1 m glycine, 0.1m NaCl, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.8, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE or nondenaturing 8% PAGE and assayed for enzyme activity. Two μg of poly(A)+RNAs from embryonic, larval, and adult Drosophila(CLONTECH) were run on a 1% formaldehyde gel with molecular weight standards (Promega). The poly(A)+ RNAs were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter, and the filter was hybridized under stringent conditions with 32P-labeled Dα2 clone covering the whole coding region of theDrosophila α subunit. Autoradiography time was 9 days. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate as described previously (18Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), except that in the assays involving the Drosophila enzyme the 2-oxoglutarate concentration was increased from 0.1 to 0.2 μmol/ml and the (Pro-Pro-Gly)10·9H2O peptide substrate concentration from 0.1 to 1.5 mg/ml. The same method was used for measuring the uncoupled decarboxylation activity, except that the peptide substrate was omitted and the amount of enzyme was increased about 10-fold. K m values were determined by varying the concentration of one substrate in the presence of fixed concentrations of the second, whereas the concentrations of the other substrates were held constant (19Myllylä R. Tuderman L. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The Triton X-100-soluble fraction of the insect cell homogenate was used as the enzyme source for theK m determinations. The amounts of recombinant proteins were compared by densitometry of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands in nondenaturing PAGE using a BioImage instrument (BioImage, Millipore). The first cDNA clone was a 160-bp PCR product obtained from a D. melanogaster cDNA pool with primers PK5 and PK3, which were based on a 179-nucleotide sequence DM59D7T present in FlyBase. This PCR product was used to screen a D. melanogaster larva λgt10 cDNA library, and one of the 7 positive clones obtained, Dα2, was found to cover 62 bp of the 5′-untranslated sequence, the whole coding region and 12 bp of the 3′-untranslated sequence of the corresponding Drosophilaα subunit mRNA. Dα6 continued 201 bp downward from the 3′-end of Dα2, and thus a total of 213 bp of the 3′-untranslated sequence was characterized. This 3′-untranslated region does not contain the canonical polyadenylation signal AATAAA, but it does contain a GATAAA sequence, which is accompanied 21 bp downstream by a possible poly(A) tail of 4 nucleotides at which the clone ends (these cDNA sequences are not shown but have been deposited in the GenBank/EMBL Data Bank with accession number AF096284). The cDNA clone encodes a 535-amino acid polypeptide. A putative signal peptide is present at its N terminus, the most likely first amino acid of the processed α subunit being glutamate, based on the computational parameters of von Hejne (13von Hejne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar) and comparison with the N terminus of the processed human α(II) subunit (5Annunen P. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J.

Thus the length of the signal peptide is probably 19 amino acids and that of the processed α subunit 516 amino acids (Fig.1). The Drosophila α subunit is very similar in size to the human α(I) and α(II) subunits which have 517 (20Helaakoski T. Vuori K. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is longer, 542 amino acids, mainly because of a 32-residue C-terminal extension (Fig. 1). The Drosophila α subunit also has a C-terminal extension as compared with the vertebrate α(I) and α(II) subunits (3Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar), but this extension is much shorter than in the C. elegans α subunit, being only 10 residues (Fig. 1). The Drosophila α subunit sequence has several minor deletions and insertions as compared with the other α subunit sequences, the longest deletion, between residues 225 and 226, being 9 amino acids (Fig. 1). The overall amino acid sequence identities between theDrosophila α subunit (excluding its 10-residue C-terminal extension) and the human α(I) and α(II) subunits are 34 and 35%, respectively, whereas its identity to the C. elegans α subunit is 31%. The identity is highest within the catalytically important (2Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 3Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T.

All three residues that bind the Fe2+ atom and the lysine that binds the C-5 carboxyl group of the 2-oxoglutarate (11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) are conserved, these amino acids being His-402, Asp-404, His-472, and Lys-482 in the Drosophila polypeptide. Surprisingly, however, the fifth critical residue, an additional histidine that is probably involved in both the binding of the C-1 carboxyl group of the 2-oxoglutarate to the Fe2+ atom and the decarboxylation of this cosubstrate (11Myllyharju J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), corresponding to residues 139–229 in the Drosophila α subunit, contains a 9-residue deletion close to its C-terminal end (between residues 225 and 226), whereas residues 139–225 show only 31, 36, and 23% identity to those in the human α(I) and α(II) subunits and the C. elegans α subunit, respectively. The 32-amino acid sequence of residues 230–261 shows a particularly low degree of identity to those in the other α subunits, namely 3.1, 6.3, and 12.5% when compared with those of the human α(I) and α(II) subunits and the C. elegans α subunit (Fig. 1). The sequence of residues 27–60 represents another region of low identity, namely 5.9, 11.8, and 2.9% to the same subunits. The Drosophila α subunit has three potential attachment sites for asparagine-linked oligosaccharide units, but the positions of these sites are different from those of the two sites (4Helaakoski T.

A recombinant baculovirus encoding theDrosophila α subunit was generated and used to infectS. frugiperda insect cells. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing Triton X-100, and centrifuged. The cell pellet was solubilized in 1% SDS, and the 0.1% Triton X-100 soluble and 1% SDS soluble proteins were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Most of the insect cell proteins were soluble in the Triton X-100 containing buffer (details not shown). As with prolyl 4-hydroxylase α subunits from other sources, the recombinant polypeptide formed insoluble aggregates, and efficient extraction of the recombinantDrosophila α subunit required the use of 1% SDS. The polypeptide was found in the form of three main bands (Fig.2, lane 2) with mobilities slightly less than those of the three human α(I) subunit bands (Fig. 2, lane 1). Digestion of the sample with endoglycosidase H produced a single band with a mobility slightly higher than that of the lowest of the three bands present in the untreated sample (Fig. 2, lane 3), suggesting that the original polypeptide was present in tri-, di-, and monoglycosylated forms. This agrees with the presence of three potential N-glycosylation sites in the Drosophilaα subunit (Fig. 1) and indicates that all three sites are used, at least in insect cells. To produce a Drosophila prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer or dimer, a cDNA coding for the Drosophila PDI polypeptide was prepared by PCR using primers based on the published sequence (15McKay R.R. Zhum L.Q. Shortridge R.D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A recombinant baculovirus encoding the Drosophila PDI polypeptide was then generated and used to infect insect cells together with the virus coding for the Drosophila α subunit. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, and Triton X-100-soluble proteins of the cell homogenate were analyzed by nondenaturing 8% PAGE. A Coomassie Blue-stained band with a mobility slightly higher than that of the enzyme tetramer produced by coinfection of insect cells with recombinant viruses coding for the α(I) subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase and the human PDI polypeptide (Fig. 3 A,lane 1) was seen in samples coinfected with the two types of Drosophila virus (Fig. 3 A,lane 2), whereas no such band was seen in a corresponding sample from cells infected with the Drosophilaα subunit virus alone (not shown). The mobility of thisDrosophila prolyl 4-hydroxylase band is distinctly different from that produced by coinfecting insect cells with baculoviruses coding for the C. elegans α subunit and the human PDI polypeptide (Fig. 3 A, lane 5), shown previously (7Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to represent an αβ dimer. The data thus strongly suggest that the Drosophila prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an α2β2 tetramer. No band corresponding to an enzyme tetramer or dimer could be seen in Coomassie Blue-stained samples from cells coexpressing theDrosophila α subunit and the human PDI polypeptide (Fig.3 A, lane 3), but formation of a small amount of a hybrid enzyme tetramer could be demonstrated by Western blotting with an antibody to the human PDI polypeptide (Fig.3 B, lane 3). Coexpression of the human α subunit with the Drosophila PDI polypeptide produced an enzyme tetramer that could easily be seen by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity of the Triton X-100-soluble proteins was measured by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate (18Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). When the specific activity of the Drosophila enzyme was compared with that of the human type I enzyme, the Coomassie Blue-stained bands in nondenaturing PAGE corresponding to these enzyme tetramers were first studied by densitometry, and the activity levels obtained were corrected (10Lamberg A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9926-9931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) for the differences in the amounts of the two types of enzyme. Initial prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity assays performed under standard conditions (18Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) suggested that the specific activity of theDrosophila enzyme was very low, but when the values were corrected for saturating concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate and the (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 peptide substrate (see below), the specific activity of the Drosophila enzyme increased to about one-third of that of the human type I enzyme (details not shown). The rate of uncoupled 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation, i.e.decarboxylation observed in the absence of the peptide substrate, was 3.7% of the rate of the complete reaction (details not shown, see also Table II below). This percentage is markedly higher than the value of 0.7% measured for the human type I enzyme (11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Table IIProlyl 4-hydroxylase activity, rate of uncoupled decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate and Km for 2-oxoglutarate of the αArg-490 mutant Drosophila enzymesEnzymeProlyl 4-hydroxylase activityUncoupled enzyme activityK m for 2-oxoglutaratedpm/50 μldpm/50 μl% complete reactionμmNoninfected control<50<15DαDβ6960 ± 120260 ± 83.7 ± 0.184 ± 29DαR490HDβ6000 ± 30120 ± 3ap < 0.005.2.0 ± 0.04bp < 0.001.106 ± 27DαR490SDβ1890 ± 400ap < 0.005.260 ± 14013.8 ± 6.8ap < 0.005.325 ± 55ap < 0.005.The values are given in dpm/50 μl of Triton X-100-soluble cell protein, mean ± S.D.

The statistical significances of the values obtained with the mutant enzymes were calculated versus the wild-type enzyme. The values are given as mean ± S.D. The K m values of the Drosophila enzyme for Fe2+ and ascorbate were very similar to those of the human type I and type II enzymes, whereas the K m for 2-oxoglutarate was about 4-fold (TableI). A major difference was found in theK m for the (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 peptide substrate, because that of the Drosophila enzyme was about 12 times that of the human type I enzyme and 3 times that of the human type II enzyme (Table I). The Drosophila enzyme resembled the vertebrate type II enzymes in being inhibited by poly(l-proline) only at high concentrations, theK i for poly(l-proline)M r 7,000 being about 30-fold relative to that obtained for the human type I enzyme and that for poly-(l-proline) M r 44,000 about 150-fold (Table I). These K i values of theDrosophila enzyme are not as high as those of the human type II enzyme, however, because the latter values are still about 5-fold and 7-fold higher than the Drosophila enzyme values for poly-(L-proline) M r 7,000 and 44,000, respectively (Table I). Arg-490 in the Drosophila α subunit was converted to either histidine or serine, and baculoviruses coding for the mutant α subunits were used to infect insect cells. The cells were harvested and homogenized as above, and the 1% SDS-soluble proteins were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The expression levels of both types of mutant α subunit per μg of protein were found to be similar to that of the wild-type polypeptide (Fig.4 A). The mutant α subunits were then coexpressed in insect cells with theDrosophila PDI polypeptide, and the cells were harvested 72 h after infection. Proteins soluble in a Triton X-100 buffer were analyzed by nondenaturing 8% PAGE and assayed for prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity. The Coomassie Blue-stained bands corresponding to the enzyme tetramer (Fig. 4 B) were studied by densitometry in each experiment, and these values were used to correct the enzyme activity levels for differences in the amounts of the various types of enzyme tetramer, as described previously (10Lamberg A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9926-9931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the R490H mutant enzyme tetramer was found to be about 90% that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the specific activity of the R490S enzyme tetramer was only about 30% (TableII). The rate of uncoupled 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation as a percentage of the rate of the complete reaction was lower with the R490H mutant enzyme than with the wild-type enzyme, whereas the R490S enzyme gave a very high percentage (Table II). The K m of the R490H mutant enzyme for 2-oxoglutarate was similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas that of the R490S enzyme was about 4-fold that of the wild-type enzyme (Table II). Northern analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from embryonal, larval, and adultDrosophila gave a distinct hybridization signal only with the larval RNA (Fig. 5). The size of the mRNA was about 1.9 kilobases, which agrees well with the size of the 1883 nucleotides characterized by cloning and sequencing. The data reported here indicate that the α subunit ofDrosophila prolyl 4-hydroxylase shows about 30–35% amino acid sequence identity with the two types of human and the C. elegans α subunit. The expression level of the mRNA for theDrosophila α subunit was much higher at the larval stage than the embryonic or adult Drosophila. Our data further indicate that the Drosophila enzyme resembles the vertebrate enzymes (2Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J.

J. 1996; 317: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in that it is an α2β2 tetramer. The Drosophila α subunit was found to have several distinct amino acid sequence differences from those of other species in both its catalytic and peptide substrate binding domains. These differences appear to be related to certain unique catalytic properties of the Drosophila enzyme. The most distinct of these differences was that the histidine likely to assist in the binding of the C-1 carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate to the Fe2+ atom, and also in the decarboxylation of this cosubstrate (11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), was replaced by Arg-490. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on the human α(I) subunit have indicated that replacement of this histidine by other amino acids, including arginine, leads to a 2–3-fold increase in theK m for 2-oxoglutarate, a marked decrease in the reaction velocity, and a marked increase in the rate of uncoupled 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation as a percentage of the rate of the complete reaction (11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The present data on the wild-typeDrosophila enzyme are similar to those obtained with the histidine to arginine mutant human type I enzyme, in that theK m of the former for 2-oxoglutarate was about 4-fold that of the wild-type human enzyme, the reaction velocity was lower, and the percentage of uncoupled decarboxylation was about 5-fold. Mutation of Arg-490 to histidine in the Drosophila α subunit reduced the percentage of uncoupled decarboxylation but did not increase the reaction velocity or reduce the K m for 2-oxoglutarate, whereas mutation of Arg-490 to serine gave a much lower reaction velocity, a much higher percentage of the uncoupled reaction, and an increased K m for 2-oxoglutarate relative to those determined with the wild-type Drosophila enzyme. The data obtained with the R490S mutant Drosophila enzyme agree with those reported for the corresponding human α(I) subunit mutant (11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas the data obtained with the R490H Drosophilamutant resemble those expected on the basis of the human mutants (11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) only in that the rate of uncoupled 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation was lower than with the wild-type Drosophila enzyme. Thus, other residues in the Drosophila α subunit must influence the environment around residue 490 so that the arginine in this position is much more acceptable than in the human α(I) subunit. The finding that the lysine that binds the C-5 carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate (11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) is conserved in the Drosophila α subunit is of interest, as the corresponding position in all other 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases sequenced so far, including lysyl hydroxylase (22Myllylä R.

The relatively low degree of identity between the Drosophilaα subunit and the other α subunits within the peptide binding domain agrees with the finding that the K m of theDrosophila enzyme for the (Pro-Pro-Gly)10peptide substrate is higher than that of any vertebrate prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer studied (Table I and Ref. 3Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar) or of the C. elegans enzyme dimer (7Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J.

It is currently unknown whether this difference is related to possible differences between the sequences of the susceptible prolines in the Drosophila collagens (27Blumberg B. MacKrell A.J.

The actual residues in the peptide binding domain that are critical for the binding of (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and poly-(l-proline) are likewise unknown. The high K m of theDrosophila enzyme for (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and the high K i values for poly-(l-proline) indicate that the peptide binding properties of theDrosophila enzyme are more closely related to those of the vertebrate type II enzymes (4Helaakoski T.

Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). A 32-amino acid residue region very close to the C-terminal end of the peptide binding domain was found to have a particularly low degree of identity between the Drosophila α subunit and those from other species. No function is currently known for this region, but the low degree of identity suggests that it may represent a variable interdomain sequence. It is also currently unknown whether the catalytic domain begins around residue 262, the C-terminal end of this variable region, or whether there is an additional domain with an unknown function between this region and the catalytic domain, as the highly conserved C-terminal region begins only around residue 385. The formation of only very small amounts of an enzyme tetramer between the Drosophila α subunit and the human PDI polypeptide is of interest, as the C. elegans α subunit readily forms an active enzyme dimer with the human PDI polypeptide (7Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as the human α(I) subunit readily formed an enzyme tetramer with theDrosophila PDI polypeptide. Thus the Drosophilaα subunit must have some structural feature that acts against tetramer formation with human PDI, and the Drosophila PDI polypeptide must have, in addition to structural features that allow prolyl 4-hdyroxylase formation with both the human andDrosophila α subunits, some specific feature that is not present in the human PDI polypeptide and that is recognized by theDrosophila α subunit. Further work will be required to elucidate these features, as no specific data are available at present on sequences in these polypeptides that are critical for prolyl 4-hydroxylase assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2317004469,"The nuclear and nucleolar targeting properties of human ribosomal protein S25 (RPS25) were analysed by the expression of epitope-tagged RPS25 cDNAs in Cos-1 cells. The tagged RPS25 was localized to the cell nucleus, with a strong predominance in the nucleolus. At the amino terminus of RPS25, two stretches of highly basic residues juxtapose. This configuration shares common features with the nucleolar targeting signals (NOS) of lentiviral RNA-binding transactivators, including human immunodeficiency viruses' (HIV) Rev proteins. Deletion and site-directed mutational analyses demonstrated that the first NOS-like stretch is dispensable for both nuclear and nucleolar localization of RPS25, and that the nuclear targeting signal is located within the second NOS-like stretch. It has also been suggested that a set of continuous basic residues and the total number of basic residues should be required for nucleolar targeting. Signal-mediated nuclear/nucleolar targeting was further characterized by the construction and expression of a variety of chimeric constructs, utilizing three different backbones with RPS25 cDNA fragments. Immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated a 17 residue peptide of RPS25 as a potential nuclear/nucleolar targeting signal. The identified peptide signal may belong to a putative subclass of NOS, characterized by compact structure, together with lentiviral RNA-binding transactivators."
https://openalex.org/W2333116340,"The MDM2 proto-oncogene is overexpressed in human tumours and regulates the activities of the tumour suppressors p53 and pRB. We created mice that overexpress MDM2 under the control of the CMV promoter. These mice did not display an increased tumour incidence, but rather a specific skin phenotype, characterized by desquamation and hyperkeratosis. Transgenic MDM2 was found to be overexpressed in the epidermis, a tissue that normally expresses high levels of MDM2. The phenotype appeared during the first week after birth and then lessened with age, closely following the level of expression of the transgene. MDM2 overexpression was associated with an increase in proliferation in the basal layer, thickening of the epidermis, altered expression of the differentiation markers cytokeratin CK14, CK10 and CK1, and a decrease in the size and the number of granules that contain products of differentiation. Transgenic mice on a p53 null background displayed similar although not identical changes, showing that the effects of MDM2 are to a certain degree p53 independent. The skin is a major site of MDM2 expression in mice, raising the possibility that MDM2 overexpression perturbs the normal pattern of MDM2 expression and inhibits differentiation of the epidermis."

But what do RNA viruses do? In his Perspective, Strauss summarizes new work leading to the identification of the host proteins that RNA viruses redirect to help replicate their RNA genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2313320161,"Telomerase activity is detectable in the majority of tumors or immortalized cell lines, but is repressed in most normal human somatic cells. It is generally assumed that reactivation of telomerase prevents the erosion of chromosome ends which occurs in cycling cells and, hence, hinders cellular replicative senescence. Here, we show that the expression of v-Myc oncoprotein by retroviral infection of telomerase-negative embryonal quail myoblasts and chicken neuroretina cells is sufficient for reactivating telomerase activity, earlier than telomere shortening could occur. Furthermore, the use of a conditional v-Myc-estrogen receptor protein (v-MycER) causes estrogen-dependent expression of detectable levels of telomerase activity in recently infected chick embryo fibroblasts and neuroretina cells. We conclude that the high levels of telomerase activity in v-Myc-expressing avian cells are not the mere consequence of transformation or of a differentiative block, since v-Src tyrosine kinase, which prevents terminal differentiation and promotes cell transformation, fails to induce telomerase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2329566391,"The type I human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) induces abnormal growth and subsequent transformation of T cells, which is associated with the development of an acute T-cell malignancy termed adult T-cell leukemia. A characteristic of HTLV-I-transformed T cells is the constitutive nuclear expression of NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors, which appears to be essential for the growth of these transformed cells. Although NF-kappaB/Rel factors are known to induce the expression of T-cell growth factor interleukin (IL)-2, it is unclear how they participate in the IL-2-independent growth of HTLV-I-transformed cells. In this study, we show that certain NF-kappaB/Rel members, predominantly c-Rel, interact with enhancer sequences for STAT5, a key transcription factor mediating IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation. Reporter gene assays reveal that the binding of c-Rel to the STAT5 site present in the Fc gammaR1 gene leads to potent transactivation of this enhancer. Binding of c-Rel to the Fc gammaR1 STAT site also occurs in human peripheral blood T cells immortalized with HTLV-I in vitro and is correlated with enhanced levels of proliferation of these cells. These results raise the possibility that NF-kappaB/Rel may participate in the growth control of HTLV-I-transformed T cells by regulating genes driven by both kappaB and certain STAT enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W2021578268,"Many integral membrane proteins contain an amino-terminal segment, often referred to as an N-tail, that is translocated across a membrane. In many cases, translocation of the N-tail is initiated by a cleavable, amino-terminal signal peptide. For N-tail proteins lacking a signal peptide, translocation is initiated by a transmembrane segment that is carboxyl to the translocated segment. The mechanism of membrane translocation of these segments, although poorly understood, has been reported to be independent of the protein secretion machinery. In contrast, here we describe alkaline phosphatase mutants containing artificial transmembrane segments that demonstrate that translocation of a long N-tail across the membrane is dependent upon SecA, SecB, and the electrochemical potential in the absence of a signal peptide. The corresponding mutants containing signal peptides also use the secretion machinery but are less sensitive to inhibition of its components. We present evidence that inhibition of SecA by sodium azide is incomplete even at high concentrations of inhibitor, which suggests why SecA-dependent translocation may not have been detected in other systems. Furthermore, by varying the charge around the transmembrane segment, we find that in the absence of a signal peptide, the orientation of the membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase is dictated by the positive inside rule. However, the presence of a signal peptide is an overriding factor in membrane orientation and renders all mutants in an Nout-Cin orientation."
