https://openalex.org/W4210593868,"Solving environmental problems relies upon cultivating pro-environmental behavior in the society. While the internet has been widely used to facilitate information transmission and communication, it’s important to understand its function in promoting pro-environmental behavior. Using the data from the China General Social Survey 2013, the relationship between the use of internet and the individual’s pro-environmental behavior is investigated, and overall positive effects are found. The results show that, the influence of internet use is more pronounced on the private pro-environmental behavior when further dividing pro-environmental behavior into private and public types. Moreover, the positive effect of internet use on pro-environmental behavior is more pronounced among low-income and female groups, compared to middle to high income and male counterparts, respectively, when considering the heterogeneity across different groups of individuals. We further explore the plausible channels of providing information, encouraging participation in pro-environmental campaigns and improving social relationships through which internet use facilitates pro-environmental behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4210467014,"Peer Review is at the heart of scholarly communications and the cornerstone of scientific publishing. However, academia often criticizes the peer review system as non-transparent, biased, arbitrary, a flawed process at the heart of science, leading to researchers arguing with its reliability and quality. These problems could also be due to the lack of studies with the peer-review texts for various proprietary and confidentiality clauses. Peer review texts could serve as a rich source of Natural Language Processing (NLP) research on understanding the scholarly communication landscape, and thereby build systems towards mitigating those pertinent problems. In this work, we present a first of its kind multi-layered dataset of 1199 open peer review texts manually annotated at the sentence level (∼ 17k sentences) across the four layers, viz. Paper Section Correspondence, Paper Aspect Category, Review Functionality, and Review Significance. Given a text written by the reviewer, we annotate: to which sections (e.g., Methodology, Experiments, etc.), what aspects (e.g., Originality/Novelty, Empirical/Theoretical Soundness, etc.) of the paper does the review text correspond to, what is the role played by the review text (e.g., appreciation, criticism, summary, etc.), and the importance of the review statement (major, minor, general) within the review. We also annotate the sentiment of the reviewer (positive, negative, neutral) for the first two layers to judge the reviewer's perspective on the different sections and aspects of the paper. We further introduce four novel tasks with this dataset, which could serve as an indicator of the exhaustiveness of a peer review and can be a step towards the automatic judgment of review quality. We also present baseline experiments and results for the different tasks for further investigations. We believe our dataset would provide a benchmark experimental testbed for automated systems to leverage on current NLP state-of-the-art techniques to address different issues with peer review quality, thereby ushering increased transparency and trust on the holy grail of scientific research validation. Our dataset and associated codes are available at https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/resources.html#Peer-Review-Analyze."
https://openalex.org/W4210253499,"Opioid-induced respiratory depression driven by ligand binding to mu-opioid receptors is a leading cause of opioid-related fatalities. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist, binds with high affinity to mu-opioid receptors but displays partial respiratory depression effects. The authors examined whether sustained buprenorphine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved with some extended-release injections used to treat opioid use disorder could reduce the frequency and magnitude of fentanyl-induced respiratory depression.In this two-period crossover, single-centre study, 14 healthy volunteers (single-blind, randomized) and eight opioid-tolerant patients taking daily opioid doses ≥90 mg oral morphine equivalents (open-label) received continuous intravenous buprenorphine or placebo for 360 minutes, targeting buprenorphine plasma concentrations of 0.2 or 0.5 ng/mL in healthy volunteers and 1.0, 2.0 or 5.0 ng/mL in opioid-tolerant patients. Upon reaching target concentrations, participants received up to four escalating intravenous doses of fentanyl. The primary endpoint was change in isohypercapnic minute ventilation (VE). Additionally, occurrence of apnea was recorded.Fentanyl-induced changes in VE were smaller at higher buprenorphine plasma concentrations. In healthy volunteers, at target buprenorphine concentration of 0.5 ng/mL, the first and second fentanyl boluses reduced VE by [LSmean (95% CI)] 26% (13-40%) and 47% (37-59%) compared to 51% (38-64%) and 79% (69-89%) during placebo infusion (p = 0.001 and < .001, respectively). Discontinuations for apnea limited treatment comparisons beyond the second fentanyl injection. In opioid-tolerant patients, fentanyl reduced VE up to 49% (21-76%) during buprenorphine infusion (all concentration groups combined) versus up to 100% (68-132%) during placebo infusion (p = 0.006). In opioid-tolerant patients, the risk of experiencing apnea requiring verbal stimulation following fentanyl boluses was lower with buprenorphine than with placebo (odds ratio: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.0 to 0.3; p = 0.001).Results from this proof-of-principle study provide the first clinical evidence that high sustained plasma concentrations of buprenorphine may protect against respiratory depression induced by potent opioids like fentanyl."
https://openalex.org/W4210759020,"As the world's largest coal producer, China was accounted for about 46% of global coal production. Among present coal mining risks, methane gas (called gas in this paper) explosion or ignition in an underground mine remains ever-present. Although many techniques have been used, gas accidents associated with the complex elements of underground gassy mines need more robust monitoring or warning systems to identify risks. This paper aimed to determine which single method between the PCA and Entropy methods better establishes a responsive weighted indexing measurement to improve coal mining safety.Qualitative and quantitative mixed research methodologies were adopted for this research, including analysis of two case studies, correlation analysis, and comparative analysis. The literature reviewed the most-used multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods, including subjective methods and objective methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each MCDM method were briefly discussed. One more round literature review was conducted to search publications between 2017 and 2019 in CNKI. Followed two case studies, correlation analysis and comparative analysis were then conducted. Research ethics was approved by the Shanxi Coking Coal Group Research Committee.The literature searched a total of 25,831publications and found that the PCA method was the predominant method adopted, and the Entropy method was the second most widely adopted method. Two weighting methods were compared using two case studies. For the comparative analysis of Case Study 1, the PCA method appeared to be more responsive than the Entropy. For Case Study 2, the Entropy method is more responsive than the PCA. As a result, both methods were adopted for different cases in the case study mine and finally deployed for user acceptance testing on 5 November 2020.The findings and suggestions were provided as further scopes for further research. This research indicated that no single method could be adopted as the better option for establishing indexing measurement in all cases. The practical implication suggests that comparative analysis should always be conducted on each case and determine the appropriate weighting method to the relevant case. This research recommended that the PCA method was a dimension reduction technique that could be handy for identifying the critical variables or factors and effectively used in hazard, risk, and emergency assessment. The PCA method might also be well-applied for developing predicting and forecasting systems as it was sensitive to outliers. The Entropy method might be suitable for all the cases requiring the MCDM. There is also a need to conduct further research to probe the causal reasons why the PCA and Entropy methods were applied to each case and not the other way round. This research found that the Entropy method provides higher accuracy than the PCA method. This research also found that the Entropy method demonstrated to assess the weights of the higher dimension dataset was higher sensitivity than the lower dimensions. Finally, the comprehensive analysis indicates a need to explore a more responsive method for establishing a weighted indexing measurement for warning applications in hazard, risk, and emergency assessments."
https://openalex.org/W4210245402,"Objective To develop a quantitative ultrasound (QUS)- and elastography-based model to improve classification of steatosis grade, inflammation grade, and fibrosis stage in patients with chronic liver disease in comparison with shear wave elastography alone, using histopathology as the reference standard. Methods This ancillary study to a prospective institutional review-board approved study included 82 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic hepatitis B or C virus, or autoimmune hepatitis. Elastography measurements, homodyned K-distribution parametric maps, and total attenuation coefficient slope were recorded. Random forests classification and bootstrapping were used to identify combinations of parameters that provided the highest diagnostic accuracy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed. Results For classification of steatosis grade S0 vs. S1-3, S0-1 vs. S2-3, S0-2 vs. S3, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were respectively 0.60, 0.63, and 0.62 with elasticity alone, and 0.90, 0.81, and 0.78 with the best tested model combining QUS and elastography features. For classification of inflammation grade A0 vs. A1-3, A0-1 vs. A2-3, A0-2 vs. A3, AUCs were respectively 0.56, 0.62, and 0.64 with elasticity alone, and 0.75, 0.68, and 0.69 with the best model. For classification of liver fibrosis stage F0 vs. F1-4, F0-1 vs. F2-4, F0-2 vs. F3-4, F0-3 vs. F4, AUCs were respectively 0.66, 0.77, 0.72, and 0.74 with elasticity alone, and 0.72, 0.77, 0.77, and 0.75 with the best model. Conclusion Random forest models incorporating QUS and shear wave elastography increased the classification accuracy of liver steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis when compared to shear wave elastography alone."
https://openalex.org/W4210443928,"The recognition and classification of White Blood Cell (WBC) play a remarkable role in blood-related diseases (i.e., leukemia, infections) diagnosis. For the highly similar morphology of different WBC subtypes, it is too confused to classify the WBC effectively and accurately for visual observation of blood cell smears. This paper proposes a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) with feature fusion strategies, named WBC-AMNet, for automatically classifying WBC subtypes based on focalized attention mechanism. To obtain more localized attention of CNN, the fusion features of the first and the last convolutional layer are extracted by focalized attention mechanism combining Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and Gather-Excite (GE) modules. The new method performs successfully in classifying monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils on the complex background with an overall accuracy of 95.66%, better than that of general CNNs. The multi-classification accuracy of WBC-AMNet with the background segmentation is over 98% in all cases. In addition, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is employed to visualize the attention heatmaps of different feature maps."
https://openalex.org/W4210680059,"Visuospatial working memory (VSWM) is essential to human cognitive abilities and is associated with important life outcomes such as academic performance. Recently, a number of reliable measures of VSWM have been developed to help understand psychological processes and for practical use in education. We sought to extend this work using Item Response Theory (IRT) and Computerised Adaptive Testing (CAT) frameworks to construct, calibrate and validate a new adaptive, computerised, and open-source VSWM test. We aimed to overcome the limitations of previous instruments and provide researchers with a valid and freely available VSWM measurement tool. The Jack and Jill (JaJ) VSWM task was constructed using explanatory item response modelling of data from a sample of the general adult population (Study 1, N = 244) in the UK and US. Subsequently, a static version of the task was tested for validity and reliability using a sample of adults from the UK and Australia (Study 2, N = 148) and a sample of Russian adolescents (Study 3, N = 263). Finally, the adaptive version of the JaJ task was implemented on the basis of the underlying IRT model and evaluated with another sample of Russian adolescents (Study 4, N = 239). JaJ showed sufficient internal consistency and concurrent validity as indicated by significant and substantial correlations with established measures of working memory, spatial ability, non-verbal intelligence, and academic achievement. The findings suggest that JaJ is an efficient and reliable measure of VSWM from adolescent to adult age."
https://openalex.org/W4220731037,"The human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis proceeds through a multi phenotypic developmental cycle with each cell form specialized for different roles in pathogenesis. Understanding the mechanisms regulating this complex cycle has historically been hampered by limited genetic tools. In an effort to address this issue, we developed a translational control system to regulate gene expression in Chlamydia using a synthetic riboswitch. Here we demonstrate that translational control via a riboswitch can be used in combination with a wide range of promoters in C. trachomatis. The synthetic riboswitch E, inducible with theophylline, was used to replace the ribosome binding site of the synthetic promoter T5-lac, the native chlamydial promoter of the pgp4 plasmid gene and an anhydrotetracycline responsive promoter. In all cases the riboswitch inhibited translation, and high levels of protein expression was induced with theophylline. Combining the Tet transcriptional inducible promoter with the translational control of the riboswitch resulted in strong repression and allowed for the cloning and expression of the potent chlamydial regulatory protein, HctB. The ability to control the timing and strength of gene expression independently from promoter specificity is a new and important tool for studying chlamydial regulatory and virulence genes."

Kavar County is located at the center of Fars province in the southwest of Iran. Overall, 5236 adults aged 35-70 years old were invited to participate in the PKCS. From whom, 4997 people comprising 2419 men and 2578 women met the inclusion criteria and were recruited in the study (participation rate: 95.4%). This study is aimed to follow participants for at least 10 years; it is designed to perform all procedures similar to the primary phase including biological sampling, laboratory tests, physical examinations, and collecting general, nutritional, and medical data at the 5th and 10th years of follow-up. In addition, participants are annually followed-up by phone to acquire data on the history of hospitalization, any major diagnosis or death. At the enrollment phase, trained interviewers were responsible for obtaining general, nutritional, and medical data utilizing a 482-item questionnaire. The results of the baseline phase of this study show that the overweight category was the most prevalent BMI category among the registered participants (n = 2005, 40.14%). Also, almost one-third of Kavar adult population suffered from metabolic syndrome at the baseline phase (n = 1664, 33.30%). The rate of eighteen-month follow-up response was 100% in the PKCS. Hypertension (n = 116, 2.32%), cardiovascular outcomes (n = 33, 0.66%), and diabetes (n = 32, 0.64%) were the most prevalent new-onset NCDs during eighteen months of follow-up in the participants."
https://openalex.org/W4210705151,"Identifying protein complexes in protein-protein interaction (ppi) networks is often handled as a community detection problem, with algorithms generally relying exclusively on the network topology for discovering a solution. The advancement of experimental techniques on ppi has motivated the generation of many Gene Ontology (go) databases. Incorporating the functionality extracted from go with the topological properties from the underlying ppi network yield a novel approach to identify protein complexes. Additionally, most of the existing algorithms use global measures that operate on the entire network to identify communities. The result of using global metrics are large communities that are often not correlated with the functionality of the proteins. Moreover, ppi network analysis shows that most of the biological functions possibly lie between local neighbours in ppi networks, which are not identifiable with global metrics. In this paper, we propose a local community detection algorithm, (lcda-go), that uniquely exploits information of functionality from go combined with the network topology. lcda-go identifies the community of each protein based on the topological and functional knowledge acquired solely from the local neighbour proteins within the ppi network. Experimental results using the Krogan dataset demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms in most cases state-of-the-art approaches in assessment based on Precision, Sensitivity, and particularly Composite Score. We also deployed lcda, the local-topology based precursor of lcda-go, to compare with a similar state-of-the-art approach that exclusively incorporates topological information of ppi networks for community detection. In addition to the high quality of the results, one main advantage of lcda-go is its low computational time complexity."

The results highlight the significance of CSR on the completion of cross-border M&A. The robustness tests including changing estimation model, new measurements, propensity score matching, and instrumental variable tests show that the main results are consistent. Second, both formal and informal institutional distance have positive moderating effects of CSR on the completion of cross-border M&A."
https://openalex.org/W4210410675,"Age-friendly neighbourhoods seem to promote physical activity among older individuals. Physical activity is especially important for chronically ill individuals. In the Netherlands, older Surinamese individuals are more likely to have chronic diseases than are their native Dutch counterparts. This study examined relationships of neighbourhood characteristics with physical activity among older Surinamese individuals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Of 2749 potential participants, 697 (25%) community-dwelling older (age ≥ 70 years) Surinamese individuals living in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, completed a questionnaire on personal and neighbourhood characteristics between March and June 2020. Correlation and multilevel regression analyses were performed to identify associations between missing neighbourhood characteristics for ageing in place and physical activity.Scores for the neighbourhood domains communication and information (r = -0.099, p ≤ 0.05), community support and health services (r = -0.139, p ≤ 0.001), and respect and social inclusion (r = -0.141, p ≤ 0.001), correlated negatively with participants' PA. In the multilevel analysis, overall missing neighbourhood characteristics to age in place scores were associated negatively with physical activity (p ≤ 0.05).This study showed the importance of age-friendly neighbourhoods for physical activity among older Surinamese individuals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Our findings suggest that the neighbourhood plays an important role in supporting older individuals' leading of physically active lifestyles. Further research is needed to support the development of interventions to create age-friendly neighbourhoods."
https://openalex.org/W4210695108,"Public health officials have classified smoking as a risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity. Smokers generally have less trust in health experts than do nonsmokers, leading to reduced risk perceptions. This study addresses smokers' trust in information sources about COVID-19 and how trust is associated with perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity among smokers.A nationally representative sample of 1,223 current smokers were surveyed between October and November 2020, indicating their level of trust in COVID-19 information sources, and their perceptions of risk from COVID-19. Multiple differences in trustworthiness emerged; smokers trusted their personal doctor for information about COVID-19 more than other information sources, while news media were generally distrusted. In addition, the FDA was trusted less than the NIH and CDC. Several ""trust gaps"" were observed, indicating disparities in levels of trust associated with gender, ethnicity, education, and political orientation, which had the strongest association with trust of all factors. Political orientation was also a significant predictor of COVID-19 risk perceptions, but there was no independent effect of political orientation when accounting for trust, which was predictive of all risk perception outcomes.Trusted sources, such as personal doctors, may most effectively convey COVID-19 information across political orientations and sociodemographic groups. News media may be ineffective at informing smokers due to their low credibility. The results suggest that trust may explain the apparent effect of political orientation on COVID-19 risk perceptions. Implications for researchers, communication professionals, and policy makers are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4210368498,"Activation of the classical complement pathway plays a major role in regulating atherosclerosis progression, and it is believed to have both proatherogenic and atheroprotective effects. This study focused on C1q, the first protein in the classical pathway, and examined its potentialities of plaque progression and instability and its relationship with clinical outcomes. To assess the localization and quantity of C1q expression in various stages of atherosclerosis, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed using abdominal aortas from eight autopsy cases. C1q immunoreactivity in relation to plaque instability and clinical outcomes was also examined using directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) samples from 19 patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and 18 patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) and coronary aspirated specimens from 38 patients with acute myocardial infarction. C1q immunoreactivity was localized in the extracellular matrix, necrotic cores, macrophages and smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Western blotting and real-time PCR illustrated that C1q protein and mRNA expression was significantly higher in advanced lesions than in early lesions. Immunohistochemical analysis using DCA specimens revealed that C1q expression was significantly higher in ACS plaques than in SAP plaques. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis using thrombus aspiration specimens demonstrated that histopathological C1q in aspirated coronary materials could be an indicator of poor medical condition. Our results indicated that C1q is significantly involved in atherosclerosis progression and plaque instability, and it could be considered as one of the indicators of cardiovascular outcomes."

We aimed to explore beliefs associated with PrEP among TGW in the Southeastern U.S., framed by the Health Belief Model. HIV-negative TGW ≥18 years old in Alabama participated in virtual focus group discussions. Authors coded and amended transcripts to explore emerging themes. Between July-December 2020, 17 TGW participated in 4 sessions. Mean age was 28.1±8.5 years. Several themes were identified: frustration with conflation of transgender identity and HIV risk, inappropriate transgender representation in PrEP advertising, concerns for interactions between PrEP and hormone therapy, perception that PrEP is meant for cisgender men who have sex with men and limited trans-affirming healthcare. Nuanced messaging is necessary to properly educate and engage TGW in HIV prevention strategies including PrEP given the diversity of this population."
https://openalex.org/W4210529806,"Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are mathematical representations of metabolism that allow for in silico simulation of metabolic phenotypes and capabilities. A prerequisite for these predictions is an accurate representation of the biomolecular composition of the cell necessary for replication and growth, implemented in GEMs as the so-called biomass objective function (BOF). The BOF contains the metabolic precursors required for synthesis of the cellular macro- and micromolecular constituents (e.g. protein, RNA, DNA), and its composition is highly dependent on the particular organism, strain, and growth condition. Despite its critical role, the BOF is rarely constructed using specific measurements of the modeled organism, drawing the validity of this approach into question. Thus, there is a need to establish robust and reliable protocols for experimental condition-specific biomass determination. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a general pipeline for biomass quantification, evaluating its performance on Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 sampled during balanced exponential growth under controlled conditions in a batch-fermentor set-up. We significantly improve both the coverage and molecular resolution compared to previously published workflows, quantifying 91.6% of the biomass. Our measurements display great correspondence with previously reported measurements, and we were also able to detect subtle characteristics specific to the particular E. coli strain. Using the modified E. coli GEM i ML1515a, we compare the feasible flux ranges of our experimentally determined BOF with the original BOF, finding that the changes in BOF coefficients considerably affect the attainable fluxes at the genome-scale."

Monitoring and responding to community awareness, concern, and possible knowledge gaps are critical during public health emergencies. Here, we describe the review and analysis of micro-blogs posted on Sina-Weibo, China's largest social media platform, to develop and disseminate a Zika virus education campaign.We used CYYUN Voice Express' Weibo Spider tool and the search terms of ""Zhaika"" OR ""Zika"" OR ""Zikv"" to capture microblogs about Zika virus retrospectively from February 1 to December 31, 2016 and prospectively from June 1 to November 15, 2017. We described microblogs meeting our inclusion criteria by month and Zika virus outbreaks in Asia and by source (e.g., government agency, individual, or other). We identified common misleading or inaccurate content authored by individual micro-bloggers (i.e., not supported by available scientific evidence) through a qualitative review. We used this information to develop and disseminate health awareness material about the Zika virus through China CDC's 12320 Health Hotline Weibo account. An online survey was conducted to obtain feedback on the material.We captured 15,888 microblogs meeting our inclusion criteria. Zika-related microblogs peaked in September 2016, corresponding to news reports about the Zika outbreak in Singapore (August to November 2016). Most microblogs (12,994 [82%]) were authored by individual users, followed by media agencies (842 [5%]), businesses (829 [5%]), international organizations (370 [2%]), and Chinese government agencies (235 [1%]). Relevant microblogs primarily focused on clinical symptoms and health risks, modes of transmission, and actions taken by individuals to prevent infection and seek health care. Incorrect and/or mis-leading information from individual users concentrated on modes of transmission and possible treatments. The microblog ""#Zika is that far and this close"" health campaign was posted on Sina-Weibo and Baidu (Internet search engine in China) on September 18, 2016. Younger respondents (p-value = 0.01), and those with at least a college education (p-value = 0.03), were more likely than other respondents to consider the online campaign reliable and trustworthy.Routine review of Sina-Weibo and other social media platforms could enhance the ability of public health staff to effectively respond to community concerns and awareness during public health emergencies. Advancements of social media monitoring tools and staff training could help to promote health awareness during emergencies by directly addressing public perceptions and concerns. Various approaches may be needed to reach different at-risk populations, particularly older and less educated populations who may prefer more traditional modes of communication."
https://openalex.org/W4210589092,"International openness can affect regional innovation through more export opportunities, enhanced import competition and the spillover effects of foreign direct investment. Many studies have been conducted based on different countries for capturing the determinants of regional innovation, but very little literature is available with contradictory findings for the case of China. Based on 19 years' panel data of 31 Chinese provinces, this paper analyzes the impact of international openness on regional innovation measured by the number of patent grants. The positive effects of overall trade and a higher proportion of exports and imports to GDP are significant and robust across different model specifications, indicating that an increase in international openness can promote regional innovating activities in China. The causal relationship of all the variables depicted by path analysis matches the results of the system GMM model. Higher intellectual property protection provides each region with the opportunity to obtain economic benefits from innovation and then make a higher investment in R&D activities. Besides, the lag effect of regional innovation capability can also explain a large part of local innovating activities. In our subsample regressions, the positive effect of trade openness on innovation is majorly manifested in developed areas like eastern provinces."
https://openalex.org/W4210608055,"Phormidium lacuna is a naturally competent, filamentous cyanobacterium that belongs to the order Oscillatoriales. The filaments are motile on agar and other surfaces and display rapid lateral movements in liquid culture. Furthermore, they exhibit a photophobotactic response, a phototactic response towards light that is projected vertically onto the area covered by the culture. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena are unclear. We performed the first molecular studies on the motility of an Oscillatoriales member. We generated mutants in which a kanamycin resistance cassette (KanR) was integrated in the phytochrome gene cphA and in various genes of the type IV pilin apparatus. pilM, pilN, pilQ and pilT mutants were defective in gliding motility, lateral movements and photophobotaxis, indicating that type IV pili are involved in all three kinds of motility. pilB mutants were only partially blocked in terms of their responses. pilB is the proposed ATPase for expelling of the filament in type IV pili. The genome reveals proteins sharing weak pilB homology in the ATPase region, these might explain the incomplete phenotype. The cphA mutant revealed a significantly reduced photophobotactic response towards red light. Therefore, our results imply that CphA acts as one of several photophobotaxis photoreceptors or that it could modulate the photophobotaxis response."
https://openalex.org/W4210624811,"A culture-specific web-based food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess dietary intake in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) adult population was developed using data from the 2009-2010 national nutrition survey. The objective of this study was to assess the relative validity of the newly developed FFQ for use in the adult Emirati population (AE-FFQ), which contained a list of 139 food lines.A convenient sample of 60 (36 females and 24 males) adult Emiratis completed 3 non-consecutive 24HRs over a period of one month, followed by the AE-FFQ, which assessed the intake over the previous month. Relative validity was evaluated by comparing nutrient and food group intakes from the AE-FFQ with the average three 24HRs using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Spearman's correlation coefficients (CC), Bland-Altman analysis, and cross-classification.The AE-FFQ overestimated energy and most nutrients and food groups. Bland-Altman analysis showed significant proportional bias between the 2 methods. Deattenuated energy-adjusted Spearman correlation coefficients were poor to good ranging from 0.06 (iron) to 0.62 (fiber) for nutrients, 0.39 median value, and from -0.01 (cruciferous vegetables) to 0.64 (eggs) for food groups, 0.41 median value. A fairly acceptable agreement was obtained, with correct classification into the same or adjacent quartile ranging from 34% (vitamin B12) to 78% (pyridoxine), median 69% for nutrients and from 55% (diet soft drinks) to 87% (soft drinks), median 67% for food groups.The AE-FFQ is an acceptable tool for ranking UAE adults (aged 18 to 50) according to their dietary intake to investigate the role of Emirati dietary patterns on health and disease. Caution is needed for assessing absolute intake, however, given the bias observed in assessing group-level agreement."
https://openalex.org/W4210678326,"Background Fluoride has become widely used in dentistry because of its effectiveness in caries control. However, evidence indicates that excessive intake interferes with the metabolic processes of different tissues. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of long-term exposure to F on the parotid salivary gland of mice, from the analysis of oxidative, proteomic and genotoxic parameters. Materials and methods The animals received deionized water containing 0, 10 or 50 mg/L of F, as sodium fluoride, for 60 days. After, parotid glands were collected for analysis of oxidative biochemistry, global proteomic profile, genotoxicity assessment and histopathological analyses. Results The results revealed that exposure to fluoride interfered in the biochemical homeostasis of the parotid gland, with increased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species and reduced glutathione in the exposed groups; as well as promoted alteration of the glandular proteomic profile in these groups, especially in structural proteins and proteins related to oxidative stress. However, genotoxic assessment demonstrated that exposure to fluoride did not interfere with DNA integrity in these concentrations and durations of exposure. Also, it was not observed histopathological alterations in parotid gland. Conclusions Thus, our results suggest that long-term exposure to fluoride promoted modulation of the proteomic and biochemical profile in the parotid glands, without inducing damage to the genetic component. These findings reinforce the importance of rationalizing the use of fluorides to maximize their preventative effects while minimizing the environmental risks."

However, in most melanoma-prone families, the genetic etiology of cancer predisposition remains undetermined. The goal of this study was to identify rare genomic variants associated with cutaneous melanoma susceptibility in melanoma-prone families. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in 2 affected individuals of 5 melanoma-prone families negative for mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4, the major cutaneous melanoma risk genes. A total of 288 rare coding variants shared by the affected relatives of each family were identified, including 7 loss-of-function variants. By performing in silico analyses of gene function, biological pathways, and variant pathogenicity prediction, we underscored the putative role of several genes for melanoma risk, including previously described genes such as MYO7A and WRN, as well as new putative candidates, such as SERPINB4, HRNR, and NOP10. In conclusion, our data revealed rare germline variants in melanoma-prone families contributing with a novel set of potential candidate genes to be further investigated in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4210380092,"Evolutionary computing (EC) is an area of computer sciences and applied mathematics covering heuristic optimization algorithms inspired by evolution in Nature. EC extensively study all the variety of methods which were originally based on the principles of selectionism. As a result, many new algorithms and approaches, significantly more efficient than classical selectionist schemes, were found. This is especially true for some families of special problems. There are strong arguments to believe that EC approaches are quite suitable for modeling and numerical analysis of those methods of synthetic biology and biotechnology that are known as in vitro evolution. Therefore, it is natural to expect that the new algorithms and approaches developed in EC can be effectively applied in experiments on the directed evolution of biological macromolecules. According to the John Holland's Schema theorem, the effective evolutionary search in genetic algorithms (GA) is provided by identifying short schemata of high fitness which in the further search recombine into the larger building blocks (BBs) with higher and higher fitness. The multimodularity of functional biological macromolecules and the preservation of already found modules in the evolutionary search have a clear analogy with the BBs in EC. It seems reasonable to try to transfer and introduce the methods of EC, preserving BBs and essentially accelerating the search, into experiments on in vitro evolution. We extend the key instrument of the Holland's theory, the Royal Roads fitness function, to problems of the in vitro evolution (Biological Royal Staircase, BioRS, functions). The specific version of BioRS developed in this publication arises from the realities of experimental evolutionary search for (DNA-) RNA-devices (aptazymes). Our numerical tests showed that for problems with the BioRS functions, simple heuristic algorithms, which turned out to be very effective for preserving BBs in GA, can be very effective in in vitro evolution approaches. We are convinced that such algorithms can be implemented in modern methods of in vitro evolution to achieve significant savings in time and resources and a significant increase in the efficiency of evolutionary search."
https://openalex.org/W4210391254,"Background/Aims Organ failure in patients with acute decompensation (AD) is a defining characteristic of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). However, the clinical features of AD during the long-term clinical course of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still poorly understood. This study aimed to clarify features and impact of AD/ACLF on the prognosis of patients after treatment for HCC. Methods This retrospective study enrolled 556 consecutive patients who were initially diagnosed with HCC, and analyses were conducted taking into account HCC treatment type, HCC stage, and presence or absence of cirrhosis. Results During follow-up, 299 patients with AD were hospitalized. AD occurrence is closely related to prognosis, regardless of the presence or absence of cirrhosis and HCC stage, and early-onset AD (within 90 days after HCC treatment) has negative impact on prognosis. In the intermediate-advanced–stage group, surgical resection had a positive impact on AD incidence post-treatment. After systemic therapy for HCC, renal impairment was the predictive factors for AD development. The 28/90-day mortality rate was higher among 41 cases (13.7%) with AD who exhibited ACLF as compared with cases without ACLF. AD without cirrhosis had similar ACLF incidence and short-term mortality, compared to AD with cirrhosis. The prognostic model using a decision-tree–based approach, which includes ACLF, bilirubin level, HCC progression, and MELD score is useful for predicting 90- or 28-day mortality after AD diagnosis. Conclusions Careful management of patients with HCC who are hospitalized with AD is necessary, considering ACLF, HCC progression, and liver function."
https://openalex.org/W4210431009,"Induction of labor is a medical iatrogenic stimulation of uterine contraction before the spontaneous onset of labor to achieve vaginal delivery. It is an increasingly being done obstetric procedure throughout the world and associated with poorer outcomes when compared with spontaneous labor. The published evidence is limited in Ethiopia including the study area. Therefore, this study was aimed at assessing the magnitude of failed induction and associated factors among pregnant women who were admitted to the labor ward of Adama hospital medical college.Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 293 women who were eligible for induction using systematic random sampling. The data were collected from 1st January to 30th April 2020 by face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire and extraction from a maternal chart. Then data was entered into Epi-data version 4.6 and analyzed using Statistical Product and Service Solution version 23. Descriptive statistics were performed to describe the study population. Logistic regression (bivariate and multivariable) analysis was conducted to identify associated factors. The association was expressed in odds ratio with 95% confidence interval and P-value <0.05 was used as cut-off points to declare significance in the final model.This study showed that the prevalence of failed induction was 20.5% (95% CI: (15.7-25.3%)). The odds of failed induction in unfavorable bishop score were 4.05 higher than the odds in favorable bishop [AOR = 4.05 95%CI (1.19-13.77)]. The odds of failed induction in an intact membrane were 2.05 higher than the ruptured membrane. [AOR = 2.05, 95%CI (1.06-3.98)]. The odds of failed induction in primigravida were 2.33 higher than the odds in the multiparous women [AOR = 2.33, 95%CI (1.26-4.29)].This study revealed that the magnitude of failed induction was higher when compared to other similar findings. Bishop scores, membrane status, and parity were significantly associated factors with failed induction. Preparation of the cervix before commencing induction is recommended to improve induction success."

We hypothesize that sGC stimulator Compound 1 can enhance NO signaling, reduce proteinuria in a diabetic nephropathy preclinical model with diminished NO bioavailability and increased oxidized sGC. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of sGC stimulator Compound 1 on the renal effect in obese ZSF1 (ZSF1 OB) rats.The sGC stimulator Compound 1, the standard of care agent Enalapril, and a combination of Compound 1 and Enalapril were administered chronically to obese ZSF1 rats for 6 months. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, creatinine clearance for glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary protein excretion to creatinine ratio (UPCR), and urinary albumin excretion ratio (UACR) were determined during the study. The histopathology of glomerular and interstitial lesions was assessed at the completion of the study.While both Compound 1 and Enalapril significantly reduced blood pressure, the combination of Compound 1 and Enalapril normalized blood pressure levels. Compound 1 improved eGFR and reduced UPCR and UACR. A combination of Enalapril and Compound 1 resulted in a marked reduction in UPCR and UACR and improved GFR.The sGC stimulator Compound 1 as a monotherapy slowed renal disease progression, and a combination of the sGC stimulator with Enalapril provided greater renal protection in a rodent model of diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W4210709099,"Men are underrepresented in family planning (FP) research, and despite the widespread promotion of FP through mass media, there is no systematic evaluation on how mass media exposure influences their FP knowledge, attitudes and behavior. Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 31 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), collected between 2010 and 2019, this paper examines the associations between three types of traditional mass media (radio, television and print) with FP knowledge, attitudes and method choices among reproductive age men in SSA, relative to other socio-cultural factors. Estimates to quantify the relative contribution of each type of mass media, relative to other evidence-based socio-cultural influences on FP outcomes, were derived using the Shorrocks-Shapley decomposition. Radio exposure had the largest impact on FP knowledge, attitudes and method choice, accounting for 26.1% of the variance in FP knowledge, followed by Television (21.4%) and education attainment (20.7%). Mass media exposure had relatively minimal impact on FP method choice, and between the three types of mass media, television (8%) had the largest influence on FP method choice. Print media had comparatively lesser impact on FP knowledge (8%), attitudes (6.2%) and method choice (3.2%). Findings suggest that mass media exposure has positive influences on FP knowledge, attitudes and method choice but its influence on FP knowledge, attitudes and method choice is smaller relative to other socio-cultural factors such as education, household wealth and marital status. As such, efforts to increase FP uptake in Sub-Saharan Africa should take into consideration the impact of these socio-cultural economic factors."
https://openalex.org/W4210722699,"Sepsis is associated with high platelet turnover and elevated levels of immature platelets. Changes in the platelet transcriptome and the specific impact of immature platelets on the platelet transcriptome remain unclear. Thus, this study sought to address whether and how elevated levels of immature platelets affect the platelet transcriptome in patients with sepsis.Blood samples were obtained from patients with sepsis requiring vasopressor therapy (n = 8) and from a control group of patients with stable coronary artery disease and otherwise similar demographic characteristics (n = 8). Immature platelet fraction (IPF) was determined on a Sysmex XE 2100 analyser and platelet function was tested by impedance aggregometry. RNA from leukocyte-depleted platelets was used for transcriptome analysis by Next Generation Sequencing integrating the use of unique molecular identifiers.IPF (median [interquartile range]) was significantly elevated in sepsis patients (6.4 [5.3-8.7] % vs. 3.6 [2.6-4.6] %, p = 0.005). Platelet function testing revealed no differences in adenosine diphosphate- or thrombin receptor activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation between control and sepsis patients. Putative circular RNA transcripts were decreased in platelets from septic patients. Leukocyte contamination defined by CD45 abundance levels in RNA-sequencing was absent in both groups. Principal component analysis of transcripts showed only partial overlap of clustering with IPF levels. RNA sequencing showed up-regulation of 524 and down-regulation of 118 genes in platelets from sepsis patients compared to controls. Upregulated genes were mostly related to catabolic processes and protein translation. Comparison to published platelet transcriptomes showed a large overlap of changes observed in sepsis and COVID-19 but not with reticulated platelets from healthy donors.Patients with sepsis appear to have a less degraded platelet transcriptome as indicated by increased levels of immature platelets and decreased levels of putative circular RNA transcripts. The present data suggests that increased protein translation is a characteristic mechanism of systemic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4210506336,"This agent-based model contributes to a theory of corporate culture in which company performance and employees' behaviour result from the interaction between financial incentives, motivational factors and endogenous social norms. Employees' personal values are the main drivers of behaviour. They shape agents' decisions about how much of their working time to devote to individual tasks, cooperative, and shirking activities. The model incorporates two aspects of the management style, analysed both in isolation and combination: (i) monitoring efforts affecting intrinsic motivation, i.e. the company is either trusting or controlling, and (ii) remuneration schemes affecting extrinsic motivation, i.e. individual or group rewards. The simulations show that financial incentives can (i) lead to inefficient levels of cooperation, and (ii) reinforce value-driven behaviours, amplified by emergent social norms. The company achieves the highest output with a flat wage and a trusting management. Employees that value self-direction highly are pivotal, since they are strongly (de-)motivated by the management style."
https://openalex.org/W4210671329,"High-quality forensic documentation can improve justice outcomes for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, but there are limited tools to assess documentation data quality. This study aimed to develop and validate a data quality assessment index to objectively assess clinician documentation across the 26 key elements of the standardized forensic evidence forms used in Kenya.Informed by prior quality assessment tools, an initial draft of the index was developed. Feedback from Kenya- and U.S.-based clinicians and human rights experts was solicited and incorporated into the draft index in an iterative fashion. Two raters independently employed the finalized Physicians for Human Rights Data Quality Index to assess and score the quality of documentation across 31 clinician-completed forms. Inter-rater reliability was determined using Cohen kappa (к) coefficients.The Index was found to have substantial overall reliability. Of the 26 documentation items, the Index had a perfect (к = 1.0) and almost perfect (к = 0.81-0.99) level of inter-rater agreement across 17 (65.4%) and 5 (19.2%) items, respectively. On a low-to-high documentation quality scale of 0 to 2, the majority of items (n = 19, 73.1%) had a mean documentation quality score >1.5-2.Quality assurance of forensic documentation is an essential component of post-sexual assault care. To our knowledge, this is the first validated quality-assessment tool in the peer-reviewed literature for sexual assault documentation and may be a promising strategy to enhance the quality of sexual assault documentation in other settings, locally, regionally, and internationally."
https://openalex.org/W4210703747,"Undernutrition among children is one of the leading major public health problems and about 49.5 million children were wasted worldwide. Asia and African countries contributed 69% and 27.2% of wasting respectively. In Ethiopia, 7% of children were wasted and 1% was severely wasted. Although Ethiopia has achieved remarkable progress in reducing under-five mortality and designed multi-dimensional approaches to address malnutrition, the data on acute malnutrition among children in the study setting is limited. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the prevalence of acute malnutrition and associated factors among 6-59-month-old children.Community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted at Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia. A total of 293 study participants were selected using a systematic sampling technique. Data were collected using structured and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaires by face-to-face interview. Data entry and analysis were made using Epi Data version 4.6 and Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 24 respectively. Descriptive statistical analysis and some of the statistical tests like the odds ratio were carried out. Both Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis with 95% confidence interval was carried out to identify associated factors and variables with P value < 0.05 were taken as statistically significant.The prevalence of wasting among children aged from 6-59 months in this study was 14.7% (95% CI: 10.9, 18.8). After controlling for all possible confounding factors, the result revealed that age of children between 6-11 months [AOR = 2.78(95% CI: 1.67, 6.19)], caregivers who were unable to read and write [AOR = 2.23 (95% CI: 1.04, 5.34)], presence of diarrheal disease in the past two weeks [AOR = 1.68 (95% CI: 1.23, 5.89)] and mothers who had a history of poor handwashing practice before food preparation and child feeding [AOR = 2.64(95% CI: 1.52, 4.88)] were found to be significantly associated with wasting.The study findings indicate that respondents' wasting was mainly affected by age of the child, educational status of caregivers, presence of diarrheal disease and hand washing practice of the mother. Providing acceptable, quality and honorable care for all children is very crucial to prevent child wasting and proper handwashing during breastfeeding and food handling is recommended and interventions aimed at improving maternal health and access to health care services for children are urgently needed."

Enhancing optimal birth interval is one of the key strategies to promote the health status of mothers and their children. However, factors affecting short birth intervals have not been identified in the study area and region. This study was aimed to assess determinants of short birth interval practice among reproductive women in Farta woreda, Ethiopia, 2019.Community based unmatched case-control study design was conducted from February to March 2019. The sample size of 303 (101 case and 202 controls) was included by using multistage sampling and then study participants were selected by simple random sampling technique. The data was collected by structured and pre-tested face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaires from the selected respondents. The collected data were entered with Epi-Data version 4.2 and analyzed by using SPSS version 23 software. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the association.

https://openalex.org/W4210272200,"The immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-L1 and PD-L2 have a substantial contribution to cancer immunotherapy including breast cancer. Microarray expression profiling identified several molecular subtypes, namely luminal-type (with a good-prognosis), HER2-type (with an intermediate-prognosis), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-type (with a poor-prognosis). We found that PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA expressions were highly expressed in TNBC-type cell lines (HCC1937, MDA-MB-231), moderately expressed in HER2-type cell line (SK-BR-3), and poorly expressed in luminal-type cell lines (MDA-MB-361, MCF7). The PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in SK-BR-3 cells, but not those in HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231 cells, decreased by nicotine stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, nicotine treatment decreased the phosphorylation of Akt in SK-BR-3 cells, but not in other cell lines. These results show that nicotine regulates the expression of immune checkpoint molecules, PD-L1 and PD-L2, via inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. This findings may provide the new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of breast cancer."

During the incremental tests, maximum heart rate (HRmax), maximal rating of perceived exertion (RPEmax), and peak lactate concentration (LApeak) were determined.The results showed significant difference between the Vpeak_TF and Vpeak_T (18.1 ± 1.2 vs. 19.2 ± 1.5 km·h-1, respectively), as well as the total time of the tests, the distance traveled and the RPEmax determined during the tests. A high correlation was observed between the Vpeak values (r = 0.94), and between Vpeak_TF and Vpeak_T with 10-km running performance (r = -0.95 vs. r = -0.89, respectively).The good agreement and association with Vpeak_T and high correlation with 10-km running performance demonstrate that the novel track field test is efficient for Vpeak_TF determination."

Machine learning (e.g., deep learning) is often employed to automate the extraction of information from these data, such as cell counting, cell type classification and image segmentation. However, the effects of different imaging methods on the accuracy of image processing have not been examined systematically. We studied the effects of different imaging methods on the performance of machine learning-based cell type classifiers. We observed lymphoid-primed multipotential progenitor (LMPP) and pro-B cells using three imaging methods: differential interference contrast (DIC), phase contrast (Ph) and bright-field (BF). We examined the classification performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with each of them and their combinations. CNNs achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of ~0.9, which was significantly better than when the classifier used only cell size or cell contour shape as input. However, no significant differences were found between imaging methods and focal positions."
https://openalex.org/W4210366086,"Attributing affectively neutral mental states such as thoughts (i.e., cool theory of mind, cool ToM) to others appears to be rooted in different processes than the ones involved in attributing affectively charged mental states such as emotions (i.e., hot ToM) to others. However, no study has investigated the developmental pattern of hot and cool ToM abilities using a similar task and the relative contribution of cool and hot inhibitory control (IC) to cool and hot ToM development. To do so, we tested 112 children aged 3.5 to 6.5 years on a cool and a hot version of a ToM task and on a cool and hot version of an IC task. We found that hot ToM abilities developed more rapidly than cool ToM. Importantly, we found that hot IC abilities mediated the relation between age and hot ToM abilities. Taken together, our results suggest that the ability to attribute emotions to others develops more rapidly than the ability to attribute thoughts and that the growing efficiency of hot ToM with age is specifically rooted in the growing efficiency of hot IC abilities."

Yet, while housing prices are systematically recorded, few accurate data sets on rents are available. In this paper, we present a new data set describing local rental markets in France based on online ads collected through to webscraping. Comparison with alternate sources reveals that online ads provide a non biased picture of rental markets and allow coverage of the whole territory. We then estimate hedonic models for prices and rents and document the spatial variations in rent-price ratios. We show that rents do not increase as much as prices in the tightest housing markets. We use our dataset to estimate the market rent of each transaction and of social dwellings. In the latter case,this allows us to estimate the in-kind benefit received by social tenants which is mainly driven by the level of private rent in their municipality."

The proximity of the municipality to the local community and its knowledge of available resources, can be crucial in easing the impact of any disaster. This study aimed to document the range of preparedness/reactivity of municipalities as COVID-19 swept through Lebanon. A qualitative case study was implemented to explore municipal response to control the epidemic, using in-depth semi-structured interviews with twenty-seven stakeholders from nine municipalities across all governorates in Lebanon. In each municipality, participants included mayors/deputy mayors, available members of municipal councils, prominent community leaders, health care professionals, and managers of local NGOs. The collected data were analyzed using the comparative thematic analysis. The socioecological model was adopted to illustrate the dynamic interplay between the barriers and facilitators at all ecological levels. The response to the pandemic differed significantly in volume and nature among different municipalities across regions, with rural areas clearly disadvantaged in terms of adequacy and completeness of response. Barriers consistently mentioned by most municipalities included economic collapse and poverty, shortage in resources, lack of support from the central government, stigma, lack of awareness, underreporting, flaws in the MOPH surveillance system, impeded accessibility to healthcare services, limited number and weak role of municipal police, increased mental illnesses, and political patronage, favoritism, and interference. On the other hand, increased donations, community engagement, social support and empathy, sufficient human resources, the effective role of healthcare systems, and good governance were identified as key facilitators. The socioecological model identified several multi-level facilitators and loopholes which can be addressed through a suggested strategic ""roadmap"" providing evidence-based interventions for future epidemics. It is crucial meanwhile that the central government strengthens the administrative and financial resources of municipalities in preparing and rapidly deploying the expected optimal response."
https://openalex.org/W4210510620,"Power quality issues, which are mainly due to power electronic devices that are invariably used not only in domestic sector but also industries, still persist despite various mitigation strategies. The slow but steady invasion of Electric vehicles or Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) in recent years, in the automobile sector, adds woes to the power quality issues further. Majority of the charging systems presently available for charging PEVs are unidirectional and so supports Grid to Vehicle (G2V) mode only as the bidirectional integration of those vehicles into the grid is still a big challenge. However, Vehicle to Grid (V2G) support mode also deserves an equal importance as the PEV charger with V2G mode of operation is capable of supporting grid functionalities also, on need basis, which largely depends on the power circuit topology and controller topology it uses. Hence, in this work an improved controller topology has been designed and developed to alleviate the burdens on the grid. Support for active power demand, voltage swell and sag mitigation, in addition to catering its prime objective of charging the batteries are focused. A Second Order Generalized Integrator Phase Locked Loop (SOGI-PLL) based controller has been developed and implemented in the proposed work to improve the transient response, apart from controlling the steady-state oscillations of the grid to which it is connected to. A single phase non-isolated bidirectional PEV charger with proposed control topology has been simulated in MATLAB-Simulink for vehicle support and grid support mode of operations. The simulation proves the satisfactory operation of the proposed charger in the four quarters of active power and reactive power (PQ) plane, thus complies the design objectives of bidirectional power flow. The results obtained from the simulation show improved performance in terms of DC link voltage overshoot, steady-state oscillations, overall efficiency, voltage and current Total Harmonic Distortions (THD)."

CD4+ counts were collected from participants' medical records. Plasma samples were tested for aflatoxin B1 albumin adducts, hepatitis B surface antigen, and HIV viral load. Participants were separated into high and low aflatoxin groups based on the median aflatoxin B1 albumin adduct level of 10.4 pg/ml for data analysis.Participants with high aflatoxin B1 albumin adduct levels had lower mean CD4 at baseline and at each follow-up period. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that higher baseline aflatoxin B1 adduct levels were associated with statistically significant lower CD4 counts (est = -66.5, p = 0.043). Not starting ART and low/middle socioeconomic status were associated with higher CD4 counts (est = 152.2, p<0.001) and (est = 86.3, p = 0.027), respectively.Consistent correlations of higher aflatoxin B1 adduct levels with lower CD4 over time indicate that there is an independent early and prolonged effect of aflatoxin on CD4 even with the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. The prospective study design, evaluation of baseline and follow-up measures, extensive control for potential confounders, and utilization of objective measures of aflatoxin exposure and CD4 count provide compelling evidence for a strong epidemiologic association that deserves careful attention in HIV care and treatment programs."
https://openalex.org/W4210769006,"Understanding what factors influence postpartum contraceptive use among young people (ages 15-24 years) is important since this group often has closely spaced and unintended births. Using secondary data gathered for an evaluation of a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded initiative designed to increase modern contraceptive use in select urban areas of Nigeria, we determine the direct and indirect effects of community beliefs and attitudes on adolescent and youth postpartum contraceptive method choice. Our statistical methods control for the endogenous timing of the initiation of sexual activity and the timing and number of births to each respondent by simultaneous estimation of equations for these choices with the choice of postpartum contraceptive method. We find that community beliefs and attitudes have important effects on our primary outcome of postpartum contraceptive use and we quantify the size of both direct and indirect effects on postpartum contraceptive method choice using simulations. The findings from this study can be used to inform programs seeking to increase young women's postpartum contraceptive use for healthy spacing and timing of births."
https://openalex.org/W4210784152,"Household water food and energy (WFE) expenditures, reflect respective survival needs for which their resources and social welfare are inter-related. We developed a policy driven quantitative decision-making strategy (DMS) to address the domain geospatial entities’ (nodes or administrative districts) of the WFE nexus, assumed to be information linked across the domain nodal-network. As investment in one of the inter-dependent nexus components may cause unexpected shock to the others, we refer to the WFE normalized expenditures product (Volume) as representing the nexus holistic measure. Volume rate conforms to Boltzman entropy suggesting directed information from high to low Volume nodes. Our hypothesis of causality-driven directional information is exemplified by a sharp price increase in wheat and rice, for U.S. and Thailand respectively, that manifests its impact on the temporal trend of Israel’s administrative districts of the WFE expenditures. Welfare mass (WM) represents the node’s Volume combined with its income and population density. Formulation is suggested for the nodal-network WM temporal balance where each node is scaled by a human-factor (HF) for subjective attitude and a superimposed nodal source/sink term manifesting policy decision. Our management tool is based on two sequential governance processes: one starting with historical data mapping the mean temporal nodal Volumes to single out extremes, and the second is followed by WM balance simulation predicting nodal-network outcome of policy driven targeting. In view of the proof of concept by model simulations in in our previous research, here HF extends the model and attention is devoted to emphasize how the current developed decision-making approach categorically differs from existing nexus related methods. The first governance process is exemplified demonstrating illustrations for Israel’s districts. Findings show higher expenditures for water and lower for energy, and maps pointing to extremes in districts’ mean temporal Volume. Illustrations of domain surfaces for that period enable assessment of relative inclination trends of the normalized Water, Food and Energy directions continuum assembled from time stations, and evolution trends for each of the WFE components."
https://openalex.org/W4210813135,"Background The purpose of this study was to develop a DTI-based method to quantitatively assess fiber angles and changes therein in leg muscles in order to facilitate longitudinal studies on muscle fiber architectural adaptations in healthy subjects. Methods The upper legs of five volunteers were scanned twice on the same day. The right lower legs of five volunteers were scanned twice with the ankle in three positions, i . e . -15° dorsiflexion, 0° neutral position, and 30° plantarflexion. The MRI protocols consisted of a noise scan, a 3-point mDixon scan and a DTI scan. Fiber-angle color maps were generated for four muscles in the upper legs and two muscles in the lower leg. Voxel-wise fiber angles (θ) were calculated from the angle between the principal eigenvector of the diffusion tensor and a reference line defined between the origo and insertion points of each muscle. Bland-Altman analysis, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV%), minimal detectable change (MDC), standard error (SE) and Friedman test were used for assessing the feasibility of this method and in order to have an indication of the repeatability and the sensitivity. Results Bland-Altman analysis showed good repeatability (CV%&lt;10 and 0.7≤ICC≤0.9) with exception of the Tibialis Anterior (TA) muscle in dorsiflexion position(CV%: 12.2) and the Semitendinosus (ST) muscle (left leg) (CV%: 11.4). The best repeatability metrics were found for the SOL muscle in neutral position (CV%: 2.6). Changes in average θ in TA and SOL with ankle positions were observed in accordance with expected agonist and antagonist functions of both muscles. For example, for the anterior left compartment the change in fiber angle Δθ with respect to the neutral position Δθ = -1.6° ± 0.8° and 2.2° ± 2.8° (p = 0.008), for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, respectively. Conclusion Our method facilitates fast inspection and quantification of muscle fiber angles in the lower and upper leg muscles in rest and detection of changes in lower-leg muscle fiber angles with varying ankle angles."
https://openalex.org/W4210814709,"A transframe region within HIV-1 Gag-Pol (referred to as p6* or p6pol), directly linked to the protease (PR) N-terminus, plays a pivotal role in modulating PR activation. To identify specific p6* residues involved in PR activation, we created a series of p6* mutants by making substitutions for conserved p6* residues. Our results indicate that some p6* mutants were defective in terms of virus infectivity, despite displaying a wild-type virus particle processing pattern. Mutations at p6* F8 reduced virus infectivity associated with insufficient virus processing, due in part to impaired PR maturation and RT packaging. Our data strongly suggest that conserved Phe (F) residues at position 8 of p6* are involved in the PR maturation process."
https://openalex.org/W4225859710,"This paper investigates experimentally the relationship between inequality in endowment and deception. Our basic design is adopted from Gneezy (2005): two players interact in a deception game. It is common knowledge that player 1 has private information about the payoffs for both players of two alternative actions. Player 1 sends a message to player 2, indicating which alternative putatively will end up in a higher payoff for player 2. The message, which can either be true or false, does not affect the payoffs of the players. Player 2 has no information about the payoffs. However, player 2 selects one of the two alternatives A or B, which is payoff-relevant for both players. Our paper adds value to the literature by extending Gneezy (2005) in two ways. First, we systematically vary the initial endowment of players 1 and 2 (common knowledge to both of them). Second, we do not limit ourselves to the standard population of university students but also recruit chess players that are not enrolled in any degree program. Doing so, we want to find out if our results remain robust over a non-standard subject population which is known to be experienced to some extent in strategic interactions. Our main findings are: (i) non-students behave more honestly than students, (ii) students are more likely to trust the opponent's message, and (iii) students and non-students behave differently to variation in initial endowment."
https://openalex.org/W4226085339,"There is increasing awareness of the need for pre- and post-doctoral professional development and career guidance, however many academic institutions are only beginning to build out these functional roles. As a graduate career educator, accessing vast silos and resources at a university and with industry-partners can be daunting, yet collaboration and network development are crucial to the success of any career and professional development office. To better inform and direct these efforts, forty-five stakeholders external and internal to academic institutions were identified and interviewed to gather perspectives on topics critical to career development offices. Using a stakeholder engagement visualization tool developed by the authors, strengths and weaknesses can be assessed. General themes from interviews with internal and external stakeholders are discussed to provide various stakeholder subgroup perspectives to help prepare for successful interactions. Benefits include increased engagement and opportunities to collaborate, and to build or expand graduate career development offices."
https://openalex.org/W4210382903,"Background Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) who attend STI clinics represent an easily accessible population for promoting HIV prevention interventions. We examined characteristics of gbMSM STI clinic attendees to identify those who could most benefit from pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Setting GbMSM STI clinic attendees in British Columbia (BC), Canada Methods A clinical electronic charting system of STI clinics in BC was used to identify gbMSM from 2004 to 2017. Incident HIV cases were defined as testers who had at least one HIV-negative test and a subsequent HIV-positive test. Seroconversion rates were calculated by risk factor variables and by year. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent predictors of HIV seroconversion. Results There were 9,038 gbMSM included, of whom 257 HIV seroconverted over the study period and 8,781 remained negative HIV testers, contributing 650.8 and 29,591.0 person-years to the analysis, respectively. The overall rate of seroconversion was 0.85 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.75–0.96). Incidence rates were higher among patients reporting &gt;5 partners in the previous six months, inconsistent condom use, or having a partner living with HIV and who had a previous or concurrent diagnosis of rectal gonorrhea or rectal chlamydia. gbMSM presenting with two STIs such as rectal gonorrhea and syphilis (3.59/100 person-years [95%CI: 2.33–5.22]) or rectal chlamydia and syphilis (3.01/100 person-years [95%CI: 2.00–4.29]) had the highest incidence rates. Conclusion gbMSM with preceding or concurrent rectal STI diagnoses or syphilis had higher rates of HIV seroconversion. The data support the inclusion of specific STI diagnoses as an indication for PrEP."
https://openalex.org/W4210460482,"Cost and safety are critical factors in the oil and gas industry for optimizing wellbore trajectory, which is a constrained and nonlinear optimization problem. In this work, the wellbore trajectory is optimized using the true measured depth, well profile energy, and torque. Numerous metaheuristic algorithms were employed to optimize these objectives by tuning 17 constrained variables, with notable drawbacks including decreased exploitation/exploration capability, local optima trapping, non-uniform distribution of non-dominated solutions, and inability to track isolated minima. The purpose of this work is to propose a modified multi-objective cellular spotted hyena algorithm (MOCSHOPSO) for optimizing true measured depth, well profile energy, and torque. To overcome the aforementioned difficulties, the modification incorporates cellular automata (CA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). By adding CA, the SHO's exploration phase is enhanced, and the SHO's hunting mechanisms are modified with PSO's velocity update property. Several geophysical and operational constraints have been utilized during trajectory optimization and data has been collected from the Gulf of Suez oil field. The proposed algorithm was compared with the standard methods (MOCPSO, MOSHO, MOCGWO) and observed significant improvements in terms of better distribution of non-dominated solutions, better-searching capability, a minimum number of isolated minima, and better Pareto optimal front. These significant improvements were validated by analysing the algorithms in terms of some statistical analysis, such as IGD, MS, SP, and ER. The proposed algorithm has obtained the lowest values in IGD, SP and ER, on the other side highest values in MS. Finally, an adaptive neighbourhood mechanism has been proposed which showed better performance than the fixed neighbourhood topology such as L5, L9, C9, C13, C21, and C25. Hopefully, this newly proposed modified algorithm will pave the way for better wellbore trajectory optimization."
https://openalex.org/W4210793453,"Low serum progranulin (PGRN) is known to be associated with granulin ( GRN ) gene mutation and T alleles of GRN rs5848 polymorphism. However, there have been only a few Asian studies exploring these. We investigated the serum PGRN levels, rs5848 genotypes, and their relations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers in the Korean population. Serum PGRN levels, GRN rs5848 polymorphism, and GRN mutations were evaluated in 239 participants (22 cognitively unimpaired participants and 217 patients with neurodegenerative diseases). CSF AD biomarkers were also evaluated in 214 participants. There was no significant difference in the serum PGRN levels among the diagnostic groups. We could not find any GRN mutation carrier in our sample. The differences in the frequencies of the rs5848 genotypes among the clinical groups or the effects of the rs5848 genotypes on serum PGRN were not observed. There was no correlation between the serum PGRN level or rs5848 genotype and CSF AD biomarkers. Neither the T allele nor the TT genotype had an effect on the development of AD. Our results showed that serum PGRN levels were not associated with rs5848 genotypes, indicating that multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms might affect PGRN concentrations in an ethnicity-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W4225854124,"Knowledge-based approaches use the statistics collected from protein data-bank structures to estimate effective interaction potentials between amino acid pairs. Empirical relations are typically employed that are based on the crucial choice of a reference state associated to the null interaction case. Despite their significant effectiveness, the physical interpretation of knowledge-based potentials has been repeatedly questioned, with no consensus on the choice of the reference state. Here we use the fact that the Flory theorem, originally derived for chains in a dense polymer melt, holds also for chain fragments within the core of globular proteins, if the average over buried fragments collected from different non-redundant native structures is considered. After verifying that the ensuing Gaussian statistics, a hallmark of effectively non-interacting polymer chains, holds for a wide range of fragment lengths, although with significant deviations at short spatial scales, we use it to define a 'bona fide' reference state. Notably, despite the latter does depend on fragment length, deviations from it do not. This allows to estimate an effective interaction potential which is not biased by the presence of correlations due to the connectivity of the protein chain. We show how different sequence-independent effective statistical potentials can be derived using this approach by coarse-graining the protein representation at varying levels. The possibility of defining sequence-dependent potentials is explored."
