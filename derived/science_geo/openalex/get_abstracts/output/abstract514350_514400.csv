https://openalex.org/W1994553956,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in the perivascular niche of many organs, including kidney, lung, liver, and heart, although their roles in these tissues are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Gli1 marks perivascular MSC-like cells that substantially contribute to organ fibrosis. In vitro, Gli1(+) cells express typical MSC markers, exhibit trilineage differentiation capacity, and possess colony-forming activity, despite constituting a small fraction of the platelet-derived growth factor-β (PDGFRβ)(+) cell population. Genetic lineage tracing analysis demonstrates that tissue-resident, but not circulating, Gli1(+) cells proliferate after kidney, lung, liver, or heart injury to generate myofibroblasts. Genetic ablation of these cells substantially ameliorates kidney and heart fibrosis and preserves ejection fraction in a model of induced heart failure. These findings implicate perivascular Gli1(+) MSC-like cells as a major cellular origin of organ fibrosis and demonstrate that these cells may be a relevant therapeutic target to prevent solid organ dysfunction after injury."
https://openalex.org/W1991481310,"Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the concordance between claims records in the National Health Insurance Research Database and patient self-reports on clinical diagnoses, medication use, and health system utilization. Methods In this study, we used the data of 15,574 participants collected from the 2005 Taiwan National Health Interview Survey. We assessed positive agreement, negative agreement, and Cohen's kappa statistics to examine the concordance between claims records and patient self-reports. Results Kappa values were 0.43, 0.64, and 0.61 for clinical diagnoses, medication use, and health system utilization, respectively. Using a strict algorithm to identify the clinical diagnoses recorded in claims records could improve the negative agreement; however, the effect on positive agreement and kappa was diverse across various conditions. Conclusion We found that the overall concordance between claims records in the National Health Insurance Research Database and patient self-reports in the Taiwan National Health Interview Survey was moderate for clinical diagnosis and substantial for both medication use and health system utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2108461537,"Technical complications are a known hazard in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vvECMO). Identifying these complications and predictive factors indicating a developing system-exchange was the goal of the study.Retrospective study on prospectively collected data of technical complications including 265 adult patients (Regensburg ECMO Registry, 2009-2013) with acute respiratory failure treated with vvECMO. Alterations in blood flow resistance, gas transfer capability, hemolysis, coagulation and hemostasis parameters were evaluated in conjunction with a system-exchange in all patients with at least one exchange (n = 83).Values presented as median (interquartile range). Patient age was 50(36-60) years, the SOFA score 11(8-14.3) and the Murray lung injury Score 3.33(3.3-3.7). Cumulative ECMO support time 3411 days, 9(6-15) days per patient. Mechanical failure of the blood pump (n = 5), MO (n = 2) or cannula (n = 1) accounted for 10% of the exchanges. Acute clot formation within the pump head (visible clots, increase in plasma free hemoglobin (frHb), serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), n = 13) and MO (increase in pressure drop across the MO, n = 16) required an urgent system-exchange, of which nearly 50% could be foreseen by measuring the parameters mentioned below. Reasons for an elective system-exchange were worsening of gas transfer capability (n = 10) and device-related coagulation disorders (n = 32), either local fibrinolysis in the MO due to clot formation (increased D-dimers [DD]), decreased platelet count; n = 24), or device-induced hyperfibrinolysis (increased DD, decreased fibrinogen [FG], decreased platelet count, diffuse bleeding tendency; n = 8), which could be reversed after system-exchange. Four MOs were exchanged due to suspicion of infection.The majority of ECMO system-exchanges could be predicted by regular inspection of the complete ECMO circuit, evaluation of gas exchange, pressure drop across the MO and laboratory parameters (DD, FG, platelets, LDH, frHb). These parameters should be monitored in the daily routine to reduce the risk of unexpected ECMO failure."
https://openalex.org/W1997278755,"Neural crest cells (NCCs) are an embryonic migratory cell population with the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of cell types that contribute to the craniofacial skeleton, cornea, peripheral nervous system, and skin pigmentation. This ability suggests the promising role of NCCs as a source for cell-based therapy. Although several methods have been used to induce human NCCs (hNCCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), further modifications are required to improve the robustness, efficacy, and simplicity of these methods. Chemically defined medium (CDM) was used as the basal medium in the induction and maintenance steps. By optimizing the culture conditions, the combination of the GSK3β inhibitor and TGFβ inhibitor with a minimum growth factor (insulin) very efficiently induced hNCCs (70–80%) from hPSCs. The induced hNCCs expressed cranial NCC-related genes and stably proliferated in CDM supplemented with EGF and FGF2 up to at least 10 passages without changes being observed in the major gene expression profiles. Differentiation properties were confirmed for peripheral neurons, glia, melanocytes, and corneal endothelial cells. In addition, cells with differentiation characteristics similar to multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were induced from hNCCs using CDM specific for human MSCs. Our simple and robust induction protocol using small molecule compounds with defined media enabled the generation of hNCCs as an intermediate material producing terminally differentiated cells for cell-based innovative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2050769195,"Ceruloplasmin is a ferroxidase that interacts with ferroportin to export cellular iron, but is not expressed in neurons. We recently reported that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the analogous iron-exporting chaperone for neurons and other cells. The ferroxidase activity of APP has since been called into question. Using a triplex Fe2+ oxidation assay, we analyzed the activity of a soluble form of APP (sAPPα) within a buffer of physiological pH and anionic charge, and determined that iron oxidation originated from phosphate. Using various techniques such as flow-cytometry to measure surface presented proteins, we confirmed that endogenous APP is essential for ferroportin persistence on the neuronal surface. Therefore, despite lacking ferroxidase activity, APP still supports iron export from neurons."

Although some flexibility in fate potential is beneficial to overall organ health, dramatic changes in cellular identity can have disastrous consequences. Emerging data within the field of pancreas biology are revising current beliefs about how cellular identity is shaped by developmental and environmental cues under homeostasis and stress conditions. Here, we discuss the changes occurring in cellular states upon fate modulation and address how our understanding of the nature of this fluidity is shaping therapeutic approaches to pancreatic disorders such as diabetes and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2050729131,"Fish larvae in aquaculture have high mortality rates due to pathogenic bacteria, especially the Vibrio species, and ineffective prophylactic strategies. Vaccination is not feasible in larvae and antibiotics have reduced efficacy against multidrug resistant bacteria. A novel approach to controlling Vibrio infections in aquaculture is needed. The potential of phage therapy to combat vibriosis in fish larvae production has not yet been examined. We describe the isolation and characterization of two bacteriophages capable of infecting pathogenic Vibrio and their application to prevent bacterial infection in fish larvae. Two groups of zebrafish larvae were infected with V. anguillarum (∼106 CFU mL−1) and one was later treated with a phage lysate (∼108 PFU mL−1). A third group was only added with phages. A fourth group received neither bacteria nor phages (fish control). Larvae mortality, after 72 h, in the infected and treated group was similar to normal levels and significantly lower than that of the infected but not treated group, indicating that phage treatment was effective. Thus, directly supplying phages to the culture water could be an effective and inexpensive approach toward reducing the negative impact of vibriosis in larviculture."
https://openalex.org/W2069561793,"Yeasts are widely distributed in nature and exist in association with other microorganisms as normal inhabitants of soil, vegetation, and aqueous environments. In this study, 12 yeast strains were enriched and isolated from leaf samples of the carnivorous plant Drosera indica L., which is currently threatened because of restricted habitats and use in herbal industries. According to similarities in large subunit and small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences, we identified 2 yeast species in 2 genera of the phylum Ascomycota, and 5 yeast species in 5 genera of the phylum Basidiomycota. All of the isolated yeasts produced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) when cultivated in YPD broth supplemented with 0.1% L-tryptophan. Growth conditions, such as the pH and temperature of the medium, influenced yeast IAA production. Our results also suggested the existence of a tryptophan-independent IAA biosynthetic pathway. We evaluated the effects of various concentrations of exogenous IAA on yeast growth and observed that IAA produced by wild yeasts modifies auxin-inducible gene expression in Arabidopsis. Our data suggest that yeasts can promote plant growth and support ongoing prospecting of yeast strains for inclusion into biofertilizer for sustainable agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W2009109613,"Background Preeclampsia (PE) is an obstetric disorder with high morbidity and mortality rates but without clear pathogeny. The dysfunction of the blood coagulation-fibrinolysis system is a salient characteristic of PE that varies in severity, and necessitates different treatments. Therefore, it is necessary to find suitable predictors for the onset and severity of PE. Objectives We aimed to evaluate blood coagulation parameters and platelet indices as potential predictors for the onset and severity of PE. Methods Blood samples from 3 groups of subjects, normal pregnant women (n = 79), mild preeclampsia (mPE) (n = 53) and severe preeclampsia (sPE) (n = 42), were collected during early and late pregnancy. The levels of coagulative parameters and platelet indices were measured and compared among the groups. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves of these indices were generated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. The predictive values of the selected potential parameters were examined in binary regression analysis. Results During late pregnancy in the normal pregnancy group, the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT) and platelet count decreased, while the fibrinogen level and mean platelet volume (MPV) increased compared to early pregnancy (p<0.05). However, the PE patients presented with increased APTT, TT, MPV and D-dimer (DD) during the third trimester. In the analysis of subjects with and without PE, TT showed the largest AUC (0.743) and high predictive value. In PE patients with different severities, MPV showed the largest AUC (0.671) and ideal predictive efficiency. Conclusion Normal pregnancy causes a maternal physiological hypercoagulable state in late pregnancy. PE may trigger complex disorders in the endogenous coagulative pathways and consume platelets and FIB, subsequently activating thrombopoiesis and fibrinolysis. Thrombin time and MPV may serve as early monitoring markers for the onset and severity of PE, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1997855844,"The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with gemcitabine (GEM) in combination with fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) on a pancreatic cancer patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model. A PDOX model was established from a CA19-9-positive, CEA-negative tumor from a patient who had undergone a pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Mice were randomized to 4 groups: bright light surgery (BLS) only; BLS+NAC; FGS only; and FGS+NAC. An anti-CA19-9 or anti-CEA antibody conjugated to DyLight 650 was administered intravenously via the tail vein of mice with the pancreatic cancer PDOX 24 hours before surgery. The PDOX was brightly labeled with fluorophore-conjugated anti-CA19-9, but not with a fluorophore-conjugated anti-CEA antibody. FGS was performed using the fluorophore-conjugated anti-CA19-9 antibody. FGS had no benefit over BLS to prevent metastatic recurrence. NAC in combination with BLS did not convey an advantage over BLS to prevent metastatic recurrence. However, FGS+NAC significantly reduced the metastatic recurrence frequency to one of 8 mice, compared to FGS only after which metastasis recurred in 6 out of 8 mice, and BLS+NAC with metastatic recurrence in 7 out of 8 mice (p = 0.041). Thus NAC in combination with FGS can reduce or even eliminate metastatic recurrence of pancreatic cancer sensitive to NAC. The present study further emphasizes the power of the PDOX model which enables metastasis to occur and thereby identify the efficacy of NAC in combination with FGS on metastatic recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2020154029,"We examined the potential effects of environmental variables, and their interaction, on phytoplankton community succession in spring using long-term data from 1992 to 2012 in Lake Taihu, China. Laboratory experiments were additionally performed to test the sensitivity of the phytoplankton community to nutrient concentrations and temperature. A phytoplankton community structure analysis from 1992 to 2012 showed that Cryptomonas (Cryptophyta) was the dominant genus in spring during the early 1990s. Dominance then shifted to Ulothrix (Chlorophyta) in 1996 and 1997. However, Cryptomonas again dominated in 1999, 2000, and 2002, with Ulothrix regaining dominance from 2003 to 2006. The bloom-forming cyanobacterial genus Microcystis dominated in 1995, 2001 and 2007–2012. The results of ordinations indicated that the nutrient concentration (as indicated by the trophic state index) was the most important factor affecting phytoplankton community succession during the past two decades. In the laboratory experiments, shifts in dominance among phytoplankton taxa occurred in all nutrient addition treatments. Results of both long term monitoring and experiment indicated that nutrients exert a stronger control than water temperature on phytoplankton communities during spring. Interactive effect of nutrients and water temperature was the next principal factor. Overall, phytoplankton community composition was mediated by nutrients concentrations, but this effect was strongly enhanced by elevated water temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2001420869,"Rationale In mouse models for atopic dermatitis (AD) hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) dysfunction and neuropeptide-dependent neurogenic inflammation explain stress-aggravated flares to some extent. Lately, cholinergic signaling has emerged as a link between innate and adaptive immunity as well as stress responses in chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we aim to determine in humans the impact of acute stress on neuro-immune interaction as well as on the non-neuronal cholinergic system (NNCS). Methods Skin biopsies were obtained from 22 individuals (AD patients and matched healthy control subjects) before and after the Trier social stress test (TSST). To assess neuro-immune interaction, nerve fiber (NF)-density, NF-mast cell contacts and mast cell activation were determined by immunohistomorphometry. To evaluate NNCS effects, expression of secreted mammal Ly-6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor-related protein (SLURP) 1 and 2 (endogenous nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands) and their main corresponding receptors were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Results With respect to neuro-immune interaction we found higher numbers of NGF+ dermal NF in lesional compared to non-lesional AD but lower numbers of Gap43+ growing NF at baseline. Mast cell-NF contacts correlated with SCORAD and itch in lesional skin. With respect to the NNCS, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 (α7nAChR) mRNA was significantly lower in lesional AD skin at baseline. After TSST, PGP 9.5+ NF numbers dropped in lesional AD as did their contacts with mast cells. NGF+ NF now correlated with SCORAD and mast cell-NF contacts with itch in non-lesional skin. At the same time, SLURP-2 levels increased in lesional AD skin. Conclusions In humans chronic inflammatory and highly acute psycho-emotional stress interact to modulate cutaneous neuro-immune communication and NNCS marker expression. These findings may have consequences for understanding and treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2006816191,"Advances in pluripotent stem cell and reprogramming technologies have given us the hope of generating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in culture. To succeed, greater understanding of the self-renewing HSC during human development is required. We discovered that the glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored surface protein GPI-80 defines a subpopulation of human fetal liver hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) with self-renewal ability. CD34(+)CD38(lo/-)CD90(+)GPI-80(+) HSPCs were the sole population that maintained proliferative potential and an undifferentiated state in stroma coculture and engrafted in immunodeficient mice. GPI-80 expression also enabled tracking of HSPCs once they emerged from endothelium and migrated between human fetal hematopoietic niches. GPI-80 colocalized on the surface of HSPCs with Integrin alpha-M (ITGAM), which in leukocytes cooperates with GPI-80 to support migration. Knockdown of GPI-80 or ITGAM was sufficient to compromise HSPC expansion in culture and engraftment in vivo. These findings indicate that human fetal HSCs employ mechanisms used in leukocyte adhesion and migration to mediate HSC self-renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2019210417,"We have investigated the effects of light-emitting diode (LED)-induced phototoxicity (LIP) on cone-photoreceptors and their protection with brimonidine (BMD), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). In anesthetized, dark adapted, adult albino rats a blue (400 nm) LED was placed perpendicular to the cornea (10 sec, 200 lux) and the effects were investigated using Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) and/or analysing the retina in oriented cross-sections or wholemounts immune-labelled for L- and S-opsin and counterstained with the nuclear stain DAPI. The effects of topical BMD (1%) or, intravitreally injected BDNF (5 µg), PEDF (2 µg), CNTF (0.4 µg) or bFGF (1 µg) after LIP were examined on wholemounts at 7 days. SD-OCT showed damage in a circular region of the superotemporal retina, whose diameter varied from 1,842.4±84.5 µm (at 24 hours) to 1,407.7±52.8 µm (at 7 days). This region had a progressive thickness diminution from 183.4±5 µm (at 12 h) to 114.6±6 µm (at 7 d). Oriented cross-sections showed within the light-damaged region of the retina massive loss of rods and cone-photoreceptors. Wholemounts documented a circular region containing lower numbers of L- and S-cones. Within a circular area (1 mm or 1.3 mm radius, respectively) in the left and in its corresponding region of the contralateral-fellow-retina, total L- or S-cones were 7,118±842 or 661±125 for the LED exposed retinas (n = 7) and 14,040±1,860 or 2,255±193 for the fellow retinas (n = 7), respectively. BMD, BDNF, PEDF and bFGF but not CNTF showed significant neuroprotective effects on L- or S-cones. We conclude that LIP results in rod and cone-photoreceptor loss, and is a reliable, quantifiable model to study cone-photoreceptor degeneration. Intravitreal BDNF, PEDF or bFGF, or topical BMD afford significant cone neuroprotection in this model."
https://openalex.org/W2078587411,"Grape thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) play roles in plant-pathogen interactions and can cause protein haze in white wine unless removed prior to bottling. Different isoforms of TLPs have different hazing potential and aggregation behavior. Here we present the elucidation of the molecular structures of three grape TLPs that display different hazing potential. The three TLPs have very similar structures despite belonging to two different classes (F2/4JRU is a thaumatin-like protein while I/4L5H and H2/4MBT are VVTL1), and having different unfolding temperatures (56 vs. 62°C), with protein F2/4JRU being heat unstable and forming haze, while I/4L5H does not. These differences in properties are attributable to the conformation of a single loop and the amino acid composition of its flanking regions."
https://openalex.org/W1984621939,"Invasion and metastasis are the major causes of death in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step in tumor progression and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling has been shown to play an important role in EMT. In this study, we investigated how TGF-β1 signaling pathways contributed to EMT in three ESCC cell lines as well as 100 patients of nomadic ethnic Kazakhs residing in northwest Xinjiang Province of China. In vitro analyses included Western blotting to detect the expression of TGF-β1/Smad and EMT-associated proteins in Eca109, EC9706 and KYSE150 cell lines following stimulation with recombinant TGF-β1 and SB431542, a potent inhibitor of ALK5 that also inhibits TGF-β type II receptor. TGF-β-activated Smad2/3 signaling in EMT was significantly upregulated as indicated by mesenchymal markers of N-cadherin and Vimentin, and in the meantime, epithelial marker, E-cadherin, was markedly downregulated. In contrast, SB431542 addition downregulated the expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin, but upregulated the expression of E-cadherin. Moreover, the TGF-β1-induced EMT promoted invasion capability of Eca109 cells. Tumor cells undergoing EMT acquire fibroblastoid-like phenotype. Expressed levels of TGF-β1/Smad signaling molecules and EMT-associated proteins were examined using immunohistochemical analyses in 100 ESCC tissues of Kazakh patients and 58 matched noncancerous adjacent tissues. The results showed that ESCC tissues exhibited upregulated expression of TGF-β1/Smad. We also analyzed the relationship between the above proteins and the patients' clinicopathological characteristics. The TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway in human Eca109 ESCC cells may carry similar features as in Kazakh ESCC patients, suggesting that TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation of EMT in ethnic Kazakh patients with ESCC from Xinjiang, China."

The authors reporting this methodical breakthrough speculated that SCNT would allow the creation of patient-matched embryonic stem cells, even in patients with hereditary mitochondrial diseases. However, herein we show that mismatched mitochondria in nuclear-transfer-derived embryonic stem cells (NT-ESCs) possess alloantigenicity and are subject to immune rejection. In a murine transplantation setup, we demonstrate that allogeneic mitochondria in NT-ESCs, which are nucleus-identical to the recipient, may trigger an adaptive alloimmune response that impairs the survival of NT-ESC grafts. The immune response is adaptive, directed against mitochondrial content, and amenable for tolerance induction. Mitochondrial alloantigenicity should therefore be considered when developing therapeutic SCNT-based strategies.

Mitochondrial alloantigenicity should therefore be considered when developing therapeutic SCNT-based strategies. In somatic cell nucleus transfer (SCNT), the nucleus of a somatic cell is transplanted into an enucleated oocyte (Noggle et al., 2011Noggle S. Fung H.L. Gore A. Martinez H. Satriani K.C. Prosser R. Oum K. Paull D. Druckenmiller S. Freeby M. et al.Human oocytes reprogram somatic cells to a pluripotent state.Nature. 2011; 478: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It has been envisioned that by this means, autologous pluripotent stem cells can be generated for specific patient-matched therapies. Embryonic stem cells by nuclear transfer (NT-ESCs) were first successfully generated from mice (Munsie et al., 2000Munsie M.J. Michalska A.E. O’Brien C.M. Trounson A.O. Pera M.F. Mountford P.S.

After substantial optimization of the SCNT technique, the derivation of NT-ESCs from human fetal fibroblasts (Tachibana et al., 2013Tachibana M. Amato P. Sparman M. Gutierrez N.M. Tippner-Hedges R.

These latter studies suggest that age-associated changes in the nucleus donor cell are not necessarily an impediment to generating human NT-ESCs (Chung et al., 2014Chung Y.G. Eum J.H. Lee J.E. Shim S.H. Sepilian V. Hong S.W. Lee Y. Treff N.R. Choi Y.H. Kimbrel E.A. et al.Human somatic cell nuclear transfer using adult cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 777-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the differentiation of insulin-producing beta cells derived from NT-ESCs generated from a subject with longstanding diabetes proved that specialized cell types that are lost in diseased patients can be reestablished (Yamada et al., 2014Yamada M. Johannesson B. Sagi I. Burnett L.C. Kort D.H. Prosser R.W. Paull D. Nestor M.W. Freeby M.

Because NT-ESCs acquire healthy mitochondria from the selected oocyte donor, inherited or acquired mtDNA diseases are most amenable for correction using the SCNT technology (Tachibana et al., 2013Tachibana M. Amato P. Sparman M. Gutierrez N.M. Tippner-Hedges R. Ma H. Kang E. Fulati A. Lee H.S.

The recent advancements in SCNT methodology have increased expectations for this approach to lead to human-assisted reproductive technologies (Cibelli, 2014Cibelli J.B. Human somatic cell nuclear transfer is alive and well.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 699-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A so far underappreciated obstacle for clinical application of SCNT-derived cell therapy may be the immunogenicity of mismatched mitochondria in NT-ESCs. After transplantation of NT-ESC-derived cells or tissue back into the nucleus donor, mismatched mtDNA-coded proteins may induce alloimmunity. We here show that allogeneic mitochondria in murine NT-ESCs may trigger an adaptive immune response that impairs the survival of NT-ESC grafts. To assess mitochondria-specific alloantigenicity, transplantation studies with SCNT-derived murine NT-ESCs were conducted across defined immunological barriers. NT-ESCs were produced previously by Kirak et al., 2010Kirak O. Frickel E.M. Grotenbreg G.M. Suh H. Jaenisch R. Ploegh H.L. Transnuclear mice with predefined T cell receptor specificities against Toxoplasma gondii obtained via SCNT.Science. 2010; 328: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar using enucleated BDF1 (B6D2F1/J) oocytes (C57BL/6J × DBA/2NCrl) F1 and isolated BALB/c (BALB/cAnNCrl; major histocompatibility complex [MHC] H2d) fibroblast nuclei (Figure 1A). Both oocytes and NT-ESCs demonstrated high mitochondrial abundance (Figure S1A available online). The high repetition of mtDNA copies and the high amount of mitochondrial proteins contribute to their relevance as possible immunogenic antigens. Culture-expanded NT-ESCs expressed markers related to pluripotency (Figure S1B). NT-ESCs grew tumors in immunodeficient NOD SCID mice (NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J). These tumors contained tissues of endodermal, ectodermal, and mesodermal origin (Figures S1C and S1D), thus meeting the criteria for teratomas. The generated NT-ESCs thus contain maternally inherited C57BL/6J (B6) mitochondria and BALB/c nuclei of the H2d haplotype. Suspensions of 106 NT-ESCs were intramuscularly injected into the thighs of recipient mice. BALB/c recipients are matched for the entire nuclear genome but are mitochondria mismatched. mtDNA sequence analysis comparing B6 mitochondria of the NT-ESCs with BALB/c mitochondria revealed two nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions within the mt-Co3 and mt-Cytb genes, which resulted in amino acid substitutions in the associated proteins (Figure S2A). These two nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were therefore the only differences in the entire cellular DNA between donor cells and recipient. According to dbSNP (Sherry et al., 2001Sherry S.T. Ward M.H. Kholodov M. Baker J. Phan L. Smigielski E.M. Sirotkin K. dbSNP: the NCBI database of genetic variation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (4837) Google Scholar), both variants are common in mouse. The affected loci are conserved among vertebrates (Figure S2B) and for one of the two observed variants a human counterpart is described in dbSNP. BDF1 (H2b/d) recipients share the H2d alleles with the NT-ESCs and are mitochondria matched but minor histocompatibility antigen (MiHA) mismatched (Figure 1A). B6 recipients possess the H2b haplotype and are therefore MHC mismatched but mitochondria matched to the NT-ESCs. The severely immunodeficient NOD SCID strain was used as a negative control because it cannot mount any antigen-specific cellular immune response. The CBA (CBA/J; H2k) strain is both MHC and mitochondria mismatched to the NT-ESCs. mtDNA sequencing revealed identical mtDNA genomes for CBA and BALB/c (not shown), as was previously reported in the context of mouse mtDNA phylogeny (Goios et al., 2007Goios A. Pereira L. Bogue M. Macaulay V. Amorim A. mtDNA phylogeny and evolution of laboratory mouse strains.Genome Res. 2007; 17: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, besides the MHC differences, NT-ESC transplantations into BALB/c and CBA cross the same mitochondrial mismatch. Previous studies on the immunogenicity of murine mitochondrial peptides were mostly restricted to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and MHC class Ia and Ib presentation (Dabhi and Lindahl, 1995Dabhi V.M. Lindahl K.F. MtDNA-encoded histocompatibility antigens.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 466-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We herein used assays that quantify activation of T helper cells (Th) because this entity plays a central role in activating CTLs and B cells, thus orchestrating graft rejection. Five-day ELISPOT assays for Th1-specific γ-interferon (IFNγ) showed a substantial immune activation in the MHC-mismatched B6 recipients, which was significantly stronger than those in mitochondria-mismatched BALB/c or MiHA-mismatched BDF1 (Figure 1B). The MHC- and mitochondria-mismatched CBA strain demonstrated the highest spot frequencies of all strains, which were approximately additive of the frequencies of the isolated MHC-mismatched B6 and the isolated mitochondria-mismatched BALB/c. The immunodeficient NOD SCID recipients showed immunological Th1 anergy. The Th2 response, although generally generating lower IL-4 spot frequencies, showed a similar relation between the recipient strains (Figure 1C). There was also a surge in NT-ESC-specific IgM antibodies in B6 recipients 5 days after immunization, which was significantly stronger than that in BALB/c or BDF1 (Figure 1D). There were no NT-ESC-specific IgM antibodies in NOD SCID. In an additional experiment, we could exclude that there were general differences among BALB/c, BDF1, and B6 in the degree of immune responsiveness (Figure S2C). Splenocytes of these three strains were unspecifically stimulated and ELISPOT assays demonstrated similar Th1 and Th2 activation. This result permits us to attribute the above ELISPOT results to the mismatched proteins. To exclude methodological bias caused by the state of pluripotency, isogeneic BALB/c ESCs (isoESCs) were used (Figure 1E). Transplantation experiments were performed with fully nuclear DNA- and mtDNA-matched, isogeneic BALB/c recipients, MiHA- and mitochondria-mismatched BDF1, and MHC- and mitochondria-mismatched B6. There was negligible Th1 and Th2 activation in isogeneic BALB/c recipients (Figures 1F and 1G). Between mitochondria-mismatched recipients, an additional MHC mismatch (B6) generated a significantly stronger Th1 activation than an additional MiHA mismatch (BDF1, Figure 1F). Together, these results demonstrate that an isolated mitochondria mismatch is sufficient to initiate marked Th activation and NT-ESC-directed antibody production. These immune responses are not caused by pluripotency features themselves. Second, an MHC mismatch causes a significantly stronger immune activation than an MiHA mismatch, in the setting of both additional mitochondrial match and mismatch. And third, the Th1 activation is additive for an MHC and a mitochondria mismatch. Based on the results by Ishikawa (Ishikawa et al., 2010Ishikawa K. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Nakada K. Morimoto M. Imanishi H. Yoshizaki M. Sasawatari S. Niikura M. Takenaga K. Yonekawa H. Hayashi J. The innate immune system in host mice targets cells with allogenic mitochondrial DNA.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2297-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which assumed that the innate immunity was responsible for rejection of mitochondria-mismatched cell grafts, the T cell-deficient nude mouse model was used to study the NK cell response. BALB/c nude (BALB/c nu/nu, CAnN.Cg-Foxn1 < nu > /Crl; H2d) mice were used as recipients for either mitochondria-mismatched NT-ESCs or fully isogeneic isoESCs (H2d, Figure 1H). Our results show that there was no increase in NK-cell-driven IFNγ ELISPOT frequency in response to NT-ESCs as compared to the response to isoESCs (Figure 1I). Also, the survival of cell grafts was similar for NT-ESCs and isoESCs and all animals formed teratomas, thus excluding relevant innate rejection processes (Figures 1J and 1K). Importantly, the transplantation experiment by Ishikawa was specifically designed to be mismatched for the maternally transmitted mitochondrial antigen (Mta) previously described by Fischer Lindahl (Fischer Lindahl et al., 1980Fischer Lindahl K. Bocchieri M. Riblet R. Maternally transmitted target antigen for unrestricted killing by NZB T lymphocytes.J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our transplant setting avoids this incompatibility and, as a consequence, we did not observe relevant innate immunity-driven rejection. Survival of NT-ESC grafts and teratoma development were assessed in the transplantation settings of Figure 1A. As expected, all NT-ESC transplants survived and formed teratomas in NOD SCID recipients (Figure 2A), whereas all grafts were rejected in fully mismatched CBAs (Figure 2B). The rather mild Th1 activation in MiHA-mismatched BDF1 still allowed 90% teratoma development of rapidly proliferating NT-ESC grafts (Figure 2C), whereas there was only 20% teratoma growth in MHC-mismatched B6 (Figure 2D). In mitochondria-mismatched BALB/c, teratomas developed in 60% of the recipients, but the tumor growth was markedly slowed (Figure 2E). Half of the tumors did not develop until day 50 to 90. Interestingly, there was a strong correlation between graft survival and Th1 activation in individual BALB/c animals (Figure 2F). Only BALB/c recipients with very low spot frequencies developed teratomas, whereas animals with at least moderate Th1 activation rejected their grafts. This further supports the notion of a T cell-mediated rejection process of mitochondria-mismatched grafts. To confirm a mitochondrial location of the immunogenic peptides, mitochondria of NT-ESCs were separated from the remainder of the cell (cytosol) and splenocytes of NT-ESC-immunized BALB/c were restimulated in vitro with either mismatched mitochondria or isogeneic cytosol (Figure 2G). Only the mismatched mitochondria caused an IFNγ response, whereas the spot frequencies with the isogeneic cytosol fractions were low, similar to those of unstimulated responder splenocytes (Figure 2H). Of note, the ELISPOT frequencies of the separated cell compartments were markedly lower than those involving whole cells. Although their precise presentation mechanism remains elusive, the detection of mitochondrial peptides in the context of MHC (Dabhi and Lindahl, 1995Dabhi V.M. Lindahl K.F. MtDNA-encoded histocompatibility antigens.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 466-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Duvvuri et al., 2014Duvvuri B. Duvvuri V.R. Wang C. Chen L. Wagar L.E. Jamnik V. Wu J. Yeung R.S. Grigull J. Watts T.H. Wu G.E. The human immune system recognizes neopeptides derived from mitochondrial DNA deletions.J. Immunol. 2014; 192: 4581-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) suggests that they enter conventional MHC antigen presentation pathways. The dependence on indirect antigen presentation in this assay may explain this observation. In accordance with the ELISPOT results, in a delayed-type hypersensitivity test, only mismatched mitochondria generated paw swelling, whereas isogeneic cytosol did not (Figure 2I). The location of the antigens for BALB/c immune activation against NT-ESCs was thus restricted to the mitochondrial fraction. We next tested whether acquired immunological tolerance against allogeneic mitochondria can be induced. In accordance with the Medawar experiments (Billingham et al., 1953Billingham R.E. Brent L. Medawar P.B. Actively acquired tolerance of foreign cells.Nature. 1953; 172: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar), neonatal BALB/c mice were immunized with mitomycin-inhibited NT-ESCs (Figure 2J). In adulthood, these animals were reinjected with NT-ESCs (BALB/creinject). In contrast to adult BALB/c recipients that received their first NT-ESC grafts, BALB/creinject showed no IFNγ response in ELISPOT assays and all animals developed teratomas (Figures 2K and 2L). This experiment not only shows that tolerance against allogeneic mitochondria can reliably be induced, it is also further proof for the relevance of the adaptive immune system in rejecting mitochondria-mismatched grafts. There have been few publications on the transplantation of mitochondria-mismatched cells or tissues with conflicting results. Although prolonged hematopoietic chimerism (Lanza et al., 2005Lanza R. Shieh J.H. Wettstein P.J. Sweeney R.W. Wu K. Weisz A. Borson N. Henderson B. West M.D. Moore M.A. Long-term bovine hematopoietic engraftment with clone-derived stem cells.Cloning Stem Cells. 2005; 7: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and acceptance of cardiac and renal cell transplants (Lanza et al., 2002Lanza R.P.

Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) in cows receiving SCNT-derived mitochondria-mismatched cells was reported, this may not guarantee universal success. Pigs rejected kidney grafts from SCNT-derived mitochondria-mismatched clones (Kwak et al., 2013Kwak H.H. Park K.M. Teotia P.K. Lee G.S. Lee E.S. Hong S.H. Yang S.R. Park S.M. Ahn C.

Proc. 2013; 45: 1754-1760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In mice and rats, it was shown that a single nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution in the mitochondrial ND1 gene or the ATPase 6 gene, respectively, generated an aberrant peptide and resulted in the loss of histocompatibility (Bhuyan et al., 1997Bhuyan P.K.

Neopeptides from human mtDNA harboring large-scale frameshift deletions were recently reported to bind to MHC molecules and can be recognized by T cells from other individuals (Duvvuri et al., 2014Duvvuri B. Duvvuri V.R. Wang C. Chen L. Wagar L.E. Jamnik V. Wu J. Yeung R.S. Grigull J. Watts T.H. Wu G.E. The human immune system recognizes neopeptides derived from mitochondrial DNA deletions.J. Immunol. 2014; 192: 4581-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Duvvuri et al. results further suggest that some neopeptides could bind promiscuously to both MHC class I and class II alleles, activate CD4 and CD8 T cells, and be recognized by CD8 memory T cells. Aberrant mitochondrial peptides may even provoke MHC overexpression and thus amplify their immunogenicity. In both mice and humans, increased MHC class I expression in cells harboring mtDNA deletions was shown (Gu et al., 2003Gu Y. Wang C. Roifman C.M. Cohen A. Role of MHC class I in immune surveillance of mitochondrial DNA integrity.J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3603-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial peptides can thus serve as immunogens (Morse et al., 1996Morse M.C. Bleau G. Dabhi V.M. Hétu F. Drobetsky E.A. Lindahl K.F. Perreault C. The COI mitochondrial gene encodes a minor histocompatibility antigen presented by H2-M3.J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3301-3307PubMed Google Scholar) and the recipient immune response may depend on the alloantigenicity of the aberrant mitochondrial protein. Although thought to be beneficial for immune surveillance and clearance of cells with mitochondrial mutations (Duvvuri et al., 2014Duvvuri B. Duvvuri V.R. Wang C. Chen L. Wagar L.E. Jamnik V. Wu J. Yeung R.S. Grigull J. Watts T.H. Wu G.E. The human immune system recognizes neopeptides derived from mitochondrial DNA deletions.J.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 3603-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), this immune feature is potentially hazardous in the context of SCNT-derived cell transplantation. Artificial reprograming using viral or nonviral plasmid-based approaches seems to alter the expression of a multitude of genes in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that are differentially expressed in ESCs (de Almeida et al., 2014de Almeida P.E. Meyer E.H. Kooreman N.G. Diecke S. Dey D. Sanchez-Freire V. Hu S. Ebert A. Odegaard J. Mordwinkin N.M. et al.Transplanted terminally differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells are accepted by immune mechanisms similar to self-tolerance.Nat.

Immunogenicity of induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2011; 474: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Specific factors being suppressed (de Almeida et al., 2014de Almeida P.E. Meyer E.H. Kooreman N.G. Diecke S. Dey D. Sanchez-Freire V. Hu S. Ebert A. Odegaard J. Mordwinkin N.M. et al.Transplanted terminally differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells are accepted by immune mechanisms similar to self-tolerance.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3903PubMed Google Scholar) or overexpressed (Zhao et al., 2011Zhao T. Zhang Z.N. Rong Z. Xu Y. Immunogenicity of induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2011; 474: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar) in the pluripotent state have been suggested to contribute to the antigenicity of iPSCs. With differentiation, the antigenicity was reported to vanish as transcriptome profile and surface antigen expression converged with those of corresponding somatic cells (de Almeida et al., 2014de Almeida P.E. Meyer E.H. Kooreman N.G. Diecke S. Dey D. Sanchez-Freire V. Hu S. Ebert A. Odegaard J. Mordwinkin N.M. et al.Transplanted terminally differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells are accepted by immune mechanisms similar to self-tolerance.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3903PubMed Google Scholar). Terminally differentiated cells derived from iPSCs are now believed to possess no or negligible immunogenicity (Araki et al., 2013Araki R. Uda M. Hoki Y. Sunayama M. Nakamura M. Ando S. Sugiura M. Ideno H. Shimada A. Nifuji A. Abe M. Negligible immunogenicity of terminally differentiated cells derived from induced pluripotent or embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2013; 494: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The described immunogenicity is therefore differentiation dependent and not due to antigenic somatic coding mutations, which have recently been reported to occur during reprogramming (Gore et al., 2011Gore A. Li Z. Fung H.L. Young J.E. Agarwal S. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Canto I. Giorgetti A. Israel M.A. Kiskinis E. et al.Somatic coding mutations in human induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2011; 471: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). When compared to autologous iPSCs that are fully matched for both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, NT-ESCs with mtDNA differences to the nucleus donor possess additional allogeneic peptides that may potentially be antigenic. These antigenic proteins in mitochondria-mismatched NT-ESCs are maintained with differentiation and the mtDNA copies, if anything, are increased in energy-consuming differentiated cells like cardiomyocytes. However, it remains to be determined if the results presented herein are transferrable to differentiated cells and tissues from NT-ESCs. The level of heterogeneity in human mitochondria is considerably higher than that in laboratory mice (Goios et al., 2007Goios A. Pereira L. Bogue M. Macaulay V. Amorim A. mtDNA phylogeny and evolution of laboratory mouse strains.Genome Res. 2007; 17: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); dbSNP lists 2,066 active human mitochondrial RefSNPs. At least 64 of these are common (global minor allele frequency 1% or higher) and nonsynonymously coding. MT-CYTB is affected by 26 such variants and MT-CO3 by two, including the human counterpart of the murine variant we observed. A recent study hints at the level of heterogeneity in human mitochondrial genomes (Ridge et al., 2014Ridge P.G. Maxwell T.J. Foutz S.J. Bailey M.H. Corcoran C.D. Tschanz J.T. Norton M.C. Munger R.G. O’Brien E. Kerber R.A. et al.Mitochondrial genomic variation associated with higher mitochondrial copy number: the Cache County Study on Memory Health and Aging.BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15: S6Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Within a data set of 1,007 full mitochondrial genomes, 899 single nucleotide variants, 26 insertions, and 20 deletions were identified. Compared to the human reference sequence, each individual carried on average 25.3 variants. Single individuals marked the extremes with 2 and 52 variants, respectively. In the field of xenotransplantation, the immunity against the αGal-antigen was long considered to be the one obstacle that needed to be overcome to clear the path for subsequent clinical application. However, when αGal was knocked out, xenoimmune responses were still evident and new immune targets surfaced that previously were overshadowed by the strong αGal response (Miyata and Platt, 2003Miyata Y. Platt J.L. Xeno—still stuck without alphaGal.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 359-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Similarly, when nuclear DNA is matched in SCNT-derived cells, antigenic competition (Johnson et al., 1981Johnson L.L. Bailey D.W. Mobraaten L.E. Antigenic competition between minor (non-H-2) histocompatibility antigens.Immunogenetics. 1981; 13: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) may allow mitochondrial antigens to emerge as immunogens. The immunogenicity of mitochondria should thus not be neglected when advancing SCNT technology. T.D., R.C.R., R.J., I.L.W., and S.S. designed the study.

For cetaceans, exhaled breath condensate (blow) provides a unique sampling matrix for such purposes. The purpose of this work was to develop an appropriate collection methodology and validate the use of a commercially available EIA for measuring cortisol in blow samples collected from belugas (Delphinapterus leucas). Nitex membrane stretched over a petri dish provided the optimal method for collecting blow. A commercially available cortisol EIA for measuring human cortisol (detection limit 35 pg ml−1) was adapted and validated for beluga cortisol using tests of parallelism, accuracy and recovery. Blow samples were collected from aquarium belugas during monthly health checks and during out of water examination, as well as from wild belugas. Two aquarium belugas showed increased blow cortisol between baseline samples and 30 minutes out of water (Baseline, 0.21 and 0.04 µg dl−1; 30 minutes, 0.95 and 0.14 µg dl−1). Six wild belugas also showed increases in blow cortisol between pre and post 1.5 hour examination (Pre 0.03, 0.23, 0.13, 0.19, 0.13, 0.04 µg dl−1, Post 0.60, 0.31, 0.36, 0.24, 0.14, 0.16 µg dl−1). Though this methodology needs further investigation, this study suggests that blow sampling is a good candidate for non-invasive monitoring of cortisol in belugas. It can be collected from both wild and aquarium animals efficiently for the purposes of health monitoring and research, and may ultimately be useful in obtaining data on wild populations, including endangered species, which are difficult to handle directly."
https://openalex.org/W2165820903,"Dichlorodiphenoxytrichloroethane (DDT) is a known persistent organic pollutant and liver damage toxicant. However, there has been little emphasis on the mechanism underlying liver damage toxicity of DDT and the relevant effective inhibitors. Hence, the present study was conducted to explore the protective effects of vitamin C (VC) and vitamin E (VE) on the cytotoxicity of DDT in HL-7702 cells and elaborate the specific molecular mechanisms. The results demonstrated that p,p′-DDT exposure at over 10 µM depleted cell viability of HL-7702 cells and led to cell apoptotic. p,p′-DDT treatment elevated the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, induced mitochondrial membrane potential, and released cytochrome c into the cytosol, with subsequent elevations of Bax and p53, along with suppression of Bcl-2. In addition, the activations of caspase-3 and -8 were triggered. Furthermore, p,p′-DDT promoted the expressions of NF-κB and FasL. When the cells were exposed to the NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC), the up-regulated expression of FasL was attenuated. Strikingly, these alterations caused by DDT treatment were prevented or reversed by the addition of VC or VE, and the protective effects of co-treatment with VC and VE were higher than the single supplement with p,p′-DDT. Taken together, these findings provide novel experimental evidences supporting that VC or/and VE could reduce p,p′-DDT-induced cytotoxicity of HL-7702 cells via the ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway and NF-κB/FasL pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1964274234,"Objective Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) are neurodegenerative diseases that can be difficult to distinguish clinically. The objective of the current study was to use surface-based analysis techniques to assess cortical thickness, surface area and grey matter volume to identify unique morphological patterns of cortical atrophy in PD, MSA and PSP and to relate these patterns of change to disease duration and clinical features. Methods High resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI volumes were acquired from 14 PD patients, 18 MSA, 14 PSP and 19 healthy control participants. Cortical thickness, surface area and volume analyses were carried out using the automated surface-based analysis package FreeSurfer (version 5.1.0). Measures of disease severity and duration were assessed for correlation with cortical morphometric changes in each clinical group. Results Results show that in PSP, widespread cortical thinning and volume loss occurs within the frontal lobe, particularly the superior frontal gyrus. In addition, PSP patients also displayed increased surface area in the pericalcarine. In comparison, PD and MSA did not display significant changes in cortical morphology. Conclusion These results demonstrate that patients with clinically established PSP exhibit distinct patterns of cortical atrophy, particularly affecting the frontal lobe. These results could be used in the future to develop a useful clinical application of MRI to distinguish PSP patients from PD and MSA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2005205299,"In Huntington's disease, expansion of a CAG triplet repeat occurs in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene (HTT), resulting in a protein bearing>35 polyglutamine residues whose N-terminal fragments display a high propensity to misfold and aggregate. Recent data demonstrate that polyglutamine expansion results in conformational changes in the huntingtin protein (HTT), which likely influence its biological and biophysical properties. Developing assays to characterize and measure these conformational changes in isolated proteins and biological samples would advance the testing of novel therapeutic approaches aimed at correcting mutant HTT misfolding. Time-resolved Förster energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based assays represent high-throughput, homogeneous, sensitive immunoassays widely employed for the quantification of proteins of interest. TR-FRET is extremely sensitive to small distances and can therefore provide conformational information based on detection of exposure and relative position of epitopes present on the target protein as recognized by selective antibodies. We have previously reported TR-FRET assays to quantify HTT proteins based on the use of antibodies specific for different amino-terminal HTT epitopes. Here, we investigate the possibility of interrogating HTT protein conformation using these assays.By performing TR-FRET measurements on the same samples (purified recombinant proteins or lysates from cells expressing HTT fragments or full length protein) at different temperatures, we have discovered a temperature-dependent, reversible, polyglutamine-dependent conformational change of wild type and expanded mutant HTT proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirms the temperature and polyglutamine-dependent change in HTT structure, revealing an effect of polyglutamine length and of temperature on the alpha-helical content of the protein.The temperature- and polyglutamine-dependent effects observed with TR-FRET on HTT proteins represent a simple, scalable, quantitative and sensitive assay to identify genetic and pharmacological modulators of mutant HTT conformation, and potentially to assess the relevance of conformational changes during onset and progression of Huntington's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2170418427,"Whereas past wolf management in the United States was restricted to recovery, managers must now contend with publicly contentious post-recovery issues including regulated hunting seasons. Understanding stakeholder concerns associated with hunting can inform stakeholder engagement, communication, and policy development and evaluation. Social identity theory (SIT) has been used to understand how groups interact, why they conflict, and how collaboration may be achieved. Applying SIT to stakeholder conflicts about wolf hunting may help delineate groups according to their concern about, support for or opposition to the policy choice of hunting wolves. Our objective was to assess concerns about hunting as a tool to resolve conflict in Michigan, using SIT as a framework. We used a mixed-modal sampling approach (e.g., paper, Internet) with wolf hunting-related public meeting participants in March 2013. Survey questions focused on 12 concerns previously identified as associated with hunting as a management tool to resolve conflict. Respondents (n = 666) cared greatly about wolves but were divided over hunting wolves. Wolf conflicts, use of science in policy decisions, and maintaining a wolf population were the highest ranked concerns. Principle components analysis reduced concerns into three factors that explained 50.7% of total variance; concerns crystallized over justifications for hunting. General linear models revealed a lack of geographic influence on care, fear and support for hunting related to wolves. These findings challenge assumptions about regional differences and suggest a strong role for social identity in driving dichotomized public perceptions in wildlife management."

Common causes of closure included weather (79%), natural disasters (14%), and problems with school buildings or utilities (4%). Only 771 (4%) USCs lasted ≥ 4 school days. Illness was the cause of 212 (1%) USCs; of these, 126 (59%) were related to respiratory illnesses and showed seasonal variation with peaks in February 2012 and January 2013.USCs are common events resulting in missed school days for millions of students. Illness causes few USCs compared with weather and natural disasters. Few communities have experience with prolonged closures for illness."
https://openalex.org/W2052716535,"Despite cultivation and seed import bans of genetically modified (GM) oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), feral GM plants were found growing along railway lines and in port areas at four sites in Switzerland in 2011 and 2012. All GM plants were identified as glyphosate-resistant GM event GT73 (Roundup Ready, Monsanto). The most affected sites were the Rhine port of Basel and the St. Johann freight railway station in Basel. To assess the distribution and intra- and interspecific outcrossing of GM oilseed rape in more detail, we monitored these two sites in 2013. Leaves and seed pods of feral oilseed rape plants, their possible hybridization partners and putative hybrid plants were sampled in monthly intervals and analysed for the presence of transgenes by real-time PCR. Using flow cytometry, we measured DNA contents of cell nuclei to confirm putative hybrids. In total, 2787 plants were sampled. The presence of GT73 oilseed rape could be confirmed at all previously documented sampling locations and was additionally detected at one new sampling location within the Rhine port. Furthermore, we found the glufosinate-resistant GM events MS8xRF3, MS8 and RF3 (all traded as InVigor, Bayer) at five sampling locations in the Rhine port. To our knowledge, this is the first time that feral MS8xRF3, MS8 or RF3 plants were detected in Europe. Real-time PCR analyses of seeds showed outcrossing of GT73 into two non-GM oilseed rape plants, but no outcrossing of transgenes into related wild species was observed. We found no hybrids between oilseed rape and related species. GM plants most frequently occurred at unloading sites for ships, indicating that ship cargo traffic is the main entry pathway for GM oilseed rape. In the future, it will be of major interest to determine the source of GM oilseed rape seeds."
https://openalex.org/W1990008878,"Polycystin-1 (Pkd1) interacts with polycystin-2 (Pkd2) to form an interdependent signaling complex. Selective deletion of Pkd1 in the osteoblast lineage reciprocally regulates osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis. The role of Pkd2 in skeletal development has not been defined. To this end, we conditionally inactivated Pkd2 in mature osteoblasts by crossing Osteocalcin (Oc)-Cre;Pkd2+/null mice with floxed Pkd2 (Pkd2flox/flox) mice. Oc-Cre;Pkd2flox/null (Pkd2Oc-cKO) mice exhibited decreased bone mineral density, trabecular bone volume, cortical thickness, mineral apposition rate and impaired biomechanical properties of bone. Pkd2 deficiency resulted in diminished Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) expressions in bone and impaired osteoblastic differentiation ex vivo. Expression of osteoblast-related genes, including, Osteocalcin, Osteopontin, Bone sialoprotein (Bsp), Phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome (Phex), Dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1), Sclerostin (Sost), and Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) were reduced proportionate to the reduction of Pkd2 gene dose in bone of Oc-Cre;Pkd2flox/+ and Oc-Cre;Pkd2flox/null mice. Loss of Pkd2 also resulted in diminished peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression and reduced bone marrow fat in vivo and reduced adipogenesis in osteoblast culture ex vivo. Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Yes-associated protein (YAP), reciprocally acting as co-activators and co-repressors of Runx2 and PPARγ, were decreased in bone of Oc-Cre;Pkd2flox/null mice. Thus, Pkd1 and Pkd2 have coordinate effects on osteoblast differentiation and opposite effects on adipogenesis, suggesting that Pkd1 and Pkd2 signaling pathways can have independent effects on mesenchymal lineage commitment in bone."
https://openalex.org/W1991415541,"Within vision research retinotopic mapping and the more general receptive field estimation approach constitute not only an active field of research in itself but also underlie a plethora of interesting applications. This necessitates not only good estimation of population receptive fields (pRFs) but also that these receptive fields are consistent across time rather than dynamically changing. It is therefore of interest to maximize the accuracy with which population receptive fields can be estimated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) setting. This, in turn, requires an adequate estimation framework providing the data for population receptive field mapping. More specifically, adequate decisions with regard to stimulus choice and mode of presentation need to be made. Additionally, it needs to be evaluated whether the stimulation protocol should entail mean luminance periods and whether it is advantageous to average the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal across stimulus cycles or not. By systematically studying the effects of these decisions on pRF estimates in an empirical as well as simulation setting we come to the conclusion that a bar stimulus presented at random positions and interspersed with mean luminance periods is generally most favorable. Finally, using this optimal estimation framework we furthermore tested the assumption of temporal consistency of population receptive fields. We show that the estimation of pRFs from two temporally separated sessions leads to highly similar pRF parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2054111986,"Chronic and non-healing skin wounds represent a significant clinical, economic and social problem worldwide. Currently, there are few effective treatments. Lack of well-defined animal models to investigate wound healing mechanisms and furthermore to identify new and more effective therapeutic agents still remains a major challenge. Pig skin wound healing is close to humans. However, standardized pig wound healing models with demonstrated validity for testing new wound healing candidates are unavailable. Here we report a systematic evaluation and establishment of both acute and diabetic wound healing models in pigs, including wound-creating pattern for drug treatment versus control, measurements of diabetic parameters and the time for detecting delayed wound healing. We find that treatment and control wounds should be on the opposite and corresponding sides of a pig. We demonstrate a strong correlation between duration of diabetic conditions and the length of delay in wound closure. Using these new models, we narrow down the minimum therapeutic entity of secreted Hsp90α to a 27-amino acid peptide, called fragment-8 (F-8). In addition, results of histochemistry and immunohistochemistry analyses reveal more organized epidermis and dermis in Hsp90α-healed wounds than the control. Finally, Hsp90α uses a similar signaling mechanism to promote migration of isolated pig and human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. This is the first report that shows standardized pig models for acute and diabetic wound healing studies and proves its usefulness with both an approved drug and a new therapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2028611465,"The incidence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)-related death has increased globally recently. To obtain information of the species and characterization of pathogens involved in NTM pulmonary infection in Southern-central China, we identified 160 non-tuberculous infection cases from 3995 acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-positive tuberculous suspects. We then randomly selected 101 non-tuberculous patients, isolated bacteria from their sputa and genotyped the pathogens using the 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequences. M. intracellulare (32.67%, 33/101), M. abscessus (32.67%, 33/101) and M. fortuitum (7.92%, 8/101) are identified in these isolates. Surprisingly, non-mycobacteria including Gordonia (8.91%, 9/101), Nocardia (5.94%, 6/101) and Tsukamurella (0.99%, 1/101) are also discovered, and the case of Tsukamurella pulmonis infection is first discovered in Southern-central China. Moreover, species of M. mucogenicum group, M. chubuense, M. kansasii, M. gastri, M. avium, M. porcinum and M. smegmatis are identified. In addition, nine immune compromised cases (8.91%, 9/101), including type two diabetes mellitus and HIV/AIDS are found to be infected with non-tuberculous bacteria. This study revealed the distribution and characteristics of non-tuberculous AFB pathogen infection occurred in Southern-central China, and suggested that physicians should be alert of the emerging of NTM and non-mycobacteria infection in AFB positive cases and take caution when choosing chemotherapy for tuberculosis-like pulmonary infections. Generally, this study may help with the development of new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of mycobacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2050343031,"Background Only a small amount of solar ultraviolet C (UV-C) radiation reaches the Earth's surface. This is because of the filtering effects of the stratospheric ozone layer. Artificial UV-C irradiation is used on leaves and fruits to stimulate different biological processes in plants. Grapes are a major fruit crop and are grown in many parts of the world. Research has shown that UV-C irradiation induces the biosynthesis of phenols in grape leaves. However, few studies have analyzed the overall changes in gene expression in grape leaves exposed to UV-C. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, transcriptional responses were investigated in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) leaves before and after exposure to UV-C irradiation (6 W·m−2 for 10 min) using an Affymetrix Vitis vinifera (Grape) Genome Array (15,700 transcripts). A total of 5274 differentially expressed probe sets were defined, including 3564 (67.58%) probe sets that appeared at both 6 and 12 h after exposure to UV-C irradiation but not before exposure. A total of 468 (8.87%) probe sets and 1242 (23.55%) probe sets were specifically expressed at these times. The probe sets were associated with a large number of important traits and biological pathways, including cell rescue (i.e., antioxidant enzymes), protein fate (i.e., HSPs), primary and secondary metabolism, and transcription factors. Interestingly, some of the genes involved in secondary metabolism, such as stilbene synthase, responded intensely to irradiation. Some of the MYB and WRKY family transcription factors, such as VvMYBPA1, VvMYB14, VvMYB4, WRKY57-like, and WRKY 65, were also strongly up-regulated (about 100 to 200 fold). Conclusions UV-C irridiation has an important role in some biology processes, especially cell rescue, protein fate, secondary metabolism, and regulation of transcription.These results opened up ways of exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of UV-C irradiation on grape leaves and have great implications for further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2036925255,"In this work, a lysostaphin-loaded, control-released, self-setting and injectable porous bone cement with efficient protein delivery was prepared by a novel setting method using hydroxyapatite/chitosan (HA/CS) composite scaffold. The cement samples were made through cementitious reactions by mixing solid powder, a mixture of HA/CS composite particles, lysostaphin, Ca(OH)2, CaCO3 and NaHCO3, with setting liquid containing citric acid, acetic acid, NaH2PO4, CaCl2 and poloxamer. The setting parameters of the cement samples were determined. The results showed that the final setting time was 96.6±5.2 min and the pH value increased from approximately 6.2 to nearly 10 during the setting process and the porosity was 34% at the end. And the microstructure and composition were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. For the release behavior of lysostaphin loaded in the cement sample, the in vitro cement extract experiment indicated that about 94.2±10.9% of the loaded protein was released before day 8 and the in vivo Qdot 625 fluorescence tracking experiment showed that the loaded protein released slower than the free one. Then the biocompatibility of the cement samples was evaluated using the methylthiazol tetrazolium assay, SEM and hematoxylin-eosin staining, which suggested good biocompatibility of cement samples with MC 3T3-E1 cells and subcutaneous tissues of mice. Finally the antibacterial activity assay indicated that the loaded lysostaphin had good release ability and strong antibacterial enzymatic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Collectively, all the results suggested that the lysostaphin-loaded self-setting injectable porous bone cement released the protein in a controlled and effective way and the protein activity was well retained during the setting and releasing process. Thus this bone cement can be potentially applied as a combination of artificial bone substitute and controlled-release system for delivery of lysostaphin to treat bone defects and infections."
https://openalex.org/W2006812611,"The pili and outer membrane proteins of Neisseria meningitidis (meningococci) facilitate bacterial adhesion and invasion into host cells. In this context expression of meningococcal PilC1 protein has been reported to play a crucial role. Intracellular calcium mobilization has been implicated as an important signaling event during internalization of several bacterial pathogens. Here we employed time lapse calcium-imaging and demonstrated that PilC1 of meningococci triggered a significant increase in cytoplasmic calcium in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, whereas PilC1-deficient meningococci could not initiate this signaling process. The increase in cytosolic calcium in response to PilC1-expressing meningococci was due to efflux of calcium from host intracellular stores as demonstrated by using 2-APB, which inhibits the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, pre-treatment of host cells with U73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor) abolished the cytosolic calcium increase caused by PilC1-expressing meningococci demonstrating that active phospholipase C (PLC) is required to induce calcium transients in host cells. Furthermore, the role of cytosolic calcium on meningococcal adherence and internalization was documented by gentamicin protection assay and double immunofluorescence (DIF) staining. Results indicated that chelation of intracellular calcium by using BAPTA-AM significantly impaired PilC1-mediated meningococcal adherence to and invasion into host endothelial cells. However, buffering of extracellular calcium by BAPTA or EGTA demonstrated no significant effect on meningococcal adherence to and invasion into host cells. Taken together, these results indicate that meningococci induce calcium release from intracellular stores of host endothelial cells via PilC1 and cytoplasmic calcium concentrations play a critical role during PilC1 mediated meningococcal adherence to and subsequent invasion into host endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2057669673,"Introduction The use of accelerometers to objectively measure physical activity (PA) has become the most preferred method of choice in recent years. Traditionally, cutpoints are used to assign impulse counts recorded by the devices to sedentary and activity ranges. Here, hidden Markov models (HMM) are used to improve the cutpoint method to achieve a more accurate identification of the sequence of modes of PA. Methods 1,000 days of labeled accelerometer data have been simulated. For the simulated data the actual sedentary behavior and activity range of each count is known. The cutpoint method is compared with HMMs based on the Poisson distribution (HMM[Pois]), the generalized Poisson distribution (HMM[GenPois]) and the Gaussian distribution (HMM[Gauss]) with regard to misclassification rate (MCR), bout detection, detection of the number of activities performed during the day and runtime. Results The cutpoint method had a misclassification rate (MCR) of 11% followed by HMM[Pois] with 8%, HMM[GenPois] with 3% and HMM[Gauss] having the best MCR with less than 2%. HMM[Gauss] detected the correct number of bouts in 12.8% of the days, HMM[GenPois] in 16.1%, HMM[Pois] and the cutpoint method in none. HMM[GenPois] identified the correct number of activities in 61.3% of the days, whereas HMM[Gauss] only in 26.8%. HMM[Pois] did not identify the correct number at all and seemed to overestimate the number of activities. Runtime varied between 0.01 seconds (cutpoint), 2.0 minutes (HMM[Gauss]) and 14.2 minutes (HMM[GenPois]). Conclusions Using simulated data, HMM-based methods were superior in activity classification when compared to the traditional cutpoint method and seem to be appropriate to model accelerometer data. Of the HMM-based methods, HMM[Gauss] seemed to be the most appropriate choice to assess real-life accelerometer data."
https://openalex.org/W2143241253,"Background Aspartic peptidase inhibitors have shown antimicrobial action against distinct microorganisms. Due to an increase in the occurrence of Chagas' disease/AIDS co-infection, we decided to explore the effects of HIV aspartic peptidase inhibitors (HIV-PIs) on Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease. Methodology and Principal Findings HIV-PIs presented an anti-proliferative action on epimastigotes of T. cruzi clone Dm28c, with IC50 values ranging from 0.6 to 14 µM. The most effective inhibitors, ritonavir, lopinavir and nelfinavir, also had an anti-proliferative effect against different phylogenetic T. cruzi strains. The HIV-PIs induced some morphological alterations in clone Dm28c epimastigotes, as reduced cell size and swollen of the cellular body. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the flagellar membrane, mitochondrion and reservosomes are the main targets of HIV-PIs in T. cruzi epimastigotes. Curiously, an increase in the epimastigote-into-trypomastigote differentiation process of clone Dm28c was observed, with many of these parasites presenting morphological alterations including the detachment of flagellum from the cell body. The pre-treatment with the most effective HIV-PIs drastically reduced the interaction process between epimastigotes and the invertebrate vector Rhodnius prolixus. It was also noted that HIV-PIs induced an increase in the expression of gp63-like and calpain-related molecules, and decreased the cruzipain expression in epimastigotes as judged by flow cytometry and immunoblotting assays. The hydrolysis of a cathepsin D fluorogenic substrate was inhibited by all HIV-PIs in a dose-dependent manner, showing that the aspartic peptidase could be a possible target to these drugs. Additionally, we verified that ritonavir, lopinavir and nelfinavir reduced drastically the viability of clone Dm28c trypomastigotes, causing many morphological damages. Conclusions and Significance The results contribute to understand the possible role of aspartic peptidases in T. cruzi physiology, adding new in vitro insights into the possibility of exploiting the use of HIV-PIs in the clinically relevant forms of the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1991274153,"Here, we have synthesized Ag2O3-ZnO nanocones (NCs) by a wet-chemical route using reducing agents at low temperature. The structural, optical and morphological properties of Ag2O3-ZnO NCs were investigated by several conventional techniques such as powder XRD, XPS, FESEM, XEDS, FTIR and UV/vis. spectroscopy. The analytical parameters of prepared NCs were also calculated for a selective detection of divalent cobalt [Co(II)] prior to its determination by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The selectivity of NCs toward various metal ions, including Cd(II), Co(II), Cr(III), Cu(II), Fe(III), Ni(II), and Zn(II) was studied. Results of the selectivity study demonstrated that Ag2O3-ZnO NC phase was the most selective towards Co(II) ion. The uptake capacity for Co(II) ion was experimentally calculated to be ∼76.69 mgg-1. Moreover, adsorption isotherm data provided that the adsorption process was mainly monolayer on homogeneous adsorbent surfaces of Ag2O3-ZnO NCs. Kinetic study revealed that the adsorption of Co(II) on Ag2O3-ZnO NCs phase followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. In addition, thermodynamic results provided that the adsorption mechanism of Co(II) ions on Ag2O3-ZnO NCs was a spontaneous process and thermodynamically favorable. Finally, the proposed method was validated by applying it to real environmental water samples with reasonable results."
https://openalex.org/W2032622459,"Idiopathic focal eosinophilic enteritis (IFEE) is an emerging cause of abdominal pain (colic) in horses that frequently requires surgical intervention to prevent death. The epidemiology of IFEE is poorly understood and it is difficult to diagnose pre-operatively. The aetiology of this condition and methods of possible prevention are currently unknown. The aims of this study were to investigate temporal and spatial heterogeneity in IFEE risk and to ascertain the effect of horse age on risk.A retrospective, nested case-control study was undertaken using data from 85 IFEE cases and 848 randomly selected controls admitted to a UK equine hospital for exploratory laparotomy to investigate the cause of colic over a 10-year period. Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to quantify temporal and age effects on the odds of IFEE and to provide mapped estimates of 'residual' risk over the study region. The relative risk of IFEE increased over the study period (p = 0.001) and a seasonal pattern was evident (p<0.01) with greatest risk of IFEE being identified between the months of July and November. IFEE risk decreased with increasing age (p<0.001) with younger (0-5 years old) horses being at greatest risk. The mapped surface estimate exhibited significantly atypical sub-regions (p<0.001) with increased IFEE risk in horses residing in the North-West of the study region.IFEE was found to exhibit both spatial and temporal variation in risk and is more likely to occur in younger horses. This information may help to identify horses at increased risk of IFEE, provide clues about the aetiology of this condition and to identify areas that require further research."
https://openalex.org/W2132143909,"Escherichia coli α-hemolysin (HlyA) is a pore-forming protein of 110 kDa belonging to the family of RTX toxins. A hydrophobic region between the amino acid residues 238 and 410 in the N-terminal half of HlyA has previously been suggested to form hydrophobic and/or amphipathic α-helices and has been shown to be important for hemolytic activity and pore formation in biological and artificial membranes. The structure of the HlyA transmembrane channel is, however, largely unknown. For further investigation of the channel structure, we deleted in HlyA different stretches of amino acids that could form amphipathic β-strands according to secondary structure predictions (residues 71–110, 158–167, 180–203, and 264–286). These deletions resulted in HlyA mutants with strongly reduced hemolytic activity. Lipid bilayer measurements demonstrated that HlyAΔ71–110 and HlyAΔ264–286 formed channels with much smaller single-channel conductance than wildtype HlyA, whereas their channel-forming activity was virtually as high as that of the wildtype toxin. HlyAΔ158–167 and HlyAΔ180–203 were unable to form defined channels in lipid bilayers. Calculations based on the single-channel data indicated that the channels generated by HlyAΔ71–110 and HlyAΔ264–286 had a smaller size (diameter about 1.4 to 1.8 nm) than wildtype HlyA channels (diameter about 2.0 to 2.6 nm), suggesting that in these mutants part of the channel-forming domain was removed. Osmotic protection experiments with erythrocytes confirmed that HlyA, HlyAΔ71–110, and HlyAΔ264–286 form defined transmembrane pores and suggested channel diameters that largely agreed with those estimated from the single-channel data. Taken together, these results suggest that the channel-forming domain of HlyA might contain β-strands, possibly in addition to α-helical structures."
https://openalex.org/W2010181565,"To investigate the efficacy and mechanism of tacrolimus(FK506), which is a novel macrolide immunosuppressant, in inhibiting triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) expression in a murine keratitis model induced by Aspergillus fumigatus.TREM-1 was detected in 11 fungus-infected human corneas by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RAW264.7 macrophages were divided into four groups, which received treatment with zymosan (100 µg/ml), zymosan (100 µg/ml) + mTREM-1/Fc protein (1 µg/ml), or zymosan (100 µg/ml) + FK506 (20 µM) or negative-control treatment. After this treatment, the expression of TREM-1, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) was assayed using qRT-PCR and ELISA. The mouse model of fungal keratitis was created by intrastromal injection with Aspergillus fumigatus, and the mice were divided into 2 groups: group A received vehicle eye drops 4 times each day, and group B received 4 doses of FK506 eye drops each day. Corneal damage was evaluated by clinical scoring and histologic examination,and myeloperoxidase (MPO) protein levels were also detected by ELISA. The expression of TREM-1, IL-1β and TNFα was then determined at different time points using qRT-PCR and ELISA.TREM-1 expression dramatically increased in the human corneas with fungal keratitis. In contrast, FK506 reduced the expression of TREM-1, IL-1β and TNFα in RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with zymosan. In the mouse model, at day 1 post-infection, the corneal score of the FK506-treated group was lower than that of the control, and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration was diminished. TREM-1, IL-1β and TNFα expression was significantly reduced at the same time point. However, the statistically significant differences in cytokine expression, clinical scores and infiltration disappeared at 5 days post-infection.FK506 may inhibit the inflammation induced by fungi and alleviate the severity of corneal damage at an early stage of fungal keratitis by downregulating TREM-1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2100104499,"Several risk stratification instruments for postoperative delirium in older people have been developed because early interventions may prevent delirium. We investigated the performance and agreement of nine commonly used risk stratification instruments in an independent validation cohort of consecutive elective and emergency surgical patients aged ≥50 years with ≥1 risk factor for postoperative delirium. Data was collected prospectively. Delirium was diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. The observed incidence of postoperative delirium was calculated per risk score per risk stratification instrument. In addition, the risk stratification instruments were compared in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and positive and negative predictive value. Finally, the positive agreement between the risk stratification instruments was calculated. When data required for an exact implementation of the original risk stratification instruments was not available, we used alternative data that was comparable. The study population included 292 patients: 60% men; mean age (SD), 66 (8) years; 90% elective surgery. The incidence of postoperative delirium was 9%. The maximum observed incidence per risk score was 50% (95%CI, 15-85%); for eight risk stratification instruments, the maximum observed incidence per risk score was ≤25%. The AUC (95%CI) for the risk stratification instruments varied between 0.50 (0.36-0.64) and 0.66 (0.48-0.83). No AUC was statistically significant from 0.50 (p≥0.11). Positive predictive values of the risk stratification instruments varied between 0-25%, negative predictive values between 89-95%. Positive agreement varied between 0-66%. No risk stratification instrument showed clearly superior performance. In conclusion, in this independent validation cohort, the performance and agreement of commonly used risk stratification instruments for postoperative delirium was poor. Although some caution is needed because the risk stratification instruments were not implemented exactly as described in the original studies, we think that their usefulness in clinical practice can be questioned."
https://openalex.org/W1970293579,"Background and Purpose Contrast enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) can help to overcome the limitations of other techniques to clearly display the details of cerebral aneurysms at 1.5-T MR system. We investigated the prevalence of unruptured cerebral aneurysms (UCAs) using three dimensional (3D) CE-MRA in a tertiary comprehensive hospital in China. Materials and Methods The cases were prospectively recorded at our hospital between February 2009 and October 2010. 3D CE-MRA, interpreted by 2 observers blinded to the participants’ information, was used to identify the location and size of UCAs and to estimate the overall, age-specific, and sex-specific prevalence. Results Of the 3993 patients (men: women = 2159∶1834), 408 UCAs were found in 350 patients (men: women = 151∶199). The prevalence was 8.8% overall (95% CI, 8.0–10.0%), with 7.0% for men (CI, 6.0–8.0%) and 10.9% for women (CI, 9.0–12.0%). The overall prevalence of UCAs was higher in women than in men (P<0.001) and increased with age both in men and women. Prevalence peaked at age group 75–80 years. Forty-two patients (11.7%) had multiple aneurysms, including 10 (2.9%) male patients and 32 (9.1%) female patients. The most common site of aneurysm was the carotid siphon, and most lesions (71.3%) had a maximum diameter of 3−5 mm. Conclusion This hospital-based prevalence study suggested a high prevalence (8.8%) of UCAs and most lesions (71.3%) had a maximum diameter of 3–5 mm observed by 3D CE-MRA. Because the rupture of small cerebral aneurysms was not uncommon, an appropriate follow-up care strategy must be formulated."
https://openalex.org/W2022135565,"Small, early life stages, such as zebrafish embryos are increasingly used to assess the biological effects of chemical compounds in vivo. However, behavioural screens of such organisms are challenging in terms of both data collection (culture techniques, drug delivery and imaging) and data evaluation (very large data sets), restricting the use of high throughput systems compared to in vitro assays. Here, we combine the use of a microfluidic flow-through culture system, or BioWell plate, with a novel motion analysis technique, (sparse optic flow - SOF) followed by spectral analysis (discrete Fourier transformation - DFT), as a first step towards automating data extraction and analysis for such screenings. Replicate zebrafish embryos housed in a BioWell plate within a custom-built imaging system were subject to a chemical exposure (1.5% ethanol). Embryo movement was videoed before (30 min), during (60 min) and after (60 min) exposure and SOF was then used to extract data on movement (angles of rotation and angular changes to the centre of mass of embryos). DFT was subsequently used to quantify the movement patterns exhibited during these periods and Multidimensional Scaling and ANOSIM were used to test for differences. Motion analysis revealed that zebrafish had significantly altered movements during both the second half of the alcohol exposure period and also the second half of the recovery period compared to their pre-treatment movements. Manual quantification of tail flicking revealed the same differences between exposure-periods as detected using the automated approach. However, the automated approach also incorporates other movements visible in the organism such as blood flow and heart beat, and has greater power to discern environmentally-driven changes in the behaviour and physiology of organisms. We suggest that combining these technologies could provide a highly efficient, high throughput assay, for assessing whole embryo responses to various drugs and chemicals."

VCP is located on chromosome 9p13-p12, a region often deleted in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The clinical significance of VCP expression in OSCC however remains unclear. In this study, expression of VCP was determined in 106 patients (77 male (71.3%) and 31 female (28.7%); age-range: 34-79 years (mean age 57 years)) by immunohistochemistry and in a subset of 15 patients by quantitative PCR. HPV-DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction and p16INK4a immunohistochemistry. The experimental findings were correlated with clinico-pathological data and survival parameters. 47.2% of all OSCC specimens were analyzed as negative or weak staining intensity for VCP. 52.8% of all specimens showed a high staining intensity for VCP. 73.1% of all patients were tested HPV-negative, 26.9% were HPV-positive. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival probabilities of all patients were 71.2% and 55.7%, respectively. No correlation could be found between HPV-status and VCP expression. VCP overexpression in HPV-negative patients was associated with significantly better 5-year disease-free survival (86.4% vs., 45.6%, p = 0.017). The level of VCP-intensity determined by immunohistochemistry could be an additional prognostic marker in HPV-negative OSCC. VCP expression seems not to correlate with the HPV-status."
https://openalex.org/W2007081035,"Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in retinal signal processing, but its cellular actions are only partly understood. An established source of retinal NO are NOACs, a group of nNOS-expressing amacrine cells which signal onto bipolar, other amacrine and ganglion cells in the inner plexiform layer. Here, we report that NO regulates glutamate responses in morphologically and electrophysiologically identified type 4 OFF cone bipolar cells through activation of the soluble guanylyl cyclase-cGMP-PKG pathway. The glutamate response of these cells consists of two components, a fast phasic current sensitive to kainate receptor agonists, and a secondary component with slow kinetics, inhibited by AMPA receptor antagonists. NO shortened the duration of the AMPA receptor-dependent component of the glutamate response, while the kainate receptor-dependent component remained unchanged. Application of 8-Br-cGMP mimicked this effect, while inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase or protein kinase G prevented it, supporting a mechanism involving a cGMP signaling pathway. Notably, perfusion with a NOS-inhibitor prolonged the duration of the glutamate response, while the NO precursor L-arginine shortened it, in agreement with a modulation by endogenous NO. Furthermore, NO accelerated the response recovery during repeated stimulation of type 4 cone bipolar cells, suggesting that the temporal response properties of this OFF bipolar cell type are regulated by NO. These results reveal a novel cellular mechanism of NO signaling in the retina, and represent the first functional evidence of NO modulating OFF cone bipolar cells."
https://openalex.org/W2089375759,"Purpose The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. We investigated potential associations between MetS and asymptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis (ICAS) in a general population. Methods The community-based “Asymptomatic Polyvascular Abnormalities in Community Study” examined asymptomatic polyvascular abnormalities in a Chinese population aged 40+ years without history of stroke and coronary heart disease. MetS was defined by the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Asymptomatic ICAS was diagnosed by transcranial color-coded Doppler sonography. Results Out of 5393 study participants, asymptomatic ICAS was detected in 713 (13.2%) participants, and MetS in 1323 (24.5%) individuals. Prevalence of asymptomatic ICAS increased significantly from 7.5% to 24.2% with increasing number of MetS components. After adjusting for age, gender, physical activity, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, MetS was significantly associated with asymptomatic ICAS (OR: 1.50; 95%CI: 1.23,1.83). Compared with the subgroup without MetS, the ORs for asymptomatic ICAS increased (P<0.0001) for each of 5 components of MetS from 1.71 (95%CI: 1.27,2.30), to 2.20 (95%CI: 1.63,2.98), 2.79 (95CI: 2.01,3.88), 3.08 (95%CI: 2.11,4.51) and 4.27 (95%CI: 2.22,8.20). Conclusions In multivariate analysis, MetS was an independent and additional factor associated with asymptomatic ICAS. Study participants with 5 MetS components had a 4 times higher risk of asymptomatic ICAS than participants with no MetS component."
https://openalex.org/W1965021105,"Accurate estimation of soil water retention curve (SWRC) at the dry region is required to describe the relation between soil water content and matric suction from saturation to oven dryness. In this study, the extrapolative capability of two models for predicting the complete SWRC from limited ranges of soil water retention data was evaluated. When the model parameters were obtained from SWRC data in the 0-1500 kPa range, the FX model (Fredlund and Xing, 1994) estimations agreed well with measurements from saturation to oven dryness with RMSEs less than 0.01. The GG model (Groenevelt and Grant, 2004) produced larger errors at the dry region, with significantly larger RMSEs and MEs than the FX model. Further evaluations indicated that when SWRC measurements in the 0-100 kPa suction range was applied for model establishment, the FX model was capable of producing acceptable SWRCs across the entire water content range. For a higher accuracy, the FX model requires soil water retention data at least in the 0- to 300-kPa range to extend the SWRC to oven dryness. Comparing with the Khlosi et al. (2006) model, which requires measurements in the 0-500 kPa range to reproduce the complete SWRCs, the FX model has the advantage of requiring less SWRC measurements. Thus the FX modeling approach has the potential to eliminate the processes for measuring soil water retention in the dry range."
https://openalex.org/W1975487447,"Past research has shown that position in a social hierarchy modulates one's social attention, as in the gaze cueing effect. While studies have manipulated the social status of others with whom the participants interact, we believe that a sense of one's own social power is also a crucial factor affecting gaze following. In two experiments, we primed the social power of participants, using different approaches, to investigate the participants' performance in a subsequent gaze cueing task. The results of Experiment 1 showed a stronger gaze cueing effect among participants who were primed with low social power, compared to those primed with high social power. Our predicted gender difference (i.e., women showing a stronger gaze cueing effect than men) was confirmed and this effect was found to be dominated by the lower social power condition. Experiment 2 manipulated the level of danger in the context and replicated the joint impact of gender and one's perceived social power on gaze cueing effect, especially in the low danger context, in comparison to the high danger context. These findings demonstrate that one's perceived social power has a concerted effect on social attention evoked by gaze, along with other factors such as gender and characteristics of the environment, and suggest the importance of further research on the complex relationship between an individual's position in the social hierarchy and social attention."
https://openalex.org/W1987042220,"Genotype 2a JFH1 virus has substantially contributed to the progress of HCV biology by allowing entire viral life cycle of HCV in cell culture. Using this genotype 2a virus, casein kinase II (CKII) was previously identified as a crucial host factor in virus assembly by phosphorylating NS5A. Since most of the prior studies employed genotype 2a JFH1 or JFH1-based intragenotypic chimera, we used genotype 1a H77S to study virus assembly. CKII inhibition by chemical inhibitors enhanced H77S virus production in contrast to that of JFH1 virus, but genetic inhibition of CKII by siRNA did not change H77S virus titer significantly. The different outcomes from these two approaches of CKII inhibition suggested that nonspecific target kinase of CKII inhibitors plays a role in increasing H77S virus production and both viral and host factors were investigated in this study. Our results emphasize substantial differences among the HCV genotypes that should be considered in both basic research and clinical practices."
https://openalex.org/W1971483040,"Daily temperature measures are commonly used when examining the association between temperature and mortality. In fact, temperature measures are available 24 hours a day and more detailed records may provide a better prediction of mortality compared to daily statistics. In this article, monthly stratified analysis modeling for mortality is conducted for the total population as well as the stratified elderly and younger subgroups. We identified the most significant time during the day that is associated with daily mortality. Surprisingly, the estimates of relative risk and magnitude of associations derived from the hourly temperature measures are similar or even stronger compared to those modeled by the daily statistics. This phenomenon remains true for lagged hourly temperature measures and the changing patterns of associations from January through December are revealed. In summary, people are the most vulnerable to temperature variations in the early morning around 5 am and the night time around 8 pm."
https://openalex.org/W2115357366,"Temporary orthodontic mini implants serve as anchorage devices in orthodontic treatments. Often, they are inserted in the jaw bones, between the roots of the teeth. The stability of the mini implants within the bone is one of the major factors affecting their success and, consequently, that of the orthodontic treatment. Bone mechanical properties are important for implant stability. The aim of this study was to determine the tensile properties of the alveolar and basal mandible bones in a swine model. The diametral compression test was employed to study the properties in two orthogonal directions: mesio-distal and occluso-gingival. Small cylindrical cortical bone specimens (2.6 mm diameter, 1.5 mm thickness) were obtained from 7 mandibles using a trephine drill. The sites included different locations (anterior and posterior) and aspects (buccal and lingual) for a total of 16 specimens from each mandible. The load-displacement curves were continuously monitored while loading half of the specimens in the oclluso-gingival direction and half in the mesio-distal direction. The stiffness was calculated from the linear portion of the curve. The mesio-distal direction was 31% stiffer than the occluso-gingival direction. The basal bone was 40% stiffer than the alveolar bone. The posterior zone was 46% stiffer than the anterior zone. The lingual aspect was stiffer than the buccal aspect. Although bone specimens do not behave as brittle materials, the diametral compression test can be adequately used for determining tensile behavior when only small bone specimens can be obtained. In conclusion, to obtain maximal orthodontic mini implant stability, the force components on the implants should be oriented mostly in the mesio-distal direction."
https://openalex.org/W2170634221,"The understanding of how Gram-positive bacteria divide and ensure the correct localization of different molecular machineries, such as those involved in the synthesis of the bacterial cell surface, is crucial to design strategies to fight bacterial infections. In order to determine the correct subcellular localization of fluorescent proteins in Streptococcus pneumoniae, we have previously described tools to express derivatives of four fluorescent proteins, mCherry, Citrine, CFP and GFP, to levels that allow visualization by fluorescence microscopy, by fusing the first ten amino acids of the S. pneumoniae protein Wze (the i-tag), upstream of the fluorescent protein. Here, we report that these tools can also be used in other Gram-positive bacteria, namely Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, possibly due to optimized translation rates. Additionally, we have optimized the i-tag by testing the effect of the first ten amino acids of other pneumococcal proteins in the increased expression of the fluorescent protein Citrine. We found that manipulating the structure and stability of the 5' end of the mRNA molecule, which may influence the accessibility of the ribosome, is determinant to ensure the expression of a strong fluorescent signal."
