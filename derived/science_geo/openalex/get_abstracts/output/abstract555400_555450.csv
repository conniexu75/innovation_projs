This study estimated the national incidence of falls and fall-related injuries among community-dwelling U.S. adults by age and gender and the trends in fall-related injuries across the adult life span.Nationally representative data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 2008 Balance and Dizziness supplement was used to develop national estimates of falls, and pooled data from the NHIS was used to calculate estimates of fall-related injuries in the U.S. and related trends from 2004-2013. Costs of unintentional fall-related injuries were extracted from the CDC's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System.Twelve percent of community-dwelling U.S. adults reported falling in the previous year for a total estimate of 80 million falls at a rate of 37.2 falls per 100 person-years. On average, 9.9 million fall-related injuries occurred each year with a rate of 4.38 fall-related injuries per 100 person-years. In the previous three months, 2.0% of older adults (65+), 1.1% of middle-aged adults (45-64) and 0.7% of young adults (18-44) reported a fall-related injury. Of all fall-related injuries among community-dwelling adults, 32.3% occurred among older adults, 35.3% among middle-aged adults and 32.3% among younger adults. The age-adjusted rate of fall-related injuries increased 4% per year among older women (95% CI 1%-7%) from 2004 to 2013. Among U.S. adults, the total lifetime cost of annual unintentional fall-related injuries that resulted in a fatality, hospitalization or treatment in an emergency department was 111 billion U.S. dollars in 2010.Falls and fall-related injuries represent a significant health and safety problem for adults of all ages. The findings suggest that adult fall prevention efforts should consider the entire adult lifespan to ensure a greater public health benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2302367542,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a high incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) related to obesity and insulin resistance. Currently, medical interventions for NAFLD have focused on diet control and exercise to reduce body weight, and there is a requirement for effective pharmacological therapies. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral antidiabetic drugs that promote the urinary excretion of glucose by blocking its reabsorption in renal proximal tubules. SGLT2 inhibitors lower blood glucose independent of insulin action and are expected to reduce body weight because of urinary calorie loss. Here we show that an SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin improves hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet-induced and leptin-deficient (ob/ob) obese mice irrespective of body weight reduction. In the obese mice, ipragliflozin-induced hyperphagia occurred to increase energy intake, attenuating body weight reduction with increased epididymal fat mass. There is an inverse correlation between weights of liver and epididymal fat in ipragliflozin-treated obese mice, suggesting that ipragliflozin treatment promotes normotopic fat accumulation in the epididymal fat and prevents ectopic fat accumulation in the liver. Despite increased adiposity, ipragliflozin ameliorates obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance in epididymal fat. Clinically, ipragliflozin improves liver dysfunction in patients with T2DM irrespective of body weight reduction. These findings provide new insight into the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on energy homeostasis and fat accumulation and indicate their potential therapeutic efficacy in T2DM-associated hepatic steatosis."

The intricate mechanism of concerted primer synthesis by two catalytic centers was an enigma for over three decades. Here we report the crystal structures of two key complexes, the human primosome and the C-terminal domain of the primase large subunit (p58C) with bound DNA/RNA duplex. These structures, along with analysis of primase/polymerase activities, provide a plausible mechanism for all transactions of the primosome including initiation, elongation, accurate counting of RNA primer length, primer transfer to Polα, and concerted autoregulation of alternate activation/inhibition of the catalytic centers. Our findings reveal a central role of p58C in the coordinated actions of two catalytic domains in the primosome and ultimately could impact the design of anticancer drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2299576776,"Parkin, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, is mutated in most cases of autosomal recessive early onset Parkinson disease. It was discovered that Parkin is also mutated in glioblastoma and other human malignancies and that it inhibits tumor cell growth. Here, we identified pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) as a unique substrate for parkin through biochemical purification. We found that parkin interacts with PKM2 both in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction dramatically increases during glucose starvation. Ubiquitylation of PKM2 by parkin does not affect its stability but decreases its enzymatic activity. Parkin regulates the glycolysis pathway and affects the cell metabolism. Our studies revealed the novel important roles of parkin in tumor cell metabolism and provided new insight for therapy of Parkinson disease."
https://openalex.org/W2299402461,"Introduction Prompted by recent amendments of Yellow Fever (YF) vaccination guidelines from boost to single vaccination strategy and the paucity of clinical data to support this adjustment, we used the profile of the YF-specific CD8+ T-cell subset profiles after primary vaccination and neutralizing antibodies as a proxy for potentially longer lasting immunity. Methods and Findings PBMCs and serum were collected in six individuals on days 0, 3, 5, 12, 28 and 180, and in 99 individuals >10 years after YF-vaccination. Phenotypic characteristics of YF- tetramer+ CD8+ T-cells were determined using class I tetramers. Antibody responses were measured using a standardized plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Also, characteristics of YF-tetramer positive CD8+ T-cells were compared between individuals who had received a primary- and a booster vaccination. YF-tetramer+ CD8+ T-cells were detectable on day 12 (median tetramer+ cells as percentage of CD8+ T-cells 0.2%, range 0.07–3.1%). On day 180, these cells were still present (median 0.06%, range 0.02–0.78%). The phenotype of YF-tetramer positive CD8+ T-cells shifted from acute phase effector cells on day 12, to late differentiated or effector memory phenotype (CD45RA-/+CD27-) on day 28. Two subsets of YF-tetramer positive T-cells (CD45RA+CD27- and CD45RA+CD27+) persisted until day 180. Within all phenotypic subsets, the T-bet: Eomes ratio tended to be high on day 28 after vaccination and shifted towards predominant Eomes expression on day 180 (median 6.0 (day 28) vs. 2.2 (day 180) p = 0.0625), suggestive of imprinting compatible with long-lived memory properties. YF-tetramer positive CD8+ T-cells were detectable up to 18 years post vaccination, YF-specific antibodies were detectable up to 40 years after single vaccination. Booster vaccination did not increase titers of YF-specific antibodies (mean 12.5 vs. 13.1, p = 0.583), nor induce frequencies or alter phenotypes of YF-tetramer+ CD8+ T-cells. Conclusion The presence of a functionally competent YF-specific memory T-cell pool 18 years and sufficient titers of neutralizing antibodies 35–40 years after first vaccination suggest that single vaccination may be sufficient to provide long-term immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2298603048,"A hybrid crystal structure of Mycobacterium smegmatis mycocerosic acid synthase, a multienzyme involved in the biosynthesis of mycobacterial branched-chain fatty acids, exemplifies the organization of fully-reducing polyketide synthases. Mycocerosic acid synthase (MAS) is a mycobacterial polyketide synthase (PKS) responsible for the biosynthesis of C20–C28 branched-chain fatty acids, key components of the specialized mycobacterial cell wall. These authors report a hybrid crystal structure of MAS from Mycobacterium smegmatis. Many commonly used drugs are either naturally occurring polyketides or their derivatives. This work represents the first high-quality model of a full PKS module, and it could be used to help dissect and re-engineer other PKSs to make new, non-natural polyketides. Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are biosynthetic factories that produce natural products with important biological and pharmacological activities1,2,3. Their exceptional product diversity is encoded in a modular architecture. Modular PKSs (modPKSs) catalyse reactions colinear to the order of modules in an assembly line3, whereas iterative PKSs (iPKSs) use a single module iteratively as exemplified by fungal iPKSs (fiPKSs)3. However, in some cases non-colinear iterative action is also observed for modPKSs modules and is controlled by the assembly line environment4,5. PKSs feature a structural and functional separation into a condensing and a modifying region as observed for fatty acid synthases6. Despite the outstanding relevance of PKSs, the detailed organization of PKSs with complete fully reducing modifying regions remains elusive. Here we report a hybrid crystal structure of Mycobacterium smegmatis mycocerosic acid synthase based on structures of its condensing and modifying regions. Mycocerosic acid synthase is a fully reducing iPKS, closely related to modPKSs, and the prototype of mycobacterial mycocerosic acid synthase-like7,8 PKSs. It is involved in the biosynthesis of C20–C28 branched-chain fatty acids, which are important virulence factors of mycobacteria9. Our structural data reveal a dimeric linker-based organization of the modifying region and visualize dynamics and conformational coupling in PKSs. On the basis of comparative small-angle X-ray scattering, the observed modifying region architecture may be common also in modPKSs. The linker-based organization provides a rationale for the characteristic variability of PKS modules as a main contributor to product diversity. The comprehensive architectural model enables functional dissection and re-engineering of PKSs."
https://openalex.org/W2297854714,"Incomplete premelting at the edges of monolayer colloidal crystals is triggered by a bulk solid–solid phase transition and truncated by a mechanical instability that induces homogeneous bulk melting of the crystal; these observations challenge existing theories of two-dimensional melting. When a crystal melts, it typically melts from the surfaces, starting with the formation of liquid-like 'premelt' surface layers at temperatures slightly below the melting point. In an effort to understand the mechanistic details of this process, Yilong Han and colleagues have investigated the melting behaviour of two-dimensional (monolayer, two-layer and three-layer) colloidal crystals — model systems whose dynamics can be followed at the single particle level. They observe a variety of surface premelting, bulk-melting and solid–solid phase-transition phenomena, the interplay of which challenges current premelting and melting theories. Crystal surfaces typically melt into a thin liquid layer at temperatures slightly below the melting point of the crystal. Such surface premelting is prevalent in all classes of solids and is important in a variety of metallurgical, geological and meteorological phenomena1. Premelting has been studied using X-ray diffraction2 and differential scanning calorimetry3, but the lack of single-particle resolution makes it hard to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Colloids are good model systems for studying phase transitions4 because the thermal motions of individual micrometre-sized particles can be tracked directly using optical microscopy5. Here we use colloidal spheres with tunable attractions to form equilibrium crystal–vapour interfaces, and study their surface premelting behaviour at the single-particle level. We find that monolayer colloidal crystals exhibit incomplete premelting at their perimeter, with a constant liquid-layer thickness. In contrast, two- and three-layer crystals exhibit conventional complete melting, with the thickness of the surface liquid diverging as the melting point is approached. The microstructures of the surface liquids differ in certain aspects from what would be predicted by conventional premelting theories. Incomplete premelting in the monolayer crystals is triggered by a bulk isostructural solid–solid transition and truncated by a mechanical instability that separately induces homogeneous melting within the bulk. This finding is in contrast to the conventional assumption that two-dimensional crystals melt heterogeneously from their free surfaces3,6 (that is, at the solid–vapour interface). The unexpected bulk melting that we observe for the monolayer crystals is accompanied by the formation of grain boundaries, which supports a previously proposed grain-boundary-mediated two-dimensional melting theory7. The observed interplay between surface premelting, bulk melting and solid–solid transitions challenges existing theories of surface premelting and two-dimensional melting."
https://openalex.org/W2299251143,"To describe antenatal findings and evaluate prenatal risk parameters for adverse outcome or need for intervention in fetuses with congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM).In our retrospective study all fetuses with a prenatal diagnosis of CPAM detected in our tertiary referral center between 2002 and 2013 were analyzed. Sonographic findings were noted and measurements of mass-to-thorax-ratio (MTR), congenital pulmonary airway malformation volume-ratio (CVR) and observed to expected lung-to head-ratio (o/e LHR) were conducted and correlated to fetal or neonatal morbidity and mortality and/or need for prenatal intervention.67 fetuses with CPAM were included in the study. Hydropic fetuses were observed in 16.4% (11/67) of cases, prenatal intervention was undertaken in 9 cases; 7 pregnancies were terminated. The survival rate of non-hydropic fetuses with conservatively managed CPAM was 98.0% (50/51), the survival rate for hydropic fetuses with intention to treat was 42.9% (3/7). 10 (18.2%) children needed respiratory assistance. Fetuses with a CVR of <0.91 were significantly less likely to experience adverse outcome or need for prenatal intervention with sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive value of 0.89, 0.71, 0.62 and 0.93, respectively. A MTR (mass-to-thorax-ratio) of < 0.51 had a positive predictive value of 0.54 and a negative predictive value of 0.96 of adverse events with a sensitivity of 0.95 and a specificity of 0.63. The negative predictive value for o/e LHR of 45% was 0.84 with sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 0.73, 0.68 and 0.52, respectively.The majority of cases with CPAM have a favorable outcome. MTR and CVR are able to identify fetuses at risk, the o/e LHR is less sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W2302432179,"Large scale, high-resolution global data on farm animal distributions are essential for spatially explicit assessments of the epidemiological, environmental and socio-economic impacts of the livestock sector. This has been the major motivation behind the development of the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, which has been extensively used since its first publication in 2007. The database relies on a downscaling methodology whereby census counts of animals in sub-national administrative units are redistributed at the level of grid cells as a function of a series of spatial covariates. The recent upgrade of GLW1 to GLW2 involved automating the processing, improvement of input data, and downscaling at a spatial resolution of 1 km per cell (5 km per cell in the earlier version). The underlying statistical methodology, however, remained unchanged. In this paper, we evaluate new methods to downscale census data with a higher accuracy and increased processing efficiency. Two main factors were evaluated, based on sample census datasets of cattle in Africa and chickens in Asia. First, we implemented and evaluated Random Forest models (RF) instead of stratified regressions. Second, we investigated whether models that predicted the number of animals per rural person (per capita) could provide better downscaled estimates than the previous approach that predicted absolute densities (animals per km2). RF models consistently provided better predictions than the stratified regressions for both continents and species. The benefit of per capita over absolute density models varied according to the species and continent. In addition, different technical options were evaluated to reduce the processing time while maintaining their predictive power. Future GLW runs (GLW 3.0) will apply the new RF methodology with optimized modelling options. The potential benefit of per capita models will need to be further investigated with a better distinction between rural and agricultural populations."

Studies investigating mechanisms whereby peptide ligands activate GLP-1R have utilized mutagenesis, receptor chimeras, photo-affinity labeling, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and crystallography of the ligand-binding ectodomain to establish receptor homology models. However, this has not enabled the design or discovery of drug-like non-peptide GLP-1R activators. Recently, studies investigating 4-(3-benzyloxyphenyl)-2-ethylsulfinyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine (BETP), a GLP-1R-positive allosteric modulator, determined that Cys-347 in the GLP-1R is required for positive allosteric modulator activity via covalent modification. To advance small molecule activation of the GLP-1R, we characterized the insulinotropic mechanism of BETP. In guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding and INS1 832-3 insulinoma cell cAMP assays, BETP enhanced GLP-1(9–36)-NH2-stimulated cAMP signaling. Using isolated pancreatic islets, BETP potentiated insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner that requires both the peptide ligand and GLP-1R. In studies of the covalent mechanism, PAGE fluorography showed labeling of GLP-1R in immunoprecipitation experiments from GLP-1R-expressing cells incubated with [3H]BETP. Furthermore, we investigated whether other reported GLP-1R activators and compounds identified from screening campaigns modulate GLP-1R by covalent modification. Similar to BETP, several molecules were found to enhance GLP-1R signaling in a Cys-347-dependent manner. These chemotypes are electrophiles that react with GSH, and LC/MS determined the cysteine adducts formed upon conjugation. Together, our results suggest covalent modification may be used to stabilize the GLP-1R in an active conformation.

Although the structures were determined using receptor constructs that did not include the ECD sequences, data from both predict very deep and open V-shaped binding crevices for the orthosteric ligands (10.Hollenstein K. de Graaf C.

Discov. 2008; 7: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar), small molecule agonists have not been developed. One hypothesis for this intractability of class B GPCRs is that the intricate nature of receptor activation renders it challenging to identify low molecular weight non-peptide orthosteric ligands that make sufficient high affinity receptor contacts over large interaction surfaces to mimic the activation mechanism used by the peptide agonists. This may prove especially difficult if crystal structures of other receptor core domains are solved and show this deep crevice-like binding is general to class B GPCRs. Therefore, an alternative approach to enhance receptor activation is to identify small molecule positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) that bind topographically distinct sites and relieve some hindrance of transitioning the receptor to an active state. Several reports have described the identification and development of PAMs for class A, class B, and class C GPCRs (12.De Amici M. Dallanoce C. Holzgrabe U. Tränkle C. Mohr K.

Each compound also enhances the actions of non-natural agonists on the GLP-1R, peptidic and non-peptidic, such as BMS-21, Boc-5, and TT-15 (24.Wootten D. Savage E.E. Willard F.S. Bueno A.B.

In total, these results support the existence of an allosteric site in the GLP-1R distinct from the orthosteric peptide-binding pocket. Although structurally distinct, unfortunately both compounds are unstable and display poor pharmacokinetic properties that preclude potential clinical development (16.Willard F.S. Bueno A.B. Sloop K.W. Small molecule drug discovery at the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor.Exp. Diabetes Res. 2012; 2012: 709893Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, because of its electrophilic nature, BETP has been reported to conjugate with GSH in vitro (25.Eng H. Sharma R. McDonald T.S. Edmonds D.J. Fortin J.P. Li X. Stevens B.D. Griffith D.A. Limberakis C. Nolte W.M. Price D.A. Jackson M. Kalgutkar A.S.

Dispos. 2013; 41: 1470-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The finding that nucleophilic GSH displaces the ethyl sulfoxide moiety of BETP led to studies that elegantly demonstrated the allosteric mechanism utilized by BETP to potentiate GLP-1R signaling occurs via irreversible covalent modification of a free cysteine located in the third intracellular loop of the GLP-1R (26.Nolte W.M.

Importantly, substitution of this cysteine (position 347) with alanine does not alter peptide agonism at the mutant receptor but does result in loss of PAM action for both BETP and compound 2 (26.Nolte W.M.

A potentiator of orthosteric ligand activity at GLP-1R acts via covalent modification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 629-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although BETP and compound 2 represent distinct chemical pharmacophores, the compounds share the electrophilicity; this suggests that compound 2 also activates the GLP-1R by covalent modification of Cys-347 (26.Nolte W.M. Fortin J.P. Stevens B.D. Aspnes G.E. Griffith D.A. Hoth L.R. Ruggeri R.B. Mathiowetz A.M. Limberakis C. Hepworth D. Carpino P.A. A potentiator of orthosteric ligand activity at GLP-1R acts via covalent modification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 629-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although both molecules act by the same mechanism, modification of the receptor by the compounds results in a differential enhancement of GLP-1R signaling (cAMP accumulation versus intracellular calcium mobilization, β-arrestin recruitment, and ERK phosphorylation) (24.Wootten D. Savage E.E. Willard F.S. Bueno A.B. Sloop K.W. Christopoulos A. Sexton P.M. Differential activation and modulation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor by small molecule ligands.Mol. Pharmacol. 2013; 83: 822-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although BETP and compound 2 are the best characterized GLP-1R PAMs reported to date, other modulators have been described (16.Willard F.S. Bueno A.B. Sloop K.W. Small molecule drug discovery at the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor.Exp. Diabetes Res. 2012; 2012: 709893Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether these molecules interact with the receptor by the same covalent mechanism. Furthermore, it is unclear whether other electrophiles that can access Cys-347 will modulate GLP-1R activity. For class B GPCRs, the presence of a free cysteine in the GLP-1R at position 347 is unique. Thus, studies evaluating the effect of modifying this site on GLP-1R-mediated cellular function may enable the development of receptor-specific agents. In line with this, the work presented herein shows that BETP potentiates insulin secretion in a glucose- and GLP-1R-dependent manner, therefore bolstering the potential therapeutic utility of allosterically modulating receptor activity. To further interrogate the mechanism whereby covalent modification enhances GLP-1R function, we describe the discovery and characterization of several electrophilic chemotypes that potentiate GLP-1R activity in a Cys-347-dependent manner. Importantly, the results indicate that structurally diverse compounds that have the ability to access the third inner membrane loop of the GLP-1R can enhance receptor signaling of this important therapeutic target. Because the positive allosteric mechanism likely occurs through structural modification that results in the formation of an intracellular adduct, strategies aimed at targeting this site may facilitate efforts to stabilize the GLP-1R in an active confirmation and possibly enable new ligand identification approaches.

Mice were housed in microisolator cages on wood chip bedding with food (2014 Teklad Global Diet, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) and deionized water available ad libitum. Lights were on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle, and temperature and relative humidity were maintained between 21 and 23 °C and 45 and 65%, respectively. For pancreatic islet isolation, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. The common bile duct was cannulated with a 27-gauge needle, and the pancreas was distended by infusion of 10 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer (Sigma) containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Akron Biotech, Boca Raton, FL) and 1 mg/ml collagenase (Vitacyte, Indianapolis, IN). Pancreatic tissue was then removed and digested in Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer at 37 °C. Islets were purified on a Histopaque (Histopaque-1077/Histopaque-11991 mixture) gradient (Sigma) for 18 min at 750 × g. Islets were then cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The next morning, islets were incubated in EBSS containing 2.8 mmol/liter glucose at 37 °C for 30 min. Groups of three size-matched islets were then hand-picked and incubated in 0.3 ml of EBSS containing the indicated concentrations of glucose and ligands at 37 °C for 90 min. Following the static incubation experiments, supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C until assayed for insulin using an electrochemiluminescence assay (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD). Data were calibrated to external standards and expressed as nanograms/ml insulin in the culture medium. HEK293 cells were adherently passaged to poly-d-lysine polymer-coated dishes. Transfection was performed using a mixture of FuGENE 6 reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) and pcDNA3.1 expression vector encoding the human GLP-1R-3×FLAG fusion protein.

https://openalex.org/W2300605489,"Repeat elements are important components of eukaryotic genomes. One limitation in our understanding of repeat elements is that most analyses rely on reference genomes that are incomplete and often contain missing data in highly repetitive regions that are difficult to assemble. To overcome this problem we develop a new method, REPdenovo, which assembles repeat sequences directly from raw shotgun sequencing data. REPdenovo can construct various types of repeats that are highly repetitive and have low sequence divergence within copies. We show that REPdenovo is substantially better than existing methods both in terms of the number and the completeness of the repeat sequences that it recovers. The key advantage of REPdenovo is that it can reconstruct long repeats from sequence reads. We apply the method to human data and discover a number of potentially new repeats sequences that have been missed by previous repeat annotations. Many of these sequences are incorporated into various parasite genomes, possibly because the filtering process for host DNA involved in the sequencing of the parasite genomes failed to exclude the host derived repeat sequences. REPdenovo is a new powerful computational tool for annotating genomes and for addressing questions regarding the evolution of repeat families. The software tool, REPdenovo, is available for download at https://github.com/Reedwarbler/REPdenovo."
https://openalex.org/W2301226206,"Although multiple lines of evidence have indicated that Arabidopsis thaliana Tandem CCCH Zinc Finger proteins, AtTZF4, 5 and 6 are involved in ABA, GA and phytochrome mediated seed germination responses, the interacting proteins involved in these processes are unknown. Using yeast two-hybrid screens, we have identified 35 putative AtTZF5 interacting protein partners. Among them, Mediator of ABA-Regulated Dormancy 1 (MARD1) is highly expressed in seeds and involved in ABA signal transduction, while Responsive to Dehydration 21A (RD21A) is a well-documented stress responsive protein. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays were used to confirm that AtTZF5 can interact with MARD1 and RD21A in plant cells, and the interaction is mediated through TZF motif. In addition, AtTZF4 and 6 could also interact with MARD1 and RD21A in Y-2-H and BiFC assay, respectively. The protein-protein interactions apparently take place in processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs), because AtTZF5, MARD1 and RD21A could interact and co-localize with each other and they all can co-localize with the same PB and SG markers in plant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2302466986,"Disturbances in the homeostasis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) referred to as ER stress is involved in a variety of human diseases. ER stress activates unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular mechanism the purpose of which is to restore ER homeostasis. Previous studies show that Mesencephalic Astrocyte-derived Neurotrophic Factor (MANF) is an important novel component in the regulation of UPR. In vertebrates, MANF is upregulated by ER stress and protects cells against ER stress-induced cell death. Biochemical studies have revealed an interaction between mammalian MANF and GRP78, the major ER chaperone promoting protein folding. In this study we discovered that the upregulation of MANF expression in response to drug-induced ER stress is conserved between Drosophila and mammals. Additionally, by using a genetic in vivo approach we found genetic interactions between Drosophila Manf and genes encoding for Drosophila homologues of GRP78, PERK and XBP1, the key components of UPR. Our data suggest a role for Manf in the regulation of Drosophila UPR."
https://openalex.org/W2300792648,"This work’s aim was to minimize the acquisition time of a radial 3D ultra-short echo-time (UTE) sequence and to provide fully automated, gradient delay compensated, and therefore artifact free, reconstruction. The radial 3D UTE sequence (echo time 60 μs) was implemented as single echo acquisition with center-out readouts and improved time efficient spoiling on a clinical 3T scanner without hardware modifications. To assess the sequence parameter dependent gradient delays each acquisition contained a quick calibration scan and utilized the phase of the readouts to detect the actual k-space center. This calibration scan does not require any user interaction. To evaluate the robustness of this automatic delay estimation phantom experiments were performed and 19 in vivo imaging data of the head, tibial cortical bone, feet and lung were acquired from 6 volunteers. As clinical application of this fast 3D UTE acquisition single breath-hold lung imaging is demonstrated. The proposed sequence allowed very short repetition times (TR~1ms), thus reducing total acquisition time. The proposed, fully automated k-phase based gradient delay calibration resulted in accurate delay estimations (difference to manually determined optimal delay −0.13 ± 0.45 μs) and allowed unsupervised reconstruction of high quality images for both phantom and in vivo data. The employed fast spoiling scheme efficiently suppressed artifacts caused by incorrectly refocused echoes. The sequence proved to be quite insensitive to motion, flow and susceptibility artifacts and provides oversampling protection against aliasing foldovers in all directions. Due to the short TR, acquisition times are attractive for a wide range of clinical applications. For short T2* mapping this sequence provides free choice of the second TE, usually within less scan time as a comparable dual echo UTE sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2301766505,"Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are pathological oscillations in cardiac action potentials during the repolarization phase and may be caused by drug side effects, ion channel disease or oxidative stress. The most widely observed EAD pattern is characterized by oscillations with growing amplitudes. So far, its occurence has been explained in terms of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in the fast subsystem of the action potential dynamics from which stable limit cycles with growing amplitudes emerge. The novel contribution of this article is the introduction of two alternative explanations of EAD genesis with growing amplitudes that do not involve stable limit cycles in fast subsystems. In particular, we demonstrate that EAD patterns with growing amplitudes may alternatively arise due to a delayed subcritical Hopf bifurcation or an unstable manifold of a saddle focus fixed point in the full fast-slow system modelling the action potential. Our work extends the list of possible dynamical EAD mechanisms and may contribute to a classification of drug effects in preclinical cardiotoxicity testing."
https://openalex.org/W2297792921,"Fossil biomolecules from an endogenous source were previously identified in Cretaceous to Pleistocene fossilized bones, the evidence coming from molecular analyses. These findings, however, were called into question and an alternative hypothesis of the invasion of the bone by bacterial biofilm was proposed. Herewith we report a new finding of morphologically preserved blood-vessel-like structures enclosing organic molecules preserved in iron-oxide-mineralized vessel walls from the cortical region of nothosaurid and tanystropheid (aquatic and terrestrial diapsid reptiles) bones. These findings are from the Early/Middle Triassic boundary (Upper Roetian/Lowermost Muschelkalk) strata of Upper Silesia, Poland. Multiple spectroscopic analyses (FTIR, ToF-SIMS, and XPS) of the extracted ""blood vessels"" showed the presence of organic compounds, including fragments of various amino acids such as hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine as well as amides, that may suggest the presence of collagen protein residues. Because these amino acids are absent from most proteins other than collagen, we infer that the proteinaceous molecules may originate from endogenous collagen. The preservation of molecular signals of proteins within the ""blood vessels"" was most likely made possible through the process of early diagenetic iron oxide mineralization. This discovery provides the oldest evidence of in situ preservation of complex organic molecules in vertebrate remains in a marine environment."
https://openalex.org/W2300388437,"Myeolchi-aekjeot (MA) in Korea is produced outdoors without temperature controls, which is a major obstacle to produce commercial MA products with uniform quality. To investigate the effects of temperature on MA fermentation, pH, bacterial abundance and community, and metabolites were monitored during fermentation at 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C. Initial pH values were approximately 6.0, and pH values increased after approximately 42 days, with faster increases at higher temperatures. Bacterial abundances increased rapidly in all MA samples after quick initial decreases during early fermentation and then they again steadily decreased after reaching their maxima, which were significantly greater at higher temperatures. Bacterial community analysis revealed that Proteobacteria and Tenericutes were predominant in all initial MA samples, but they were rapidly displaced by Firmicutes as fermentation progressed. Photobacterium and Mycoplasma belonging to Proteobacteria and Tenericutes, respectively, which may include potentially pathogenic strains, were dominant in initial MA, but decreased with the growth of Chromohalobacter, which occurred faster at higher temperatures––they were dominant until 273 and 100 days at 15°C and 20°C, respectively, but not detected after 30 days at 25°C and 30°C. Chromohalobacter also decreased with the appearance of subsequent genera belonging to Firmicutes in all MA samples. Tetragenococcus, halophilic lactic acid bacteria, appeared predominantly at 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C; they were most abundant at 30°C, but not detected at 15°C. Alkalibacillus and Lentibacillus appeared as dominant genera with the decrease of Tetragenococcus at 25°C and 30°C, but only Lentibacillus was dominant at 15°C and 20°C. Metabolite analysis showed that amino acids related to tastes were major metabolites and their concentrations were relatively higher at high temperatures. This study suggests that high temperatures (approximately 30°C) may be appropriate in MA fermentation, in the light of faster disappearance of potentially pathogenic genera, higher amino acids, growth of Tetragenococcus, and faster fermentation."

Proteasome substrates are selected by a ubiquitin ligase E3, which collaborates with a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) to covalently attach ubiquitin molecules onto substrates (9.Finley D.

The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-marked substrates are then delivered to and degraded by the proteasome. The key to understanding the role of proteolysis in CENP-A regulation is to identify E3 enzymes involved. Two groups previously isolated Psh1 as a yeast Cse4-binding protein via the affinity purification-mass spectrometry coupled approach and further demonstrated that Psh1 acts as an E3 ligase for Cse4 ubiquitylation and degradation (11.Hewawasam G.

Because Cse4 overexpression leads to toxicity in psh1Δ cells (11.Hewawasam G. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Venkatesh S. Martin-Brown S. Florens L. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L.

Yeast cells lacking RCY1 are found to be sensitive to Cse4 expression and exhibit compromised Cse4 degradation. RCY1 encodes a F-box containing protein, which is a substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cdc53-F box (SCF) 2The abbreviation used is: SCFSkp1-Cdc53-F box. E3 complex (19.Kus B.M. Caldon C.E.

Rcy1 is one of the eight F-box proteins in yeast, but little is known about its degradation targets (19.Kus B.M. Caldon C.E. Andorn-Broza R. Edwards A.M.

Skp1-Cdc53-F box. A collection of yeast S. cerevisiae strains lacking non-essential ubiquitylation or degradation components including various E2s and E3s in BY4741 background were obtained from Dr. Mark Hochstrasser (Yale University) (22.Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Autoregulation of an E2 enzyme by ubiquitin-chain assembly on its catalytic residue.Nat. Cell. Biol. 2007; 9: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Haploid yeast mutant strains lacking RCY1, TOM1, PSH1, ATG1, ATG9, ATG14, YPT31, YPT32, and SNC1 in the BY4741 strain background were obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). GFP- or GST-tagged Cdc53 strain was obtained from Open Biosystems and ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., respectively. Strain YHR305 (psh1::LEU2 rcy1::KanMX4) was constructed by replacing PSH1 with LEU2 in the rcy1Δ strain. Sectoring strain YPH278 was obtained from Dr. P. Hieter and was used to delete the RCY1 gene by LEU2 to make strain YHR313. Endogenous RCY1 gene was tagged 9 Myc epitopes at its C-terminal using PCR-mediated homologous recombination to construct strain YHR297 in BY4741 background. The plasmid pMB1458 bearing 3HA-tagged Cse4 and pYES2-HTH-HHT2 expressing HA-tagged histone H3 were previously described (12.Ranjitkar P. Press M.O. Yi X. Baker R. MacCoss M.J. Biggins S.

The plasmid for V5-tagged Cse4 expression in Escherichia coli was kindly provided by Dr. Biggins. RCY1 was amplified by PCR to append the FLAG epitope at its C terminus and inserted into pRS425GAL1 to create the plasmid pRS425GAL1-Rcy1-Flag for FLAG-tagged Rcy1 expression in yeast. Yeast cells were grown in rich (YPD) or synthetic media containing standard ingredients and 2% glucose (SD medium), or 2% raffinose (SR medium), or 2% raffinose + 2% galactose (SRG medium). The plasmid pMB1458 was separately transformed into wild-type or 93 yeast mutants (see supplemental Table S1). Yeast cells bearing the plasmid were first grown in synthetic media containing glucose. Actively growing cells were spotted onto glucose-containing SD-ura and galactose-containing SG-ura media in serial 10-fold dilution. Cse4 expression is controlled by a GAL1 promoter and induced by galactose. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Thirteen mutants that exhibited reduced growth on SG-ura plates were deemed possible candidates from the initial screen and further analyzed (18.Liu C. van Dyk D. Li Y. Andrews B. Rao H. A genome-wide synthetic dosage lethality screen reveals multiple pathways that require the functioning of ubiquitin-binding proteins Rad23 and Dsk2.BMC Biol. 2009; 7: 75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Antibodies against HA and myc were obtained from BioLegend Inc. (San Diego, CA). Antibodies for V5 and FLAG were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific and Sigma, respectively. Rpt5 antibody was obtained from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY). As previously described (17.Liu C. van Dyk D. Choe V. Yan J. Majumder S. Costanzo M. Bao X. Boone C. Huo K. Winey M. Fisk H.

Protein translation was shut off by the addition of cycloheximide (150 μg/ml). Samples were collected at the indicated time points. Proteins were extracted by glass bead lysis of cells, processed for immunoblotting with anti-HA (BioLegend, MMS101P), followed by detection with goat anti-mouse HRP conjugate using ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). The stable protein Rpt5 was used as a loading control in the expression shutoff experiments. Yeast YPH278 cells contained the defective ade2–101 ochre mutation, which can be suppressed by the SUP11 gene, carried on a non-essential, 90-kb chromosome fragment. YPH278 cells that maintained this chromosomal fragment produced white colonies, whereas the loss of it resulted in a red color or sectors (17.Liu C. van Dyk D. Choe V. Yan J. Majumder S. Costanzo M.

The RCY1 gene was deleted in the YPH278 strain, and the resulting mutant YHR313 was compared with YPH278. As previously described (17.Liu C. van Dyk D. Choe V. Yan J. Majumder S. Costanzo M. Bao X.

The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h and then kept at room temperature for ∼5 days for color development. The involvement of the proteasome in Cse4 turnover was previously demonstrated using proteasome mutant cim3-1 (7.Collins K.A. Furuyama S. Biggins S.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2012; 192: 319-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which has a number of defects that may potentially contribute to Cse4 stabilization indirectly. We assessed the effects of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on Cse4 degradation. Cse4 turnover is impaired upon MG132 treatment (Fig. 1A), supporting the involvement of the proteasome in Cse4 regulation (7.Collins K.A. Furuyama S. Biggins S.

Biol. 2004; 14: 1968-1972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Besides the proteasome, autophagy is the other major proteolytic system in eukaryotes (24.Athané A. Buisson A. Challier M. Beaumatin F. Manon S. Bhatia-Kiššova I. Camougrand N. Insights into the relationship between the proteasome and autophagy in human and yeast cells.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2015; 64: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We evaluated whether autophagy is involved in Cse4 turnover. Whereas Cdc13 was degraded by autophagy as previously reported (Fig. 1C), Cse4 stability was not altered significantly in yeast cells lacking one of the core autophagy components (i.e. ATG1, ATG9, ATG14) (Fig. 1B), suggesting that autophagy is not involved in Cse4 degradation. As Cse4 is still degraded in yeast cells lacking Psh1 E3 (11.Hewawasam G. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Venkatesh S. Martin-Brown S. Florens L. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L.

To this end, we employed an array of yeast mutant cells lacking known or putative ubiquitylation/degradation enzymes (22.Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Autoregulation of an E2 enzyme by ubiquitin-chain assembly on its catalytic residue.Nat. Cell. Biol. 2007; 9: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S1). Reasoning that Cse4 accumulation may lead to toxicity, we adopted a synthetic lethal screen to look for yeast mutants that show growth retardation upon Cse4 expression. The plasmid bearing the GAL1-promoter regulated CSE4 was introduced into wild-type and 93 yeast degradation mutants separately (Fig. 2A). Following the initial screen, seven mutants including psh1Δ were confirmed to show Cse4-induced slower growth by the serial spotting assay (Fig. 2B). It is worth noting that PSH1 and DOA1, both known to promote Cse4 destruction (11.Hewawasam G. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Venkatesh S. Martin-Brown S. Florens L. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L.

Doa1, also called Ufd3, is involved in ubiquitin homeostasis albeit the underlying mechanism remains enigmatic (14.Au W.C. Dawson A.R. Rawson D.W. Taylor S.B. Baker R.E.

Four isolated mutants (i.e. vps18Δ, doa4Δ, ufo1Δ, ubx7Δ) did not exhibit Cse4 stabilization (Fig. 2C), indicating that they do not directly promote Cse4 turnover. The mechanisms underlying the Cse4-triggered toxicity in these mutants are unknown, but these genes may possibly be involved in a Cse4-related event indirectly. Interestingly, Cse4 degradation is impaired in the rcy1Δ mutant (Fig. 2C). Rcy1 contains a F-box domain and can be assembled into a Skp1-Cdc53-Rcy1 complex with demonstrated ubiquitin ligase activity (19.Kus B.M. Caldon C.E. Andorn-Broza R. Edwards A.M.

RCY1 was originally identified in a screen for genes involved in a endocytic process and was shown to regulate protein trafficking from endosomes to the Golgi network (20.Wiederkehr A. Avaro S.

It is possible that the Rcy1-mediated protein trafficking may indirectly affect Cse4 turnover. To determine the specificity of Rcy1 in Cse4 regulation, we evaluated Cse4 degradation in yeast cells lacking Ypt31 and Ypt32, two GTPases that work with Rcy1 in the endosome-Golgi transport (21.Chen S.H.

Interestingly, Cse4 did not elicit toxicity and was not stabilized in ypt31Δ or ypt32Δ cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, Cse4 was unaffected in cells missing the SNARE Snc1 (Fig. 3, A and B), which interacts with Rcy1 and regulates protein trafficking (21.Chen S.H. Shah A.H. Segev N. Ypt31/32 GTPases and their F-Box effector Rcy1 regulate ubiquitination of recycling proteins.Cell Logist. 2011; 1: 21-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combined, the data suggest that the role of Rcy1 in Cse4 regulation is likely separate from its involvement in protein trafficking outside of nucleus. Histone H3 was previously shown to be ubiquitylated and degraded by the ubiquitin ligase Tom1 pathway (23.Singh R.K. Kabbaj M.H. Paik J. Gunjan A. Histone levels are regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitylation-dependent proteolysis.Nat. Cell. Biol. 2009; 11: 925-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We found that histone H3 degradation was compromised in tom1Δ (Fig. 3C) as expected (23.Singh R.K. Kabbaj M.H. Paik J. Gunjan A. Histone levels are regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitylation-dependent proteolysis.Nat. Cell. Biol. 2009; 11: 925-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but was little affected in rcy1Δ cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting the specific involvement of Rcy1 in Cse4 turnover. Although Tom1 regulates histone H3, Tom1 was not involved in Cse4 turnover (Fig. 3D). As the F-box protein is the substrate-recognition component of SCF E3s (9.Finley D. Ulrich H.D. Sommer T. Kaiser P. The ubiquitin-proteasome system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2012; 192: 319-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), we examined whether Cse4 associates with Rcy1 in yeast by the co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 4A). We found that endogenous Rcy1 immunoprecipitates Cse4 (Fig. 4A), supporting a close link between Rcy1 and Cse4 in vivo. Furthermore, we also carried out the in vitro binding experiment. Cse4 purified from E. coli can interact with Rcy1 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Rcy1 recognizes Cse4. Consistent with the role of Rcy1 in Cse4 ubiquitylation, Cse4 ubiquitylation was reduced in rcy1Δ cells (Fig. 4, C and D). We also evaluated whether other SCF components are involved. We found that Cse4 interacts with Cdc53, a core component of SCF E3, in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 4, E and F). Because both Psh1 and Rcy1 promote Cse4 destruction, we wondered whether they work the same or different pathways. To determine the functional relationship between PSH1 and RCY1, we assessed the degradation of Cse4 in cells lacking either or both RCY1 and PSH1. Consistent with earlier studies, deletion of PSH1 slightly stabilized Cse4 (11.Hewawasam G. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Venkatesh S. Martin-Brown S. Florens L. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L.

Interestingly, the double mutant psh1Δ rcy1Δ showed more compromised Cse4 degradation than single mutants, suggesting that Psh1 and Rcy1 likely work in parallel pathways in Cse4 regulation. As Cse4 plays a critical role in chromosome segregation, altered Cse4 regulation may affect genome stability (5.Au W.C. Crisp M.J. DeLuca S.Z. Rando O.J. Basrai M.A. Altered dosage and mislocalization of histone H3 and Cse4p lead to chromosome loss in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2008; 179: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rcy1 may regulate genome maintenance, we employed a colony sectoring assay to compare the rate of chromosome loss in wild-type and rcy1Δ cells (Fig. 6A) (17.Liu C. van Dyk D. Choe V. Yan J. Majumder S. Costanzo M. Bao X. Boone C. Huo K. Winey M. Fisk H. Andrews B. Rao H. Ubiquitin ligase Ufd2 is required for efficient degradation of Mps1 kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 43660-43667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These cells contain a non-essential chromosome fragment bearing the SUP11 gene, which can suppress the ade2–101 mutation-induced red pigment accumulation. As expected, wild-type cells can efficiently maintain the non-essential SUP11-bearing chromosome, leading to few cells (less than 2%) with red sectors. In contrast, RCY1 deletion leads to a significant increase of red sectors in rcy1Δ cells (∼5%) (Fig. 6A), suggesting enhanced chromosome instability in rcy1Δ cells, a phenotype that is consistent with the RCY1-CSE4 link. We noticed that rcy1Δ cells grow slower than wild-type cells at room temperature. Indeed, upon closer examination, we found that rcy1Δ cells are sensitive to cold temperature (Fig. 6B). In line with temperature sensitivity, a drastic increase of chromosome loss was observed in rcy1Δ cells (∼40%) that were grown at room temperature (data not shown). Here we identify another degradation component, Rcy1, involved in Cse4 regulation. Rcy1 partnered with Skp1 and Cdc53 exhibits the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity (19.Kus B.M. Caldon C.E. Andorn-Broza R. Edwards A.M. Functional interaction of 13 yeast SCF complexes with a set of yeast E2 enzymes in vitro.Proteins. 2004; 54: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Rcy1 was previously known to promote intracellular trafficking from the endosome to the Golgi (20.Wiederkehr A. Avaro S. Prescianotto-Baschong C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Riezman H.

Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 4560-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Without RCY1, Snc1 ubiquitylation was impaired, leading to its entrapment on endosomes (21.Chen S.H. Shah A.H. Segev N.

Nevertheless, the physiological functions of RCY1 remain far from clear. We found that Rcy1 is specifically involved in the degradation of Cse4, but not histone H3. Our study expands the function of Rcy1 in proteolysis, distinct from its involvement in protein trafficking, and reveals new phenotypes associated with the RCY1 deletion (Fig. 3). Cse4/CENP-A is crucial to establish a specialized chromatin structure at the centromere (1.Earnshaw W.C. Discovering centromere proteins: from cold white hands to the A, B, C of CENPs.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Excessive or nonrestraint Cse4 can lead to its occupancy at the euchromatic region, which may cause aneuploidy and promote tumorigenesis (1.Earnshaw W.C.

The discovery of enhanced chromosome instability in rcy1Δ cells suggest that altered regulation of the Rcy1-Cse4 pathway may be involved in cancer. Doa1, but not Rcy1, was isolated in a similar synthetic dosage lethality screen employed to identify potential regulators of Cse4 (5.Au W.C. Crisp M.J. DeLuca S.Z. Rando O.J. Basrai M.A. Altered dosage and mislocalization of histone H3 and Cse4p lead to chromosome loss in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2008; 179: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Whereas the early screen scanned the entire set of yeast deletion mutants available (>4000) (5.Au W.C. Crisp M.J. DeLuca S.Z. Rando O.J. Basrai M.A. Altered dosage and mislocalization of histone H3 and Cse4p lead to chromosome loss in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2008; 179: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we probed a selected group of mutants linked to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Our targeted approach allowed a more careful examination of mutant phenotypes. As Doa1 regulates intracellular levels of ubiquitin in general, Doa1 affects ubiquitin-mediated processes much more broadly than Rcy1 (14.Au W.C. Dawson A.R. Rawson D.W. Taylor S.B. Baker R.E.

Identification of a novel 29-linked polyubiquitin binding protein, Ufd3, using polyubiquitin chain analogues.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4844-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that Cse4 turnover is more severely compromised in doa1Δ than in rcy1Δ. Our results suggest that Psh1 and Rcy1 likely work in parallel pathways to tune down the Cse4 level (Fig. 5, A and B). Because Cse4 remains partially degraded in psh1Δ rcy1Δ double mutant cells, other E3s involved in Cse4 degradation exist. It is not unusual for a protein targeted for degradation by multiple E3s. For example, histone H3 degradation has been shown to involve five E3s including Tom1, Snt2, Pep5, Hel1, and Hel2 (34.Singh R.K. Gonzalez M. Kabbaj M.H. Gunjan A. Novel E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate histone protein levels in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e36295Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A more “extreme” case is the p53 tumor suppressor, for which more than 15 E3 enzymes have been implicated in its turnover under various conditions (35.Love I.M. Grossman S.R. It takes 15 to tango: making sense of the many ubiquitin ligases of p53.Genes Cancer. 2012; 3: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The employment of multiple E3s in substrate degradation allows more regulation. Identification of additional E3s involved in the degradation of Cse4, especially its human homolog CENP-A, remains a future challenge. Besides ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, a variety of approaches are adopted to restrain Cse4 activity with the participations of casein kinase 2, the proline isomerase Fpr3, the H3 chaperones HIR and CAF-1, and several chromatin modulators (e.g. SWI/SNF remodeling enzymes, the FACT complex) (15.Hewawasam G.S.

Unraveling the functional cross-talks among these factors/pathways will be key to revealing the molecular basis underlying Cse4 regulation.

We construct a coupled synchronization network, perform community analysis, and identify formation of four distinct network communities that are relatively stable over time. In addition to investigating the entire period, we divide the time period into into “mild crisis,” (1999–2002), “calm,” (2003–2006) and “severe crisis” (2007–2012) sub-periods and find that the severe crisis period behavior dominates the dynamics in the foreign exchange-equity synchronization network. We observe that in general the foreign exchange market has predictive power for the global stock market performances.

The MAPK-phosphorylated Twist1 on its serine 68 (Ser(P)68-Twist1) has a significantly enhanced stability and function to drive cancer cell invasion and metastasis. However, the phosphatase that dephosphorylates Ser(P)68-Twist1 and destabilizes Twist1 has not been identified and characterized. In this study, we screened a serine/threonine phosphatase cDNA expression library in HEK293T cells with ectopically coexpressed Twist1. We found that the small C-terminal domain phosphatase 1 (SCP1) specifically dephosphorylates Ser(P)68-Twist1 in both cell-free reactions and living cells. SCP1 uses its amino acid residues 43–63 to interact with the N terminus of Twist1. Increased SCP1 expression in cells decreased Ser(P)68-Twist1 and total Twist1 proteins, whereas knockdown of SCP1 increased Ser(P)68-Twist1 and total Twist1 proteins. Furthermore, the levels of SCP1 are negatively correlated with Twist1 protein levels in several cancer cell lines. SCP1-dephosphorylated Twist1 undergoes fast degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Importantly, an increase in SCP1 expression in breast cancer cells with either endogenous or ectopically expressed Twist1 largely inhibits the Twist1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype and the migration and invasion capabilities of these cells. These results indicate that SCP1 is the phosphatase that counterregulates the MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser68-Twist1.

The small C-terminal domain phosphatases (SCPs) contain a conserved DXDX(T/V) motif and are members of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (20Moorhead G.B. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Ulke-Lemée A. Emerging roles of nuclear protein phosphatases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). SCPs were initially found to be able to preferentially dephosphorylate the Ser(P)5 on the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II to regulate RNA polymerase II recycling (21Yeo M. Lin P.S. Dahmus M.E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 26078-26085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that SCP1 is required for RE-1 silencing transcription factor-repressed neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal cells (22Yeo M. Lee S.K. Lee B. Ruiz E.C. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N. Small CTD phosphatases function in silencing neuronal gene expression.Science. 2005; 307: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). SCP1 can also dephosphorylate Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 to potentiate TGF-β signaling (23Sapkota G. Knockaert M. Alarcón C. Montalvo E. Brivanlou A.H. Massagué J.

In addition, SCP1 has been shown to dephosphorylate Snail1 at a GSK-3β-targeted phosphorylation site to regulate Snail1 protein stability (25Wu Y. Evers B.M. Zhou B.P. Small C-terminal domain phosphatase enhances snail activity through dephosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The concentration and function of Twist1 are regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications. Tip60 acetylates Twist1 at Lys63 and Lys67, which allows Twist1 to interact with BRD4 for transcriptional activation of Wnt5a (26Shi J. Wang Y. Zeng L. Wu Y. Deng J. Zhang Q. Lin Y. Li J. Kang T.

Furthermore, the counterregulation between PKA-mediated phosphorylation and protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation of Twist1 on Thr125 and Ser127 plays crucial roles in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. PKB-mediated phosphorylation of Ser42 in Twist1 enables cells to evade the DNA damage-induced p53 response. In a cell line derived from squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, casein kinase 2 (CK2) induced by IL-6 can phosphorylate Twist1 at Ser18 and Ser20 to stabilize Twist1 and promote cell motility. The inhibitor of κB kinase β can also phosphorylate Twist1 at multiple sites to arrest Twist1 in the cytoplasm for ubiquitination and degradation (27Zhong J. Ogura K. Wang Z. Inuzuka H.

Our laboratory has previously reported that the Ser68 residue in Twist1 is highly phosphorylated by MAPKs in both breast cancer cell lines and human breast tumors, and this phosphorylation strongly stabilizes Twist1 protein to enhance breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (31Hong J. Zhou J. Fu J. He T. Qin J. Wang L. Liao L. Xu J. Phosphorylation of serine 68 of Twist1 by MAPKs stabilizes Twist1 protein and promotes breast cancer cell invasiveness.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 3980-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this study, we screened a serine/threonine phosphatase cDNA library to identify phosphatases that specifically dephosphorylate Ser(P)68-Twist1. We found that SCP1 specifically interacts with Twist1 and dephosphorylates Ser(P)68-Twist1. The SCP1-mediated dephosphorylation of Ser(P)68-Twist1 accelerates Twist1 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in significant decreases in both the EMT phenotype and the migration and invasion capabilities of cancer cells. These findings suggest that activation of SCP1 and inactivation of MAPKs may be a useful approach for eliminating the detrimental role of Twist1 in cancer metastasis. Human SCP1 and its dominant negative mutant (dnSCP1) cDNAs in the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid were described previously (24Wrighton K.H. Willis D. Long J. Liu F. Lin X. Feng X.H. Small C-terminal domain phosphatases dephosphorylate the regulatory linker regions of Smad2 and Smad3 to enhance transforming growth factor-β signaling.J. Biol.

The N-terminal FLAG-tagged or HA-tagged SCP1 and dnSCP1 were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1-Hygro or pLenti6/TR plasmid. The N-terminal HA-tagged Twist1 and C-terminal FLAG-tagged Twist1 were subcloned into the pSG5 and pcDNA3.1 plasmids, respectively. SCP1 cDNA fragments were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. Full-length Twist1 and its fragments were tagged by a C-terminal FLAG sequence and subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. SCP1 deletion mutants were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis methods and subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. All expression vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. This study used antibodies against SCP1 (NBP1-55978, Novus Biologicals), Twist1 (ab50887, Abcam), GAPDH (ab9484, Abcam), HA (C29F4, Cell Signaling Technology), vimentin (5741, Cell Signaling Technology), GST (sc-33613, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), E-cadherin (610181, BD Biosciences), tubulin (T-8203, Sigma-Aldrich), FLAG (F-1804, Sigma-Aldrich), and β-actin (A5441, Sigma). The antibody against Ser(P)68-Twist1 was described previously (31Hong J. Zhou J. Fu J. He T. Qin J. Wang L. Liao L. Xu J.

MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-435, 4T1, MCF7, HeLa, Ishikawa, HEK293T, and HEK293 cells with doxycycline (DOX)-inducible Twist1-FLAG, S68A-Twist1-FLAG and S68E-Twist1-FLAG were cultured in DMEM supplemented with glucose (4.5 g/liter), l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% FBS as described previously (12Fu J.

Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies) or PEI reagent by following the instructions of the manufacturer. To generate stable MCF7 cell lines with Twist1 expression, MCF7 cells (106) were transfected with 1 μg of MfeI-linearized pcDNA3.1-Twist1-FLAG plasmid or pcDNA3.1 empty (control) plasmid. The transfected cells were selected in medium containing 500 μg/ml of G418 for 2 weeks. The surviving clones were individually isolated, expanded, and analyzed by Western blotting. GST pulldown assays were performed as described previously (19Fu J. Zhang L. He T. Xiao X. Liu X. Wang L. Yang L. Yang M. Zhang T. Chen R. Xu J. TWIST represses estrogen receptor-α expression by recruiting the NuRD protein complex in breast cancer cells.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2012; 8: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were individually expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli (Novagen). Bacteria were lysed in Sarkosyl buffer (0.5% Sarkosyl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) with sonication at 4 °C. Clear lysates containing 10 μg of protein were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The beads were washed three times and incubated with purified full-length Twist1 or Twist1 fragments at 4 °C for another 1.5 h. The beads were washed five times using buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins associated with the beads were heat-eluted in SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting. The in vitro phosphatase assay was performed as described previously (24Wrighton K.H. Willis D. Long J. Liu F. Lin X. Feng X.H. Small C-terminal domain phosphatases dephosphorylate the regulatory linker regions of Smad2 and Smad3 to enhance transforming growth factor-β signaling.J. Biol.

For the in vivo phosphatase assay, cells were transfected with SCP1 or mutant SCP1 expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies). Forty-eight hours later, cells were collected and subjected to Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (12Fu J. Qin L. He T. Qin J. Hong J. Wong J. Liao L. Xu J. The TWIST/Mi2/NuRD protein complex and its essential role in cancer metastasis.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). HEK293 cell lines (105 cells) with DOX-inducible Twist1-FLAG expression were transfected with 1 μg of HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-ubiquitin) plasmid and HA-SCP1 or HA-dnSCP1 plasmid. After 36 h, cells were treated with vehicle (H2O) or 1 μg/ml DOX for 6 h and then with vehicle (DMSO) or 10 μg/ml MG132 for another 6 h. Cell lysates were prepared and mixed with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times using ice-cold PBS. Bound proteins were heat-eluted in SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. MDA-MB-436 and Ishikawa cells were infected with lentiviral particles of the GIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir-GFP system as described previously (19Fu J. Zhang L. He T. Xiao X. Liu X. Wang L. Yang L. Yang M. Zhang T. Chen R. Xu J. TWIST represses estrogen receptor-α expression by recruiting the NuRD protein complex in breast cancer cells.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2012; 8: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These lentiviral vectors mediate the expression of non-targeting control shRNA or shRNAs (clone RHS4430-101068525 and clone RHS4430-101071006, Sigma) that target human SCP1 mRNA. To measure the knockdown efficiency, total RNA was isolated from the infected and growth-selected cell pools using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher). Two micrograms of RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Universal Probe Library Center software (Roche Applied Science) was used to design primers and match the corresponding fluorescence-labeled probes for TaqMan real-time PCR. The relative mRNA concentration was presented after normalizing to the β-actin mRNA concentration. The protein levels of SCP1, Twist1, and Ser(P)68-Twist1 in these cells were also assayed by Western blotting. Cells expressing control shRNA or shRNA targeting SCP1 mRNA were treated with 250 μg/ml of cycloheximide for different periods of time. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting analyses of Twist1 and tubulin. Twenty micrograms of total protein were loaded in each lane. The relative level of Twist1 protein was obtained by normalizing to the level of tubulin protein in each sample. Cells were transfected as described above. Forty-eight hours later, transfected cells were subjected to the growth, migration, and invasion assays using the RT-CES system (ACEA Biosciences) as described previously (12Fu J. Qin L. He T. Qin J. Hong J. Wong J. Liao L. Xu J. The TWIST/Mi2/NuRD protein complex and its essential role in cancer metastasis.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). For the growth assay, 5000 cells in medium containing 10% FBS were plated in each well. For migration and invasion assays, cells were washed five times with serum-free medium. Then, 50,000 cells in 100 μl of serum-free medium were plated in each upper chamber. Each of the lower chambers, which were separated by a membrane with 8-μm pores from the upper chamber, was filled with medium containing 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. For the invasion assay, the membrane of each chamber was precoated with 20 μl of 1:5 diluted growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The cell indices, which positively correlate with cell densities, were automatically recorded every 30 min during the entire monitoring process by the software of the RT-CES system. Each assay was performed in triplicate. We have previously reported that Twist1 is phosphorylated on Ser68 by MAPKs, which greatly stabilizes Twist1 protein to enhance cancer cell invasion (5Qin Q. Xu Y. He T. Qin C. Xu J. Normal and disease-related biological functions of Twist1 and underlying molecular mechanisms.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 90-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 31Hong J.

Phosphorylation of serine 68 of Twist1 by MAPKs stabilizes Twist1 protein and promotes breast cancer cell invasiveness.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 3980-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To identify the phosphatase(s) that can counterbalance the detrimental role of MAPKs in Twist1 function by dephosphorylating Ser(P)68-Twist1, we screened a phosphatase library consisting of 33 protein serine/threonine phosphatases and six dual-specific protein phosphatases (32Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.H. PPM1A functions as a Smad phosphatase to terminate TGFβ signaling.Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We co-transfected HEK293T cells with Twist1-FLAG (Twist-F) expression plasmid and one of the above 39 phosphatases and then examined the levels of each phosphatase, Ser(P)68-Twist1-F, and total Twist1-F by Western blotting. We found that SCP1 expression significantly decreased the level of Ser(P)68-Twist1-F as well as the level of total Twist1-F protein, whereas other phosphatases showed no obvious effect on the level of Ser(P)68-Twist1-F (Fig. 1A and data not shown). These results suggest that SCP1 is a candidate phosphatase that dephosphorylates Ser(P)68-Twist1. To confirm that SCP1 expression caused dephosphorylation of Ser(P)68-Twist1, we expressed Twist1-F together with different amounts of FLAG-tagged SCP1 (F-SCP1) in HEK293T cells. Western blotting analysis revealed that both Ser(P)68-Twist1-F and total Twist1-F were decreased in a F-SCP1 dose-dependent manner when total protein inputs of all samples were normalized to GAPDH (Fig. 1B). Because Twist1 protein is less stable than Ser(P)68-Twist1 (31Hong J. Zhou J. Fu J. He T. Qin J. Wang L. Liao L. Xu J. Phosphorylation of serine 68 of Twist1 by MAPKs stabilizes Twist1 protein and promotes breast cancer cell invasiveness.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 3980-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the decrease in total Twist1-F in cells with high F-SCP1 expression is expected. To further evaluate the ratio of Ser(P)68-Twist1 to total Twist1 proteins, we co-expressed Twist1-F with different amounts of F-SCP1 in HEK293T cells and assayed the levels of Ser(P)68-Twist1-F when comparable total Twist1-F protein was loaded to each lane. Again, the levels of Ser(P)68-Twist1-F were markedly reduced when F-SCP1 expression levels were increased (Fig. 1C). To further evaluate the effect of SCP1 on endogenous Ser(P)68-Twist1, we expressed F-SCP1 in MDA-MB-435 and 4T1 cancer cell lines with abundant endogenous Twist1 expression (12Fu J. Qin L. He T.

Similarly, when similar amounts of total endogenous Twist1 protein in all samples were assayed by Western blotting, the levels of endogenous Ser(P)68-Twist1 were drastically decreased in both of these cell lines with F-SCP1 overexpression (Fig. 1D). These results clearly demonstrate that the levels of either ectopically expressed or endogenous Ser(P)68-Twist1 negatively correlate with the levels of SCP1 expression in multiple cell lines. To examine whether Ser(P)68-Twist1 is a direct substrate of SCP1, we purified total Twist1-F protein from HEK293 cell lysate containing the phosphatase inhibitor"
https://openalex.org/W2301317266,"Ladderanes are hydrocarbon chains with three or five linearly concatenated cyclobutane rings that are uniquely produced as membrane lipid components by anammox (anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing) bacteria. By virtue of their angle and torsional strain, ladderanes are unusually energetic compounds, and if produced biochemically by engineered microbes, could serve as renewable, high-energy-density jet fuel components. The biochemistry and genetics underlying the ladderane biosynthetic pathway are unknown, however, previous studies have identified a pool of 34 candidate genes from the anammox bacterium, Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, some or all of which may be involved with ladderane fatty acid biosynthesis. The goal of the present study was to establish a systematic means of testing the candidate genes from K. stuttgartiensis for involvement in ladderane biosynthesis through heterologous expression in E. coli under anaerobic conditions. This study describes an efficient means of assembly of synthesized, codon-optimized candidate ladderane biosynthesis genes in synthetic operons that allows for changes to regulatory element sequences, as well as modular assembly of multiple operons for simultaneous heterologous expression in E. coli (or potentially other microbial hosts). We also describe in vivo functional tests of putative anammox homologs of the phytoene desaturase CrtI, which plays an important role in the hypothesized ladderane pathway, and a method for soluble purification of one of these enzymes. This study is, to our knowledge, the first experimental effort focusing on the role of specific anammox genes in the production of ladderanes, and lays the foundation for future efforts toward determination of the ladderane biosynthetic pathway. Our substantial, but far from comprehensive, efforts at elucidating the ladderane biosynthetic pathway were not successful. We invite the scientific community to take advantage of the considerable synthetic biology resources and experimental results developed in this study to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway that produces unique and intriguing ladderane lipids."

We used a semantic relatedness judgment task in L2 English that included Polish-English interlingual homographs and English translations of the Polish homographs’ meanings. Based on previous studies using the same paradigm, we expected a strong homograph interference and inhibition of the homographs’ Polish meanings translations. In addition, we predicted that participants with lower L2 proficiency would experience greater interference and stronger inhibitory effects. The reported results confirm a strong homograph interference effect. In addition, our results indicate that the scope of inhibition generalized from the homograph’s irrelevant meaning to a whole semantic category, indicating the flexibility of the inhibitory mechanisms. Contrary to our expectations, L2 proficiency did not modulate the effects of interference and inhibition, possibly due to a relatively low variability in proficiency within our participant sample."

VE estimates were performed for each influenza virus type/subtype, stratified by underlying diseases and adjusted for age, sex and calendar week of infection.Detailed genetic and antigenic analyses showed that circulating A(H3N2) viruses were genetically distinct from the 2014/15 A(H3N2) vaccine component indicating a profound vaccine mismatch. The Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically conserved and matched the respective vaccine component. Influenza B viruses were lineage-matched B/Yamagata viruses with a clade-level variation. Consistent with substantial vaccine mismatch for the A(H3N2) viruses a crude overall VE of only 47% was estimated, whereas the VE estimates for A(H1N1)pdm09 were 84% and for influenza B viruses 70%. Increased VE estimates were obtained after stratification by underlying diseases and adjustment for the covariates sex and age, whereby the adjustment for the calendar week of infection was the covariate exerting the highest influence on adjusted VE estimates.In summary, VE data obtained in this study underscore the importance to perform VE estimates in the context of detailed characterization of the contributing viruses and also demonstrate that the calendar week of influenza virus infection is the most important confounder of VE estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2298109369,"A number of studies have recently investigated personality traits in non-human species, with the dog gaining popularity as a subject species for research in this area. Recent research has shown the consistency of personality traits across both context and time for adult dogs, both when using questionnaire based methods of investigation and behavioural analyses of the dogs’ behaviour. However, only a few studies have assessed the correspondence between these two methods, with results varying considerably across studies. Furthermore, most studies have focused on adult dogs, despite the fact that an understanding of personality traits in young puppies may be important for research focusing on the genetic basis of personality traits. In the current study, we sought to evaluate the correspondence between a questionnaire based method and the in depth analyses of the behaviour of 2-month old puppies in an open-field test in which a number of both social and non-social stimuli were presented to the subjects. We further evaluated consistency of traits over time by re-testing a subset of puppies. The correspondence between methods was high and test- retest consistency (for the main trait) was also good using both evaluation methods. Results showed clear factors referring to the two main personality traits ‘extroversion,’ (i.e. the enthusiastic, exuberant approach to the stimuli) and ‘neuroticism,’ (i.e. the more cautious and fearful approach to the stimuli), potentially similar to the shyness-boldness dimension found in previous studies. Furthermore, both methods identified an ‘amicability’ dimension, expressing the positive interactions the pups directed at the humans stranger, and a ‘reservedness’ dimension which identified pups who largely chose not to interact with the stimuli, and were defined as quiet and not nosey in the questionnaire."
https://openalex.org/W2300588192,"Introduction There is wide variability in the amount of weight gained when quitting smoking, but little is known about key predictors of weight gain. We examined the impact of body mass index (BMI) category and sociodemographic variables on post-cessation weight gain. Materials and Methods We utilized National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from five consecutive cycles of data collection from 2003–2004 to 2011–2012 to estimate post-cessation weight gain by BMI category among recent quitters (n = 654). We analyzed data on their “current weight” and their “past year weight”. We also compared the recent quitters with current smokers, in order to estimate the amount of weight that could be attributed to quitting smoking. Results Recent quitters gained 1.4 kg (95% CI: 0.8 to 2.0), while current smokers had a non-significant weight change (-0.01 kg (95% CI: -0.3 to 0.2). Weight gain was significant for those in the normal weight (3.1 kg, 95% CI: 2.3 to 3.9) and overweight BMI categories (2.2 kg, 95% CI: 1.1 to 3.2). Conclusions BMI category is a key factor in the extent of post-cessation weight gain, with normal and overweight recent quitters gaining significant amounts of weight."
https://openalex.org/W2298636578,"In nature, almost all animals have to cope with periods of food shortage during their lifetimes. Starvation risks are especially high for carnivorous predatory species, which often experience long intervals between stochastic prey capturing events. A laboratory experiment using the common predatory carabid beetle Anchomenus dorsalis revealed an exceptional level of starvation resistance in this species: males survived up to 137 days and females up to 218 days without food at 20°C. Individual starvation resistance was strongly positively affected by pre-starvation body mass but only slightly by beetle structural body size per se. Females outperformed males even when the effect of gender was corrected for the effects of structural body size and pre-starvation body mass. The better performance of females compared to males and of beetles with higher relative pre-starvation body mass could be linked to higher fat content and lean dry mass before starvation, followed by a greater decrease in both during starvation. There was also a difference between the sexes in the extent of body mass changes both during ad libitum feeding and following starvation; the body masses of females fluctuated more compared to males. This study stresses the need to distinguish between body mass and structural body size when investigating the ecological and evolutionary consequences of body size. Investigation of the net effects of body size and sex is necessary to disentangle the causes of differences in individual performances in studies of species with significant sexual size dimorphism."
https://openalex.org/W2296861984,"Understory plant communities play critical ecological roles in forest ecosystems. Both above- and below-ground ecosystem properties and processes influence these communities but relatively little is known about such effects at fine (i.e., one to several meters within-stand) scales, particularly for forests in which the canopy is dominated by a single species. An improved understanding of these effects is critical for understanding how understory biodiversity is regulated in such forests and for anticipating impacts of changing disturbance regimes. Our primary objective was to examine the patterns of fine-scale variation in understory plant communities and their relationships to above- and below-ground resource and environmental heterogeneity within mature lodgepole pine forests. We assessed composition and diversity of understory vegetation in relation to heterogeneity of both the above-ground (canopy tree density, canopy and tall shrub basal area and cover, downed wood biomass, litter cover) and below-ground (soil nutrient availability, decomposition, forest floor thickness, pH, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and multiple carbon-source substrate-induced respiration (MSIR) of the forest floor microbial community) environment. There was notable variation in fine-scale plant community composition; cluster and indicator species analyses of the 24 most commonly occurring understory species distinguished four assemblages, one for which a pioneer forb species had the highest cover levels, and three others that were characterized by different bryophyte species having the highest cover. Constrained ordination (distance-based redundancy analysis) showed that two above-ground (mean tree diameter, litter cover) and eight below-ground (forest floor pH, plant available boron, microbial community composition and function as indicated by MSIR and PLFAs) properties were associated with variation in understory plant community composition. These results provide novel insights into the important ecological associations between understory plant community composition and heterogeneity in ecosystem properties and processes within forests dominated by a single canopy species."
https://openalex.org/W2296988838,"Persistent somatoform pain disorder (PSPD) is a mental disorder un-associated with any somatic injury and can cause severe somatosensory and emotional impairments in patients. However, so far, the neuro-pathophysiological mechanism of the functional impairments in PSPD is still unclear. The present study assesses the difference in regional spontaneous activity between PSPD and healthy controls (HC) during a resting state, in order to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying PSPD. Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data were obtained from 13 PSPD patients and 23 age- and gender-matched HC subjects in this study. Kendall’s coefficient of concordance was used to measure regional homogeneity (ReHo), and a two-sample t-test was subsequently performed to investigate the ReHo difference between PSPD and HC. Additionally, the correlations between the mean ReHo of each survived area and the clinical assessments were further analyzed. Compared with the HC group, patients with PSPD exhibited decreased ReHo in the bilateral primary somatosensory cortex, posterior cerebellum, and occipital lobe, while increased ReHo in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and default mode network (including the medial PFC, right inferior parietal lobe (IPL), and left supramarginal gyrus). In addition, significant positive correlations were found between the mean ReHo of both right IPL and left supramarginal gyrus and participants’ Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores, and between the mean ReHo of the left middle frontal gyrus and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores. Our results suggest that abnormal spontaneous brain activity in specific brain regions during a resting state may be associated with the dysfunctions in pain, memory and emotional processing commonly observed in patients with PSPD. These findings help us to understand the neural mechanisms underlying PSPD and suggest that the ReHo metric could be used as a clinical marker for PSPD."
https://openalex.org/W2398916212,"Haemophilus influenzae is an opportunistic pathogen. The emergence of virulent, non-typeable strains (NTHi) emphasizes the importance of developing new interventional targets. We screened the NTHi supragenome for genes encoding surface-exposed proteins suggestive of immune evasion, identifying a large family containing Sel1-like repeats (SLRs). Clustering identified ten SLR-containing gene subfamilies, each with various numbers of SLRs per gene. Individual strains also had varying numbers of SLR-containing genes from one or more of the subfamilies. Statistical genetic analyses of gene possession among 210 NTHi strains typed as either disease or carriage found a significant association between possession of the SlrVA subfamily (which we have termed, macrophage survival factor, msf) and the disease isolates. The PittII strain contains four chromosomally contiguous msf genes. Deleting all four of these genes (msfA1-4) (KO) resulted in a highly significant decrease in phagocytosis and survival in macrophages; which was fully complemented by a single copy of the msfA1 gene. Using the chinchilla model of otitis media and invasive disease, the KO strain displayed a significant decrease in fitness compared to the WT in co-infections; and in single infections, the KO lost its ability to invade the brain. The singly complemented strain showed only a partial ability to compete with the WT suggesting gene dosage is important in vivo. The transcriptional profiles of the KO and WT in planktonic growth were compared using the NTHi supragenome array, which revealed highly significant changes in the expression of operons involved in virulence and anaerobiosis. These findings demonstrate that the msfA1-4 genes are virulence factors for phagocytosis, persistence, and trafficking to non-mucosal sites."
https://openalex.org/W2300124239,"Some conduct-disordered youths have high levels of callous unemotional traits and meet the DSM-5's ""with limited prosocial emotions"" (LPE) specifier. These youths often do aggressive, self-benefitting acts that cost others. We previously developed a task, the AlAn's game, which asks participants to repeatedly decide whether to accept or reject offers in which they will receive money but a planned charity donation will be reduced. In our prior work, more ""costly helping"" (i.e., rejecting the offered money and protecting the donation) was associated with lower callous unemotional traits. Here we extend that prior work in a larger sample of adolescent male patients with serious conduct problems and controls, and test whether this association is mediated specifically by a Moral Elevation response (i.e., a positive emotional response to another's act of virtue).The adolescent male participants were: 45 patients (23 with LPE) and 26 controls, who underwent an extensive phenotypic assessment including a measure of Moral Elevation. About 1 week later participants played the AlAn's game.All AlAn's game outcomes demonstrated significant group effects: (1) money taken for self (p = 0.02); (2) money left in the charitable donation (p = 0.03); and, (3) costly helping (p = 0.047). Controls took the least money and did the most costly helping, while patients with LPE took the most money and did the least costly helping. Groups also significantly differed in post-stimulus Moral Elevation scores (p = 0.005). Exploratory analyses supported that the relationship between callous unemotional traits and costly helping on the AlAn's game may be mediated in part by differences in Moral Elevation.The AlAn's game provides a standardized behavioral measure associated with callous unemotional traits. Adolescents with high levels of callous unemotional traits engage in fewer costly helping behaviors, and those differences may be related to blunting of positive emotional responses."
https://openalex.org/W2301697702,"In S334ter-line-3 rat model of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), rod cell death induces the rearrangement of cones into mosaics of rings while the fibrotic processes of Müller cells remodel to fill the center of the rings. In contrast, previous work established that DL-alpha-aminoadipic-acid (AAA), a compound that transiently blocks Müller cell metabolism, abolishes these highly structured cone rings. Simultaneously, adherens-junction associated protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression forms in a network between the photoreceptor segments and Müller cells processes. Thus, we hypothesized that AAA treatment alters the cone mosaic rings by disrupting the distal sealing formed by these fibrotic processes, either directly or indirectly, by down regulating the expression of ZO-1. Therefore, we examined these processes and ZO-1 expression at the outer retina after intravitreal injection of AAA and observed that AAA treatment transiently disrupts the distal glial sealing in RP retina, plus induces cones in rings to become more homogeneous. Moreover, ZO-1 expression is actively suppressed after 3 days of AAA treatment, which coincided with cone ring disruption. Similar modifications of glial sealing and cone distribution were observed after injection of siRNA to inhibit ZO-1 expression. These findings support our hypothesis and provide additional information about the critical role played by ZO-1 in glial sealing and shaping the ring mosaic in RP retina. These studies represent important advancements in the understanding of retinal degeneration's etiology and pathophysiology."

Genotyping the polymorphisms involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of acenocoumarol before starting anticoagulant therapy would result in a better quality of life and a more efficient use of healthcare resources. The objective of this study is to develop a new algorithm that includes clinical and genetic variables to predict the most appropriate acenocoumarol dosage for stable anticoagulation in a wide range of patients. We recruited 685 patients from 2 Spanish hospitals and 1 primary healthcare center. We randomly chose 80% of the patients (n = 556), considering an equitable distribution of genotypes to form the generation cohort. The remaining 20% (n = 129) formed the validation cohort. Multiple linear regression was used to generate the algorithm using the acenocoumarol stable dosage as the dependent variable and the clinical and genotypic variables as the independent variables. The variables included in the algorithm were age, weight, amiodarone use, enzyme inducer status, international normalized ratio target range and the presence of CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853), CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910), VKORC1 (rs9923231) and CYP4F2 (rs2108622). The coefficient of determination (R2) explained by the algorithm was 52.8% in the generation cohort and 64% in the validation cohort. The following R2 values were evaluated by pathology: atrial fibrillation, 57.4%; valve replacement, 56.3%; and venous thromboembolic disease, 51.5%. When the patients were classified into 3 dosage groups according to the stable dosage (<11 mg/week, 11-21 mg/week, >21 mg/week), the percentage of correctly classified patients was higher in the intermediate group, whereas differences between pharmacogenetic and clinical algorithms increased in the extreme dosage groups. Our algorithm could improve acenocoumarol dosage selection for patients who will begin treatment with this drug, especially in extreme-dosage patients. The predictability of the pharmacogenetic algorithm did not vary significantly between diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2301973158,"Objective This study explored qualitative treatment-subgroup interactions within data of a RCT with two cognitive behavioral treatments (CBT) for adolescents with ADHD: a planning-focused (PML) and a solution-focused CBT (SFT). Qualitative interactions imply that which treatment is best differs across subgroups of patients, and are therefore most relevant for personalized medicine. Methods Adolescents with ADHD (N = 159) received either PML or SFT. Pre-, post- and three-month follow-up data were gathered on parent-rated ADHD symptoms and planning problems. Pretreatment characteristics were explored as potential qualitative moderators of pretest to follow-up treatment effects, using an innovative analyses technique (QUINT; Dusseldorp & Van Mechelen, 2014). In addition, qualitative treatment-subgroup interactions for the therapeutic changes from pre- to posttest and from post- to follow-up test were investigated. Results For the entire time span from pretest to follow-up only a quantitative interaction was found, while from posttest to follow-up qualitative interactions were found: Adolescents with less depressive symptoms but more anxiety symptoms showed more improvement when receiving PML than SFT, while for other adolescents the effects of PML and SFT were comparable. Discussion Whereas subgroups in both treatments followed different trajectories, no subgroup was found for which SFT outperformed PML in terms of the global change in symptoms from pretest to three months after treatment. This implies that, based on this exploratory study, there is no need for personalized treatment allocation with regard to the CBTs under study for adolescents with ADHD. However, for a subgroup with comorbid anxiety symptoms but low depression PML clearly appears the treatment of preference. Trial Registration Nederlands Trial Register NTR2142"

This study aims to create models of the cost of treating hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM based upon physician estimates of medical resource usage.Using a literature review and personal advice from endocrinologists and emergency physicians, we developed several models for managing patients with hypoglycemia. The final model was approved by the consulting experts. We also developed 3 unique surveys to allow endocrinologists, emergency room (ER) physicians, and primary care physicians to evaluate the resource usage of patients with hypoglycemia. Medical costs were calculated by multiplying the estimated medical resource usage by the corresponding health insurance medical care costs reported in 2014.In total, 40 endocrinologists, 20 ER physicians, and 30 primary care physicians completed the survey. We identified 12 types of standard medical models for secondary or tertiary hospitals and 4 for primary care clinics based on the use of ER, general ward, or intensive care unit (ICU) and patients' status of consciousness and self-respiration. Estimated medical costs per person per hypoglycemic event ranged from $17.28 to $1,857.09 for secondary and tertiary hospitals. These costs were higher for patients who were unconscious and for those requiring ICU admission.Hypoglycemia has a substantial impact on the medical costs and its prevention will result in economic benefits for T2DM patients and society."

Therefore, the molecular basis for the interconversion between the extracellular and intracellular facing conformations, which lies at the heart of the transport mechanism, remains poorly understood. Previously we deduced the intracellular facing models of MATE transporters and posited how they undergo conformational changes during drug export (9Lu M. Radchenko M. Symersky J. Nie R. Guo Y.

On the basis of our new biochemical data and available crystal structures, we uncovered the movement of transmembrane helices during transport in NorM-NG, shedding new light on how MATE transporters switch between their extracellular and intracellular facing states.

The membrane expression levels of the NorM-NG mutants discussed in this work were similar to that of the wild-type protein, based on the Western blot using an antibody against the His tag. Poorly expressed and/or unstable NorM-NG mutants had been removed from further study. For the Western blot, the antibody (Qiagen, catalog no. 34460) was diluted 2,500-fold before being mixed with the transfer membranes, and each sample examined on the SDS-PAGE gel was derived from cell membranes isolated from 80 μg of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) ΔacrABΔmacABΔyojHI cells expressing the NorM-NG variants. The NorM-NG variants were expressed and purified as follows. Briefly, E. coli BL21 (DE3) ΔacrABΔmacABΔyojHI cells transformed with the protein expression vectors were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium to an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and ruptured by multiple passages through a precooled French pressure cell. All the protein purification experiments were performed at 4 °C.

The culture was then incubated at 30 °C with shaking, and the bacterial growth was monitored after 10 h. Assays were performed in 96-well plates, and the optical density at 595 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Tecan GENios Plus). We defined the minimal inhibitory concentration as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial compounds that precludes the growth of E. coli under our experimental conditions (7Lu M. Symersky J. Radchenko M. Koide A. Guo Y. Nie R. Koide S. Structures of a Na+-coupled, substrate-bound MATE multidrug transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 2099-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cultures of the E. coli BL21 (DE3) ΔacrABΔmacABΔyojHI cells expressing NorM-NG variants were grown to an A600 nm of 0.5 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h. The cells were harvested; washed three times with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0; resuspended in the same buffer to an A600 nm of 1.0/ml. Rhodamine 6G (R6G) or ethidium was added to the cells at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml, with or without the inclusion of 300 μm CuSO4, 600 μm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 750 μm DTT. After incubation on ice for 10 min, a 1-ml sample was withdrawn every 2.5 min, and cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The R6G or ethidium fluorescence was then measured with the excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 590 nm, respectively (10Radchenko M. Symersky J. Nie R. Lu M. Structural basis for the blockade of MATE multidrug efflux pumps.Nat. Commun. 2015; 67995Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this work, we aimed to use our intracellular facing model of NorM-NG as a guide for site-directed mutagenesis (9Lu M. Radchenko M. Symersky J. Nie R. Guo Y. Structural insights into H+-coupled multidrug extrusion by a MATE transporter.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and then “freeze” NorM-NG in its intracellular facing conformation by utilizing disulfide cross-linking (16Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Transport mechanism of a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters.Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To accomplish this aim, we first attempted to remove all the endogenous cysteines in NorM-NG and then to carry out paired cysteine substitutions to generate mutants wherein disulfide bonds can be formed in the intracellular facing conformation but not the extracellular facing conformation. NorM-NG has four endogenous cysteines: Cys202 (TM6), Cys381 (TM10), Cys407 (TM11), and Cys444 (TM12), most of which are removed from the substrate- and Na+-binding sites and not conserved even in the NorM branch (7Lu M. Symersky J. Radchenko M. Koide A. Guo Y. Nie R. Koide S. Structures of a Na+-coupled, substrate-bound MATE multidrug transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 2099-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, the replacement of these cysteines by isosteric serine or valine, we reasoned, would be unlikely to affect the protein folding or transport function. Much to our amazement, although the single NorM-NG mutants C202S and C381S were both expressed to the same level as that of the wild-type protein, the replacement of Cys407 or Cys444 in NorM-NG, by serine or valine, completely abolished the protein expression (data not shown). To overcome this difficulty, we aligned the amino acid sequence of NorM-NG with those of >30 NorM orthologues. Based on the sequence alignment, we substituted Cys407 and Cys444 in NorM-NG individually with the equivalent residues found in other NorM orthologues and then examined the membrane expression and solution behaviors of those single mutants by using Western blot and gel filtration chromatography, respectively (18Li X. Dang S. Yan C. Gong X. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presinilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Well behaved single mutations were then selected and combined to generate double, triple, and finally quadruple mutants (data not shown). After screening >40 different NorM-NG mutants, we identified a quadruple mutant, C202S/C381S/C407F/C444R, hereafter termed “Cys-less NorM-NG,” that was expressed to a similar level to that of NorM-NG and exhibited good solution behavior. Based on the drug resistance and accumulation assays (see below), we found that the Cys-less NorM-NG retained the multidrug efflux activity, suggesting that the quadruple mutation had not disrupted the transporter structure or function and thus was suitable for further mutagenesis and functional studies. Previously we hypothesized that NorM-NG switches from its extracellular to intracellular facing conformation upon substrate release and Na+ binding (7Lu M. Symersky J. Radchenko M. Koide A. Guo Y. Nie R. Koide S. Structures of a Na+-coupled, substrate-bound MATE multidrug transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 2099-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our studies further predicted that in the intracellular facing NorM-NG, the extracellular portions of TM1 and TM2 are in close proximity to those of TM8 and TM7, respectively (9Lu M. Radchenko M. Symersky J. Nie R. Guo Y. Structural insights into H+-coupled multidrug extrusion by a MATE transporter.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). If our prediction is correct, once we replace the amino acids envisioned to be close enough in the intracellular facing NorM-NG with cysteines, we may be able to employ disulfide cross-linking to “stitch” together the extracellular portions of TM1 and TM8, TM2 and TM7, or TM2 and TM8. Along this line of reasoning, we identified 14 pairs of amino acids in NorM-NG whose Cα positions are far apart in the extracellular facing structure (7Lu M. Symersky J. Radchenko M. Koide A. Guo Y. Nie R. Koide S. Structures of a Na+-coupled, substrate-bound MATE multidrug transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 2099-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but close to each other in the intracellular facing model (Fig. 1). The intracellular facing model of NorM-NG was constructed by rotating the C domain as a rigid body in the extracellular facing structure by 20° relative to the N domain (9Lu M. Radchenko M. Symersky J. Nie R. Guo Y. Structural insights into H+-coupled multidrug extrusion by a MATE transporter.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Among the 14 pairs of amino acids, 8 are located within TM1 and TM8, 5 are within TM2 and TM7, and 1 is within TM2 and TM8. Notably, most of these amino acids are removed from the substrate- and Na+-binding sites (7Lu M. Symersky J. Radchenko M. Koide A. Guo Y. Nie R. Koide S. Structures of a Na+-coupled, substrate-bound MATE multidrug transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 2099-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), thereby diminishing the possibility of interfering with substrate- and/or Na+-binding and hence giving rise to inactive proteins upon cysteine substitutions. We then replaced these amino acids in the Cys-less NorM-NG with cysteines singularly or in pairs, yielding a total of 28 and 14 of what we denoted “mono-” and “dicysteine” mutants, respectively. Among the 14 dicysteine mutants, only 7 were expressed to similar levels to that of NorM-NG (Fig. 2) and were well folded based on their profiles on gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). Importantly, these 7 mutants retained the ability to extrude different drugs (see below) and were therefore suitable for further investigation.FIGURE 2Western blot analysis of the NorM-NG variants. Western blot analysis of NorM-NG variants in membrane preparations was performed by using an antibody against the His tag. This analysis suggested that all of the NorM-NG variants investigated in this work were expressed at similar levels in the E. coli membrane. The positions of two molecular weight markers are also indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We first asked whether the seven dicysteine mutants, namely T42C/L289C, A45C/V285C (TM1 and TM8), L58C/V269C, L58C/F270C, A62C/F265C, A62C/S266C (TM2 and TM7), and A57C/Q284C (TM2 and TM8) can form intramolecular disulfide bonds in vitro. We expressed and purified these dicysteine mutants in the presence of Na+. We then incubated these proteins with an oxidizing agent (copper phenanthroline) and performed nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3A). We observed that for five mutants, T42C/L289C, A45C/V285C, L58C/F270C, A62C/S266C, and A57C/Q284C, copper phenanthroline treatment yielded distinct protein species with markedly higher electrophoretic mobility. Moreover, the faster migrating protein species contained no free cysteine thiols, because they could no longer react with a thiol-reactive fluorophore, N-(5-fluoresceinyl)maleimide (Fig. 3B). Notably, the electrophoretic mobility shift unlikely resulted from protein aggregation and/or denaturation induced by copper phenanthroline, because the five dicysteine mutants remained monomeric and well folded after the copper phenanthroline treatment, as judged by their behavior on gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). Indeed, the changes in electrophoretic mobility could be completely reversed by incubating the protein samples subsequently with the reducing agent DTT (see below), arguing that the gel mobility shift was due to oxidative cross-linking of the paired cysteines, and the disulfide bonds in a well folded transporter were readily reduced by DTT. Moreover, the cross-linking of the five NorM-NG mutants depended on the presence of copper phenanthroline, because neither the gel mobility shift nor the loss of free cysteine thiols could be detected for the untreated protein samples even after prolonged storage (data not shown). By contrast, copper phenanthroline treatment failed to alter the electrophoretic mobility of another two dicysteine mutants L58C/V269C and A62C/F265C (Fig. 3A). Additionally, these two mutants retained the free cysteine thiols even after the exposure to copper phenanthroline (Fig. 3B). Because NorM-NG is a monomer in solution (7Lu M. Symersky J. Radchenko M. Koide A. Guo Y. Nie R. Koide S. Structures of a Na+-coupled, substrate-bound MATE multidrug transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 2099-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10Radchenko M. Symersky J. Nie R. Lu M. Structural basis for the blockade of MATE multidrug efflux pumps.Nat. Commun. 2015; 67995Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), our data were consistent with the five cysteine pairs: T42C/L289C, A45C/V285C, L58C/F270C, A62C/S266C, and A57C/Q284C, each forming an intramolecular disulfide bond. The formation of such disulfide bonds likely prevented complete unfolding of the protein under nonreducing and yet denaturing conditions and thus substantially altered the electrophoretic mobility of the transporter (13Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner BI. Proximity of two oppositely oriented reentrant loops in the glutamate transporter GLT-1 identified by paired cysteine mutagenesis.J. Biol.

Transport mechanism of a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters.Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Significantly, under our experimental conditions, the five detergent-purified dicysteine mutants could be converted into the faster migrating species almost completely, further attesting to the validity of our experimental design and the intracellular facing model (9Lu M. Radchenko M. Symersky J. Nie R. Guo Y. Structural insights into H+-coupled multidrug extrusion by a MATE transporter.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In comparison with the five shifted dicysteine mutants, copper phenanthroline had no measurable effect on the gel mobility of the wild-type or Cys-less NorM-NG or the single mutant D41A (Fig. 3A). D41A exhibited severely crippled transport function (7Lu M. Symersky J. Radchenko M. Koide A. Guo Y. Nie R. Koide S. Structures of a Na+-coupled, substrate-bound MATE multidrug transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 2099-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10Radchenko M. Symersky J. Nie R. Lu M. Structural basis for the blockade of MATE multidrug efflux pumps.Nat. Commun. 2015; 67995Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and was used as a negative control in our functional assays. Because both NorM-NG and D41A bear the four endogenous cysteines, our data implied that under our experimental conditions, copper phenanthroline did not cause the formation of intramolecular disulfide bond(s) among the endogenous cysteines or intermolecular disulfide bond(s) between different NorM-NG molecules. Nonetheless, the Cys-less NorM-NG vastly simplified the interpretation of our experimental data (e.g. the detection of free cysteine thiols; Fig. 3B) and also ruled out the possibility of forming disulfide bond(s) between the endogenous and newly introduced cysteines. Therefore, we deemed the Cys-less NorM-NG better suited for our cross-linking studies than the wild-type transporter. Unlike the five cross-linkable dicysteine mutants, the electrophoretic mobility of the corresponding monocysteine mutants was not affected by the copper phenanthroline and/or DTT treatment (Fig. 4). Additionally, the 10 monocysteine mutants retained their free cysteine thiols even after the copper phenanthroline treatment, in marked contrast to the dicysteine mutants (Fig. 3B), indicating that under our experimental conditions, copper phenanthroline catalyzed the oxidation of the paired cysteines rather than the single cysteines in NorM-NG. We further examined the impact of substrates on the cross-linking. We found that TPP, a substrate of NorM-NG (7Lu M. Syme"

Viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) containing genomic RNA segments, nucleoprotein oligomers, and the viral polymerase, play a central role in the viral replication cycle. Our knowledge about critical events such as vRNP assembly and interactions with other viral and cellular proteins is poor and could be substantially improved by time lapse imaging of the infected cells. However, such studies are limited by the difficulty to achieve live-cell compatible labeling of active vRNPs. Previously we designed the first unimpaired recombinant influenza WSN-PB2-GFP11 virus allowing fluorescent labeling of the PB2 subunit of the viral polymerase (Avilov et al., J.Virol. 2012). Here, we simultaneously labeled the viral PB2 protein using the above-mentioned strategy, and virus-encoded progeny RNPs through spontaneous incorporation of transiently expressed NP-mCherry fusion proteins during RNP assembly in live infected cells. This dual labeling enabled us to visualize progeny vRNPs throughout the infection cycle and to characterize independently the mobility, oligomerization status and interactions of vRNP components in the nuclei of live infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2300278634,"Generating random number sequences is a popular psychological task often used to measure executive functioning. We explore random generation under “joint cognition” instructions; pairs of participants take turns to compile a shared response sequence. Across three studies, we point to six key findings from this novel format. First, there are both costs and benefits from group performance. Second, repetition avoidance occurs in dyadic as well as individual production settings. Third, individuals modify their choices in a dyadic situation such that the pair becomes the unit of psychological function. Fourth, there is immediate contagion of sequence stereotypy amongst the pairs (i.e., each contributor “owns” their partner’s response). Fifth, dyad effects occur even when participants know their partner is not interacting with them (Experiment 2). Sixth, ironically, directing participants’ efforts away from their shared task responsibility can actually benefit conjoint performance (Experiment 3). These results both constrain models of random generation and illuminate processes of joint cognition."

An estimated number of about 50% of all anemia may be attributed to iron deficiency among young children in Cambodia.A cross-sectional survey was conducted in rural Cambodia in September 2012. Villages in pre-selected communes were randomly chosen using stunting as a primary indicator of nutritional status. In total, 928 randomly selected households with children aged 3-23 months were included. Hemoglobin, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and retinol binding protein (RBP) were assessed from capillary blood samples. In addition, length/height and weight of mothers and children were taken and data on dietary diversity was collected. A child feeding index (CFI) was created. Associations between biomarkers of iron and vitamin A status and nutritional status or food intake were explored.Anemia prevalence was highest among 6- to 12-months-olds (71%). Ferritin and sTfR inversely correlated and were significantly associated with hemoglobin concentrations. The consumption of animal source foods (ASF) significantly impacts on the interaction between ferritin, sTfR and hemoglobin. Concentrations of RBP were significantly higher in children who had received a vitamin A supplement. The CFI was associated with sTfR and hemoglobin. Lower length and weight were associated with lower ferritin levels and showed an indirect effect on hemoglobin through ferritin.Nutrition programs targeting children under 2 years of age need to focus on the preparation of complementary foods with high nutrient density to sustainably prevent micronutrient deficiency and generally improve nutritional status. Future assessments of the micronutrient status should include identification of hemoglobinopathies and parasitic infections to better understand all causes of anemia in Cambodian infants and young children.German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00004379."

In this work, we investigated the influence of oxygen in the media during UV irradiation and characterized the effect on chemical composition using NMR and LC-MS, as well as the ability of the irradiated media to support cell culture. Chemically defined Chinese hamster ovary cell growth media was irradiated at high fluences in a continuous-flow UV reactor. UV-irradiation caused the depletion of pyridoxamine, pyridoxine, pyruvate, riboflavin, tryptophan, and tyrosine; and accumulation of acetate, formate, kynurenine, lumichrome, and sarcosine. Pyridoxamine was the only compound to undergo complete degradation within the fluences considered; complete depletion of pyridoxamine was observed at 200 mJ/cm2. Although in both oxygen- and nitrogen-saturated media, the cell culture performance was affected at fluences above 200 mJ/cm2, there was less of an impact on cell culture performance in the nitrogen-saturated media. Based on these results, minimization of oxygen in cell culture media prior to UV treatment is recommended to minimize the negative impact on sensitive media."
https://openalex.org/W2302456409,"Leukotoxin (Ltx) is a prominent virulence factor produced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, an oral microorganism highly associated with aggressive periodontitis. Ltx compromises host responsiveness by altering the viability of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Previously, we developed a Rhesus (Rh) monkey colonization model designed to determine the effect of virulence gene mutations on colonization of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Unexpectedly, an A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin (ltxA) mutant (RhAa-VS2) failed to colonize in the Rh model. No previous literature suggested that Ltx was associated with A. actinomycetemcomitans binding to tooth surfaces. These results led us to explore the broad effects of the ltxA mutation in vitro. Results indicated that LtxA activity was completely abolished in RhAa-VS2 strain, while complementation significantly (P<0.0001) restored leukotoxicity compared to RhAa-VS2 strain. RT-PCR analysis of ltx gene expression ruled out polar effects. Furthermore, binding of RhAa-VS2 to salivary-coated hydroxyapatite (SHA) was significantly decreased (P<0.0001) compared to wild type RhAa3 strain. Real time RT-PCR analysis of the genes related to SHA binding in RhAa-VS2 showed that genes related to binding were downregulated [rcpA (P = 0.018), rcpB (P = 0.02), tadA (P = 0.002)] as compared to wild type RhAa3. RhAa-VS2 also exhibited decreased biofilm depth (P = 0.008) and exo-polysaccharide production (P<0.0001). Buccal epithelial cell (BEC) binding of RhAa-VS2 was unaffected. Complementation with ltxA restored binding to SHA (P<0.002) but had no effect on biofilm formation when compared to RhAa3. In conclusion, mutation of ltxA diminished hard tissue binding in vitro, which helps explain the previous in vivo failure of a ltxA knockout to colonize the Rh oral cavity. These results suggest that; 1) one specific gene knockout (in this case ltxA) could affect other seemingly unrelated genes (such as rcpA, rcpB tadA etc), and 2) some caution should be used when interpreting the effect attributed to targeted gene mutations when seen in a competitive in vivo environment."

Here we show that executing such actions can influence performance on a speech-categorization task. Participants watched and/or listened to speech stimuli while executing either a power or a precision grip.

Two follow-up experiments indicated that the effect was based on action-induced bias in selecting the syllable.
https://openalex.org/W2299499895,"Numerous studies have identified the effects of prematurity on the neonate's physical health, however few studies have explored the effects of prematurity on both the physical and mental health of the child as they develop. Secondary analysis of data from the Millennium Cohort Study, a longitudinal study of infants (n = 18 818, born 2000-2002 in the United Kingdom) was performed. Effects of gestational age at birth on health outcomes at 5 years were measured using parental rating of their children's general health and severity of behavior problems. The association between parent's general health ratings and behavior problem ratings was low: 86% of those reporting serious behavior problems (5% of the sample, n = 764) rated their child as being in excellent, very good, or good health. Still, a gradient of increasing risk of poorer outcome with decreasing gestational age was observed for a composite health measure (poor/fair health and/or serious behavior problems), suggesting an association with prematurity for this composite assessment of health status. The greatest contribution to the childhood composite health measure at 5 years was for children born at 32-36 weeks gestation: population attributable fractions for having poor outcomes was 3.4% (Bonferroni-adjusted 95% confidence interval 1.1%-6.2%), compared to 1% (0.2-2.3) for birth at less than 32 weeks. Results suggest that preterm children, by school entry, are not only at high risk of physical health problems, but also of behavioral health problems.

https://openalex.org/W2302372233,"Purpose A magnetic resonance imaging method is presented that allows for the simultaneous assessment of oxygen delivery, oxygen uptake, and parenchymal density. The technique is applied to a mouse model of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) induced lung emphysema in order to investigate how structural changes affect lung function. Method Nine-week-old female C57BL6 mice were instilled with saline or PPE at days 0 and 7. At day 19, oxygen delivery, oxygen uptake, and lung density were quantified from T1 and proton-density measurements obtained via oxygen-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (OE-MRI) using an ultrashort echo-time imaging sequence. Subsequently, the lungs were sectioned for histological observation. Blood-gas analyses and pulmonary functional tests via FlexiVent were performed in separate cohorts. Principal Findings PPE-challenged mice had reduced density when assessed via MRI, consistent with the parenchyma loss observed in the histology sections, and an increased lung compliance was detected via FlexiVent. The oxygenation levels, as assessed via the blood-gas analysis, showed no difference between PPE-challenged animals and control. This finding was mirrored in the global MRI assessments of oxygen delivery and uptake, where the changes in relaxation time indices were matched between the groups. The heterogeneity of the same parameters however, were increased in PPE-challenged animals. When the oxygenation status was investigated in regions of varying density, a reduced oxygen-uptake was found in low-density regions of PPE-challenged mice. In high-density regions the uptake was higher than that of regions of corresponding density in control animals. The oxygen delivery was proportional to the oxygen uptake in both groups. Conclusions The proposed method allowed for the regional assessment of the relationship between lung density and two aspects of lung function, the oxygen delivery and uptake. When compared to global indices of lung function, an increased sensitivity for detecting heterogeneous lung disorders was found. This indicated that the technique has potential for early detection of lung dysfunction–before global changes occur."

Due to the development of tissue engineering, embryonic stem cells (ESCs)-derived corneal epithelial-like cells (ESC-CECs) become a new direction for this issue. However, the immunogenicity of ESC-CECs is a critical matter to be solved. In the present study, we explored the immunological properties of ESC-CECs, which were differentiated from ESCs. The results showed that ESC-CECs had a similar character and function with LSCs both in vitro and in vivo. In ESC-CECs, a large number of genes related with immune response were down-regulated. The expressions of MHC-I, MHC-II, and co-stimulatory molecules were low, but the expression of HLA-G was high. The ESC-CECs were less responsible for T cell proliferation and NK cell lysis in vitro, and there was less immune cell infiltration after transplantation in vivo compared with LSCs. Moreover, the immunological properties were not affected by interferon-γ. All these results indicated a low immunogenicity of ESC-CECs, and they can be promising in clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2409344832,"Sf9, a cell line derived from Spodoptera frugiperda, is an ideal model organism for studying insect apoptosis. The first notable study that attempted to identify the apoptotic pathway in Sf9 was performed in 1997 and included the discovery of Sf-caspase-1, an effector caspase of Sf9. However, it was not until 2013 that the first initiator caspase in Sf9, SfDronc, was discovered, and the apoptotic pathway in Sf9 became clearer. In this study, we report another caspase of Sf9, SfDredd. SfDredd is highly similar to insect initiator caspase Dredd homologs. Experimentally, recombinant SfDredd underwent autocleavage and exhibited different efficiencies in cleavage of synthetic caspase substrates. This was attributed to its caspase activity for the predicted active site mutation blocked the above autocleavage and synthetic caspase substrates cleavage activity. SfDredd was capable of not only cleaving Sf-caspase-1 in vitro but also cleaving Sf-caspase-1 and inducing apoptosis when it was co-expressed with Sf-caspase-1 in Sf9 cells. The protein level of SfDredd was increased when Sf9 cells were treated by Actinomycin D, whereas silencing of SfDredd reduced apoptosis and Sf-caspase-1 cleavage induced by Actinomycin D treatment. These results clearly indicate that SfDredd functioned as an apoptotic initiator caspase. Apoptosis induced in Sf9 cells by overexpression of SfDredd alone was not as obvious as that induced by SfDronc alone, and the cleavage sites of Sf-caspase-1 for SfDredd and SfDronc are different. In addition, despite sharing a sequence homology with initiator caspases and possessing weak activity on initiator caspase substrates, SfDredd showed strong activity on effector caspase substrates, making it the only insect caspase reported so far functioning similar to human caspase-2 in this aspect. We believe that the discovery of SfDredd, and its different properties from SfDronc, will improve the understanding of apoptosis pathway in Sf9 cells."

https://openalex.org/W2299140937,"Regulating emerging industries is challenging, even controversial at times. Under-regulation can result in safety threats to plant personnel, surrounding communities, and the environment. Over-regulation may hinder innovation, progress, and economic growth. Since one typically has limited understanding of, and experience with, the novel technology in practice, it is difficult to accomplish a properly balanced regulation. In this work, we propose a control and coordination policy called soft regulation that attempts to strike the right balance and create a collective learning environment. In soft regulation mechanism, individual agents can accept, reject, or partially accept the regulator's recommendation. This non-intrusive coordination does not interrupt normal operations. The extent to which an agent accepts the recommendation is mediated by a confidence level (from 0 to 100%). Among all possible recommendation methods, we investigate two in particular: the best recommendation wherein the regulator is completely informed and the crowd recommendation wherein the regulator collects the crowd's average and recommends that value. We show by analysis and simulations that soft regulation with crowd recommendation performs well. It converges to optimum, and is as good as the best recommendation for a wide range of confidence levels. This work sheds a new theoretical perspective on the concept of the wisdom of crowds."
https://openalex.org/W2302532432,"Rodent mandibular incisors have a unique anatomical structure that allows teeth to grow throughout the lifetime of the rodent. This report presents a novel transplantation technique for studying the apical bud differentiation of rodent mandibular incisors. Incisal apical end tissue with green fluorescent protein from transgenic mouse was transplanted to wild type mice, and the development of the transplanted cells were immunohistologically observed for 12 weeks after the transplantation. Results indicate that the green fluorescent apical end tissue replaced the original tissue, and cells from the apical bud differentiated and extended toward the incisal edge direction. The immunostaining with podoplanin also showed that the characteristics of the green fluorescent tissue were identical to those of the original. The green fluorescent cells were only found in the labial side of the incisor up to 4 weeks. After 12 weeks, however, they were also found in the lingual side. Here the green fluorescent cementocyte-like cells were only present in the cementum close to the dentin surface. This study suggests that some of the cells that form the cellular cementum come from the apical tissue including the apical bud in rodent incisors."
