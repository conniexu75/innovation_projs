https://openalex.org/W2053186076,"Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text."
https://openalex.org/W2001141328,"Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure."

An example of such an optical source is a single-photon pulse with a vanishing probability for detecting two or more photons. Using pulsed laser excitation of a single quantum dot, a single-photon turnstile device that generates a train of single-photon pulses was demonstrated. For a spectrally isolated quantum dot, nearly 100% of the excitation pulses lead to emission of a single photon, yielding an ideal single-photon source."
https://openalex.org/W4248318091,"Understanding how DNA binding proteins control global gene expression and chromosomal maintenance requires knowledge of the chromosomal locations at which these proteins function in vivo. We developed a microarray method that reveals the genome-wide location of DNA-bound proteins and used this method to monitor binding of gene-specific transcription activators in yeast. A combination of location and expression profiles was used to identify genes whose expression is directly controlled by Gal4 and Ste12 as cells respond to changes in carbon source and mating pheromone, respectively. The results identify pathways that are coordinately regulated by each of the two activators and reveal previously unknown functions for Gal4 and Ste12. Genome-wide location analysis will facilitate investigation of gene regulatory networks, gene function, and genome maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2053203314,"Niemann-Pick type C2 disease (NP-C2) is a fatal hereditary disorder of unknown etiology characterized by defective egress of cholesterol from lysosomes. Here we show that the disease is caused by a deficiency in HE1, a ubiquitously expressed lysosomal protein identified previously as a cholesterol-binding protein. HE1 was undetectable in fibroblasts from NP-C2 patients but present in fibroblasts from unaffected controls and NP-C1 patients. Mutations in the HE1 gene, which maps to chromosome 14q24.3, were found in NP-C2 patients but not in controls. Treatment of NP-C2 fibroblasts with exogenous recombinant HE1 protein ameliorated lysosomal accumulation of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol."

Consequently, “SUMOylation” plays a role in multiple vital cellular processes such as oncogenesis, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and response to virus infection. SUMO-1 is conjugated to a target protein by a pathway that is distinct from but analogous to ubiquitin conjugation. Like ubiquitin, SUMO-1 is proteolytically processed to expose its mature C terminus by recently described SUMO-1-specific proteases variously called Ulp1 and Ulp2 in yeast (11Li S.J. Hochstrasser M.

Ulp1, Ulp2, and SENP1, but not SUSP-1, are capable of both deconjugating SUMO-1 from modified proteins and removing four amino acids from the C terminus of the 101-amino acid SUMO-1 precursor to generate the mature 97-amino acid form. SUMO-1 addition is accomplished by a thioester cascade, with SUMO-1 first being activated by a heterodimeric SUMO-1-activating enzyme (SAE) that adenylates the C-terminal glycine of SUMO-1 (16Johnson E.S.

In a transesterification reaction SUMO-1 is transferred from the SAE to the SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C terminus of SUMO-1 and the ε-amino group of a lysine residue of the target protein (6Saitoh H.

Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Unlike ubiquitin conjugation, SUMO-1 modification of target proteins in vitrois not dependent on the equivalent of an E3 protein ligase (17Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar,19Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that a short sequence containing the consensus ΨKXE, where Ψ represents a large hydrophobic amino acid, constitutes a transferable signal that confers the ability to be modified with SUMO-1 on proteins to which it is linked. The predominantly nuclear localization of both subunits of the SAE, Ubc9 and SUMO-1, suggest that SUMOylation is a nuclear process. We demonstrate that heterologous proteins carrying the SUMO-1 consensus modification sequences present in IκBα and p53 are only conjugated to SUMO-1 in vivo when a nuclear localization signal (NLS) is also present. These data suggest that protein substrates must be targeted to the nucleus to undergo SUMO-1 conjugation and allow us to propose that this modification may be involved in regulating multiple processes in the nucleus. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (25Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence analysis 2 μg of plasmid were transfected in 1 × 106 HeLa cells. For nickel bead purification, 10 μg of each plasmid DNA encoding pyruvate kinase (PK) fusions and His6-SUMO-1 were transfected in 1 × 107 HeLa cells. To increase efficiency of protein expression, no DNA carrier was used in cotransfections. After transfection, cells were seeded in 75 cm2 flasks. One-twentieth of transfected cells were seeded in a separated plate (to control protein input), and incubation was continued for 24 h. Plasmids encoding His6-SUMO-1, HA-SUMO-1, SV5-SAE1, HA-SAE2, and SV5-Ubc9 were reported previously (8Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol.

Wright J. Thompson J. Thomas D. Baleux F. Virelizier J.L. Hay R.T. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2425-2435PubMed Google Scholar) to generate PK-IκBα-(1–26) and PK-IκBα-(1–26)-KR. cDNAs encoding 361–393 and 361–393 KR of p53 were subcloned from previously described constructs (9Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction fragments and synthetic oligonuclotides encoding the 381–391 fragment of p53, the 16–26 fragment of IκBα, the 519–529 fragment of human RanGAP1, the 99–109 fragment of adenovirus type 2 E1B, and the 485–495 fragment of PML, as well as Lys to Arg versions, were cloned inBamHI and XbaI restriction sites of the PK vector. The same cDNAs were subcloned into BamHI andXbaI restriction sites of the NLS-PK vector that contains a polylinker,KpnI-BamHI-EcoRV-XbaI, to generate NLS-PK versions. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (28Rodriguez M.S. Thompson J. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol.

Randall, University of St. Andrews), and anti-Myc (9E10) were applied for 30 min followed by a 30-min incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany). Images were acquired on a DMRB fluorescence microscope (Leica) with a CCD camera (Princeton). In vitrotranscription/translation (Promega) and SUMO-1 conjugation assays were performed as reported (8Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer for Western blot analysis (8Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). His6-SUMO-1 conjugates were purified as described (9Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 8.5% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Sigma) by electroblotting, and processed for Western blotting as reported previously (9Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Primary monoclonal antibody anti-Myc (9E10) was obtained from Dr. R. E. Randall. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. An enhanced chemiluminescence detection system was used to detect specific antigen-antibody interactions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). It has been previously reported that Ubc9 promotes the nuclear localization of a Ubc9-β-galactosidase fusion protein inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (24Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ubc9 has been localized predominantly in the nucleus of T cells (29Firestein R. Feuerstein N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5892-5902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To analyze the subcellular distribution of all the components of the SUMO-1 conjugation pathway, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with HA-tagged versions of SUMO-1 and SAE-2 and SV5-tagged versions of Ubc9 and SAE-1 (Fig. 1). As expected, SUMO-1 displayed nuclear distribution and accumulated in nuclear dot-like structures (30Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 a). Using paraformaldehyde fixation, Ubc9 was localized mainly in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (Fig. 1 b). However, when cells were fixed with 1:1 methanol/acetone, Ubc9 immunoreactive material was concentrated at the nuclear envelope (data not shown and Ref. 23Lee G.W. Melchior F. Matunis M.J. Mahajan R. Tian Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6503-6507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The SAE-1 and SAE-2 (Fig. 1, c and d, respectively) subunits of the SAE presented an exclusively nuclear distribution that was not changed when both subunits were coexpressed or when cells were fixed by different methods (data not shown). Thus, the predominant nuclear localization of enzymes implicated in the SUMO-1 modification pathway suggests that this ubiquitin-like modification may take place in the nucleus. To test the proposition that SUMO-1 modification takes place in the nucleus, we designed an experiment strategy in which a minimal SUMO-1 modification site, fused to a heterologous protein, is located in either the nucleus or the cytoplasm by virtue of the presence or absence of an NLS. Constructs were designed such that these could be tested for SUMO-1 conjugation in vitro, where there is no influence of compartmentalization, or expressed in vivo either in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Analysis of the sequence of SUMO-1 conjugation sites in multiple proteins indicates that a short motif ΨKXE represents the primary site of SUMO-1 modification (8Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 9Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T.

Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To further define the sequence required for conjugation with SUMO-1, we designed a series of constructs containing IκBα N-terminal and p53 C-terminal modification sites fused to the C terminus of either a Myc-tagged version of PK or an equivalent construct containing the SV40 NLS (NLS-PK) (Fig.2). [35S]Met-labeled PK and NLS-PK fusions generated by in vitro transcription and translation were assayed for SUMO-1 conjugation in vitrousing the previously described assay (8Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). PK and NLS-PK fused to amino acids 1–26 and 16–26 of IκBα or amino acids 361–393 and 381–391 of p53 were conjugated with SUMO-1, whereas PK or NLS-PK alone were not (Fig. 2, A and B). When lysine residues 21 of IκBα and 386 of p53 were changed to arginine (KR constructs), SUMO-1-modified forms of PK-IκBα-KR and PK-p53-KR fusions were not detected, indicating that SUMO-1 was conjugated specifically to the previously described lysine residues (8Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 9Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 11-amino acid sequence required for conjugation with SUMO-1 could be further reduced, a series of synthetic oligonucleotides that specifies the human RanGAP1 519–529 (11 amino acids), 520–528 (9 amino acids), 521–527 (7 amino acids), and 522–526 (5 amino acids) amino acid sequences was fused to the C terminus of PK to generate the corresponding PK-RanGAP1 constructs (Figs. 2 C and 4A). Efficient SUMO-1 conjugation was observed with PK fusion encoding 11, 9, and 7 amino acids, whereas the efficiency of conjugation was reduced but still detectable with only 5 amino acids (Fig. 2 C). Thus, SUMO-1 modification requires a core recognition motif of five amino acids, although flanking residues influence the efficiency of conjugation. In most cells, SUMO-1 is found in conjugates with target proteins, and as such the pool of free SUMO-1 is limiting (8Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). At present, most cellular substrates reported to be conjugated with SUMO-1 show a nuclear distribution (PML, Sp100, and p53), shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (IκBα) (34Arenzana-Seisdedos F.

Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation analysis indicates that 80–90% of endogenous SUMO-1-conjugated proteins have a nuclear distribution (7, 36, and data not shown). To determine whether SUMO-1 conjugation requires nuclear targeting, the PK-IκBα and PK-p53 constructs were compared with NLS-PK-IκBα and NLS-PK-p53 constructs for SUMO-1 conjugationin vivo. The ability of the NLS-PK constructs to be conjugated with SUMO-1 in vitro is identical to the PK fusion counterpart (Fig. 2, A and B). As expected, all PK constructs were localized in the cytoplasm, and all NLS-PK constructs were localized in the nucleus of transfected cells (Fig. 3 A). To detect forms of PK and NLS-PK modified by SUMO-1 in vivo, constructs specifying these proteins were cotransfected into HeLa cells with an expression plasmid for His6-SUMO-1 (9Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). His6-SUMO-1-conjugated proteins were isolated on nickel beads, and eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody recognizing the Myc tag. NLS-PK-IκBα-(1–26) and -(16–26) as well as NLS-PK-p53-(361–393) and -(381–391) are efficiently conjugated with SUMO-1 (Fig. 3,B and C, top). Under the same conditions, KR mutants were not modified. In contrast to NLS-PK constructs, PK counterparts were not modified. These results clearly indicate that nuclear localization is required for conjugation of proteins with SUMO-1. Although a short motif can direct SUMO-1 modification when transferred to a heterologous protein, the efficiency of SUMO-1 modification will be a combination of the intrinsic substrate activity of the motif and the environment of the motif in the native protein. To investigate the intrinsic substrate activity of a range of SUMO-1 modification motifs, we generated additional PK constructs (Fig.4 A) encoding amino acids 485–495 of PML (31Duprez E. Saurin A.J.

Errico and R. T. Hay, unpublished data. which contain the lysine residue that is the site of SUMO-1 conjugation (Fig. 4 A). 35S-labeled PK-RanGAP1-(519–529), PK-p53-(381–391), PK-IκBα-(16–26), PK-AdE1B-(99–109), and PK-PML-(485–495) were used as substrates for SUMO-1 conjugation in vitro (Fig. 4 B). A range of substrate activities is evident (Fig. 4 B), with PK-AdE1B and PK-PML being modified efficiently, PK-IκBα and PK-p53 being modified less efficiently, and PK-RanGAP1 being modified poorly. Those differences were also observed in vivo when comparing NLS-PK fusions encoding PML, IκBα, and p53 sequences (Fig. 4 C) in conditions where PK counterparts were poorly modified or not modified at all (data not shown). The differences observed in the conjugation of SUMO-1 to this range of substrates indicates that the precise sequence of the SUMO-1 modification motif, when isolated from its native environment, defines the efficiency of SUMO-1 conjugation. To evaluate the role of each amino acid within the ΨKXE motif in SUMO-1 conjugation, a series of PK constructs encoding alanine mutations in the FKTE sequence of p53 were generated (9Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Mutations of theX residue T did not affect conjugation with SUMO-1 (Fig.5 A). When residue Ψ was changed to alanine, conjugation with SUMO-1 was reduced (Fig.5 A). As expected, mutation of the strictly conserved Lys and Glu residues abrogates conjugation with SUMO-1 (Fig. 5 A). These results confirm that Lys and Glu are the most important residues of the consensus and suggest that the Ψ and X residues may influence the efficiency of SUMO-1 conjugation. To investigate this point, a series of PK-RanGAP1 molecules was generated in which the Ψ residue (Leu) of the poorly modified PK-RanGAP1 was changed to each of the possible hydrophobic residues, and the efficiency of conjugation was determined in vitro. Whereas changing the Leu to either Ile or Val increased the efficiency of SUMO-1 conjugation, changes to Ala, Pro, or Trp substantially reduced the efficiency of conjugation. Substitutions of Leu with Phe or Met did not alter the efficiency of conjugation (Fig. 5 B). To evaluate the role of theX amino acid, the Met residue at this position in PK-PML was changed to either Ala, Lys, Ile, Ser, or Asp. Whereas substitution of Met with Asp caused a small decrease in substrate activity, all of the other modifications at this position were without consequence. Although most described modification sites in naturally occurring proteins contain the sequence ΨKXE, it was of interest to determine whether a Glu residue was absolutely required for activity. The conservative Glu to Asp change was therefore made within the context of the PK-PML construct, and the substrate activity was determined. The altered substrate is modified very poorly when compared with a substrate containing the wild type motif (Fig. 5 B). Thus, SUMO-1 modification is directed by a ΨKXE motif, where the nature of the hydrophobic amino acid preceding the acceptor lysine residue has a major influence on the efficiency with which SUMO-1 is conjugated to the target protein. Post-translational protein modifications modulate protein function by altering protein activity or the ability to interact with ligands or by changing subcellular localization of the modified protein. Conjugation with SUMO-1 has been proposed to regulate protein function through all these mechanisms. Identification of a short amino acid sequence motif required for the transfer of the capacity to be conjugated with SUMO-1 to a heterologous protein indicates that this motif is necessary for recognition by the SUMO-1 modification enzymes. Most of the targets for SUMO-1 modification are Ubc9-interacting proteins, and it is likely that substrate specificity is achieved by Ubc9. The C-terminal region of Ubc9, which is thought to be involved in substrate binding, lies close to the catalytic site and favors the direct transfer of SUMO-1 to substrate proteins (38Liu Q. Jin C. Liao X. Shen Z. Chen D.J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16979-16987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The most important amino acids in the consensus sequences are Lys and Glu. Whereas the acceptor Lys residue cannot be substituted, Glu can be replaced by Asp to generate a recognition motif that, although functional, is poorly conjugated with SUMO-1 (Fig. 4). To date, the only reported modification site containing Asp rather than Glu in a natural protein is in the yeast septin Cdc3, although it was not clear how efficiently this site was utilized for modification (32Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In addition to the Lys and Glu residues, the large hydrophobic residue contributes substantially to the efficiency of SUMO-1 modification. Short transferable sequences from various protein substrates modified with SUMO-1 show different capacities to be conjugated with SUMO-1. The best conjugated short sequence contains the sequence IKME from PML, whereas the sequence that is least efficiently modified contains the sequence LKSE from RanGAP1. Surprisingly, RanGAP1 is one of the best cellular substrates for conjugation with SUMO-1 (4Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 5Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), suggesting that other cis or trans factors may influence its efficiency of conjugation. When fused to the C terminus of a heterologous protein, the 7-amino acid sequence containing the ΨKXE motif acts as an efficient substrate for SUMO-1 modification in vitro. However, when an amino acid is removed from each end of this sequence to generate a five-amino acid sequence containing the ΨKXE motif, its substrate activity is reduced. Although the shortest transferable sequence we have tested contains five amino acids, extensive additional mutagenesis failed to identify any elements outside the ΨKXE motif that contributed to substrate activity. It is likely that the seven-amino acid sequence is a more efficient substrate than the five-amino acid sequence, because the sequences were added to the C-terminal end of a carrier protein such that the Glu in the ΨKXE motif is now the C terminus of the protein. Thus the ΨKXE motif needs to be flanked by at least one additional C-terminal amino acid for optimal recognition by the SUMO-1 modification machinery. One important factor is how the recognition motif is presented to the surface of the protein. If it is located in an exposed loop, then it may be highly accessible to the modification machinery. Mutational analysis of RanGAP1 indicates that sequences flanking the domain containing the acceptor lysine (Lys-526) are required for efficient SUMO-1 modification in vitro, although the function of these additional domains has yet to be defined (35Matunis M.J. Wu J.A. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Alternatively, additional binding sites for Ubc9 in the target protein may result in tighter binding of Ubc9 to the protein substrate, with a consequent increase in the efficiency of conjugation. This may be the case with PML, in which the RING finger is required for interaction with Ubc9 in a yeast two-hybrid analysis. PML proteins containing mutations that disrupt the RING finger are poorly modifiedin vivo but efficiently modified in vitro (31Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas SUMO-1 conjugation of RanGAP1 and IκBα can be catalyzedin vitro simply with SAE and Ubc9 (17Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 19Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), it is possible that additional protein factors may influence the efficiency of conjugation. The importance of how the modification motif is presented is exemplified by the case of the splicing protein p32, which contains a perfect match to the consensus recognition site for SUMO-1 modification and yet is not modified by SUMO-1 in vitro. 3R. T. Hay, unpublished observation. Moreover, inspection of the structure of p32 (39Jiang J. Zhang Y. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) reveals that the recognition motif is not surface-exposed and would not be accessible to the modification machinery. The observed predominant nuclear distribution of SUMO-1, SAE, and Ubc9, as well as the exclusive SUMO-1 modification of NLS-PK substrates, indicates that SUMO-1 modification requires nuclear targeting. However, because Ubc9 is concentrated at the nuclear envelope, we cannot determine whether SUMO-1 modification with SUMO-1 takes place after transport of substrates into the nucleus or whether modification occurs during docking at the nuclear envelope and/or translocation into the nucleus. It has previously been noted that mutations or deletions of the nuclear localization signals of PML, RanGAP1, and Sp100 that resulted in cytoplasmic accumulation of these proteins also resulted in loss of SUMO-1 modification in vivo (31Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sternsdorf T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In addition, a 97-kDa isoform of PML, which, for unknown reasons, is located in the cytoplasm, also fails to undergo SUMO-1 modificationin vivo. The same protein, however, is efficiently modified by SUMO-1 in vitro (31Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, newly synthesized unmodified substrates would be targeted to the nucleus, where they would be modified by the combination of SAE1, SAE2, and Ubc9. Once modified, these proteins may be incorporated into subnuclear structures such as PODs. In particular, SUMO-1 modification of the POD component PML is required for both formation of the PODs (40Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for recruitment of other proteins such as Daxx into the PODs (41Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss III, J.F. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Alternatively, newly SUMO-1-modified proteins could, as in the case of RanGAP1, be targeted to the nuclear pore complex (4Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 5Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) or shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm like IκBα and p53, although there is as yet no data indicating whether this is the case for the SUMO-1-modified form of these proteins (8Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 9Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Although nuclear targeting appears to be required for SUMO-1 modification of most substrates, we cannot rule out the possibility that some proteins may be modified in other cellular compartments. This may be the case for the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4, which are targeted to the cell membrane and yet appear to be SUMO-1-modified (42Giorgino F. de Robertis O. Laviola L. Montrone C. Perrini S. McCowen K.C. Smith R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). One possibility is that newly synthesized SAE and Ubc9 are recruited to a cytoplasmic complex containing GLUT1 and GLUT4, where modification takes place. This is consistent with the observation that GLUT1 and GLUT4 both interact directly with Ubc9. If the NLSs of SAE and Ubc9 are occluded in this complex, then this would allow a small proportion of the predominantly nuclear SAE and Ubc9 to remain in the cytoplasm tightly associated with their substrate. The two recently described SMT3-specific proteases Ulp1 and Ulp2 (11Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar,12Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) accumulate a different pattern of SMT3-conjugated proteins in their mutants, indicating that deconjugation of substrates can be achieved and regulated by multiple SMT3 proteases with different specificities. Because SUMO-1 is a limiting factor for conjugation of substrates, deconjugation of SUMO-1 may be a dual mechanism to decrease (or increase) protein activity of a deconjugated protein and increase (or decrease) the activity of a newly conjugated target, when released SUMO-1 is available. However the cellular sites at which this process takes place are not known, because the cellular localization of endogenous SUMO-1-specific proteases has yet to be determined. Thus SUMO-1 modification of most proteins appears to be regulated by the requirement of the substrate to be targeted to the nucleus and by the possession of a SUMO-1 recognition motif displayed on the surface of the target protein. It is likely that SUMO-1 modification emerges as an important control mechanism that regulates the activity of many nuclear proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2029925140,"In all eukaryotic organisms, inappropriate firing of replication origins during the G2 phase of the cell cycle is suppressed by cyclin-dependent kinases. Multicellular eukaryotes contain a second putative inhibitor of re-replication called geminin. Geminin is believed to block binding of the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) complex to origins of replication, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. Here we show that geminin interacts tightly with Cdt1, a recently identified replication initiation factor necessary for MCM loading. The inhibition of DNA replication by geminin that is observed in cell-free DNA replication extracts is reversed by the addition of excess Cdt1. In the normal cell cycle, Cdt1 is present only in G1 and S, whereas geminin is present in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Together, these results suggest that geminin inhibits inappropriate origin firing by targeting Cdt1."

Studies of acriflavine loading in normal and NPC1 fibroblasts indicated that NPC1 uses a proton motive force to remove accumulated acriflavine from the endosomal/lysosomal system. Expression of NPC1 in Escherichia coli (i) facilitated the transport of acriflavine across the plasma membrane, causing cytosolic accumulation, and (ii) resulted in transport of oleic acid but not cholesterol or cholesterol-oleate across the plasma membrane.

Our results indicate that temperatures in the region have declined by about 10 degrees C since 3.2 million years ago. Records of paleoproductivity suggest that this cooling was associated with an increase in wind-driven upwelling tied to a shift from relatively stable global warmth during the mid-Pliocene to the high-amplitude glacial-interglacial cycles of the late Quaternary. These observations imply that Atlantic Ocean surface water circulation was radically different during the mid-Pliocene.

There are three members of the SREBP family: 1a, 1c, and 2 (15Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). SREBP-1 appears to be more involved with the regulation of lipogenic genes, while SREBP-2 may have the greatest influence on the expression of cholesterolgenic genes (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The SREBPs were identified because of their ability to bind to the sterol regulatory element and confer sterol regulation to several genes involved with cholesterol synthesis (15Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). SREBPs are synthesized as 125-kDa precursor proteins that contain two transmembrane domains for insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (15Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain, a 68-kDa helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor (i.e. mature SREBP), is released for nuclear translocation by a sterol-dependent proteolytic cascade (15Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The proteolytic release of mature SREBP is also regulated by PUFA (11Xu J.

SREBP-1a and -1c are derived from the same gene, but the N terminus of the SREBP-1a protein is 24 amino acid residues longer because SREBP-1a and -1c employ different promoter sites (17Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The nuclear abundance of SREBP-1, and hence the rate of lipogenic gene transcription, is determined by the rate of proteolytic release of the mature SREBP-1 and the relative abundance of SREBP-1 precursor (11Xu J.

Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Fasting, diabetes, or the ingestion of PUFA reduce the amount of hepaticSREBP-1 mRNA. On the other hand, carbohydrate-refeeding or insulin administration increase the abundance of SREBP-1mRNA (18Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 19Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin.

Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The changes in hepatic SREBP-1 mRNA abundance, and ultimately SREBP-1 precursor protein, associated with fasting, carbohydrate ingestion, diabetes, or insulin administration reflect alterations in SREBP-1 gene transcription (20Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le, L.iepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, nuclear run-on assays indicated that the reduction in hepatic content of SREBP-1 mRNA resulting from PUFA ingestion may involve post-transcription mechanisms (11Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This has led us to hypothesize that PUFA suppress the hepatic expression ofSREBP-1 by accelerating the rate of SREBP-1mRNA decay. With this report, we in fact demonstrate that PUFA accelerate the decay of SREBP-1 mRNA, and thatSREBP-1c mRNA is more sensitive to PUFA regulation than is SREBP-1a. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (150–170 g) were fasted for 24 h prior to hepatocyte isolation. Hepatocytes were isolated and maintained in primary monolayer culture as previously described by Salati and Clarke (21Salati L.M. Clarke S.D. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated hepatocytes (9 × 106 cells) were plated onto 10-cm tissue culture plates that were previously coated with rat tail collagen (Becton Dickinson Labware). Cells were allowed to attach for 4 h in Waymouth MB 752/1 medium (Life Technology) supplemented with 0.4 mm alanine, 0.5 mm serine, 26 mm sodium bicarbonate, 100 nm insulin (Life Technologies Inc.), 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. After the attachment period, medium was changed to a serum-free media and treated with 150 μm albumin-bound 20:4(n-6), 20:5(n-3), and 18:1(n-9) at a fatty acid/albumin ratio of 4:1. Cells not treated with fatty acid received an amount of albumin equal to that provide with the fatty acid-albumin complex. The source of albumin for all studies was essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The impact of dietary PUFA on the transcription of hepatic fatty acid synthase and SREBP-1 was determined using the nuclear run-on assay (11Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). A rat specific SREBP-1c/ADD1 cDNA (B. Spiegelman) was employed to quantify the amount of nascentSREBP-1 mRNA synthesized by the nuclei. The abundance ofSREBP-1 and fatty acid synthase mRNA in cultured primary rat hepatocytes was determined using total RNA extracted by the phenol-guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, total RNA (30 μg per lane) was size-fractionated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde denaturing gel, and subsequently transferred to a Zeta-probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) (11Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The mRNA abundance of the respective transcripts was estimated by sequentially hybridizing the membrane with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for SREBP-1, fatty acid synthase, andglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. All probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using random prime labeling (Life Technologies). Hybridization and wash conditions have been described previously (23Clarke S.D. Armstrong M.K. Jump D.B. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Autoradiographic signals were quantified using Instant Imager (Packard). The effect of fatty acid on the abundance and decay of SREBP-1c and -1a was determined using the ribonuclease protection assay (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kinggston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). A rat SREBP-1a cDNA fragment with sequence corresponding to exon 1 (specific to SREBP-1a) and part of exon 2 (common to both SREBP-1a and -1c) was produced using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification and total rat liver RNA as the template. The primers were those described in Ref. 17Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar. The amplified cDNA fragment was then subcloned into the pBluescript vector (Invitrogen) and the plasmid was linearized with HindIII. The cDNA fragment used to produce 18S ribosome RNA was purchased from Ambion. Both antisense probes were transcribed using bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase (RPAIII Kit, Ambion). The probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and possessed specific activities of 5–8 × 108 dpm/μg forSREBP-1 and 4–10 × 103 dpm/μg for18S. Hybridization was conducted by incubating 10 μg of total RNA with at least 4 m excess of probe at 56 °C overnight. After RNase A/T1 digestion, the protected fragments were separated on a 8 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and the autoradiographic signals were visualized by exposure to x-ray film, and the abundance of each transcript was quantified using Instant Imager (Packard). The relative level ofSREBP-1a and -1c mRNA was compared upon correcting for the number of 32P-labeled UTP atoms in each protected fragment. Nuclear and microsomal protein extracts were prepared from hepatocyte monolayers as described in Refs. 25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

To prevent proteolysis, all buffers contained 25 μg/ml N-acetylleucylleucylnorleucinal, 24 μg/ml Pefabloc, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Briefly, hepatocytes from five 10-cm plates were pooled, and the cell pellets were disrupted by Dounce homogenization in 3 volumes of a buffer solution containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,300 × g for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended and incubated for 1 h in an equal volume of a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.6, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2,1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. The nuclei were collected by centrifuging the suspension for 30 min at 15,000 × g. Microsomes were isolated by centrifuging the supernatant from the initial 3,300 × g spin for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. The microsomal proteins were collected by solubilizing the pellet in 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 0.1 mNaCl, 1% (v/v) SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors. The abundance of mature SREBP-1 (nuclear) and precursor SREBP-1 (microsomal) was determined by Western blotting following the procedure described by Xu et al. (11Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive SREBP-1 was identified by incubating the blot for 4 h with monoclonal anti-SREBP-1 (IgG-2A4) prepared from hybridoma cells (ATCC, CRL 2121), and the protein visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bands were quantified for relative intensity using the Ambis imagizing system. PUFA regulation of SREBP-1a, -1c, and fatty acid synthase mRNA half-lives in primary hepatocyte was evaluated by an α-amanitin transcription inhibition assay (27Chen Y. Weeks J. Mortin M.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 4214-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were isolated from fasted rats and maintained in a serum-free media containing 28 mm glucose, 0.1 μm insulin, and 0.1 μm dexamethasone. Following a 44-h incubation to induce SREBP-1 expression in the hepatocytes, the medium was changed to one containing either albumin-bound 150 μm20:4(n-6) or albumin alone. After a 3-h pretreatment, transcription was arrested by adding α-amanitin (15 μmfinal concentration). The abundance of SREBP-1, fatty acid synthase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasewas determined by Northern blot or ribonuclease protection procedures. To examine the possibility that mRNA translation was needed forSREBP-1 mRNA to undergo decay, the half-lives ofSREBP-1a and -1c mRNA were determined in the presence of the translational inhibitor, cycloheximide. As described previously, SREBP-1 expression in isolated hepatocytes was induced by culturing hepatocytes in a media containing glucose and insulin. After 48 h in culture, the cells were treated with cycloheximide (5 μm final concentration) for 2 h, and subsequently treated with 150 μm albumin-bound 20:4(n-6) or albumin alone for an additional 6 h. The abundance of SREBP-1a and -1c mRNA was quantified using the ribonuclease protection assay. Total RNA was extracted from rats fed a high carbohydrate diet. The 3′-end of rat SREBP-1 mRNA was cloned using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methodology. First strand synthesis was accomplished using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and a poly(T) degenerate primer, 5′-TTCTAGTCGACTGAATTCTCTCGAGGCGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT(G/A/C)(G/A/C/T)-3′ that was linked to an adaptor sequence of 5′-TTCTAGTCGACTGAATTCTCTCGAGGCG-3′. After a 20-min 42 °C reaction, polymerase chain reaction amplification was conducted using the gene-specific primer at position 5′-GAGGAGGGTCTTCCTACATGAGGC-3′ and the adaptor primer sequence 5′-TTCTAGTCGACTGAATTCTCTCGAGGCG-3′. The reaction conditions were comprised of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1.5 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 1.5 min, and finally 33 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 1.5 min. The resulting amplification product was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. Earlier work from our group suggested that the hepatic reduction in SREBP-1 mRNA abundance elicited by dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids was not accompanied by a reduced rate of gene transcription (11Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, this earlier work employed a hamster cDNA for SREBP-1 to quantify the synthesis of nascentSREBP-1 transcripts that occurred in rat liver nuclei (11Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). It is possible that the hamster SREBP-1 cDNA may have hybridized to a nonspecific nascent transcript produced in the nuclear run-on assay. Such nonspecific hybridization could have masked potential changes in SREBP-1 gene transcription. Therefore, the effect of dietary (n-6) and (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids on rat liver SREBP-1 gene transcription was re-evaluated using a cDNA specific for ratSREBP-1, i.e. adipose differentiationand determination factor-1 (ADD-1). Nuclear run-on assays (n = 4 per diet group) continued to indicate that SREBP-1 gene transcription was not inhibited by dietary fats rich in 18-carbon (n-6) or 20- and 22-carbon (n-3) fatty acids (data not shown). The nuclear run-on results cited above led to the hypothesis that polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce SREBP-1mRNA and protein abundance by accelerating the decay of theSREBP-1 transcript. Pursuit of this question required an hepatic cellular model that mimicked intact animal responses. Isolated rat hepatocytes maintained in primary culture fulfill this requirement. As observed in the intact animal (11Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 12Mater M.K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35816-35840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the amount of mature SREBP-1 found in the nuclei of hepatocytes was positively correlated with the hepatocyte content of fatty acid synthase mRNA (Fig.1). Specifically, culturing hepatocytes isolated from 24-h fasted rats in medium containing insulin and 28 mm glucose resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in the amount of membrane (precursor) and nuclear (mature) SREBP-1 (Fig.1 A). The increase in hepatocyte SREBP-1 protein was paralleled by a comparable rise in the abundance of SREBP-1mRNA (Fig. 1 B). Most importantly, treating the hepatocytes with 150 μm albumin-bound 20:4(n-6) completely blocked the insulin-glucose dependent induction of SREBP-1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1). An examination of the rapidity with which 20:4(n-6) exerted its influence on SREBP-1 expression revealed that a 5- and 10-h exposure to 20:4(n-6) reduced the hepatocyte content ofSREBP-1 mRNA 50 and 85%, respectively (Fig.2). Interestingly, there was at least a 2-h lag before 20:4(n-6) exerted its suppressive influence on SREBP-1 mRNA (Fig. 2). Finally, it is important to note that 20:4(n-6) had no effect on either the insulin-glucose induction or the steady state level ofglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (Fig.1 B and Fig. 2). This indicates that the suppression ofSREBP-1 and associated lipogenic genes by 20:4(n-6) is specific and comparable to the in vivo responses achieved with dietary (n-6) or (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (11Xu J.

Hepatocytes were isolated from 24-h fasted rats and maintained in a media containing insulin and 28 mm glucose. After 44 h in culture (0 time), 37.5 μm BSA or 150 μm albumin-bound 20:4(n-6) was added to the media. Total RNA was extracted from the hepatocytes at the times indicated, and the abundance ofSREBP-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was determined by Northern analysis (A). B depicts the change inSREBP-1 mRNA that occurs when hepatocytes were incubated in the presence (open circles) and absence (closed circles) of 20:4(n-6).

Asterisk indicates values that are significantly lower than the BSA-treated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The influence of 20:4(n-6) on the half-life ofSREBP-1 mRNA was examined by pretreating rat liver cell monolayers for 3 h with albumin-bound 20:4(n-6) or albumin alone, and subsequently adding α-amanitin to inhibit gene transcription (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). The abundance of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-genase was not affected by either 20:4(n-6) or α-amanitin (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). On the other hand, Northern analyses revealed that 20:4(n-6) treatment of rat cell monolayers accelerated the rate ofSREBP-1 mRNA decay (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Regression analysis employing all measurements from 0 to 10 h indicated that 20:4(n-6) significantly (p < 0.05) shortened the half-life for total SREBP-1 mRNA from 11.6 h (r = 0.94, p < 0.01) in the absence of fatty acid to 6.4 h (r = 0.92,p < 0.01) in the presence of 20:4(n-6). Examination of the decay curve suggested that the decay ofSREBP-1 mRNA occurred in two phases, i.e. a rapidly decaying pool (0–4 h), and a more slowly decaying pool (4–10 h). However, 20:4(n-6) accelerated the decay of both of these putative pools (Fig. 3). Because the cDNA probe utilized in the Northern analyses encoded a sequence that was common to bothSREBP-1a and -1c, we hypothesized that the apparent existence of two decay rates for SREBP-1, as determined by Northern analyses, may represent differences in decay between the SREBP-1a and -1c transcripts. To examine this possibility, a ribonuclease protection assay was employed to separately quantify the effect of 20:4(n-6) on the decay of SREBP-1a and -1c (Fig.4). The SREBP-1c/1aratio found in isolated hepatocytes maintained in a media containing insulin and glucose was 3/1, which was not dissimilar from the 5/1 ratio observed in vivo (29Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). When hepatocytes were maintained in a fatty acid-free media, the half-life ofSREBP-1c was similar to that of SREBP-1a,i.e. 10.0 h (r = 0.77,p < 0.07) and 11.6 h (r = 0.71,p < 0.10), respectively (Fig. 4). However, when the hepatocyte monolayers were treated with 20:4(n-6), the half-life of SREBP-1c was significantly (p< 0.05) reduced to 4.6 h (r = 0.93,p < 0.01). The half-life of SREBP-1amRNA also appeared to be reduced by 20:4(n-6) but the decrease from 11.6 to 7.7 h (r = 0.94) was not statistically significant. Like 20:4(n-6), 20:5(n-3) accelerated the decay of SREBP-1c (Fig.5). The decay of SREBP-1aappeared to be unaffected by 20:5(n-3), but this lack of significant decay likely reflects the fact that cells were harvested after 4 h of fatty acid treatment which was well below the 7.7 h half-life of the SREBP-1a transcript. Unlike the effect of PUFA, the monounsaturated fatty acid, 18:1(n-9) had no effect on the hepatocyte content of SREBP-1c and -1a mRNA.

Heritable deficiency of this enzyme results in various forms of GalNAc-β(1,4)-[N-acetylneuraminic acid (2,3)]-Gal-β(1,4)-Glc-ceramide gangliosidosis, including Tay-Sachs disease. We have determined the x-ray crystal structure of a β-hexosaminidase from Streptomyces plicatus to 2.2 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank code 1HP4). β-Hexosaminidases are believed to use a substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism that generates a cyclic oxazolinium ion intermediate. We have solved and refined a complex between the cyclic intermediate analogueN-acetylglucosamine-thiazoline and β-hexosaminidase fromS. plicatus to 2.1 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank code1HP5). Difference Fourier analysis revealed the pyranose ring ofN-acetylglucosamine-thiazoline bound in the enzyme active site with a conformation close to that of a 4C1chair. A tryptophan-lined hydrophobic pocket envelops the thiazoline ring, protecting it from solvolysis at the iminium ion carbon. Within this pocket, Tyr393 and Asp313 appear important for positioning the 2-acetamido group of the substrate for nucleophilic attack at the anomeric center and for dispersing the positive charge distributed into the oxazolinium ring upon cyclization. This complex provides decisive structural evidence for substrate-assisted catalysis and the formation of a covalent, cyclic intermediate in family 20 β-hexosaminidases. β-Hexosaminidase, a family 20 glycosyl hydrolase, catalyzes the removal of β-1,4-linkedN-acetylhexosamine residues from oligosaccharides and their conjugates.

Therefore, a large number of enzymes dedicated to carbohydrate metabolism have evolved. Enzymes specifically responsible for carbohydrate catabolism are collectively referred to as glycosyl hydrolases and have been classified into 77 families based on amino acid sequence similarity (1Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 2Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar, 3Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures are known for representatives of 30 of the families. Although there are differences in chain length and domain structure between proteins of a single family, all proteins of a family hydrolyze the glycosidic bond with the same stereochemical outcome (4Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Family 20 includes the β-N-acetylhexosaminidases (β-hexosaminidases)1 (EC3.2.1.52), enzymes that catalyze the removal of terminal β-1,4 linkedN-acetylhexosamine residues from the nonreducing ends of oligosaccharides and their conjugates. In humans, there are two major β-hexosaminidase isoforms: HexA and HexB. HexA is a heterodimer of subunits α (encoded by HEXA) and β (encoded byHEXB), whereas HexB is a homodimer of β subunits. HexA is essential for degrading GalNAc-β(1,4)-[N-acetylneuraminic acid (2,3)]-Gal-β(1,4)-Glc-ceramide ganglioside; the biological importance of HexA activity is illustrated by the fatal neurodegenerative disorders that result from its heritable deficiency (5Gravel R.A. Clark J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 7 th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1807-1839Google Scholar). Mutations in HEXA or HEXB cause Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease, respectively. These genetic diseases have made the human β-hexosaminidase isoforms the subject of much research. A substantial amount of genetic and biochemical information is available for these isozymes (5Gravel R.A. Clark J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 7 th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1807-1839Google Scholar), but detailed information about their catalytic mechanism is limited. Mechanistic studies have been primarily limited by the difficulties in producing sufficient amounts of recombinant enzyme needed for kinetic analysis (6Cao Z. Petroulakis E. Salo T. Triggs-Raine B.

Genet. 1993; 53: 497-508PubMed Google Scholar); however, recent improvements in expression and purification procedures have allowed more accurate kinetic measurements to be made (8Hou Y. Vocadlo D. Withers S. Mahuran D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6219-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Crystals of human HexB have been grown (9Church W.B. Swenson L. James M.N. Mahuran D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); however, attempts at solving its three-dimensional structure have not been successful. Nonetheless, much insight into the mechanism of human HexA and HexB has been provided by structural and functional studies carried out on related family 20 glycosyl hydrolases (10Tews I. Perrakis A.

Armand S. Davies G.J. Vorgias C.E. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and human β-hexosaminidase (14Lai E.C. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14743-14749Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this family operates via a retaining mechanism. The consensus view for the mechanism of β-retaining glycosyl hydrolases involves general acid catalyzed cleavage of the β-(1,4)-glycosidic linkage via a transition state with substantial oxacarbenium ion character to form a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate with an active site carboxylate. General base-catalyzed attack of water at the anomeric center of this intermediate yields a product with the same anomeric stereochemistry as the substrate. This mechanism is commonly referred to as the double displacement mechanism of hydrolysis (1Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 15Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1480) Google Scholar, 16McCarter J.D.

Unexpectedly, family 20 β-hexosaminidases and chitobiases, as well as the functionally related chitinases of family 18, were found to lack a carboxylate group suitably disposed to stabilize the oxacarbenium ion transition state (10Tews I.

Instead, x-ray structural analysis of S. marcescens chitobiase (SmCHB) and kinetic studies with inhibitors have provided strong evidence for catalysis involving participation of the neighboring C2-acetamido group on the substrate (Fig. 1 A and Refs.10Tews I.

The 2-acetamido group of the substrate acts in place of the enzyme nucleophile to generate an enzyme-stabilized oxazolinium ion intermediate. The cyclic intermediate is then hydrolyzed by general base catalyzed attack of water at the anomeric center in a manner analogous to the double displacement mechanism described above. We have determined the three-dimensional crystal structure of a family 20 β-hexosaminidase cloned from Streptomyces plicatus(21Robbins P.W. Overbye K. Albright C. Benfield B. Pero J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The 55-kDa enzyme, referred to as SpHEX, is a highly active and stable glycosyl hydrolase that functions over a broad pH range. Co-crystallization of SpHEX with the cyclic intermediate analogue N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)-thiazoline (Fig. 1 B and Ref. 19Knapp S. Vocadlo D. Gao Z. Kirk B. Lou J. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6804-6805Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and subsequent crystallographic analysis has provided decisive structural evidence for a substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism involving 2-acetamido group participation, resulting in the formation of a covalent, cyclic intermediate (Fig. 1). Escherichia coli strain JM109 was used for plasmid amplification, and plasmid purification was carried out using Qiagen purification systems. Restriction enzymes and Vent DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA ligase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All cloning procedures are described in Ref. 22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. SpHEX is a 506-amino acid protein having a predicted molecular mass of 55010 Da (GenBankTM accession number AF063001). It was expressed as a recombinant, N-terminal His7-tagged fusion protein. Briefly, the plasmid psHEX-1.8 (11Mark B.L. Wasney G.A. Salo T.J. Khan A.R. Cao Z. Robbins P.W. James M.N. Triggs-Raine B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19618-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) contained theSpHEX open reading frame. The first 100 base pairs of the 5′-end of the SpHEX open reading frame was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the sense primer (5′-GGAATTCCATATGCATCATCATCATCATCATCACACCGGCGCCGCCCCGGACCGGAAG-3′) and the antisense primer (5′-TGGCGCGCCGCCGGGGTCGACCGAGGCGGG-3′). This polymerase chain reaction product was restriction digested withAscI and NdeI for ligation into the final expression plasmid. To obtain the remaining 1.7-kilobase pair fragment of the SpHEX open reading frame, a further aliquot of psHEX-1.8 was restriction digested with AscI andBamHI. The 100-base pair (NdeI/AscI) and 1.7-kilobase pair (AscI/BamHI) fragments were then ligated into the T7 expression plasmid pET-3a (Novagen) that had been linearized by digestion with NdeI and BamHI. The ligation product resulted in the expression plasmid p3AHEX-1.8 whose sequence was verified prior to use in fusion protein expression. The His7-SpHEX fusion protein was expressed inE. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 = ∼0.5 and then induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by French press. After centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 1 h, the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow (Qiagen) column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. Once loaded, the column was washed with the lysis buffer supplemented with 80 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). The fusion protein was eluted from the column using lysis buffer supplemented with 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and precipitated with 55% ammonium sulfate for storage at 4 °C. Aliquots of the precipitated protein were routinely resuspended and dialyzed twice against 50 mm trisodium citrate, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and then concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml with a Millipore concentrator. Approximately 40–60 mg of pure fusion protein was routinely obtained per liter of culture. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis using a VG Quattro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (VG Biotech, Altringham, UK) determined the mass of the purified fusion protein to be 56,054 Da, in good agreement with the theoretical mass of 56,049 Da. Seleno-Met-substituted His7-SpHEX was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLys S using the method described in Ref. 23Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium until mid-log phase growth was reached. The culture was then supplemented with 0.5 mm Lys, 0.8 mm Thr, 0.6 mm Phe, 0.8 mm Leu, 0.8 mm Ile, and 0.8 mm Val to inhibit endogenous Met biosynthesis. After a 30-min incubation, the culture was further supplemented with 0.25 mm seleno-Met and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 10 h. Seleno-Met substituted His7-SpHEX was purified in the same manner as native His7-SpHEX except that the protein was dialyzed against 3 mm dithiothreitol before concentrating to avoid selenium oxidation. Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis verified that all 6 Met residues in the 512-amino acid SpHEX protein had been substituted with seleno-Met. All purified fusion protein was visualized for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both native and seleno-Met substituted His7-SpHEX crystallized in the hexagonal space group P6122 within 2 weeks by vapor diffusion at room temperature. The mother liquor consisted of 2.2m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm trisodium citrate, pH 6.0, and 20–25% glycerol. Hanging drops were set up by mixing an aliquot of SpHEX (concentrated to 10 mg/ml) with an equal amount of the mother liquor. Crystals of His7-SpHEX in complex with NAG-thiazoline were obtained by co-crystallization of the native fusion protein (from which dithiothreitol had been removed by dialysis) with 2–5 mmNAG-thiazoline. Diffraction data for a MAD phasing experiment were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, BioCARS sector beamline BM-14-C and BM-14-D on native and seleno-Met substituted His7-SpHEX crystals flash cooled to 100 K, respectively (see Table I). Diffraction data from crystals of the complex between His7-SpHEX and NAG-thiazoline were collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, beamline 9-2 (see Table I). All diffraction data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab A solution to the crystal structure of the protein was obtained by a MAD phasing experiment performed on seleno-Met-substituted protein crystals (25Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). A combination of data derived from the MAD phasing experiment at beamline BM-14-D with data collected from native SpHEX crystals at beamline BM-14-C allowed for the determination of the three-dimensional structure of S. plicatus β-hexosaminidase to 2.2 Å resolution. Although the SpHEX crystals diffracted to slightly higher resolution than 2.2 Å, data collection was restricted to this resolution to avoid excessive data rejection caused by spot overlap. The program SOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar) was used for local scaling of the data and to calculate the anomalous and dispersive differences needed to find selenium sites and to determine phase probability distributions. Patterson maps, calculated from the anomalous and dispersive differences, allowed us to find clearly five of the six selenium atoms present in the SpHEX structure. The missing selenium atom was part of the initiation Met whose position could not be determined because of disorder of the first 14 residues of the His7-tagged N terminus. Electron density maps, generated using structure factor phases obtained from the MAD phasing experiment (initial figure of merit 0.8), were improved only slightly by solvent flattening using Density Modification (Fig. 2 and Ref. 27Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1555-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Map boundaries were extended beyond the CCP4 asymmetric unit using EXTEND (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Residues 8–512 were readily fit into the density as one continuous chain. Coordinates for the small molecules glycerol and SO4− were obtained through the HIC-UP world wide web site, and their geometries were optimized by X-PLOR (31Brunger A.T. XPLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) prior to use in model building. The molecular model of native SpHEX was refined using a maximum likelihood target function during both simulated annealing and conjugate gradient minimization as implemented in Crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance System (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Prior to refinement, 10% of the diffraction data was randomly flagged for cross-validation using the free R factor. After each round of refinement, the model was manually inspected with O using 2Fo −Fc and Fo −Fc maps. The final refinement statistics for the model reflect the high quality data (see Table I). An Fo −Fc map, used to visualize NAG-thiazoline in the active site, was obtained using structure factor phases calculated from the native SpHEX model that had been positioned into the unit cell of the NAG-thiazoline complex using rigid body refinement followed by conjugate gradient minimization. Solvent molecules were removed from the model before placing it into the new cell and were relocated during later rounds of refinement. Any waters found in the active site were deleted until the NAG-thiazoline had been modeled into the electron density ascribed to it. The initial NAG-thiazoline model and its geometrical parameters were based on the x-ray crystal structure of N-acetylgalactosamine-thiazoline (GalNAc-thiazoline). 2D. J. Vocadlo and S. G. Withers, unpublished data.Refinement of the NAG-thiazoline complex was carried out using Crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance System as described for the native SpHEX model above. The final refinement statistics are presented in Table I. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (native SpHEX Protein Data Bank code 1HP4; SpHEX/NAG-thiazoline complex Protein Data Bank code 1HP5). Excellent crystallographic data (Table I) produced easily interpretable electron density maps into which a model ofSpHEX was built (Fig. 2). The enzyme is a kidney shaped, two-domain protein having overall dimensions of ∼68 × 58 × 56 Å (Fig. 3). The two domains ofSpHEX have a similar fold to domains II (residues 214–335) and III (residues 336–818) of SmCHB (Fig.4); however, significant deviations between the two structures exist. The most striking structural difference between SpHEX and SmCHB is the absence in SpHEX of two of the four domains that composeSmCHB (Fig. 4). This results in a solvent-exposed active site at the C-terminal end of the (β/α)8 barrel forming domain II. Such a solvent-exposed active site appears to explain why β-hexosaminidases, such as human β-hexosaminidase A, can accommodate large glycoconjugates like GalNAc-β(1,4)-[N-acetylneuraminic acid (2,3)]-Gal-β(1,4)-Glc-ceramide ganglioside.Figure 4C α superposition of SpHEX (red) andSmCHB (blue) generated using O (30Jones T.A.

NAG-thiazoline (NGT), bound within the active site of SpHEX, is shown as a Corey, Pauling, Koltun model. The overall rms difference for the superposition was found to be 1.67 Å using 389 Cα atoms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Domain I of SpHEX is composed of residues 1–151. As inSmCHB, this domain has an α/β topology consisting of a solvent exposed, seven-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet that buries two, roughly parallel, α-helices (Fig. 3). Similar topologies have been found in matrix metalloproteinases (10Tews I. Perrakis A. Oppenheim A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and collagenases. The amino acid sequence identity between SpHEX andSmCHB is lowest throughout this domain. A structure-based alignment using SwissPDBviewer (33Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar) indicated only a 16.1% amino acid identity. Nonetheless, the fold is well conserved, with 87 Cα atoms of the two homologous domains having a rms difference of only 1.34 Å. A multiple sequence alignment of all family 20 glycosyl hydrolases indicates that domain I is conserved throughout the entire family. Such conservation suggests a functional requirement for this domain by family 20 glycosyl hydrolases; ironically, however, its function remains unknown. Domain II of SpHEX is composed of residues 151–512 and is folded into a (β/α)8 barrel with the active site of the enzyme residing at the C termini of the 8 β-strands of the barrel. This domain is homologous to domain III in SmCHB, and a structure-based sequence alignment demonstrated there to be a 29.5% sequence identity between the two domains, where 236 of the Cα atoms had a rms difference of 1.30 Å. What may indeed be a common feature of this (β/α)8 barrel domain in family 20 glycosyl hydrolases is the conspicuous absence of regular helices at positions α5 and α7 in the (β/α)8barrel. In both SpHEX and SmCHB helix α5 consists of only a single turn of a 3/10 helix, whereas helix α7 is completely absent and is instead replaced by an extended loop. Overall, this domain in SpHEX contains shorter surface loops and is much more compact than its homologous counterpart, domain III, inSmCHB. Multiple sequence alignments of family 20 glycosyl hydrolases suggest that such a compact (β/α)8 barrel domain may be a common feature among many family 20β-hexosaminidases, including the human isoforms (10Tews I.

Unlike the basic (β/α)8 barrel motif, domain II ofSpHEX contains three major loop structures that extend from the C termini of three of the 8 β-strands of the barrel. First, loop Lp7 replaces helix α7 as described above (Fig. 3). Second, a 36-amino acid loop, Lp2, extends from the C terminus of strand β2 and contains a short helical segment that packs against and stabilizes the third major loop Lp3. Lp3 is a 41-amino acid loop that extends from the C terminus of strand β3 and contains a helical segment that is complimentary to and packs against the helical segment found in Lp2 (Fig. 3). There is only one disulfide bond in SpHEX (Cys263–Cys282), and its presence close to the base of Lp3 may help to stabilize the conformation of this loop. Lp3 and Lp7 act in concert to form the hydrophobic faces of sugar binding site +1 described below (Fig. 5). There are two homologous loops in SmCHB; however, they are longer and perform an additional function by interacting with a domain not present in SpHEX (SmCHB domain I) (Fig. 4). Finally, an extra helix continues on from helix α8 of the (β/α)8 barrel to complete the C terminus ofSpHEX. This extra helix stabilizes domains I and"

However, the kinase(s) that targets these proteins has not been identified. Using a combined pharmacological and genetic approach, we found that none of the kinases tested was responsible for IRF phosphorylation in cells infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Although the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine potently blocked IRF3 and -7 phosphorylation, inhibitors for protein kinase C, protein kinase A, MEK, SAPK, IKK, and protein kinase R (PKR) were without effect. Both IκB kinase and PKR have been implicated in IFN induction, but cells genetically deficient in IκB kinase, PKR, or thePKR-related genes PERK, IRE1, orGCN2 retained the ability to phosphorylate IRF7 and induce IFNα. Interestingly, PKR mutant cells were defective for response to double-stranded (ds) RNA but not to virus infection, suggesting that dsRNA is not the only activating viral component. Consistent with this notion, protein synthesis was required for IRF7 phosphorylation in virus-infected cells, and the kinetics of phosphorylation and viral protein production were similar. Despite evidence for a lack of involvement of dsRNA and PKR, vaccinia virus E3L protein, a dsRNA-binding protein capable of inhibiting PKR, was an effective IRF3 and -7 phosphorylation inhibitor. These results suggest that a novel cellular protein that is activated by viral products in addition to dsRNA and is sensitive to E3L inhibition is responsible for IRF activation and reveal a novel mechanism for the anti-IFN effect of E3L distinct from its inhibition of PKR.

Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Gene induction is rapid, and can be divided into two distinct phases initiated by induction of IFNβ andIFNα4 expression followed by induction of other members of the IFNα gene family (3Marié I.

Differences in the gene expression profiles of the distinct type I IFN genes can be accounted for by unique properties of their promoter/enhancer structures.IFNβ expression is controlled by an enhanceosome that binds three distinct transcription factor complexes in the context of chromatin-organizing proteins (5Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Each of these complexes, c-jun/ATF2 (AP1), IRF, and NFκB, become active following protein phosphorylation events induced in response to virus infection.IFNα promoters are also activated by IRF proteins, and the distinct DNA binding characteristics and patterns of induction and activation of IRF3 and IRF7 confer the differential expression of the IFNα gene family (3Marié I.

While several transcription factors required for IFN gene induction have been identified, delineation of the signaling pathways stimulated by virus infection that lead to phosphorylation-dependent activation remains incomplete. Activation of NFκB requires phosphorylation-induced degradation of its inhibitor, IκB, through the action of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ/NEMO (10Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of IKK is activated by a wide variety of inducers, including viral infection and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common by product of viral infection (11Yamaoka S. Courtois G.

Activation of IKK by dsRNA and viral infection may depend on a second enzyme, protein kinase R (PKR); however, in this role PKR may function noncatalytically and serve as an adaptor protein (12Chu W.M. Ostertag D. Li Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y. Hu Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), although even this requirement has been recently called into question (13Iordanov M.S. Wong J. Bell J.C. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The AP1 transcription factor, also required forIFNβ gene induction, is likewise activated by phosphorylation through the action of c-Jun kinase (JNK), which is also activated in virus-infected cells (12Chu W.M.

The third transcription factor complex required for IFN gene induction, composed of IRF3 and/or IRF7, is also activated by phosphorylation specifically in virus-infected cells (3Marié I. Durbin J.E.

Not only is the identity of the IRF3/IRF7 kinase unclear, the nature of the activating component produced during virus infection that leads to kinase activation remains unknown. One candidate has been dsRNA, a common intermediate or by product of many viral infections that directly activates PKR (23Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Moreover, many viruses target inactivation of PKR as a strategy to overcome host antiviral responses, by binding dsRNA, interfering with the activation of PKR, blocking its recognition of substrates, or inducing its degradation (24Alcami A. Koszinowski U.H. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence suggests that dsRNA may not be the essential or at least not the only viral component leading to IFN gene expression. For instance, disruption of the gene for PKR abrogated the induction of IFN in response to dsRNA, but did not prevent responsiveness to viral infection (25Kumar A. Yang Y.L. Flati V. Der S.

Weaver B. Reich N. Spector D. David M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3796-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Zhu H. Cong J.P. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3607-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We have investigated the mechanisms of phosphorylation of IRF7 and its close relative, IRF3, during activation of IFN gene expression following Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection. By all parameters tested, IRF3 and IRF7 appeared to be activated by the same mechanism. Their phosphorylation occurred with similar kinetics which required ongoing protein synthesis during viral infection, was blocked by the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine but not by inhibitors specific for individual kinases, and could be inhibited by the vaccinia virus protein, E3L. However, IRF3 and -7 phosphorylation was unaffected by the inactivation of the PKR gene, and IFNα gene expression was still induced in virus-infectedPKR(−/−) and IKKγ−/−) cells, as well as in cells deficient for several PKR-related genes. These data suggest that IRF7 activation can be stimulated by a viral component other than or in addition to dsRNA, that a novel cellular kinase distinct from PKR is responsible for its phosphorylation, and that the E3L protein exerts its anti-IFN effect by inhibiting not only PKR but also the distinct IRF3/7 kinase(s). 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum.PKR(−/−) and wild type control fibroblasts were immortalized by the 3T3 process (30Aaronson S.A.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), except that E3L proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride with a 0.2-μm pore size. Rabbit antisera to IRF3 and IRF7 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used at 0.5 μg/ml. Chicken anti-NDV (SPAFAS, North Franklin, CT) was used at a dilution of 1:1000. Monoclonal anti-E3L antibody Tw2.3 (42Yuwen H. Cox J.H. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Moss B. Virology. 1993; 195: 732-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was an ammonium sulfate fraction from supernatants of hybridoma cultures, the kind gift of Jonathan Yewdell (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). DRBP76 and Staufen proteins were detected using antibodies to epitope tags. In vitro kinase assays for IKK were performed by immunoprecipitating IKK from mouse fibroblasts, and incubating the recovered protein with 1 μg of GST fusion protein substrates in 15 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm magnesium chloride, 20 mm β−glycerophosphate, 20 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmNa4VO3, 1 mm EDTA, plus protease inhibitors) in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min, followed by analysis by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Antibody against IKK was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). GST-IRF7 was expressed in bacteria from the pGEX-2T vector (43Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). GST-IκB and mutant IκB were kind gifts of Jan Vilcek (New York University). IRF3 is constitutively expressed in cells while IRF7 is induced in response to an early wave of IFN production following viral infection (44Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine & Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This differential expression complicates the question of whether these two proteins can be activated by the same kinase. To alleviate this technical shortcoming, we ectopically expressed IRF3 or IRF7 by transient transfection so that expression would be normalized under the control of an artificial promoter and phosphorylation could be measured independent from protein induction. Infection of transfected cells with NDV led to phosphorylation, as judged by a mobility shift following SDS-PAGE that is dependent on phosphorylation (3Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Marié I. Smith E. Prakash A. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8803-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Lin R.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), of both IRF7 (Fig.1A) and IRF3 (Fig.1B). Moreover, both proteins were activated with equivalent kinetics, becoming phosphorylated at 5 h post-infection and showing maximal phosphorylation 7–8 h post-infection that remained high for several hours (data not shown). Acquisition of DNA binding activity, as judged by EMSA, correlated precisely with phosphorylation for both proteins (data not shown). We validated this transfection system by examining the kinetics of phosphorylation of endogenous IRF3 (Fig. 1D) which was phosphorylated with the same kinetics as the ectopically expressed protein. Therefore, the sequential activation of IRF3- and IRF7-target genes normally observed in untransfected cells following NDV infection can be accounted for by the requirement for induction of the IRF7 protein rather than by utilization of distinct kinases. Considerable viral protein synthesis occurred within the first 7 h of infection, as judged by immunoblotting for viral proteins using antisera directed against NDV virions (Fig. 1C). This observation prompted us to consider whether protein synthesis, including viral protein synthesis, might be involved in IRF activation. To test this notion, protein synthesis was blocked by addition of cycloheximide at various times after infection. Inhibition of protein synthesis at any point up until ∼3 h post-infection prevented phosphorylation of IRF7 (Fig. 2,lanes 3–5). However, addition of cycloheximide after that point was without effect (Fig. 2, lanes 6–9). Consistent with the requirement of phosphorylation of IRF3 (16Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) and IRF7 for acquisition of DNA binding (6Marié I. Smith E. Prakash A. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8803-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), cycloheximide added early in infection also blocked IRF7 activity as measured by EMSA (data not shown). These data suggest that proteins accumulating during the first 3 h of NDV infection are required for activation of the IRF7 kinase. Since no serine kinases are encoded by NDV (45de Leeuw O. Peeters B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), it is likely that viral proteins are involved either directly or indirectly in activation of a cellular kinase that targets IRF7. Alternatively, cycloheximide might block synthesis of a short-lived cellular protein. Cellular kinases potentially involved in IRF phosphorylation were investigated initially by use of pharmacological inhibitors. To distinguish a direct effect of inhibition on an IRF kinase from a possible indirect effect caused by, for instance, inhibition of necessary viral protein synthesis, pharmacological inhibitors were added late in infection (5 h post-infection), just prior to the observed appearance of phosphorylated protein and at a time point at which ongoing protein synthesis was no longer required. IRF7 phosphorylation was blocked by staurosporine (Fig.3A, lane 4), a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor previously shown to block phosphorylation of IRF1 in virus-infected cells (46Watanabe N. Sakakibara J. Hovanessian A.G. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4421-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). IRF7 phosphorylation was also reduced by the related inhibitor, K252a (Table I). However, none of the more specific kinase inhibitors tested were capable of preventing IRF phosphorylation (Fig. 3A and TableI). These included inhibitors of PKR (2-amino purine (47Hu Y. Conway T.W. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)) and of IKK (acetylsalacylic acid and salacylic acid (48Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar)), kinases known to be activated in response to virus infection and involved in activation of NFκB. Other agents ineffective in blocking IRF phosphorylation included inhibitors of PKC, PKA, p38, extracellular kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and tyrosine kinases. The phosphorylation status of IRF7 correlated with its ability to bind DNA, as detected by EMSA (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Specificity of DNA binding was confirmed by antibody and DNA competition reactions (Fig. 3B) using anti-Flag (lane 3), anti-IRF7 (lane 4), or homologous DNA competitor (lane 5). IRF3 phosphorylation was also blocked by staurosporine treatment (Fig.3C, lane 3) but not by any other inhibitors tested, and none of the pharmacologic agents tested led to IRF phosphorylation in the absence of infection (data not shown). Phosphorylation of ectopically expressed IRF3 paralleled that of the endogenous protein whose phosphorylation was blocked by staurosporine and cycloheximide (Fig.3C, lanes 6 and 7) but not by genistein, H7, H8, or wortmanin (lanes 8–11). Another technique used to probe the nature of the IRF kinase involved a search for agents that might block a virally activated cellular signaling step, or, alternatively, that might activate IRF7 phosphorylation in the absence of viral infection. We treated cells with DNA damaging agents, calcium chelators, proteosome inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors, and activators of the unfolded protein response. We also overexpressed a constitutively active form of MKK7, an activator of the JNK pathway (49Holland P.M. Suzanne M. Campbell J.S. Noselli S. Cooper J.A. J. Biol.

We have recently demonstrated that SAHA induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human breast cancer cells, accompanied by up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF1/CIP1, via a p53-independent mechanism. In this study, we used p21 gene expression as a model system to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying SAHA-mediated gene activation. Treatment of human breast cancer cell line MCF7 cells with SAHA induced p21 mRNA as a consequence of an immediate-early gene activation. Moreover, SAHA activated the p21 promoter primarily through two Spl sites located at -82 and -69 relative to the transcription start site. Furthermore, Sp1 and Sp3 proteins were the major factors binding to the Spl site of the p21 promoter. However, SAHA did not alter their DNA binding activities, suggesting that SAHA mediates p21 promoter activity by a mechanism other than altering the DNA binding activities of Sp1 and Sp3. Further studies using the GAL4 luciferase assay system demonstrated that both GAL4-Sp1 and GAL4-Sp3 fusion proteins supported SAHA-mediated gene activation from a promoter driven by five GAL4 DNA binding sites, and that GAL4-Sp3 fusion protein was suppressive in the absence of SAHA treatment. Collectively, our results suggest that SAHA activates the p21 promoter through the Spl sites, and that both Spl and Sp3 proteins can mediate SAHA-induced gene activation."

More than 50% of the newly synthesized wt CFTR remains incompletely folded and is degraded at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas the remaining 25–50% undergoes an ATP-dependent conformational maturation and is exported to the cis/medial-Golgi, where its complex glycosylation can occur (4Lukacs G.L.

If the ER retention of the mutant is not complete, accelerated disposal from the post-ER compartments could contribute to its inability to express at the physiological level in certain tissues. Indeed, based on indirect evidence, we proposed that the rescued ΔF508 CFTR has a short residence time at the cell surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), expressing ΔF508 CFTR heterologously (34Lukacs G.L.

However, neither this nor any other study has provided direct biochemical or structural information regarding the behavior of ΔF508 CFTR following its escape from ER. Here we provide direct biochemical and functional evidence for the biological instability of the complex-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR. Furthermore, we show that the stability defect is temperature-sensitive, which is likely due to an attenuated conformational stability of the native state, demonstrated by increased protease susceptibility and the thermoaggregation tendency of the rescued mutant relative to its wt counterpart. The implications of these observations are fundamental with respect to understanding the cellular phenotype and designing more efficient therapeutic strategies in CF. A mixture of stably transfected baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, expressing human wt and ΔF508 CFTR with a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, was generated and maintained as described (4Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Characterization of the HA-tagged CFTR variants will be described elsewhere. Isolation of ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane-enriched microsomes from BHK cells was performed using nitrogen cavitation and differential centrifugation as described (11Zhang F. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Where specified, the core-glycosylated wt or mutant CFTR was eliminated from the cells during a 3-h incubation in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX, 100 μg/ml). The microsomal pellet was resuspended in HSE medium (10 mm sodium HEPES, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.6) and used either immediately or after being snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Microsomes were isolated from ΔF508 and wt CFTR expressor BHK cells and incubated at a protein concentration of 1.3–1.5 and 0.8–1.0 mg/ml, respectively, in the presence of trypsin or proteinase K for 15 min at 4 °C in digestion buffer (phosphate-buffered saline) as described. Proteolysis was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 1 mm, and samples were immediately denatured in 2× Laemmli sample buffer at 37 °C for 20 min. To distinguish between high mannose and complex-typeN-linked oligosaccharide modification of CFTR, cell lysates were incubated with endoglycosidase H (7 μg/ml) and peptideN-glycosidase F (31 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 3 h. The mobility shift of deglycosylated CFTR was visualized with immunoblotting using anti-HA mAb. CFTR immunoblotting was performed with anti-HA mAb (Babco). Proteolytic digestion patterns were visualized with the mouse monoclonal M3A7 and L12B4 anti-CFTR Abs. L12B4 localizes to the region of the cytoplasmic NBD1 of CFTR (epitope within the range of amino acid positions 386 and 412), and M3A7 localizes to the region of the cytoplasmic NBD2 of CFTR (epitope within the range of amino acid positions 1365 and 1395) (11Zhang F. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of ERP72 and GRP78 was performed with the rabbit polyclonal (SPA720) and mouse monoclonal (SPA826, Stressgen) antibodies, respectively. Immunoblots, with multiple exposures, were quantified using DuoScan transparency scanner and N.I.H. Image 6.1 software (developed by the National Institutes of Health and available at their web site). Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed essentially as described (4Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Monolayer cells were pulse-labeled under defined conditions and chased at the indicated temperature for the time intervals specified for each experiment. Membrane proteins were solubilized in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm iodoacetamide). Immunoprecipitates, obtained with anti-HA or M3A7 and L12B4 anti-CFTR mAbs, were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The radioactivity incorporated was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) (4Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed (H-buffer: 154 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.6) and biotinylated with 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,2-dithiopropionate (EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, Pierce) three times for 15 min at 37 °C. Following the solubilization of the cells in RIPA buffer, biotinylated CFTRs were affinity-isolated on streptavidin-Sepharose (Sigma), separated with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized with anti-HA mAb and ECL. The plasma membrane cAMP-dependent halide conductance of transfected BHK cells was determined with iodide efflux as described (35Chang B.-X. Tabcharani J.A. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Kartner N. Alon N. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11304-11311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the chloride content was replaced with iodide by incubating the cells in loading buffer (136 mm NaI, 3 mm KNO3, 2 mmCa(NO3)2, 11 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 60 min at room temperature. Iodide efflux was initiated by replacing the loading buffer with efflux medium (composed of 136 mm nitrate in place of iodide). The extracellular medium was replaced every minute with efflux buffer (1 ml). After a steady-state was reached, the intracellular cAMP level was raised by agonists (10 μm forskolin, 0.2 mmCTP-cAMP, and 0.2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine) to achieve maximal phosphorylation of ΔF508 CFTR, and collection of the efflux medium resumed for an additional 6–9 min. The amount of iodide in each sample was determined with an iodide-selective electrode (Orion). Following the solubilization of BHK cells in Laemmli sample buffer, the aggregation tendency of wt and mutant CFTR was compared by exposing the lysate to temperatures ranging from 37 to 100 °C for 5 min. SDS-resistant macromolecular aggregates were sedimented with centrifugation (17,000 × g for 15 min). Monomeric mutant and wt CFTR, ERP72, GRP78, and Na+/K+-ATPase remaining in the supernatant were measured with quantitative immunoblotting using the appropriate Ab and ECL. To attain high sensitivity immunodetection, the influenza HA epitope-tagged ΔF508 and wt CFTR were expressed stably in BHK cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that the HA-tagged ΔF508 CFTR appears as an endoglycosidase H (endo-H)- and peptideN-glycosidase F (PNGase-F)-sensitive, core-glycosylated polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass ≈140–150 kDa (Fig.1 a, empty arrowhead) at 37 °C (9Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). The processing defect of the ΔF508 CFTR could be partially overcome by the combination of glycerol and low temperature treatment, similarly to its nontagged counterpart, as reported in a number of cultured cells (10Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 350: 761-764Crossref Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 23Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Following the optimization of the rescue conditions, accumulation of the complex-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR was indicated by the appearance of endo-H-resistant immunoreactive polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass ≈170 kDa (Fig.1 a, black arrowhead) (9Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). The N-linked oligosaccharide modification and the apparent molecular mass of the rescued ΔF508 CFTR are virtually identical to that of the HA-tagged complex-glycosylated wt CFTR (Fig. 1). The biological stability of the complex-glycosylated wt and rescued ΔF508 CFTR was determined upon inhibition of protein biosynthesis with CHX or vesicular transport from ER to Golgi with brefeldin A (BFA). After the accumulation of the complex-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR at 26 °C, cells were incubated in the presence of CHX or BFA at 37 °C, and the remaining CFTR was measured with quantitative immunoblotting, using anti-HA mAb as a function of incubation time (Fig. 1, b and c). Densitometry revealed that the half-life of the complex-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR (t 12 ≈ 5 h) is at least four times shorter than that of the wt CFTR (t 12 ≈ 22 h) at 37 °C, regardless of the inhibitor (Fig. 1 d). Similarly fast disposal of the ΔF508 CFTR (t 12 ≈ 5 h) could be observed in the absence of CHX or BFA, after shifting the temperature from 26 to 37 °C during the chase (Fig.1 c). To verify that the deletion of Phe-508 destabilizes the complex-glycosylated CFTR, metabolic pulse-chase experiments were performed on transfectants expressing wt or rescued ΔF508 CFTR (Fig.2 a). Phosphorimage analysis confirmed that the complex-glycosylated ΔF508 was eliminated four times faster (t 12 ≈ 4.5 h) than wt CFTR (t 12 ≈ 18 h) at 37 °C (Fig.2 b). Similar turnover rates were obtained upon rescuing the mutant with either glycerol or reduced temperature alone, and on mock-treated wt CFTR, ruling out that osmotic or cold stress can account for the difference (data not shown). The accelerated disappearance of ΔF508 CFTR also cannot be attributed to the loss of the carboxyl-terminal epitope, because similar half-lives were measured with antibodies to epitopes located in NBD1, NBD2, or at the amino-terminal tail (data not shown). Finally, preliminary results obtained on pancreatic ductal epithelia expressing the ΔF508 CFTR constitutively showed that the mutation impairs the stability of CFTR in polarized epithelia to a degree comparable with that found in nonpolarized cells (data not shown). These results collectively support the notion that the instability is an intrinsic property of the rescued ΔF508 CFTR rather than epitope- or cell-specific. To examine whether the turnover of the plasma membrane-associated mutant CFTR is similar to that of the complex-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR pool, which comprises thetrans-Golgi network, secretory vesicles, and endosomes as well, the fate of the rescued ΔF508 CFTR was followed with cell surface biotinylation and iodide efflux measurements. The plasma membrane proteins of BHK cells, expressing ΔF508, rescued ΔF508, or wt CFTR, were covalently tagged with NHS-SS-biotin, affinity-isolated on streptavidin beads, and immunoblotted with anti-HA mAb. Both the rescued ΔF508 and the wt CFTR are amenable to biotinylation, in contrast to the ER-resident, core-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR (Fig. 3 a). Densitometric analysis revealed that ≈50% of the biotinylated ΔF508 CFTR disappeared after 4 h and became undetectable by 10 h of chase at 37 °C (Fig. 3 b). In contrast, the turnover of biotinylated wt CFTR was more than 4-fold slower (t 12 ≈ 18 h, data not shown) than the rescued ΔF508 CFTR but comparable with the complex-glycosylated wt CFTR pool (Fig. 1 d and 2 b). The lack of endogenous cAMP-dependent anion conductance of BHK cells permitted us to monitor the arrival of functional ΔF508 CFTR to the plasma membrane by the iodide efflux assay. At permissive temperatures, the cAMP-stimulated iodide release was proportional with the length of the rescue period up to 8 h (Fig.4 a, inset). After allowing ΔF508 CFTR to accumulate at the cell surface for 5 h, raising the temperature to 37 °C evoked a rapid disappearance of the mutant. The amount of iodide released by cAMP-dependent protein kinase stimulation decreased by 50% after 4 h and became undetectable after 10 h of chase at 37 °C (Fig. 4,a and b) in cells expressing rescued ΔF508, whereas no decrease was apparent over 10 h in wt CFTR expressors. Because the cAMP-activated iodide release could not be detected in rescued mock-transfected and parental BHK cells (data not shown), the functional and the biotinylation studies jointly indicate that the ΔF508 CFTR channels are as unstable at the cell surface as in the post-ER compartments. Taken together, the immunoblot, metabolic pulse-chase, biotinylation, and iodide measurements provide the first direct evidence that the functional and biochemical half-life of the complex-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR is 4–5-fold shorter than its wt counterpart at 37 °C, suggesting that structural differences may persist between the rescued ΔF508 and wt CFTR at the plasma membrane. To test whether the stability defect of the complex-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR at 37 °C is related to its thermolability, pulse-labeled cells were chased at temperatures ranging from 28 to 40 °C. Although thet 12 of wt and rescued ΔF508 CFTR converged at 28 °C (≈50 h), a striking difference became apparent at temperatures above 30 °C. Rescued ΔF508 CFTR was at least 20-fold more unstable (t 12 ≈ 0.8 h) than its wt counterpart (t 12 ≈ 18 h) at 40 °C (Fig.5, a and b). In sharp contrast, no difference could be resolved in the relative turnover rates of the core-glycosylated (ER-resident) wt and ΔF508 CFTR between 28 and 40 °C (Fig. 5 b), consistent with the notion that the core-glycosylated form represents a common folding intermediate, which is less susceptible to thermal denaturation (4Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 5Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

Considering that unfolding of soluble and membrane proteins upon heat shock accelerates their cellular degradation (36Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar), our results suggest that the thermal resistance of the complex-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR toward unfolding is substantially lower than its wt counterpart. Because large quantities of purified CFTR are not available to test this hypothesis directly, the protease susceptibility of native and the thermoaggregation propensity of solubilized CFTR variants were measured as indirect indicators of their structural stability. SDS-solubilized cell lysates, obtained from BHK cells expressing ΔF508, rescued ΔF508, or wt CFTR, were heat-denatured at temperatures ranging between 37 and 100 °C. Insoluble aggregates were sedimented by centrifugation, and monomeric CFTR remaining in the supernatant was quantified by immunoblotting. The thermostability of solubilized CFTR was characterized by measuring the aggregation temperature (Ta), at which 50% of monomeric CFTR is converted into SDS-resistant aggregates (Fig.6 a). The Ta of rescued ΔF508 CFTR was 10 °C lower (Ta ≈ 65 °C) than its wt counterpart (Ta ≈ 75 °C) but 10 °C higher than the core-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR (Ta ≈ 55 °C) (Fig. 6 b). The following observations suggest that the progressively decreasing thermostability of the rescued and core-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR is likely the consequence of structural differences. Firstly, distinct aggregation pattern was also measured on immunoprecipitated wt and mutant CFTR (data not shown), implying that their aggregation propensity is independent of other polypeptides. Secondly, no difference could be documented in the thermoaggregation of the polytopic Na+/K+-ATPase, in parental BHK cells, or in cells expressing wt, ΔF508, or rescued ΔF508 CFTR (Fig. 6 c). Conversely, ERP72 and GRP78, soluble ER proteins, were resistant to aggregation, presumably due to their fully denatured state in SDS, in contrast to polytopic membrane proteins, which tend to preserve their aggregation tendency following detergent solubilization (37Sagne C. Isambert M.F. Henry J.P. Gasnier B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 c). Finally and most importantly, no significant difference between the thermoaggregation tendency of ΔF508, rescued ΔF508, and wt CFTR"

https://openalex.org/W1965722860,"The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is believed to function as a key component of the general transcription machinery. We tested the role of TBP during the onset of embryonic transcription by antisense oligonucleotide-mediated turnover of maternal TBP messenger RNA. Embryos without detectable TBP initiated gastrulation but died before completing gastrulation. The expression of many genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II and III was reduced; however, some genes were transcribed with an efficiency identical to that of TBP-containing embryos. Using a similar antisense strategy, we found that the TBP-like factor TLF/TRF2 is essential for development past the mid-blastula stage. Because TBP and a TLF factor play complementary roles in embryonic development, our results indicate that although similar mechanistic roles exist in common, TBP and TLF function differentially to control transcription of specific genes."

Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1995Google Scholar). Since the pyrimidine bases absorb in the UV region (200–300 nm), UV irradiation causes a [2 + 2] reaction at adjacent pyrimidine sites, resulting in the formation of two major photoproducts, the cis,syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD)1 and the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproduct ((6-4) photoproduct). Unlike the CPD, the primary photoproduct of the [2 + 2] addition between the C-5–C-6 double bond and the carbonyl or iminyl group, oxetane for TT or azetidine for TC, is not actually observed but undergoes rapid rearrangement at temperatures above −80 °C, leading to the formation of the (6-4) photoproduct, as shown in Fig.1 (2Rahn R.O. Hosszu J.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1969; 10: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 3Clivio P. Fourrey J.-L. Gasche J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5481-5483Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consequently, the hydroxyl or amino group at the C-4 position of the 3′-base is transferred to the 5′-pyrimidine ring in the (6-4) photoproduct. Although both the CPD and the (6-4) photoproduct are formed by UV at adjacent pyrimidine sites in DNA strands, the structural features of the (6-4) photoproduct are quite different from those of the CPD. Therefore, the influence of these two photolesions on replication also differs (4Pfeifer G.P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Photoproducts must be repaired in cells to maintain genetic integrity. Photolyase is a unique DNA repair enzyme that eliminates UV-derived photoproducts by electron transfer from the catalytic cofactor, FAD, using light in the near UV/blue region (5Sancar G.B. Mutat.

Thus far, two types of photolyases have been isolated. One is a DNA photolyase specific for the CPD (referred to as CPD photolyase in this report) and the other is a (6-4) photolyase specific for the (6-4) photoproduct (7Sancar A.

Jiang C.Z. Todo T. Britt A.B. Yamamoto K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the (6-4) photolyases are quite similar to the CPD photolyases, although (6-4) photolyase does not bind or repair the CPD (13Todo T. Ryo H. Yamamoto K. Toh H. Inui T. Ayaki H. Nomura T. Ikenaga M. Science. 1996; 272: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The (6-4) photolyase has been considered to have evolutionarily diverted from the CPD photolyase (17Kanai S. Kikuno R. Toh H. Ryo H. Todo T. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In fact, we have shown that the (6-4) photolyases possess features quite similar with those of the CPD photolyases (14Todo T.

(19Kim S.-T. Malhotra K. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8535-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rejected the possibility that a single electron transfer to the (6-4) photoproduct could result in the restoration of the original DNA bases. It was suggested that a function additional to the common photolyase activities is required for the (6-4) photolyase to restore the original bases. It was proposed that the (6-4) photolyase repairs the (6-4) photoproduct first by converting it to a four-membered ring and then by splitting the two pyrimidines, as does the CPD photolyase (oxetane intermediate model, see Ref. 19Kim S.-T. Malhotra K. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8535-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous reports, we showed by high pressure liquid chromatography analyses that both the T(6-4)T and T(6-4)C photoproducts are restored completely to the original bases, despite the difference in the functional group at the C-4 of the 3′-base (18Hitomi K.

These results strongly suggested that the transfer of the –NH2 or –OH group of the (6-4) photoproduct is an intramolecular reaction within the substrate. Additionally, Zhaoet al. (21Zhao X. Liu J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32580-32590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) supported the oxetane intermediate model by using chemically synthesized analogues of the (6-4) photoproduct as the substrate. However, the (6-4) photoproducts neither form this intermediate nor turn into the original bases spontaneously. Theoretical calculations on the base portion of T(6-4)T and its oxetane isomer estimated the gap to be about 14.5–16.5 kcal/mol, suggesting that perturbation of the (6-4)/oxetane equilibrium is unlikely to be a feature of the photoenzymic repair mechanism as the computed value exceeds the likely difference in binding energy between the two species (22Heelis P.F.

In this paper, we identified the residues crucial for the photoreactivation by the (6-4) photolyase. Due to the high similarity in the primary structures at the active sites, the reason for the marked difference in the substrate specificity of each type of photolyase has been unclear. A structural model of the (6-4) photolyase in complex with the (6-4) photoproduct was constructed to discuss the substrate recognition and the reaction mechanism. We propose that the two conserved histidine residues, which are not present in the CPD photolyases, act as an acid and a base to catalyze the formation of the four-membered ring intermediate. Xenopus (6-4) photolyase and its substrate, the 49-mer oligonucleotide containing a single (6-4) photoproduct, were prepared for in vitroassays, as described previously (14Todo T. Kim S.-T. Hitomi K.

The (6-4) photoproduct derived from two thymidines was incorporated into the TTAA sequence context, which is the recognition site of the MseI restriction endonuclease. The oligonucleotide was labeled isotopically at the 5′ terminus, annealed with the complementary strand, and then used as the substrate. To detect the photolyase activity in vitro, restriction site restoration assays were performed, as described previously (18Hitomi K. Kim S.-T. Iwai S. Harima N. Otoshi E. Ikenaga M. Todo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32591-32598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The substrate (1 nm) was treated with the photolyases in 30 μl of a 50 mm buffered solution containing 1 mm dithiothreitol under daylight irradiation by a fluorescent lamp. The mixture was diluted to 150 μl with sterile water, treated with the same volume of phenol/chloroform (50:50, v/v), and precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of sterile water, digested with MseI (New England Biolabs, Inc.) overnight, subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, and visualized by autoradiography. The cleaved and uncleaved fractions of the DNA fragment were quantified with a Fuji bioimaging analyzer (BAS-2000, Fuji Photo Film). For the isotope effect, D2O, KOD, and (DOCD2)2CDOD (glycerol-d8), which were 99 atom %, were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes. The salt used in the preparation of buffers was initially dissolved in D2O and was concentrated in several freeze-dry cycles prior to the addition of glycerol-d8. The substrate was diluted in buffer prepared with D2O and glycerol-d8. The enzymes were dissolved in buffer containing D2O and glycerol-d8 and were concentrated with a Centriprep-50 apparatus (Millipore Corporation), and their absorption and fluorescence spectra were found to be virtually identical to those of the enzymes dissolved in H2O. Substrate binding was detected with electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), as described previously (18Hitomi K. Kim S.-T. Iwai S. Harima N. Otoshi E. Ikenaga M. Todo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32591-32598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The described substrate (50 pm) was incubated with 0.05–1 nm of the photolyase in 10 μl of 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) on ice for 30 min in the dark, and the resultant mixture was applied to a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The electrophoresis was performed under yellow light to prevent photoreactivation, and then the gel was autoradiographed for visual inspection. The bound and unbound fractions of the DNA fragment were quantified on the bioimaging analyzer. The in vivo effect of the photolyase was detected by the survival rate of UV-irradiated E. coli strain SY2 (uvrA−, recA−, phr−) containing the plasmid pRT2, which carries the wild type E. coli CPD photolyase gene, as described previously (14Todo T. Kim S.-T. Hitomi K. Otoshi E. Inui T. Morioka H. Kobayashi H. Ohtsuka E. Toh H. Ikenaga M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). E. coli SY2 (pRT2) was transformed with a series of mutant constructs derived from pGEX-Xl64PR. The transformed cells were grown in LB medium containing 150 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C overnight. The expression of the photolyase gene was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the medium to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and shaking for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. Aliquots of cells were plated on LB agar and irradiated first by UV at an intensity of either 0.3 or 0.6 J/m2 and subsequently with daylight fluorescence lamps for 1 h. The plates were incubated in the dark at 37 °C overnight, and surviving colonies were counted the next day. All experiments, except the photoreactivation treatment, were performed under yellow light. Alanine-substituted mutations were introduced at Gln288, Trp291, His354, Leu355, His358, and Trp398 inXenopus (6-4) photolyase, respectively. Based on the described plasmid, pGEX-Xl64PR (14Todo T. Kim S.-T. Hitomi K. Otoshi E. Inui T. Morioka H. Kobayashi H. Ohtsuka E. Toh H. Ikenaga M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we constructed mutated plasmids using the Site-directed Mutagenesis System Mutan®-Super Express Km (Takara). The BglII/SphI fragment digested from pGEX-Xl64PR was subcloned into the BamHI/SphI sites of pKF18. The resultant plasmid was named pKF-Xl64 and was used as the template. The synthetic oligonucleotides for mutagenesis are as follows: pGEX-Q288A designed for Q288A, 5′-TCTCCATGGGGCGTTGCTGTGG-3′ (positions 852–873); pGEX-W291A for W291A, 5′-GCAGTTGCTGGCGCGCGAGTTC-3′ (positions 861–882); pGEX-H354A for H354A, 5′-ATGGATCCACGCCTTAGCTCGA-3′ (positions 1050–1071); pGEX-L355A for L355A, 5′-GATCCACCACGCAGCTCGACAT-3′ (positions 1053–1074); pGEX-H358A for H358A, 5′-CTTAGCTCGAGCTGCTGTCGCT-3′ (positions 1062–1083); pGEX-W398A for W398A, 5′-AAATTGGCTGGCGCTCTCTGCT-3′ (positions 1182–1203). The underlines indicate the modified sequences. According to the manufacturer's instructions, mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction using the described oligonucleotides and pKF-Xl64. Mutated fragments derived from pKF-Xl64 were inserted at the proper position of pGEX-Xl64PR with the appropriate restriction endonucleases, NdeI andMunI. In all cases, the nucleotide sequence was determined to ensure that no additional mutation was introduced. The commercially available E. coli strain JM 109 (Takara) and the strain SY2 (pRT2) were transformed with the resultant pGEX-XL64PR plasmids carrying a single mutation for the protein production and the in vivo assays, respectively. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused proteins were used for all experiments, except that the GST was removed for the substrate binding assays. The wild type enzyme and the mutants were purified as described previously (14Todo T. Kim S.-T. Hitomi K. Otoshi E. Inui T. Morioka H. Kobayashi H. Ohtsuka E. Toh H. Ikenaga M.

The production of the photolyases was checked by both SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–20% gradient) and an enzymatic assay using the GST Detection Module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which is based on the detection of the fused GST activity. According to the manufacturer's instructions, 2 μl of the cell extracts from the transformed E. coli were added to 150 μl of a solution containing 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1 mm glutathione, and the change in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored on a UV spectrophotometer. The amino acid sequences of E. coli CPD photolyase and Xenopus (6-4) photolyase were aligned by using the commercially available software, GENETYX-MAC Version 8.0 (Software Development Co., Ltd.). A tertiary model ofXenopus (6-4) photolyase from Glu221 to Pro420 was constructed by comparative modeling based on the structure of E. coli CPD photolyase (Protein Data Bank code,1dnp) (9Park H.W.

Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3604) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the free (6-4) photoproduct of thymidylyl(3′ → 5′)-thymidine, derived from an NMR study (30Kim J.-K. Choi B.-S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. Byong-Seok Choi. The (6-4) photoproduct was manually docked to the active site of Xenopus (6-4) photolyase, using the molecular graphics program Insight II (Molecular Simulation Inc.), and the energy of the complex conformation was further minimized (28Morikami K. Nakai T. Kidera A. Saito M. Nakamura H. Comput. & Chem. 1992; 16: 243-248Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity and the apparent reaction of the (6-4) photolyases are quite different from those of the CPD photolyases, although both photolyases repair the damage by photoinduced electron transfer from reduced FAD to the substrate (18Hitomi K.

Fig. 2shows the pH profile of Xenopus (6-4) photolyase. A single T(6-4)T photoproduct in a 49-mer oligonucleotide was photoreactivated with Xenopus (6-4) photolyase at various pH values. The activity was detected with the described coupled enzyme assay (18Hitomi K. Kim S.-T. Iwai S. Harima N. Otoshi E. Ikenaga M. Todo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32591-32598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which is based on the restoration of the restriction enzyme sensitivity of a recognition sequence containing the photoproduct by photoreactivation. Repair by Xenopus (6-4) photolyase was most efficient at high pH (pH 8.5–9.0), although flavin is most efficiently excited at a lower pH. The maximal activity occurred at pH 8.5 and was 2.4-fold higher than that at pH 6.5, whereas a remarkable decrease of catalysis was observed upon approaching pH 6.0. To determine the catalytic residues essential for the formation of the proposed four-membered ring intermediate, a site-specific mutation analysis was carried out. Although the crystal structures of the CPD photolyases did not contain the substrate (9Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 10Tamada T. Kitadokoro K. Higuchi Y. Inaka K. Yasui A. de Ruiter P.E. Eker A.P. Miki K. Nat. Struct.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3875-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The C-terminal halves of the (6-4) and CPD photolyases are highly conserved. The homology of Xenopus (6-4) photolyase to E. coli CPD photolyase increases to 35.8% in this region, whereas the (6-4) photolyases share 26.5–28.5% homology withE. coli CPD photolyase in the full-length comparison (Fig.3 A). This region of E. coli CPD photolyase also contains most of the amino acids involved in the binding of the flavin cofactor, and the FAD-binding sites are well conserved in the (6-4) photolyase (Fig. 3 B). Eleven of 14 amino acids involved in FAD binding in Xenopus (6-4) photolyase are homologous, and 8 of them are identical inXenopus (6-4) photolyase. The flavin chromophore is deeply buried in the center of the C-terminal helical domain (9Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 10Tamada T. Kitadokoro K. Higuchi Y. Inaka K. Yasui A. de Ruiter P.E. Eker A.P. Miki K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This conservation indicates the structural similarity between the CPD and (6-4) photolyases. Although the proposed DNA binding residues are not very well conserved, most of the aromatic residues are conserved (Fig.3 C). Particularly, Trp291 and Trp398of the Xenopus enzyme, equivalent to Trp277 and Trp384 of E. coli photolyase, respectively, are conserved in all of the (6-4) photolyases. Trp277 and Trp384 of E. coli CPD photolyase are supposed to be located between the cofactor and the substrate (31Kim S.-T. Li Y.F. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Vande Berg B.J. Sancar G.B. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Sanders D.B. Wiest O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5127-5134Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The conservation of the FAD-binding sites and the π-systems of the aromatic residues is consistent with the fact that the (6-4) photolyase transmits a photoinduced electron from the reduced FAD to the substrate, as the CPD photolyase does. In contrast, the marked difference between the CPD and (6-4) photolyases lies in the hydrophilic residues. The substitutions from E. coli CPD photolyase to Xenopus (6-4) photolyase include Glu274 → Gln288, Asn341 → His354, Arg342 → Leu355, and Met345 → His358. Remarkably, the hydrophilicity is inverted at Leu355 and His358 in the Xenopus enzyme from the counterparts in the bacterial CPD photolyase, although these residues are conserved well in the (6-4) photolyases. We thought that these residues could confer the substrate specificity to the (6-4) photolyases. Based upon the observation described above, we selected Gln288, Trp291, His354, Leu355, His358, and Trp398 ofXenopus (6-4) photolyase as targets for alanine mutagenesis. The wild type and alanine-substituted (6-4) photolyases were prepared as fusion proteins with GST, as reported previously (14Todo T. Kim S.-T. Hitomi K. Otoshi E. Inui T. Morioka H. Kobayashi H. Ohtsuka E. Toh H. Ikenaga M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and were characterized by comparison of the absorption spectra. Production of the photolyases was monitored by the GST activity, as described under “Experimental Procedures.ȁ The alanine-substituted photolyases were produced at a level similar to that of the wild type. For all photolyases, the flavin chromophore was identified by the absorption spectrum. The enzymes exhibited a prominent peak at 450 nm with a shoulder at 470 nm, which is typical of the fully oxidized forms of flavin. These results suggested that the overall structures of the fused enzymes were intact and that the flavin binding was not perturbed in the mutants. Due to their availability, GST-fused (6-4) photolyases were used for the repair assays. The (6-4) photolyase binds the substrate independent of light and initiates the repair only upon absorbing a near UV-visible photon, as CPD photolyase does. To characterize the substrate binding of the (6-4) photolyase mutants, EMSA was performed in the dark by using the 49-mer oligonucleotide containing a single T(6-4)T photoproduct as a substrate. All of the obtained photolyases displayed an affinity for the substrate. We generated the binding isotherms of the mutants under the conditions of constant substrate and various enzyme concentrations (Fig. 4). All mutants except Leu355 showed the affinity that is comparable to wild type. In contrast, apparently, the mutation of Leu355 resulted in a large decrease in the affinity to the substrate. To study the catalysis by the mutants, we used two assays. First, we tested the photoreactivating activity of the photolyases in vitro. Fig.5 A shows the results of the restriction site susceptibility assays. The repair activity was not reduced by the mutation at either Gln288 or Leu355, whereas H358A showed a decrease in the cleaved fraction (lane 7). In addition, as revealed in the figure, the H354A mutant lost the catalytic activity (lane 5). The ratio of DNA repaired by the bulky residue mutants, histidines and tryptophans, was quantified at different times (Fig. 5 B). Removal of the π-system of Trp291 or Trp398resulted in a reduction of the activity to 2(6-4)0% of the wild type, whereas the mutation of the histidine residues had a particularly large influence on the catalysis. The H354A mutant lost the repair activity completely, and the rate of repair by the H358A mutant was only 1.5% that by the wild type enzyme. Since E. coli does not photoreverse the (6-4) pho"

J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and14Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar for reviews). One form (A) is fully capable of catalyzing the high turnover rotenone-sensitive NADH-ubiquinone reductase reaction. The other, which we operationally call as de-activated form (D) is unable to transfer electrons to the quinone acceptor but is fully capable of the reactions with artificial electron acceptors such as ferricyanide or hexaammine ruthenium (III). In the absence of the substrates (NADH and oxidized quinone) or in the presence of NADH and completely reduced ubiquinone (no turnover is permitted) the spontaneous slowly established equilibrium between A and D forms is greatly shifted to the latter. The A to D transition has extremely high activation energy (270 kJ/mol) (15Kotlyar A.B. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and does not proceed at a significant rate at temperatures below 20 °C. The D to A transition needs slow activating turnover(s) in complete NADH-ubiquinone reductase reaction and it proceeds rather rapidly at ambient temperature (t 12 ∼ 10 s at 25 °C) (16Kotlyar A.B. Sled V.D. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The rate of turnover-dependent D → A transition is decreased at alkaline pH and/or in the presence of bivalent cations (16Kotlyar A.B. Sled V.D. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A-form is insensitive to the SH-reagents whereas the D-form is specifically labeled and irreversibly inactivated by NEM and other sulfhydryl group reagents (16Kotlyar A.B. Sled V.D. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Gavrikova E.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The significance of the slow A → D transition for physiological regulation of Complex I activity and consequently for general metabolism in mitochondria remained obscure as does existence of the phenomenon itself in intact mitochondria. Some general speculative proposal on the subject has been put forward (14Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 18Maklashina E.O. Vinogradov A.D. Biochemistry ( Moscow ). 1994; 59: 1221-1226Google Scholar), although they remain speculative because no evidence for the enzyme A → D transition in situ were yet available. To our knowledge there is only one report in the literature which suggests indirectly that Ca2− sensitivity of the de-activated Complex I was the reason for a decrease of respiration rate with NAD+-linked substrates seen in intact liver mitochondria after Ca2+ load (19Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It can hardly be overemphasized that an unambiguous demonstration of any regulatory property of Complex I in intact mitochondria is extremely difficult because the inner mitochondrial membrane is not permeable to NADH and respiration of mitochondria in the presence of NAD+-linked substrates involves, besides Complex I itself, obligatory operation of the dicarboxylate transport system, particular dehydrogenase, and the downstream components of the respiratory chain. It also worth noting that Complex I in intact mitochondria, at least its matrix-protruding part, operates within rich protein environment which may or may not significantly affect the catalytic and/or regulatory properties of the enzyme. The aim of the studies reported here was 2-fold. First, we searched for a reliable experimental procedure for direct quantitative measurement of the Complex I catalytic activity in sealed mitochondria. We have used the channel-forming antibiotic alamethicin (20Fox R.O. Richards F.M. Nature. 1982; 300: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 21Marsh D. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 345-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) previously employed for unmasking several ATP-dependent enzymatic activities in sealed membraneous preparations and to reveal latent NADH oxidase activity in intact mitochondria (22Besch H.R. Jones L.R. Fleming J.W. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7905-7908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jones L.R. Maddock S.W. Besch H.R. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1992; 11: 49-58PubMed Google Scholar). The present article shows that permeabilization of mitochondria by alamethicin provides a valuable tool for measurement of the specific NADH oxidase and/or NADH-quinone reductase activities in mitochondria. The second problem we have addressed was to find out whether slow pseudo-reversible Complex I A ↔ D transition exist when the enzyme operates in the natural matrix protein environment. Having succeeded in measurement of Complex I activity in situ we were able to show that this unique property is indeed an intrinsic feature of the enzyme in mitochondria. These were isolated from trypsin-treated heart muscle (two hearts were handled for one preparation) essentially as described by Jacobus and Saks (25Jacobus W.E. Saks V.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 219: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The final precipitate of mitochondria was suspended in 0.3 msucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 0.2 mm EDTA (potassium salts, pH 7.4), and BSA (1 mg/ml) and stored in ice. The mitochondria oxidized malate/glutamate (5 mm each) in the reaction mixture comprising 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmTris/Cl−, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 6 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 8.0) at the average rate of 14 and 130 (respiratory control ratio of about 10) nanoatoms of oxygen per min per mg of protein in the absence and presence of 200 μm ADP, respectively, at 22 °C. SMP were prepared (15Kotlyar A.B. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and their NADH oxidase was activated (26Burbaev D.S. Moroz I.A. Kotlyar A.B. Sled V.D. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 254: 47-51Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as described. The uncoupled particles (in the presence of gramicidin D, 0.2 μg/ml) catalyzed the rotenone-sensitive (more than 99%) NADH oxidase reaction at the average rate of 1 μmol/min/mg of protein at 22 °C, pH 8.0. Complex I was purified according the standard procedure (27Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Its activity was determined at 38 °C in the reaction mixture containing: 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mmTris/Cl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, BSA (1 mg/ml), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaN3, 100 μm NADH, and 100 μm ubiquinone-1 (Q1) after preincubation for 20 min with soybean phospholipids (2 mg/mg of Complex I). This was prepared from the supernatant left after sonic treatment of bovine heart mitochondria during SMP preparation. The supernatant (15 ml) stored at −20 °C was thawed and diluted 2 times with cold water. 13 ml of 100 mm Tris/Cl− (pH 7.5) was added and pH of the mixture was adjusted to 6.0 with acetic acid. The slightly turbid mixture was centrifuged (30,000 × g, 30 min) to remove residual membranes, pH of clear supernatant was adjusted to 8.0 with 1 n KOH and solid ammonium sulfate was added up to 70% saturation. The mixture was left on ice for 20 min, precipitated protein was collected (30,000 × g, 30 min), suspended in 2.5 ml of 10 mm Tris/Cl− (pH 8.0), and dialyzed for 24 h against 1 liter of the same solution. The clear soluble protein fraction thus obtained was stored in liquid nitrogen. The activities were assayed at 30 °C as a decrease of absorption at 340 nm with 200 μm NADH as the substrate (oxidase) or 200 μm NADH and 100 μm ubiquinone-1 (Q1) in the presence of 1.5 mm KCN (reductase). The standard assay mixture contained: 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris/Cl− (pH 8.0), 0.2 mmpotassium EDTA, and the enzyme preparation (mitochondria or SMP (∼10 μg of protein/ml). This was assayed following cytochrome c reduction at 550 nm in the presence of 5 mm malate, 5 mm glutamate, 1.5 mm KCN, and 15 μm cytochrome c. The hypotonic assay mixture contained: 10 mmTris/Cl− (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm potassium EDTA and mitochondria (∼25 μg of protein/ml). All the activities throughout the paper are expressed as micromoles of NADH oxidized per min per mg of protein. This activity was determined as the rate of NADH oxidation in the reaction mixture containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 μm rotenone, 150 μmNADH, and 20 μm oxaloacetate. The mitochondrial preparations (∼20 mg of protein/ml) were solubilized at 0 °C by Triton X-100 (1%, w/v, 20 min) and diluted 10 times in 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). Small samples (∼2 μg of protein/ml) thus treated were added to the reaction mixture and NADH oxidation was started by the addition of oxaloacetate. The aspartate-2-oxoglutarate transaminase activity of the mitochondria solubilized by Triton X-100 was determined as the rate of NADH oxidation in the reaction mixture containing 20 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 μm rotenone, 150 μm NADH, 0.1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 0.1 mm aspartate and malate dehydrogenase (1 unit/ml). About 50 μg of the mitochondrial protein per ml was added to the assay mixture. The following procedure based on our experimental findings (see “Results”) was employed to prepare the mitochondrial preparation capable of the rotenone-sensitive oxidation of externally added NADH. Intact mitochondria (10–20 mg/ml) were diluted 20 times with the mixture comprising of 0.25 msucrose, 10 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm EDTA, BSA (1 mg/ml), 2.5 mm MgCl2, and alamethicin (40 μg/ml). The suspension was incubated at 20 °C for 5 min, diluted 2.5 times with the same cold mixture containing no MgCl2 and alamethicin, and centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 15 min. Precipitated mitochondria were suspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris/Cl− (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, and BSA (10 mg/ml), and stored in ice during the experiments. The protein content was determined with biuret reagent (28Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.S. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as the standard. NADH, NADPH, NAD+, EDTA, Tris, Hepes, BSA, malic acid, glutamic acid, l-aspartate, 2-oxoglutarate, ADP, Q1 (C-7956, Lot 117H32541), cytochrome c, and NEM were from Sigma. Malate dehydrogenase was from “Reanal” (Hungary). Alamethicin was a kind gift from Dr. S. Kotelevtzev (Laboratory of Physico-chemical membranology, School of Biology, Moscow State University). Intact rat heart mitochondria prepared by a mild isolation procedure as compared with other reductase preparations were used to study the effects of alamethicin on permeability of their inner membranes for the respiratory substrates. TableI demonstrates that besides expected uncoupling effect on Δμ̃H+-controlled respiration (state 4), alamethicin drastically potentiated the rotenone-sensitive oxidation of externally added NADH. Remarkably, alamethicin did not affect the NADH-Q1 reductase activities of inside-out SMP, and that of the detergent-solubilized purified preparation of Complex I. When alamethicin-induced NADH oxidation was followed by spectrophotometric techniques in the standard Mg2+-free reaction mixtures routinely employed to assay NADH oxidase we noted that the stimulatory effect of the antibiotic on NADH oxidation was time-dependent and much less pronounced than that shown in Table I. Further inspection has revealed that the presence of Mg2+ was needed for rapid and effective channel forming activity of alamethicin in mitochondria. At pH 8.0 the stimulatory effect of alamethicin was saturated at Mg2+ concentration of 2.5 mm; this value was independent of antibiotic concentration. After NADH oxidation was induced by alamethicin in the presence of Mg2+ subsequent removal of the cation by the addition of EDTA did not affect NADH oxidase (the results are not shown). When different alamethicin concentrations were used for permeabilization of mitochondria the strong cooperativity of its channel forming activity was found (Fig.1). Although Mg2+ was found to promote the effect of alamethicin, further washing of alamethicin-treated mitochondria in Mg2+-free medium did not reverse the permeabilization and mitochondria thus treated retained their NADH oxidase activity with externally added NADH. Thus, a simple procedure for preparation of NADH-permeable mitochondria as described under “Materials and Methods” has been worked out.Table IEffect of alamethicin on several oxidoreductase activities catalysed by the mitochondrial preparations different degree of resolutionPreparation and reactionSpecific activity− Alamethicin+ Alamethicin (30 μg/ml)μmol per min per mgIntact rat heart mitochondriaSuccinate oxidase0.030.16Succinate oxidase (+ FCCP, 1 μm)0.15NADH oxidase0.020.62NADH oxidase (+ FCCP, 1 μm)0.020.62NADH oxidase (+ rotenone, 5 μm)0.03Bovine heart SMPNADH-Q1 reductase (+ FCCP, 1 μm)0.600.58NADH-Q1 reductase (+ FCCP, 1 μm + rotenone, 5 μm)0.050.05Complex INADH-Q1 reductase2.342.42Oxidase activities of intact rat heart mitochondria were measured as the respiration rates with oxygen-sensitive electrode in the medium containing 0.12 m sucrose, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4.

Open table in a new tab Oxidase activities of intact rat heart mitochondria were measured as the respiration rates with oxygen-sensitive electrode in the medium containing 0.12 m sucrose, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Oxidation of NADH by SMP and Complex I was measured as described (see “Materials and Methods”) in the standard reaction mixture in the presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2. It was of interest to know whether the matrix proteins are retained in alamethicin-treated mitochondria. This was verified by measuring several enzymatic activities which requires the enzymes located in matrix. Table II shows that alamethicin-treated washed mitochondria lost their endogenous NAD+ whereas the preparation significantly retained their malate dehydrogenase and transaminase. The specific cytochromec reductase activity (0.08) in the presence of added NAD+ was close to that found in the standard polarographic experiments (0.130) at State 3 (see “Materials and Methods”). It should be noted that the hypotonic reaction mixture was used for the cytochrome c reductase activity assay to provide accessibility of the inner membrane for added cytochrome c; thus quantitative comparison of the NADH oxidase and cytochromec reductase activities is to be taken only as an approximation. The specific activities of malate dehydrogenase and transaminase were decreased in the alamethicin-treated preparations. This was not unexpected, because alamethicin pore is not specific and permeable for large cations and anions (29Hanke W. Boheim G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 596: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus alamethicin induces swelling of mitochondlia which can change the permeability of the inner membrane and disruption of the outer membrane (30Das M.K. Basu A. Balarm P. Biochem. Int. 1985; 11: 357-363PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIEnzymatic activities of intact and alamethicine-treated rat heart mitochondriaEnzymeSpecific activityIntact mitochondriaAlamethicin-treated mitochondriaμmol per min per mgMalate-cytochrome c reductase− NAD+0.03<0.01+ NAD+ (100 μm)0.040.08Aspartate-2-oxoglutarate transaminase0.60.34Malate dehydrogenase27.017.2The figures correspond to the specific activities of the representative samples determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” No special attempts were made to reveal full catalytic activities by variation of the substrate concentrations, ionic composition, and pH of the assay medium. Thus, the data should be considered as to demonstrate the retention of some matrix located enzymes in alamethicin-treated mitochondria only.

Thus, the data should be considered as to demonstrate the retention of some matrix located enzymes in alamethicin-treated mitochondria only. The results presented above showed that alamethicin-treated mitochondria can be used for assay of the specific in situComplex I activity. It was of interest to compare the kinetic properties of the mitochondrial enzyme which is exposed to a number of matrix proteins with those previously reported for inside-out SMP (7Vinogradov A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the concentration dependence of the initial reaction rates on ubiquinone homologue Q1and NADH which were essentially the same as those for SMP. Pronounced inhibition of the NADH-Q1 reductase activity at high concentrations of Q1 (Fig. 2 A) was variable and dependent on the particular sample of the commercially obtained quinone. This phenomenon presumably is due to some unidentified inhibitory contaminants and merits further investigation. It should be noted, however, that with one particular sample of Q1 the same kinetic behavior was always seen for inside-out SMP and alamethicin-treated mitochondria. The standard kinetic parameters of the rotenone-sensitive NADH-Q1 reductase activity for alamethicin-treated mitochondria and those for inside-out SMP are summarized in Table III. The catalytic turnover numbers for different preparations were calculated using the values for the enzyme content determined as the minimal amount of piericidin, the specific irreversible inhibitor of Complex I (31Hall C. Wu M. Crane F.L. Takahashi H. Tamura S. Folker K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 25: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Horgan D.J. Ohno H. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5967-5976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), needed to block the activities. The very close turnover numbers andKm values thus obtained for mitochondria and SMP preparations suggest that the enzyme in sealed mitochondria behaves as its active sites would be freely accessible for the substrates and that the matrix located proteins do not affect the catalytic activity of Complex I. Slightly lower enzyme turnover number in rat heart mitochondria may be due to species difference.Table IIIKinetic parameters of NADH-Q1 reductase reaction catalyzed by Complex I in sealed mitochondria and inside-out submitochondrial particlesPreparationComplex I contentTurnover numberK mQ1K mNADHnmol per mg of proteins−1μmRat heart mitochondria0.154059Bovine heart mitochondria0.1153Bovine heart SMP0.2050107Complex I content and the respective turnover numbers were calculated as piericidine “titer.” The latter was determined as the intersection points from the linear graphs: the residual activityversus amount of the inhibitor added; the activities were determined after prolonged (20 min, 30 °C) preincubation of the enzyme preparations with piericidine. Open table in a new tab Complex I content and the respective turnover numbers were calculated as piericidine “titer.” The latter was determined as the intersection points from the linear graphs: the residual activityversus amount of the inhibitor added; the activities were determined after prolonged (20 min, 30 °C) preincubation of the enzyme preparations with piericidine. The differences in catalytic properties of A and D forms of Complex I summarized in the Introduction provide at least two simple diagnostic criteria for their relative content in any particular preparation: one is the sensitivity of NADH-quinone reductase to the sulfhydryl group reagents; the other is a lag-phase in the catalytic activity which is seen as inhibition of the enzyme by divalent cations at alkaline pH. Both tests were employed in further studies of alamethicin-treated mitochondria. Fig.3 shows the effect of Mg2+ on time course of NADH oxidation at different pH in thermally de-activated mitochondria. At pH 7.0 about 40% inhibition of the reaction rate by Mg2+ was observed. The inhibitory effect of Mg2+ was significantly increased at pH 9.0. Note, that the rates of NADH oxidation in the absence of Mg2+ were the same at pH 7.0 and 9.0. These results are in accord with the previously reported kinetics of NADH oxidation by the D-form of Complex I in SMP (16Kotlyar A.B. Sled V.D. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the experiments depicted in Fig.4 the sensitivity of NADH oxidation to NEM was compared for thermally de-activated mitochondria (A) and the same preparation prepulsed with NADH to reactivate the enzyme (B). Thus, qualitatively, permeabilized mitochondria show both characteristic features of the enzyme A ↔ D transition. To get further insight into quantitative characteristics of the enzyme transition, we examined the time course of its irreversible inhibition by NEM in mitochondria and SMP treated under various conditions (Fig.5). At 20 °C activated SMP and intact and permeabilized mitochondria as isolated were resistant to prolonged (20–40 min) NEM treatment (closed circles andsquares, no detectable de-activation of the enzyme occurs at this temperature). In contrast at 37 °C, the enzyme was rapidly (t 12 ∼ 2 min) inactivated by NEM in both preparations (open circles and squares). Remarkably, exactly the same rates of NEM-induced inactivation were found for bovine heart SMP and rat heart mitochondria. It seemed conceivable that the dramatic difference between the inactivation seen at different temperatures might be due to the temperature dependence of the sulfhydryl group(s) alkylation reaction. However, this was not the case as evident from the experiments where the preparation was first de-activated at 37 °C, and then treated with NEM at 20 °C: rapid inhibition was observed (Fig. 5, closed triangles). Thus, the time dependence of the inhibition by NEM at 37 °C was evidently due to the time dependence of the enzyme de-activation. Moreover, when mitochondria were partially de-activated by incubation at 37 °C for limited periods of time as indicated on the abscissa in Fig.5 and further treated with NEM at 20 °C for 2 min (the time needed to inhibit completely de-activated enzyme at this temperature), the points (open triangles) corresponding to the residual activity thus revealed perfectly fit the curve characteristic for the time-dependent inhibition by NEM at 37 °C.Figure 4Inhibition of de-activated Complex I in mitochondria by NEM. Mitochondria were de-activated as described in the legend to Fig. 3, and preincubated in the standard NADH-Q1 assay mixture containing 2 mm NEM (where indicated) for 2 min (A) before the reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 μm NADH (indicated by the arrows). B, the same as A except de-activated mitochondria were pulsed with 10 μm NADH (1 min) before preincubation in the assay mixture with NEM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Irreversible inhibition of Complex I in mitochondria and submitochondrial particles by NEM as a function of active/de-active enzyme transition. Permeabilized mitochondria (1.6 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C (○) or 20 °C (●) in the presence of 2 mm NEM in the standard NADH-Q1assay mixture (NADH and Q1 were omitted) for the time indicated on the abscissa. Small aliquots were withdrawn from the samples and their NADH-Q1 reductase activity was determined in the presence of 200 μm NADH and 100 μm Q1. The same experiments were done at 37 °C (■) and 20 °C (▪) for fully activated SMP. ▵, mitochondria were first preincubated at 37 °C in the absence of NEM for the times incubated on the abscissa, then the suspension was cooled down to 20 °C, 2 mm NEM was added, incubation was continued for 2 min, and the residual NADH-Q1 reductase activity was assayed. ▴, SMP were first thermally de-activated (37 °C, 15 min) and then treated with 2 mm NEM at 20 °C as described for ▪. 100% of the activities correspond to 0.45 and 0.7 μmol of NADH oxidized per min/mg of protein for mitochondria and SMP, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Another approach for modeling of in situ Complex I A ↔ D transition was to see the effect of crude matrix protein fractions on the slow interconversions of the enzyme forms in inside-out SMP. No effects of added matrix fraction (3.3 mg/ml) on the thermally induced de-activation or on NADH-induced reactivation were found. In contrast to NEM, oxidized glutathione (5 mm) had no effect on the D-form of Complex I in SMP (nonenzymatic thiol-disulfide exchange reaction) or in the presence of matrix proteins (possible enzyme-catalyzed exchange reaction, the results are not shown). When the steady-state oxidation of the Krebs cycle substrates was reconstituted in the model system by the addition of malate plus glutamate and NAD+, the “turnover conditions” drastically prevented the enzyme de-activation even after incubation of the samples at 37 °C as long as 20 min (Fig.6). The activity of mitochondrial Complex I is of great importance for cell physiology because the enzyme serves as the main collector of reducing equivalents derived from Krebs cycle substrates and modulation of the enzyme activity is expected to influence the energetic status of any aerobic cell. Despite widespread interest in the functional state of the enzyme at the cellular level the lack of simple and reliable methods for the quantitative determination of its activity in intact mitochondria greatly hampered the progress in several areas of bioenergetics, especially in those of medical importance since a number of diseases are believed to be associated with some defects in Complex I (33Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 34Schapira A.H.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It is a general practice in mitochondriology to correlate respiratory activity in the presence of NAD-dependent dehydrogenase-linked substrates with the catalytic activity of Complex I. Depending on the particular tissue and/or on a number of factors hard to control such as intactness of the mitochondrial membranes, deficiency in nicotinamide nucleotides, specific activities of dicarboxylate translocases and dehydrogenases, such correlation may or may not be judicious. An obvious way to overcome an uncertainty in the specific Complex I activity in mitochondria might be to use a detergent to abolish the permeability barrier for NADH. However, the ubiquinone reductase activity of Complex I has been shown to be extremely sensitive to a number of lipophilic compounds including detergents (35Batayneh N. Kopacz S.J. Lee C.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 476-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 36Ushakova A.V. Grivennikova V.G. Ohnishi T. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Trans. 1999; 27: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), as can be illustrated by strong inhibition of the enzyme by Triton X-100 (36Ushakova A.V. Grivennikova V.G. Ohnishi T. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The permeabilization of intact mitochondria by alamethicin provides a simple procedure for reliable quantitative assay of Complex I without any interference with the substrate translocases and dehydrogenases. Indeed, the kinetic parameters of fully active Complex I in sealed rat heart and bovine heart mitochondria as reported here are very similar to those determined for inside-out SMP (TableIII). Another possible important application of alamethicin-induced permeabilization is its use for qualitative and quantitative determination of a heterogenity of sealed membraneous preparations of Complex I such as submitochondrial or sub-bacterial particles. No stimulation of the NADH-Q1 reductase activity in SMP was found (Table I), thus suggesting that no enzymatically active right-side out particles are present in the preparations routinely used in our laboratory (15Kotlyar A.B. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In contrast, considerable stimulation of the uncoupled NADH oxidase reaction by alamethicin was found for the preparations obtained from Paracoccus denitrificanscells 2V. G. Grivennikova, N. V. Zakharova, and A. D. Vinogradov, unpublished observation. which is in accord with the previously reported stimulation by bee venom of NADH oxidation by P. denitrificans subbacterial particles (38Burnell J.N. John P.

The disadvantage of using alamethicin for the specific assay of Complex I is obvious impossibility of measuring the enzyme activity in energized mitochondria, thus possible Δμ̃H+-dependent rapid modulation of Complex I remains to be a “black box.” Also it should be pointed out that partial or complete loss of some small proteins or other unknown substances from the matrix after treatment of mitochondria with alamethicin cannot be ruled out (Table II). Two diagnostic tests: Mg2+ susceptibility at alkaline pH and NEM sensitivity showed that mitochondrial proteins which are in direct contact with the matrix-exposed part of the enzyme do not protect Complex I against A ↔ D transition and strengthen our hypothesis on the physiological relevance of this phenomenon. An obvious question arises: what are the possible physiological conditions which may lead to the de-activation of Complex I in vivo? It seems unlikely that D-form is present in vivo when Complex I catalyzes the steady-state NADH oxidation (Fig. 6). However, rapid de-activation is expected under strong hypoxic or anoxic conditions when the enzyme turnover is prohibited. An important point for the discussion of such a scenario is that reactivation of the de-activated enzyme is a very slow process in the presence of divalent cations. The millimolar free Mg2+ (39Jung D.W. Panzeter E. Baysal K. Brierley G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and variable high concentrations of Ca2+ (19Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Bioenerg.

Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar) are present in the mitochondrial matrix. Thus Complex I is expected to stay in D-form for a long time after reoxygenation. In addition to the adverse effects that result from de-energization of mitochondria during anoxia, further adverse effects are anticipated following re-oxygenation because the D-form is unable to transfer electrons to ubiquinone but can reduce oxygen directly producing large amounts of superoxide. It is well established that D-form by all the parameters studied so far (14Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) is equivalent to the rotenone-inhibited enzyme and rotenone was reported to activate superoxide generation by Complex I (41Turrens J.F.

However, certain fatty acids and their derivatives can also act as endogenous ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor that positively modulates insulin sensitivity. To clarify the effects of externally delivered fatty acids on glucose uptake in an insulin-responsive cell type, we systematically examined the effects of a range of fatty acids on glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Of the fatty acids examined, arachidonic acid (AA) had the greatest positive effects, significantly increasing basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 1.8- and 2-fold, respectively, with effects being maximal at 4 h at which time membrane phospholipid content of AA was markedly increased. The effects of AA were sensitive to the inhibition of protein synthesis but were unrelated to changes in membrane fluidity. AA had no effect on total cellular levels of glucose transporters, but significantly increased levels of GLUT1 and GLUT4 at the plasma membrane. While the effects of AA were insensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibition, the lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, substantially blocked the AA effect on basal glucose uptake. Furthermore, adenoviral expression of a dominant-negative PPARγ mutant attenuated the AA potentiation of basal glucose uptake. Thus, AA potentiates basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by a cyclooxygenase-independent mechanism that increases the levels of both GLUT1 and GLUT4 at the plasma membrane. These effects are at least partly dependent onde novo protein synthesis, an intact lipoxygenase pathway and the activation of PPARγ with these pathways having a greater role in the absence than in the presence of insulin.

Free fatty acids are considered to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and may be involved in the early events leading to insulin resistance in man (2Boden G.

The Lancet. 1963; April 13: 785-789Abstract Scopus (3719) Google Scholar) demonstrated that oxidation of fatty acids could inhibit glucose oxidation through the effects of acetyl-CoA on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. More recently it has been shown that increased delivery of free fatty acids in vivo can impair insulin-mediated glucose disposal through inhibition of glucose uptake (4Boden G. Chen X. Ruiz J.

Furthermore, several long chain fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated, have been demonstrated to decrease mRNA levels of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in vitro (8Long S.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1138-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Insulin sensitivity in whole animals can also be influenced by the manipulation of the dietary fatty acid profile. A diet high in saturated, monounsaturated (n-9) or polyunsaturated (n-6) fatty acids (PUFA)1 leads to insulin resistance in rodents (9Storlien L.H. Kraegen E.W. Chisholm D.J. Ford G.L. Bruce D.G.

Diabetes. 1991; 40: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Substituting a small percentage of fatty acids in the n-6 PUFA diet with n-3 PUFA normalizes insulin action (9Storlien L.H.

However, in both humans and rodents, PUFA (particularly n-3) levels in skeletal muscle membrane phospholipids are positively correlated with insulin sensitivity (10Storlien L.H. Jenkins A.B.

Interest in these activities has been greatly enhanced by the recent recognition of the importance of the nuclear hormone receptor PPARγ in the control of insulin sensitivity (14Auwerx J.

Commun. 1981; 103: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) originally reported that exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to certain unsaturated fatty acids during differentiation could enhance basal glucose uptake. These workers suggested that relatively nonspecific effects on membrane fluidity might underlie these effects. More recently, a similar effect on basal glucose uptake has been observed in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes supplemented with the n-6 PUFA, arachidonic acid (AA) (31Tebbey P.W. McGowan K.M. Stephens J.M. Buttke T.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 639-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Fong J.C. Chen C.C. Liu D. Chai S.P. Tu M.S. Chu K.Y. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In light of recent advances in the understanding of the possible roles of lipid mediators in the control of glucose homeostasis we have re-examined the effects of a range of fatty acids on glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Having established that AA had the most marked effects on enhancement of glucose disposal we have attempted to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects.DISCUSSIONA role for fatty acids in the modulation of insulin sensitivityin vivo and in vitro is well established (11Storlien L.H. Baur L.A. Kriketos A.D. Pan D.A. Cooney G.J. Jenkins A.B. Calvert G.D. Campbell L.V. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), although the precise nature of the mechanisms underlying these effects is unknown. The recently established fact that certain fatty acids and their metabolites can act as endogenous ligands for the nuclear hormone receptor PPARγ provides a potential mechanism (15Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we investigated the effect of a range of fatty acids on glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Having established that AA had the most marked effect on the enhancement of glucose uptake, we have attempted to dissect the molecular events underlying this effect. Our studies have found that 4 h of exposure to AA potentiates basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by increasing levels of GLUT1 and GLUT4 at the plasma membrane. The potentiation of glucose uptake is independent of cyclooxygenase but at least partly dependent on an intact lipoxygenase pathway, de novo protein synthesis, and PPARγ activation. Our results also suggest that the molecular mechanisms whereby AA potentiates basal versusinsulin-stimulated glucose uptake may differ slightly.The systematic study of the effects of various fatty acids on glucose uptake in adipocytes was first reported by Grunfeld et al.(30Grunfeld C. Baird K.L. Kahn C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These workers showed that incubation of 3T3-L1 cells, during the process of differentiation, with a range of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids increased basal glucose uptake. Saturated fatty acids decreased insulin-stimulated uptake, whereas monounsaturated fatty acids had no effect. Our studies investigated the effect of 10 mainly polyunsaturated, fatty acids on glucose uptake in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Differentiated cells were used to eliminate confounding effects of fatty acids on the adipogenic process itself. In agreement with Grunfeld et al. (30Grunfeld C. Baird K.L. Kahn C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) there appeared to be a relatively nonspecific effect of all fatty acids to increase basal glucose uptake. However, all fatty acids studied, except the saturated palmitic acid (16:0), increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and this effect did not appear to be specific to fatty acid series. The most marked effects on glucose uptake were observed with AA, which increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake at all time points studied. Two previous studies have shown a similar effect of AA on basal glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fonget al. (32Fong J.C. Chen C.C. Liu D. Chai S.P. Tu M.S. Chu K.Y. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) observed an increased basal glucose uptake with 0.2 mm AA at all time points from 1 to 8 h (32Fong J.C. Chen C.C. Liu D. Chai S.P. Tu M.S. Chu K.Y. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, Tebbey et al. (31Tebbey P.W. McGowan K.M. Stephens J.M. Buttke T.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 639-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported such an effect with 50 μm AA following 24 and 72 h incubation. Neither study, however, observed a significant effect of AA on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Consistent with the observations of Fong et al. (32Fong J.C. Chen C.C. Liu D. Chai S.P. Tu M.S. Chu K.Y. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the potentiating effects of 8 h exposure to AA on glucose uptake were partially inhibited by cycloheximide, we found that the effects of 4 h of AA were also sensitive to the inhibition of protein synthesis suggesting the involvement of a rapidly synthesized protein intermediate in the mediation of this response.Having established the effect of AA on glucose uptake, we examined whether this was mediated through increased expression or altered cellular location of glucose transporters. Previous studies have demonstrated a decrease in total cellular and plasma membrane GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes supplemented with AA for 24 and 48 h (31Tebbey P.W. McGowan K.M. Stephens J.M. Buttke T.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 639-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Long S.D. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1138-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Conversely, 3T3-L1 adipocytes supplemented with AA for 8 and 48 h exhibited increased total cellular and plasma membrane levels of GLUT1 (32Fong J.C. Chen C.C. Liu D. Chai S.P. Tu M.S. Chu K.Y. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Tebbey P.W. McGowan K.M. Stephens J.M. Buttke T.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 639-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect was not, however, observed with 2 h AA incubation (32Fong J.C. Chen C.C. Liu D. Chai S.P. Tu M.S. Chu K.Y. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In our experiments, 4 h AA incubation had no effect on total cellular levels of GLUT1 or GLUT4. However, a highly significant increase in the plasma membrane levels of both transporters, in the absence and presence of insulin was observed. Thus AA appears to enhance either the translocation of both major adipocyte glucose transporters to the plasma membrane or reduce their rate of internalization.It has been suggested that fatty acids may have nonspecific effects on cellular membranes which could secondarily alter the intrinsic activity of transmembrane glucose transporters (12Borkman M. Storlien L.H. Pan D.A. Jenkins A.B. Chisholm D.J. Campbell L.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 30Grunfeld C. Baird K.L. Kahn C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In particular, alterations in the fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids can affect membrane fluidity (45Stubbs C.D. Smith A.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 779-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It was unclear, however, whether as short an exposure as 4 h would be sufficient to lead to such changes in plasma membrane composition. We observed that, within 4 h, at least half of the available AA had entered the cells and that there was a highly significant increase in the AA content of membrane phospholipids. However, this did not have any discernible effect on membrane fluidity. Therefore, although we have not excluded an effect of AA on the intrinsic activity of membrane glucose transporters any such effect is unlikely to be mediated by changes in membrane fluidity.Arachidonic acid is capable of being metabolized by both the cyclooxygenase and the lipoxygenase enzyme systems. The resulting metabolites have been implicated in the control of a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Inhibitors of the individual enzyme systems were employed to examine which, if either, of these systems was involved in the generation of an AA metabolite that might mediate the effects on glucose uptake. Cyclooxygenase, or prostaglandin H synthase, catalyzes the conversion of AA to the prostanoids and the thromboxanes. The enzyme exists as two isozymes, COX1, which is constitutively expressed, and COX2, which is inducible (40Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). We inhibited the COX enzyme activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes for 30 min prior to addition of AA using ibuprofen (nonselective), piroxicam (COX1), or 6-MNA (COX2). None of these compounds inhibited the AA potentiation of either basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in our system, despite the demonstration that the COX enzyme activity had indeed been inhibited. These results contrast with those of Fong et al. (46Fong J.C. Chen C.C. Liu D. Tu M.S. Chai S.P. Kao Y.S. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) who reported that indomethacin (a nonselective COX inhibitor) inhibited the 8-h AA potentiation of basal glucose uptake. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear but may be explained by the differing experimental conditions of the two studies, specifically the time points and particular COX inhibitors studied. Several groups have demonstrated that certain COX metabolites of AA, particularly the J series of prostaglandins, can activate PPARγ in vitro and could therefore act as endogenous ligands (21Yu K.

Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). Our results would suggest that the AA potentiation of glucose uptake is not mediated via the action of a COX metabolite on PPARγ. However, the involvement of PPARγ in mediating the AA effect on glucose uptake is not excluded. It is possible that other metabolites, or AA itself, could act as PPARγ activators in this system. It should also be noted that COX inhibitors themselves have also been demonstrated to act as ligands at PPARγ (47Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Oliver B.B. Ringold G.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3406-3410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Ibuprofen was shown to induce PPARγ activity 20-fold at 10−4m but piroxicam had a negligible effect. The effects of 6-MNA have not been reported.Lipoxygenase enzymes catalyze the conversion of AA to the leukotrienes and the hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. The enzyme exists as three isozymes, 5-LOX, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX. We inhibited the LOX enzyme activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes for 30 min prior to addition of AA using NDGA, a nonselective LOX inhibitor. We observed a significant inhibition of the AA potentiation of basal glucose uptake with NDGA. Furthermore, there was a trend for NDGA to inhibit the AA potentiation of insulin-stimulated uptake. These results suggest that a LOX metabolite(s) of AA may be involved in its effect on glucose uptake. Indeed, it has been shown that the 15-LOX metabolites of both AA and linoleic acid, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, respectively, can function as micromolar PPARγ agonists (29Nagy L.

To investigate the role of PPARγ in our system, we inhibited endogenous activity by transducing fully differentiated adipocytes with a dominant-negative hPPARγ mutant receptor. This mutant form of hPPARγ has previously been shown to inhibit co-transfected wild-type receptor action and to inhibit the thiazolidinedione-induced differentiation of human pre-adipocytes (36Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M. Agostini M. Adams M. Collingwood T.N. Provenzano C. Browne P.O. Rajanayagam O. Burris T.P. Schwabe J.W. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5754-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the transduced hPPARγ mutant receptor was highly expressed in murine 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and adipocytes and inhibited endogenous wild-type activity. We then showed that the AA potentiation of basal glucose uptake was partially, but significantly, inhibited in cells transduced with the mutant receptor. There was, however, no significant effect of the mutant receptor on the AA potentiation of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. These results suggest that PPARγ activation is at least partly required for the AA effect on glucose uptake. While the dominant-negative mutant is clearly capable of specifically inhibiting PPARγ function some caveats of this system should be mentioned. First, although high levels of infectivity were observed, 3T3-L1 adipocytes are notoriously difficult to transduce with high efficiency using adenoviruses and full inhibition of PPARγ function in all cells may not have been achieved. It is also theoretically possible that this dominant-negative mutant might, at high concentrations, occupy and inhibit transcription through response elements other than the true native peroxisome proliferator response elements. Such effects, however, have not actually been demonstrated.In summary, we have undertaken the most comprehensive study to date of the effects of free fatty acids on basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in an insulin-responsive cell type. The potentiating effects of even short-term exposure to AA are at least partially dependent on new protein synthesis and involve enhanced expression of both GLUT1 and GLUT4 at the plasma membrane. While activation of PPARγ appears to be necessary, particularly in the absence of insulin, this does not appear to involve cyclooxygenase metabolites of AA but, somewhat surprisingly, our results suggest a greater role for lipoxygenase metabolites in the mediation of this important metabolic effect. A full understanding of the control of glucose homeostasis and its dysregulation in diabetes mellitus will require a better comprehension of the integration of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (1McGarry J.D. Science. 1992; 258: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Free fatty acids are considered to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and may be involved in the early events leading to insulin resistance in man (2Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The classic studies of Randle and colleagues (3Randle P.J. Hales C.N. Garland P.B. Newsholme E.A. The Lancet. 1963; April 13: 785-789Abstract Scopus (3719) Google Scholar) demonstrated that oxidation of fatty acids could inhibit glucose oxidation through the effects of acetyl-CoA on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. More recently it has been shown that increased delivery of free fatty acids in vivo can impair insulin-mediated glucose disposal through inhibition of glucose uptake (4Boden G. Chen X. Ruiz J.

The ADP-ribose at Asn-41 results in functional inactivation of Rho reflected by disaggregation of the actin cytoskeleton. We report on a new C3-like transferase produced by a pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus strain. The transferase designated C3Stau was cloned from the genomic DNA. At the amino acid level, C3Stau revealed an identity of 35% to C3 from C. botulinum and Clostridium limosumexoenzyme, respectively, and of 78% to EDIN from S. aureus. In addition to RhoA, which is the target of the other C3-like transferases, C3Stau modified RhoE and Rnd3. RhoE was ADP-ribosylated at Asn-44, which is equivalent to Asn-41 of RhoA. RhoE and Rnd3 are members of the Rho subfamily, which are deficient in intrinsic GTPase activity and possess a RhoA antagonistic cell function. The protein substrate specificity found with recombinant Rho proteins was corroborated by expression of RhoE in Xenopus laevis oocytes showing that RhoE was also modified in vivo by C3Stau but not by C3 from C. botulinum. The poor cell accessibility of C3Stau was overcome by generation of a chimeric toxin recruiting the cell entry machinery of C. botulinum C2 toxin. The chimeric C3Stau caused the same morphological and cytoskeletal changes as the chimeric C. botulinum C3. C3Stauis a new member of the family of the C3-like transferases but is also the prototype of a subfamily of RhoE/Rnd modifying transferases."
https://openalex.org/W2312753022,"Epidemiological studies have suggested that the consumption of fruits and vegetables that provide several classes of compounds, including Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), may have chemopreventive activity against breast cancer. Several in vitro and in vivo animal studies also provide convincing evidence for the anti-tumor activity of I3C, however, the molecular mechanism(s) by which I3C exerts its biological effects on breast cancer cells has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of I3C in Her-2/neu over-expressing MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells and compared these results with parental cells transfected with control vector. We focused our investigation in elucidating the molecular mechanism(s) by which I3C induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Our data show that I3C inhibits breast cancer cell growth in a dose dependent manner in Her-2/neu over-expressing and in normal Her-2/neu expressing cells. Induction of apoptosis was also observed in these cell lines when treated with I3C, as measured by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 activation. In addition, we found that I3C up-regulates Bax, down-regulates Bcl-2 and, thereby, increased the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 favoring apoptosis. These results suggest that the alteration in the expression of these genes may play an important role in mediating the biological effects of I3C. Moreover, we also show the cellular localization of Bax by confocal microscopy, which showed diffuse distribution of Bax throughout the cytoplasmic compartment in breast cancer cells in control culture. However, in I3C treated cells, Bax showed a punctate pattern of distribution that was localized in the mitochondria. From these results, we conclude that the over-expression and translocation of Bax to mitochondria causes mitochondrial depolarization and activation of caspases, which may be one of the mechanism(s) by which I3C induces apoptotic processes in I3C treated breast cancer cells. Overall, our present data provide a novel molecular mechanism(s) by which I3C elicits its biological effects on both Her-2/neu over-expressing and with normal Her-2/neu expressing breast cancer cells, suggesting that I3C could be an effective agent in inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells."

In this paper, we establish a genotoxic mechanism for γ-OH-PdG in E. coliand describe the processing of this adduct in bacterial cells. We have developed a novel experimental approach that allows us to explore cellular responses to DNA adducts at a mechanistic level (23Pandya G.A. Yang I.-Y. Grollman A.P. Moriya M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The plasmid vector used in this study employs strand-specific markers tagged with mismatches. An oligonucleotide containing a single DNA adduct is incorporated into heteroduplex (HD) DNA containing short stretches of mismatches at several locations. The modified DNA is introduced into mismatch repair-deficient hosts, and adduct-related events are measured. Progeny plasmid are analyzed for their marker sequences. Linkage analysis of marker sequences allows us to group progeny according to in vivo processing events, including excision repair, translesion DNA synthesis, and recombination repair. Restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England BioLabs. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and polymerase chain reaction-grade dNTPs were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. The 3′→5′-exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment (KF exo−) was purified from E. coli CJ374 containing pCJ141, an expression vector (gift from C. Joyce, Yale University), as described previously (24Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1830-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The synthesis of oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing γ-OH-PdG or 1,N 2-(1,3-propano)-2′-deoxyguanosine (PdG) (IV in Fig. 1) has been described previously (25Khullar S. Varaprasad C.V. Johnson F. J.

Oligonucleotides containing the precursor of γ-OH-PdG (N 2-[3,4-dihydroxybutyl] dG) or PdG were purified twice by high pressure liquid chromatography using a Waters μBondapak C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm) and acetonitrile in 100 mm triethylammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.8, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with the dimethoxytrityl group (DMT) on and off. The acetonitrile gradient was 16–33% with DMT-on DNA and 0–20% with DMT-off DNA and applied over 40 min. To generate γ-OH-PdG, oligonucleotides containingN 2-[3,4-dihydroxybutyl] dG were incubated in 100 mm sodium periodate for >6 h at room temperature (25Khullar S. Varaprasad C.V. Johnson F. J. Medicinal Chem. 1999; 42: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). γ-OH-PdG-containing oligonucleotides were separated from the parental oligonucleotides by high pressure liquid chromatography as described above for DMT-off DNA. All oligonucleotides were subjected to electrophoresis in a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. Bands were detected by UV shadowing. Oligonucleotides were excised from the gel then purified over a Sep-Pak column (Waters). Purified oligonucleotides were subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry analysis. The results were as follows: 13-mer with γ-OH-PdG m/z: observed, 3901.8 ± 0.47; calculated, 3901.6; 28-mer with γ-OH-PdGm/z: observed, 8510.15 ± 0.23; calculated, 8509.6; and 28-mer with PdG m/z: observed, 8494.37 ± 0.58; calculated, 8493.6. E. coli strains used are shown in Table I; MO strains were constructed by P1 transduction (27Miller J.H.

These plasmids differ in DNA sequence at three regions but are otherwise identical; hence, HD DNA prepared from these plasmids contains three mismatched regions (see Fig. 3). A mismatched region involving a BamHI site is located 150 nucleotides upstream from the adduct site, the others, containing NheI and SpeI/AatII sites, are located ∼220 and 3100 nucleotides, respectively, downstream from the adduct (see Fig. 3). As described later, these mismatches serve as strand-specific markers.Table IE. coli strainsStrainRelevant genotypeSource and/or referenceAB1157EGSC 1-aE. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale, CT.AB1886As AB1157, butuvrA6EGSCES1481mutS215∷Tn10EGSC, (33Siegel E.C.

Open table in a new tab The scheme for this construction is shown in Fig.2. Detailed procedures have been described previously (19Levine R.L. Yang I.-Y. Hossain M. Pandya G.A. Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4098-4104PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, double-stranded (ds) pA was digested with EcoRV (Step I), and the linearized plasmid DNA was ligated to a blunt-ended duplex 13-mer, 5′-d(AGGTACGTAGGAG)/ 3′-d(TCCATGCATCCTC), containing aSnaBI site (5′-TACGTA) (Step II). Two constructs, each containing a single insert with opposite orientation, were isolated; one of these, pA106, was used in this study. Single-stranded (ss) pA106 was mixed with EcoRV-digested ds pS (Steps III and IV), treated with NaOH to denature ds pS, then neutralized to form ds DNA. Circular ss pA106 and its complementary strand (derived from ds pS) were annealed to form HD DNA containing a 13-nucleotide gap. An unmodified or modified 13-mer (3′-d(TCCATAXCTCCTC), where X is dG or γ-OH-PdG) phosphorylated at the 5′-termini using T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATP, was annealed into the gap and ligated by T4 DNA ligase. The 13-mers are not fully complementary to the gap sequence, because they form mismatches at and adjacent (5′ and 3′) to the adduct site (Fig. 3). These mismatches, located opposite the SnaBI site, also serve as a strand-specific marker. The ligation mixture was treated with SpeI andEcoRV to remove residual ds pS. Closed circular ds DNA was purified by ultracentrifugation in a CsCl/ethidium bromide solution. DNA was concentrated by Centricon 30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. In this HD construct, six and three base mismatches are formed at theSpeI/AatII and SnaBI sites, respectively. At the BamHI and NheI sites, one strand has six extra bases. These four mismatched regions serve as strand-specific markers: A/a (BamHI site), B/b (SnaBI site), C/c (NheI site), and D/d (AatII/SpeI site). The unmodified complementary strand derived from ss pA106 contains the A-B-C-D linkage (Fig.3). γ-OH-PdG was incorporated into the site of b on the strand bearing the a-b-c-d linkage; this strand is the template for leading strand synthesis. Unmodified or modified DNA (12 ng) was introduced into mismatch repair-deficient (mutS) MO strains (50 μl of electrocompetent cells) by electroporation. The mutSmutation assures that the mismatches will not be repaired. 2× YT medium 16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g/1000 ml NaCl, pH 7) (950 μl) was added to the electroporation mixture, then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. A portion (10–50 μl of a 100× dilution) of the mixture was plated onto a 1× YT-ampicillin (100 μg/ml) plate to determine the number of transformants in the mixture. The remaining mixture was incubated for additional 40 min and then added to 10 ml of 2× YT containing ampicillin. After culturing overnight, progeny plasmid was prepared by the alkaline lysis method and used to transform E. coli DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.). This second transformation segregates progeny plasmid derived from each strand of the HD DNA. Transformants were inoculated individually in 96-well plates and cultured for several hours. Bacterial cultures were stamped onto filter paper placed on a 1× YT-ampicillin plate and cultured overnight. The filter was treated with 0.5 m NaOH for 11 min, neutralized in 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 7 min, washed with 1× SSC (150 mmNaCl, 15 mm Na3 citrate, pH 7.2) then with ethanol, and baked at 80 °C for 2 h.

L and R probes were used to confirm the presence of the 13-mer insert. In several experiments, mitomycin C was used to induce SOS functions inE. coli. Overnight cultures of MO strains were diluted 20-fold with prewarmed 2× YT and cultured for 2 h. Mitomycin C (1–10 μg/ml) was added to the cultures and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking. Cells were prepared for electroporation by repeated washings with H2O. When a HD construct bearing a single γ-OH-PdG residue is introduced into a host cell, various events may occur (Fig. 4). If the adduct is removed by excision repair before being replicated, the immediate 5′- and 3′-flanking mismatches also are removed. Gap-filling DNA synthesis converts 5′-CXA (b) to 5′-ACG (B); therefore, progeny derived from the repaired strand contain the linkage of a-B-c-d (progeny III) (Fig. 4, step 1). When the construct is replicated in the absence of DNA repair, progeny produced from the unmodified strand contain the A-B-C-D linkage (step 2), whereas those from the modified strand have a-b-c-d (step 4) following translesion synthesis (TLS). When DNA synthesis is blocked by the adduct, the block may be overcome by UmuD′2C/RecA-assisted TLS or recombination repair (daughter strand gap repair) (29Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 407-414Google Scholar). In recombination repair, the ss gap is filled by strand transfer from the unmodified parental strand (step 5). The 3′-end of the blocked nascent strand is used to replicate the transferred region (step 6). These processes create a Holliday junction. When the Holliday junction is migrated by the RuvA·RuvB complex, a Holliday junction-specific helicase, and resolved by RuvC, a Holliday junction-specific endonuclease (step 7), progeny with the linkage of A-B-C-D (progeny I), a-B-C-d (progeny IV), a-B-C-D (progeny V), and A-B-C-d (progeny VI) are created. Oligonucleotides used for primer extension studies are as follows: 28-mer templates, 5′-CTGCTCCTCXATACCTACACGCTAGAAC, where X is dG, γ-OH-PdG, or PdG; an 18-mer primer for incorporation experiments, 5′-GTTCTAGCGTGTAGGTAT; 19-mer primers for extension experiments, 5′-GTTCTAGCGTGTAGGTATN, where N is dA, dG, dC, or dT; and a 16-mer primer for read-through experiments, 5′-GTTCTAGCGTGTAGGT. All oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis in a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. The 5′-32P-end-labeled primers were hybridized to templates at a molar ratio of 1:1.2 in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl. Annealing reactions were conducted by heating at 70 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 65 nmprimer/template, 200 or 300 μm dNTP, and 0–850 nm KF exo−. The concentrations of dNTP were 200 μm for incorporation and extension experiments and 300 μm for read-through experiments. KF exo−was diluted in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. Reactions were conducted at 25 °C for 30 min and stopped by adding 10 μl of formamide dye mixture (90% formamide, 0.001% xylene cyanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 20 mm EDTA). Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and aliquots (1.5 μl) were subjected to electrophoresis in a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel (0.4 mm thick, 40 cm long) at 2600 V for 3 h. Gels were analyzed by a PhosphorImager using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). Pathway 1 depicted in Fig. 4 predicts that progeny III derived from plasmids subjected to excision repair will contain the a-B-c-d linkage. The unmodified control construct, which contained three base mismatches and no adduct, yielded <1% of progeny III in the uvrA (MO937) and uvr + (MO939) strains (Table II), indicating that the mismatches were not subjected to nucleotide excision repair. When the adducted construct was introduced into the uvrA strains (MO937 and MO934), progeny III accounted for <3% of plasmids analyzed. When the same construct was introduced into uvr+strains (MO939 and MO933), fractions of progeny III ranged from 32 to 35%. Thus, γ-OH-PdG is a substrate for UvrABC-catalyzed nucleotide excision repair in the presence of the 5′- and 3′-flanking mismatches.Table IILinkage analysis of progeny plasmidProgeny2-aLinkages of marker sequences for progeny I–VI correspond to those in Fig. 4.No. of plasmidMO937, ΔrecA,uvrAMO939, ΔrecA,uvrA +MO934,uvrAMO933, “wild”dGγ-OH-PdGdGγ-OH-PdGγ-OH-PdGγ-OH-PdG%SOS induction−−−−−+2-c,d E. coli was pretreated with mitomycin C at 1 (c) or 10 (d) μg/ml.−+dI32 (61)2-bNumbers represent percent.

Open table in a new tab The HD constructs were introduced into MO937 (ΔrecA,uvrA, alkA1, tag1). With the unmodified control construct, more than 96% of progeny were derived from replication of both strands (progeny I andII, Table II). The ratio of progeny I to II, however, was not 1:1 but twice that of progeny I. This result is consistent with that of a previous study (23Pandya G.A. Yang I.-Y. Grollman A.P. Moriya M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using the modified construct, the number of progeny I derived from the unmodified strand (78%) markedly exceeded that of progeny II derived from TLS (17%). This result indicates that γ-OH-PdG is a strong but not complete block to DNA synthesis. The apparent efficiency of TLS is estimated to be 27% (17/64). The induction of SOS functions did not increase significantly the fraction of progeny II in MO934. The fractions of progeny II obtained in the uvr+ strains (MO939 and MO933) were lower than those in the uvrA strains (MO937 and MO934) due to efficient repair of the adduct by nucleotide excision repair. The adducted HD construct was introduced into MO933 (“wild”), MO934 (uvrA), MO220 (mutD5), and MO221 (mutD5, ΔumuDC) in the presence or absence of induced SOS functions. Initial numbers of transformants in the transformation mixtures were determined by plating a portion of the transformation mixture. This analysis revealed >1 × 106 and >1 × 104 transformants per transformation in the absence and presence of induced SOS functions, respectively. The lower transformation efficiency of mitomycin C-treated cells is thought to be due to DNA damage. Progeny plasmid DNA was purified following overnight culture of the transformation mixture in the presence of ampicillin and then digested with SnaBI, the site for which is located in marker B (Fig. 3). This digestion removes progeny derived from the unmodified strand and plasmids subjected to excision repair or recombination repair (see Fig.4), facilitating analysis of TLS events. Targeted events were analyzed by differential oligonucleotide hybridization and DNA sequencing. This analysis revealed that almost all targeted events were γ-OH-PdG → dG, indicating accurate TLS. Only one γ-OH-PdG → dT transversion was observed among 282 transformants of SOS-uninduced MO933, yielding a miscoding frequency of 0.35%. The numbers of transformants analyzed were 144 f"

Lethality of uniparental embryos appears to be caused by either the lack of, or overexpression of, specific genes that are imprinted and only expressed from the nonimprinted parental allele. More than 35 autosomal genes in the mouse exhibit parent-of-origin, allele-specific imprinting in embryonic and adult tissues. The imprint, once set, is stable during mitosis but is reversed and reset by passage through meiosis during gametogenesis (4Tucker K.L. Beard C. Dausmann J. Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P.W. Lei H. Li E.

Given the epigenetic nature of imprinting, much attention has centered on whether DNA methylation is crucial to the establishment and maintenance of the silent imprinted allele (6Jaenisch R.

Furthermore, despite changes in global levels of DNA methylation in early embryogenesis, methylation of some imprinted genes remains constant even at the blastocyst stage, whereas the rest of the genome is hypomethylated (8Tremblay K.D. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Razin A. Cedar H.

These findings together with the derivation of embryos deficient in methyltransferases, in particular DNA methyltransferase 1, suggest that proper expression of some imprinted genes (10Li E. Beard C.

However, it is unclear whether methylation is involved in the regulation of some or all imprinted alleles. If methylation regulates the monoallelic expression of imprinted genes, demethylation should reactivate silent alleles in vitro. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the reactivation of imprinted alleles in a series of novel nonexpressing uniparental mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)1 treated by demethylating agents 5-azacytidine (AzaC) or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AzadC) alone or in combination with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). Our results suggest that both DNA methylation and histone deacetylase activities regulate the differential allelic expression of some but not all imprinted genes in somatic cells and that the epigenetic modifications required for maintenance of monoallelic expression vary among different imprinted loci. Significantly, the activated state induced by DNA demethylation, but not by histone acetylation, is propagated and stably inherited during mitosis, indicating that methylation is required for long term repression of some imprinted genes. WT and uniparental MEFs were derived from explanted day 13 (day of plug = day 1) embryos after removing the head and internal organs.

Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The PG eggs were derived from mouse lines that constitutively expressed the Neo gene (15Stewart C.L. Vanek M. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3701-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The AG and PG MEFs were derived by culturing the primary explants in media supplemented with G418 for at least 1 week which selected against the WT cells lacking theNeoR gene. Uniparental MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and Pen/Strep. The day before treatment, cells were split to 50–60% density. For the experiment shown in Fig. 2, cells were treated with various concentrations of TSA (Wako) (0.2–5 μm) or AzaC or AzadC (Sigma) (1–10 μm) for 24 h and total RNA was prepared and analyzed by RT-PCR. For the experiment shown in Figs.3 and 4, cells were incubated in media containing 0.3 μmof TSA for 72 h. For treatment with the AzaC or AzadC (Sigma), cells were incubated with medium containing initially 1 μm AzaC or AzadC for 24 h followed by 0.3 μm AzaC or AzadC for an additional 48 h. For the combined treatment with AzaC/TSA or AzadC/TSA, cells were incubated with AzadC or AzaC at the final concentration of 1 μm for 24 h followed by 0.3 μm for another 24 h, after which 0.4 μm TSA was added in the presence of 0.3 μm AzadC or AzaC for an additional 24 h. After treatment, cells were either used to prepare total RNA or cultured in the absence of the drugs for up to 2 weeks.Figure 3Treatment of AG and PG MEFs with AzaC , AzadC , and/or TSA results in reactivation of a subset of imprinted genes.RNA isolated from untreated (−) or treated (+) AG and PG MEFs was analyzed by RT-PCR.

Open table in a new tab For quantitative evaluation of the expression of imprinted genes in untreated, TSA- and/or AzadC-treated AG and PG MEFS, total RNA was converted to cDNA, and quantitative PCR was performed using serial dilutions to assure a linear amplification of the target and control genes (18Gilliland G.

The levels of target gene expression were measured relative to the housekeeping genes Hprt (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase) and Gapd(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphte dehydrogenase) as internal controls. The amplified products were analyzed by Southern blotting and quantified by a PhosphorImager Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics). Total RNA (10 μg) isolated from untreated, TSA- and/or AzadC-treated MEFs was incubated overnight at 45 °C with radiolabeled probe (∼106 cpm) in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing hybridization buffer (Ambion, Inc). The reaction mixtures were digested with RNases A and T1 and subsequently analyzed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The relative intensities of the target and control mRNAs were quantified by phosphorimaging. Uniparental MEFs cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of TSA (0.2, 1, or 5 μm) were harvested and nuclei prepared as described previously (19El Kharroubi A. Martin M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei (3–5 × 106) were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm AEBSF (ICN) and proteinase inhibitors complete (Roche)), then SDS was added to final concentration of 1%. 20 μg of proteins from treated and untreated AG and PG MEFs were separated by 16.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Hyperacetylated histones were detected by anti-acetylated H3 and H4 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) and were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As control for the amount of protein loading, a parallel gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Genomic DNA was extracted by proteinase K/SDS digestion, phenol/chloroform extraction, and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Forp57Kip2 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein 2) analysis, DNA was first digested withHindIII and XbaI followed by incubation with either HpaII or MspI for at least 16 h at 37 °C. For the methylation analysis of U2af1 (U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor) and Snrpn (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N) genes, DNA was digested first with BamHI and HindIII followed byHpaII or MspI. Digested DNA was analyzed by Southern blotting as described previously (19El Kharroubi A. Martin M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We generated uniparental diploid MEFs containing exclusively either the paternal AG or the maternal PG genome. In these uniparental cells, the epigenetic regulation of both alleles should be identical, with an imprinted gene being either expressed or silent depending on the parent-of-origin profile of imprinting. Probes to a panel of imprinted genes showed that these cell lines stably retain parent-of-origin allele-specific imprinting status over 30 cell generations (Fig.1).

In contrast, the transcripts of maternally expressed H19 (H19 fetal liver mRNA), Grb10/Meg1 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 10/maternally expressed gene 1), andp57Kip2 (26Bartolomei M.S.

The one exception was theIgf2r/M6Pr (insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor/mannose 6-phosphate receptor) (29Barlow D.P. Stoger R. Herrmann B.G. Saito K. Schweifer N. Nature. 1991; 349: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). This gene is strongly expressed from the maternal allele (in PG and WT MEFs), but low levels of expression were also detected in the AG MEFs, indicating that the silencing of the paternal allele was not fully acquired in day 13 uniparental embryonic tissues. Furthermore, the tissue-specific imprinted genes Rasgrf1 (Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1), which is expressed exclusively from the paternal allele in the brain, heart, and stomach (30Plass C. Shibata H. Kalcheva I. Mullins L. Kotelevtseva N. Mullins J. Kato R. Sasaki H. Hirotsune S. Okazaki Y. Held W.A. Hayashizaki Y. Chapman V.M. Nat.

Tilghman S.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Rossant J. Nagy A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), were not detected in WT and uniparental MEFs. The housekeeping genes, Gapd andHprt, were expressed in all MEFs. These results demonstrate that AG and PG MEFs retain the correct expression pattern of 12 imprinted genes and provide unique and significant advantages to analyze mechanisms leading to allele-specific silencing of these genes. To examine the roles that DNA methylation and histone deacetylation play in differential expression of imprinted genes, uniparental AG and PG MEFs were treated with increasing concentrations of either a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase (32Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TSA (0.2–5 μm, Fig. 2) or with inhibitors of DNA methylation, AzaC/AzadC (1–10 μm) for 24 h. RT-PCR was performed to determine whether imprinted genes were induced by drug treatment in nonexpressing cells. TSA treatment resulted in a dose-dependent induction of Igf2 andp57Kip2 in PG and AG MEFs, respectively (Fig.2 A). A modest induction of both Igf2 andp57Kip2 was observed in cells treated with a low dose of TSA (0.2 μm). TSA reactivation was significantly higher at 1 μm and decreased at 5 μm, possibly because of its adverse effect on cell proliferation and viability (33Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Unlike Igf2 andp57Kip2, all of the other imprinted genes listed in Fig. 1 remained silent, despite induced accumulation of hyperacetylated histones H3 and H4 after culturing uniparental cells in the presence of different doses of TSA (Fig. 2 B). Acetylation of core histones, in particular H3 and H4, is believed to play a role in chromatin unfolding and transcription regulation, as actively transcribed genes are enriched in hyperacetylated histones H3 and H4 (33Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 34Mizzen C.A. Allis C.D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 35Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that levels of acetylated H3 and H4 were very low (detectable only at high exposure, data not shown) in untreated AG and PG MEFs. Incubation with 0.2–5 μm TSA resulted in the accumulation of acetylated H3 and H4 as determined by antibodies directed against acetylated histones (Fig. 2 B; 0.2, 1, and 5 μm TSA). Under these experimental conditions, among the imprinted genes analyzed (Fig. 1), only Igf2 and p57Kip2 were reactivated. At this point we cannot rule out whether the induction of these two genes is triggered by a locus-specific histone acetylation or by a secondary effect of a global histone acetylation. In contrast, treatment with demethylating agents AzaC or AzadC for 24 h was not sufficient to induce detectable levels of imprinted gene mRNA in nonexpressing cells (data not shown). However, treatment with high doses of AzaC and AzadC (5–10 μm) for over 24 h was toxic and inhibited cell proliferation. To minimize the adverse effects of drug treatment on cell proliferation, a protocol was elaborated in which uniparental AG and PG MEFs were treated for 3 days with low dose of AzaC, AzadC, and/or TSA (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig.3, this resulted in the activation of a subset of imprinted genes. Peg3 and Zac1 were reactivated in PG MEFs and, p57Kip2 andH19 in AG cells after exposure of cells to either AzaC or AzadC. Igf2 was induced in PG MEFs treated with TSA alone and was not responsive to demethylating agents, whereas both TSA and AzaC/AzadC synergistically activated p57Kip2 in AG MEFs. In contrast, Grb10, Peg1,Rasgrf1, Sgce, Snrpn, andU2af1 remained inactive after both treatments. The effects of TSA and AzadC on the expression of Igf2r were not assessed because the gene is not fully silenced in AG MEFs. The levels of expression of a gene paternally imprinted,p57Kip2, and two maternally imprinted genes,Peg3 and U2af1, were evaluated further by RNase protection assay and/or quantitative RT-PCR (Fig.4). Measurement by phosphorimaging analysis of changes in p57Kip2 mRNA levels revealed a significant induction of p57Kip2 expression after treatment with either TSA or AzadC (Fig.4 A). However, the combined treatment with AzadC and TSA synergistically activated p57Kip2 expression to about 5-fold higher levels than treatment with either AzadC or TSA alone. These results suggest that both histone deacetylase and DNA methylation activities mediate silencing of the paternal allele ofp57Kip2 in cultured MEFs. Unlikep57Kip2, Peg3 was activated in PG MEFs treated with AzadC alone, whereas the addition of TSA antagonized the induction by AzadC in a combined treatment (Fig.4 B), demonstrating that in this case the hyperacetylation of histones has a negative effect on gene expression. Under the same protocols, treatment of PG MEFs with AzadC and/or TSA did not significantly change the expression levels of U2af1,Hprt, or Gapd (Fig. 4, B andC). Overall the results shown in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 suggest that only a subset of imprinted genes is activated in response to inhibitors of histone deacetylation and/or DNA methylation. We analyzed the methylation status of p57Kip2 (induced by TSA and AzadC) and U2af1 (not responsive to either TSA or AzadC treatment) by comparing the digestion of genomic DNA from untreated, TSA-, AzaC-, or AzadC-treated AG and PG MEFs (Fig.5). After treatment, cells were cultured in the absence of drugs for 3–7 days, and DNA was purified and digested with the methylation-sensitive HpaII or insensitiveMspI enzymes and analyzed by Southern blotting. Blots were hybridized with probes derived from the promoter region ofp57Kip2 (Fig. 5 A) andU2af1 (Fig. 5 B). DNA from WT MEFs, which carry both active and silent alleles of each imprinted gene, was used as a control. In all samples, DNA from nonexpressing cells (AG forp57Kip2 and PG for U2af1), either untreated or TSA-treated, was relatively resistant to HpaII digestion, but was cut by MspI to produce heterogeneous fragments of various sizes (Fig. 5, A and B). The results demonstrated that in nonexpressing cells,p57Kip2 (in AG MEFs) and U2af1 (in PG MEFs) genes are densely methylated, whereas in the expressing cells DNA is unmethylated, as it is digested to the same extent with eitherHpaII or MspI (compare Fig. 5 A,lanes 6 and 7, with Fig. 5 B,lanes 7 and 9). After treatment with AzadC,p57Kip2 DNA from AG MEFs was readily digested with HpaII (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 2and 4), demonstrating that AzadC induced extensive demethylation at this locus, particularly with regard to the appearance of a major band at 0.4 kilobase. However, DNA from the same cells treated with TSA (which also activatedp57Kip2) showed only minor changes inHpaII digestion, indicating that TSA did not cause significant demethylation as seen in AzadC-treated samples. Similar results were obtained when blots were hybridized with U2af1(Fig. 5 B). DNA from AzaC- or AzadC-treated PG cells was partially digested with HpaII, whereas DNA from untreated cells was fully resistant to digestion (compare lanes 2–5). Thus, under these experimental conditions DNA is significantly demethylated after AzaC or AzadC treatment, whereas the same sequences in untreated cells are densely methylated. However, despite significant levels of DNA demethylation, U2af1 and other imprinted genes remained silent after treatment (Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting that partial demethylation was not sufficient to reactivate these silent alleles. In mammals, propagation of the methylation state within CpG dinucleotides by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase occurs during or shortly after replication (36Bestor T.H. Verdine G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Inhibition of DNA methylation by AzaC or AzadC leads to the reactivation of some imprinted genes, specifically H19, Peg3,p57Kip2, and Zac1, whereas TSA treatment induces two genes, p57Kip2 andIgf2 (Fig. 3). To determine whether these induced patterns of expression are maintained after multiple cell divisions, uniparental MEFs initially treated for 3 days with TSA, AzaC, or AzadC (Fig. 6, lanes P1) were cultured for 7 days (lanes P2) or 15 days (lanes P4) after withdrawal of the inducing agents. The results shown in Fig. 6 revealed that the expression of H19, Peg3,p57Kip2, and Zac1 induced by transient treatment with either AzaC or AzadC is enriched and maintained over the course of multiple cell divisions in the absence of either inhibitor (compare P1 with P4). However, the TSA-induced transient expression of p57Kip2 and Igf2 was quickly reversed to a silent state after two to four cell cycles after drug withdrawal. These results demonstrate that changes in DNA methylation, but not levels of histone acetylation, create a dominant and heritable epigenetic state of gene expression at some imprinted loci. In mammals, genomic imprinting results from the differential epigenetic modification to a subset of genes in the germ line, leading to parent-of-origin monoallelic expression during embryogenesis and in adult tissues. Studying the molecular basis that distinguishes the paternal and the maternal alleles of imprinted genes has been complicated by the simple fact that all somatic tissues contain both maternal and paternal genomes. This necessitated the use of a variety of techniques to distinguish between the parental alleles, such as polymorphisms generated by intercrosses or the introduction of mutations or deletions into different imprinted genes. Here we have greatly simplified the analysis of imprinted gene expression by generating novel uniparental mouse fibroblast lines retaining parent-of-origin patterns of imprinting. We showed that the parental specific expression is stably inherited during multiple cell generations in vitro, demonstrating that these uniparental cells provide unique advantages for analyzing the mechanisms of silencing of imprinted alleles. Treatment of uniparental cells with inhibitors of histone deacetylases or DNA methyltransferases resulted in activation of only a subset of imprinted genes. In PG cells, bothZac1 and Peg3 were reactivated in cells treated with AzaC or AzadC, whereas Igf2 was induced only by TSA. In AG MEFs, p57Kip2 was synergistically activated by combination of both AzadC and TSA, and H19 was induced after AzadC treatment but not with TSA. However, under identical experimental conditions Grb10, Peg1,Sgce, Snrpn, and U2af1, as well as the tissue-specific imprinted genes Rasgrf1 andMash2, remained silent after all treatments, demonstrating that not all imprinted genes are responsive to changes in DNA methylation or histone acetylation levels in somatic tissues. Recently DNA methylation and histone deacetylation have been functionally linked to transcriptional repression. Methyl-CpG-binding proteins MeCP2 (37Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D.

Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) reside in multiprotein complexes with histone deacetylases. These complexes assemble on methylated DNA mediating transcriptional repression through chromatin hypoacetylation with the silent state being partially reversed by TSA. Consistent with this model, we have shown thatp57Kip2 is responsive to inhibitors of both DNA methylation and histone deacetylase (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). This suggests that the silent paternal allele of p57Kip2 may be associated with a repressor complex similar to those described above and may contain both histone deacetylase and methyl-binding proteins responsible for targeting the complex to methylated DNA. In contrast,H19, Peg3, and Zac1 were only responsive to loss of methylation but not to an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, suggesting that complexes containing methyl-binding proteins but not histone deacetylase may be involved in silencing at these loci. Whether the reactivation of all these genes is caused by direct alteration of their “imprint” or by indirect changes in methylation elsewhere, remains to be determined. However, simultaneous analysis of the methylation levels of imprinted genes (Fig. 5) in both AG and PG MEFs suggests that treatment affects global DNA methylation rather than some gene-specific regulatory process. Genetic evidence has implicated DNA methylation in silencing imprinted alleles ofH19, Igf2, Igf2r, andp57Kip2 because a loss-of-function mutation of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase gene (Dnmt1) resulted in biallelic expression of both H19 andp57Kip2 (10Li E.

Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). In agreement with the genetic data, we showed that in vitrodemethylation caused reactivation of a subset of imprinted genes, including p57Kip2 and H19 in nonexpressing AG MEFs, and the newly identified Zac1 gene and Peg3 from the maternal alleles in PG MEFs. Under these experimental conditions, the reactivation of Zac1 andPeg3 suggests that methylation is also required to maintain the silent state at these imprinted loci. The expression level ofSnrpn also appeared to increase in Dnmt1 null mice (42Shemer R. Birger Y. Riggs A.D. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear whether the elevated expression is caused by an increase in the transcription from the active paternal allele or to the reactivation of the silent maternal allele. Our results show that loss in DNA methylation in PG MEFs (Fig. 5) did not result in detectable changes in expression of Snrpn (Fig.3). Other reports (43Shin J.Y. Kim H.S. Park J. Park J.B. Lee J.Y.

Pedone et al. (45Pedone P.V. Pikaart M.J. Cerrato F. Vernucci M. Ungaro P. Bruni C.B. Riccio A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) suggested that Igf2 may also be induced by inhibitors of DNA methylation, and H19 may be activated in a combined treatment with AzaC + TSA or sodium butyrate. In a DNA methyltransferase null background (Dnmt1 −/−)Igf2 is not expressed, with both the maternal and paternal alleles being silent and H19 being expressed from both alleles. These conflicting results suggest that the relaxation of the coregulated Igf2 and H19 imprinting is complex and that epigenetic changes elsewhere in the genome may also affect their expression under certain conditions. Here we showed (Figs. 3 and 6) that the same treatment that led to reactivation of H19, p57Kip2,Peg3, and Zac1 did not change the silent state ofGrb10, Peg1, Sgce, Snrpn, and U2af1, despite the paternal and maternal alleles of these genes being differentially methylated (7Constancia M. Pickard B. Kelsey G. Reik W. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 881-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 42Shemer R. Birger Y. Riggs A.D. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and that treatment with AzadC resulted in substantial demethylation of bothp57Kip2 and U2af1(Fig. 5). This suggests that some imprinted genes (Grb10, Peg1,Sgce, Snrpn, U2af1) are associated with repressive heterochromatin-like structures that may be propagated independently of DNA methylation and/or levels of histone acetylation. Similar mechanisms were also suggested to explain the different rates at which HPRT and PGK were reactivated on the silent X chromosome after treatment with AzaC (48Lester S.C. Korn N.J. DeMars R. Somatic Cell Genet. 1982; 8: 265-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). If this is the case, whatever the nature of the initial imprint is, once the silencing is set, the repressive state becomes mitotically stable and reversible only by passage through meiosis (4Tucker K.L. Beard C. Dausmann J. Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P.W. Lei H. Li E. Jaenisch R.

Partial DNA demethylation in MEFs is therefore not sufficient to induce detectable expression of these imprinted genes. Also, the observed differential methylation between the expressed and silent alleles might be a consequence and not the cause of silencing. In this case, DNA demethylation would not affect the silencing. Detailed analysis of chromatin structure and composition may help elucidate the mechanisms orchestrating allele-specific silencing of this group of imprinted genes. Propagation of epigenetic states of expression during multiple cell divisions is essential for the stability of imprinting. Remarkably, we observed that the activated state of H19,p57Kip2, Peg3, and Zac1mediated by DNA demethylation was enriched and stably propagated through multiple mitoses (Fig. 6). In contrast, the activated state ofIgf2 and p57Kip2, induced by transient inhibition of histone deacetylase, was quickly reversed after withdrawal of TSA from the culture medium, suggesting that the histone deacetylase activity associated with silencing Igf2and p57Kip2 is only temporarily inhibited but not disrupted by TSA treatment. These results support a previous observation (4Tucker K.L. Beard C. Dausmann J. Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P.W. Lei H. Li E. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) that changes in DNA methylation, but not histone acetylation, create a heritable epigenetic state at some, but not all, imprinted loci in somatic cells. Here, we have shown that uniparental AG and PG MEFs provide a unique model to study the regulation of imprinted gene expression in vitro. In these lines, as in the whole mouse, imprinted genes are expressed according to their parental origin. Among the imprinted genes examined, four were responsive to partial loss of methylation (i.e. H19, p57Kip2,Peg3, and Zac1), suggesting that DNA methylation is the primary silencing mechanism for this set of imprinted genes and that additional mechanisms may regulate silencing of other imprinted genes in somatic cells.

Upon insulin binding to the α subunits, the insulin receptor undergoes a poorly characterized conformational change that results in autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic portion of the β subunits. Three regions in the β subunits are sites of autophosphorylation: the juxtamembrane region, the activation loop (A-loop) within the tyrosine kinase domain, and the C-terminal tail (3Tornqvist H.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5748-5753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous crystallographic studies of the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor (IRKD) have demonstrated that upon autophosphorylation, the kinase A-loop undergoes a major change in conformation (12Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 13Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the unphosphorylated, low activity form of IRKD (IRKD0P) without ATP (apo), Tyr-1162 in the A-loop is situated in the active site, blocking access to peptide substrates (12Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). In this A-loop configuration, the beginning (proximal end) of the A-loop interferes with ATP binding. The crystal structure of the tris-phosphorylated, activated form of IRKD (IRKD3P) reveals how autophosphorylation of Tyr-1158, Tyr-1162, and Tyr-1163 stabilizes a specific A-loop configuration in which the substrate binding sites (MgATP and peptide) are accessible and the important catalytic residues are properly positioned (13Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 14Hubbard S.R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Solution studies of IRKD indicate, however, that in the presence of millimolar quantities of ATP (as are present in a cell), the A-loop of unphosphorylated IRKD is in equilibrium between inhibiting, “gate-closedȁ conformations, as represented by the apoIRKD0P crystal structure, and “gate-openȁ conformations in which Tyr-1162 is displaced from the active site (15Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Ablooglu A.J. Han Y.P. Kohanski R.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When the A-loop adopts a gate-open conformation, the kinase is competent to serve as either enzyme or substrate in atrans-autophosphorylation reaction. Prior to A-loop autophosphorylation, gate-open conformations of the A-loop would exist in which the majority of the A-loop has no particular conformation (because of lack of phosphotyrosine-mediated interactions), but is nevertheless disengaged from the active site. After autophosphorylation, the A-loop is stabilized in the gate-open conformation observed in the IRKD3P structure. A detailed understanding of the mechanism by which insulin triggers the initial autophosphorylation event in the insulin receptor requires a structural description of the basal state (unphosphorylated) kinase with bound substrates (ATP and protein). Ideally, this would be provided by a crystal structure of IRKD0P with bound ATP analog and peptide substrate. To date, attempts to obtain crystals of such a ternary (or binary) complex have been unsuccessful. Steady-state kinetic studies of IRKD provide a plausible explanation for this failure: the Km values for ATP and peptide substrate are elevated prior to autophosphorylation, 0.9 and 2 mm, respectively, decreasing to 0.04 and 0.05 mm upon autophosphorylation. 2Ablooglu, A. J. and Kohanski, R. A. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 504–513.2Ablooglu, A. J. and Kohanski, R. A. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 504–513. These data are consistent with the autoinhibitory mechanism suggested by the apoIRKD0P structure and underscore the inherent difficulty of loading the kinase with substrates prior to A-loop autophosphorylation. Recently, a substitution in the A-loop of IRKD, Asp-1161 → Ala (IRKDDA), has been introduced that dramatically alters the A-loop equilibrium in the unphosphorylated kinase. 3M. Frankel, A. J. Ablooglu, J. W. Leone, E. Rusinova, J. B. A. Ross, R. L. Heinrikson, and R. A. Kohanski, submitted for publication.3M. Frankel, A. J. Ablooglu, J. W. Leone, E. Rusinova, J. B. A. Ross, R. L. Heinrikson, and R. A. Kohanski, submitted for publication. This particular substitution was motivated by the apoIRKD0P crystal structure in which the Asp-1161 side chain participates in several hydrogen bonds that stabilize the gate-closed configuration of the A-loop (Fig. 1). Steady-state kinetic experiments demonstrate that theKm(ATP) in the basal state is ∼10-fold lower for this mutant than for wild-type IRKD, suggesting that the A-loop equilibrium is shifted toward gate-open conformations.3 Interestingly, this mutation does not affect Km(peptide) in the unphosphorylated state, which remains high (several millimolar). The kinetic properties of IRKDDA after autophosphorylation are indistinguishable from those of the wild-type kinase. The lower Km(ATP) for this mutant affords the possibility of structurally characterizing IRKD with ATP bound prior to insulin-stimulated A-loop autophosphorylation. Indeed, crystals of IRKDDA with a bound ATP analog (AMP-PCP) were readily obtained. Here we present the structure of the binary complex of IRKDDA with MgAMP-PCP at 2.4-Å resolution. This structure and the accompanying viscometric and denaturation data provide insights into the structural rearrangements that occur within the basal state kinase to promote catalysis. The 46-kDa form (residues 953–1355) of the Asp-1161 → Ala mutant cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor, IRCDDA, was generated and purified as described.3 This form of the kinase was used for denaturation studies. To generate the 35-kDa form (residues 978–1283) of the mutant (IRKDDA) used in the crystallographic and viscometric studies, the 0.65-kb XhoI-StuI fragment from pX-D1161A-IRCD was inserted into theXhoI-StuI sites of pALTER-IRK vector, which includes the point mutations Cys-981 → Ser and Tyr-984 → Phe described previously (16Wei L. Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8122-8130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The fragment swap was verified withNheI digestion; this restriction enzyme site was introduced previously to replace a StuI site by a silent mutation at Ala-1048 and Ser-1049 (17Cann A.D. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7681-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The resulting pALTER-IRKDDA was digested with HindIII, filled in with the large Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and a 0.9-kb fragment was released withBamHI. This was inserted into theBamHI-SmaI sites of the baculovirus expression vector pVL1393 (PharMingen), producing pVL1393-IRKDDA, and the recombinant virus was generated using a Baculogold kit (PharMingen); the mutation was reconfirmed in pVL1393-IRKDDA by DNA sequencing. Proteins were expressed and purified as described (18Bishop S.M. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).3 The absence of A-loop phosphorylation in each form (46 kDa and 35 kDa) of the mutant was determined by endoproteinase Lys-C digestion and peptide mapping by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Crystals of the binary complex of IRKDDA and MgAMP-PCP were grown at 20 °C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops containing 2.0 μl of protein solution (9 mg/ml IRKDDA, 1.5 mm AMP-PCP (Sigma), and 4.5 mm MgCl2) and 2.0 μl of reservoir buffer (18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell dimensionsa = 57.9 Å, b = 69.6 Å, andc = 89.3 Å when frozen. There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit, and the solvent content is 51% (assuming a protein partial specific volume of 0.74 cm3/g). Crystals were transferred into a cryosolvent consisting of 30% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 15% ethylene glycol.

The relative viscosity, ηrel, is the ratio of the viscosity in the presenceversus the absence of viscogen and was determined as described by Adams and Taylor (25Adams J.A. Taylor S.S.

To determine the viscosity dependences ofkcat/Km(peptide), measurements were done at 1 mm ATP and 0.14 mmY-IRS939. A control reaction measuring kcat was done using ATPγS to show the absence of viscosity effects in the IRKDDA-catalyzed reaction because phosphoryltransferase reactions with ATPγS are usually chemistry-limited rather than diffusion step-limited (26Chlebowski J.F.

The protein concentration was 0.5 μm. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and steady-state emission spectra were collected between 310 and 420 nm at 1-nm increments, using an SLM 4800 spectrofluorimeter operating in the single-photon counting mode. The centroid of the emission spectrum was determined after subtraction of a blank spectrum for each guanidinium chloride concentration, which was obtained from the refractive index measured with a Bausch and Lomb refractometer. Details regarding instrument settings and data handling are given in Bishop et al. (18Bishop S.M. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the original structure of unphosphorylated (low activity) IRKD, the A-loop traverses the ATP-binding cleft between the N- and C-terminal lobes of the kinase, and Tyr-1162 in the A-loop is bound in the active site, hydrogen-bonded to Asp-1132 and Arg-1136 in the catalytic loop (12Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Asp-1161 contributes to the stabilization of this inhibitory conformation of the A-loop by participating in four hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1). In the crystal structure of the Asp-1161 → Ala mutant IRKD in complex with MgAMP-PCP (Fig. 2), the A-loop adopts a conformation in which the active site is unobstructed (gate-open), consistent with solution studies measuring the accessibility of the active site.3 In the IRKDDA structure, the proximal end of the A-loop, containing the protein kinase-conserved 1150DFG sequence, is positioned more similarly to that in the activated IRKD3P structure than that in the apoIRKD0Pstructure (Fig. 3A). A-loop residues 1155–1171, which include the three autophosphorylation sites Tyr-1158, Tyr-1162, and Tyr-1163, have no supporting electron density in the IRKDDA structure and are presumed to be disordered. The A-loop becomes ordered again at PTK-conserved Pro-1172, which adopts the same conformation in the three IRKD structures (IRKDDA, IRKD0P, and IRKD3P). The absence of Tyr-1162 in the active site in the binary IRKDDAstructure is consistent with biochemical studies (16Wei L. Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8122-8130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and modeling exercises, which indicate that MgATP and Tyr-1162 cannot bind in the active site simultaneously, i.e. thatcis-autophosphorylation of Tyr-1162 is not sterically possible. In protein kinases, residues in both the N- and C-terminal lobes bind and thus position ATP for phosphoryl transfer (29Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The extent to which ATP is bound productively depends on the degree of lobe closure, the relative disposition of the two lobes. A superposition of C-terminal lobe residues for the three IRKD structures reveals that the degree of lobe closure for IRKDDA is intermediate between IRKD0P and IRKD3P (Fig. 3A). From its position in the IRKD0P structure, the N-terminal lobe is rotated 11° toward the C-terminal lobe in the IRKDDAstructure. An additional 8° is required for the N-terminal lobe to reach the position observed in the IRKD3P structure. Analysis of the changes in backbone φ, ψ torsion angles shows that the hinge points for the N-terminal lobe rotation are at Arg-1061, before β-strand 4 (β4), and Met-1079, in the segment linking the N- and C-terminal lobes. When the N-terminal β sheet is superimposed for the three IRKD structures, α-helix C (αC) in the IRKDDA structure is observed to be in essentially the same position with respect to the β sheet as it is in the IRKD0P structure. Thus, in the transition from the autoinhibited, gate-closed conformation of the A-loop (IRKD0P) to a gate-open conformation with bound ATP (IRKDDA), the entire N-terminal lobe rotates as a rigid body. However in the transition to the activated state (IRKD3P), αC undergoes an independent (from the β sheet) motion that entails a 12° rotation toward the C-terminal lobe and a 28° rotation about the helical axis (Fig. 3B). These movements of αC, which mainly occur through φ, ψ changes at Phe-1054 and Thr-1055 at the base of the helix, are necessary to position protein kinase-conserved Glu-1047 (in αC) proximal to conserved Lys-1030 (in β3). Lys-1030 coordinates the α- and β-phosphates of ATP in an active protein kinase configuration (30Zheng J. Trafny E.A. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 362-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H. Huber R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The IRKDDA structure suggests that the rotation of αC required for a properly configured active site relies on the precise positioning of Phe-1151 in the DFG motif. Although the position of Phe-1151 in the IRKDDA structure is roughly similar to that in the IRKD3P structure, there are critical differences. In the IRKD3P structure, Phe-1151 is buried deep in a hydrophobic pocket underneath αC (Fig.4A). This pocket is composed of residues from αC (Glu-1047, Val-1050, Met-1051), from the αC-β4 loop (Phe-1054, Val-1059), from αE (Leu-1123), and from β8 (Ile-1148). In contrast, the side chain of Phe-1151 in the IRKDDA structure points upward toward αC and is situated in a shallow hydrophobic pocket comprising the same residues as above (some with different side-chain rotamers) and additionally Phe-1128 in the segment preceding the catalytic loop (Fig. 4B). With Phe-1151 in this position, αC is sterically hindered from undergoing the movements that bring Glu-1047 into the active site. Moreover, conserved Asp-1150, which coordinates Mg2+, is pulled back from the active site vis à vis its position in the IRKD3P structure (Fig. 3B). The ATP analog (AMP-PCP) that was co-crystallized with IRKDDA is bound in the cleft between the two kinase lobes (Fig. 2) and is ordered throughout, including the γ-phosphate. The conformation of AMP-PCP in the IRKDDA structure is different from the conformation of AMP-PNP observed in the ternary IRKD3P structure and closely resembles the conformation of ATP and AMP-PNP in crystal structures of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (30Zheng J. Trafny E.A. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 362-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H. Huber R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In the ternary IRKD3P structure, the γ-phosphate of AMP-PNP is swung away from the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine substrate in the active site, presumably due to the imperfect fit with nitrogen rather than oxygen as the bridging atom between the β- and γ-phosphates. Due to the incomplete rotation of the N-terminal lobe toward the C-terminal lobe in IRKDDA, AMP-PCP binds to the “roofȁ of the cleft (N-terminal residues) but not to the “floorȁ (C-terminal residues). Lys-1030 in β3 is hydrogen-bonded to the α-phosphate, but the ribose hydroxyl groups are not within hydrogen-bonding distance to Asp-1083 in the C-terminal lobe, as in IRKD3P. Moreover, only one Mg2+ ion is evident in the IRKDDA structure, coordinated by Asp-1150 and the β- and γ-phosphates of AMP-PCP. Because of the retracted position of Asp-1150, the coordination of this Mg2+ is weak: Mg–O distances ≥ 2.4 Å. Due to the lack of lobe closure and the consequent positioning of AMP-PCP at the roof of the cleft, the second Mg2+ ion present in the IRKD3P structure, coordinated by Asn-1137 of the catalytic loop (C-terminal lobe), is absent in the binary IRKDDA structure. Although the A-loop in the IRKDDA structure does not occlude the peptide binding site as in the IRKD0Pstructure, Km(peptide), unlikeKm(ATP), is not decreased in the Asp-1161 → Ala mutant.3 In the structure of ternary IRKD3P, residues 1169–1171 at the distal end of the A-loop are hydrogen-bonded via main-chain atoms to peptide substrate residues P+1 through P+3 (P0 is the acceptor tyrosine), forming two short, antiparallel β strands (13Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). In addition, the side chains of Leu-1170 and Leu-1171 are constituents of the binding pockets for the P0 and P+3 side chains, respectively. Thus, the disorder in the IRKDDAA-loop at the distal end results in a peptide binding site that is not fully formed, which is reflected in the highKm(peptide). In contrast, in the gate-open conformation stabilized by A-loop autophosphorylation, the distal end of the A-loop is ordered even in the absence of peptide substrate. 4J. H. Till and S. R. Hubbard, unpublished data. The binding and chemical steps associated with an IRKD-catalyzed phosphorylation reaction are summarized in Scheme 1 for the experimental conditions where enzyme (E) is saturated with ATP (T), tyrosyl peptide (Y) binds with on- and off-rate constants k2 andk−2, the rate constant for the chemical step is given by k3, and the net rate constant for release of products ADP (D) and phosphotyrosyl peptide (pY) is given byk4′. E·T+Y⇄k−2k2E·T·Y→k3E·D·pY→k4′E+D+pYSCHEME1The stepwise rate constants present in the steady-state kinetic parameters were derived using Cleland's method (32Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3220-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and were established from the viscosity dependence ofkcat andkcat/Km(peptide)(Fig. 5).kcat=k3·k4′/(k3+k4′)Equation 1 kcat/Km(peptide)=k2·k3/(k−2+k3)Equation 2 The principle behind viscometric analysis is that increased solution viscosity will affect the diffusion-dependent steps of substrate binding (k2 andk−2) and product release (k4′) but not the chemical step (k3), because the latter does not involve solute (substrate) exchange between the bulk phase and the enzyme's active site (23Blacklow S.C. Raines R.T. Lim W.A. Zamore P.D. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To identify whether chemistry is the rate-limiting step in steady-state phosphorylation of the peptide substrate Y-IRS939 by IRKDDA, the viscosity dependence ofkcat andkcat/Km(peptide)was determined. The parameters (kcat)rel and (kcat/Km)rel are the ratio of kcat andkcat/Km, respectively, in the presence of viscogen versus the control reaction in aqueous buffer without viscogen. If the rate constant for a diffusion-dependent step is much smaller than for a diffusion-independent step, then the plot of (kcat)rel or (kcat/Km)relversus ηrel will have zero slope. For IRKDDA, both global parameters were sensitive to changes in viscosity, increasing linearly with increasing viscogen (Fig. 5). The slope for (kcat)relversus ηrel was 0.8 ± 0.1, and the slope for (kcat/Km)relversus ηrel was 1.2 ± 0.2. For IRKDDA-catalyzed reactions without viscogen,kcat = 9.6 ± 0.4 s−1 andkcat/Km(peptide)= 4.2 ± 0.7 × 103m−1 s−1. From these values, we calculate k3 = 59 s−1 and k4′ = 14 s−1. 5These parameters were calculated fromk4′ = kcat/(slope from (kcat)relversusηrel); k3 =kcat·k4′/(k4′− kcat). Because these rate constants differ by only 4-fold, the steady-state rate constant of the reaction (kcat) is partially limited by chemistry and partially by product release (Equation 1). These are approximately the same values of k3and k4′ determined for the activated kinase, IRKD3P: 46 s−1 and 11 s−1, respectively.2 Denaturation of IRCDDA(46-kDa form of the mutant) in guanidinium chloride was monitored using fluorescence and is presented (Fig. 6) as the change in centroid of the emission spectrum (defined in Ref. 18Bishop S.M.

The data are compared with denaturation profiles from unphosphorylated and phosphorylated wild-type IRCD taken from previous work (18Bishop S.M. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3079"
https://openalex.org/W2057955738,"The neurotoxic effects of activated microglia in neurodegenerative diseases are well established. We recently provided evidence that chromogranin A (CGA), a multifunctional protein localized in dystrophic neurites and in senile plaques, induces an activated phenotype and secretion of neurotoxins by rat microglia in culture. In the present study, we focused on the mechanisms underlying neuronal degeneration triggered by CGA-activated microglia. We found that neuronal death exhibits apoptotic features, characterized by the externalization of phosphatidylserine and the fragmentation of DNA. Microglial neurotoxins markedly stimulate the phosphorylation and activity of neuronal p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and provoke the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, which precedes apoptosis. Inhibition of p38 kinase with SB 203580 partially protects neurons from death induced by CGA-activated microglia. Furthermore, neurons are also protected by Fas-Fc, which antagonizes the interactions between the death receptor Fas and its ligand FasL and by cell-permeable peptides that inhibit caspases 8 and 3. Thus, CGA triggers the release of microglial neurotoxins that mobilize several death-signaling pathways in neurons. Our results further support the idea that CGA, which is up-regulated in many neuropathologies, represents a potent endogeneous inflammatory factor possibly responsible for neuronal degeneration.

Our results further support the idea that CGA, which is up-regulated in many neuropathologies, represents a potent endogeneous inflammatory factor possibly responsible for neuronal degeneration. Destruction of neurons by apoptosis and necrosis is the underlying mechanism in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and, thus, represents an area of intense interest (1Pettmann B. Henderson C.E.

Activated microglial cells are capable of releasing cytotoxic agents, including cytokines, complement proteins, proteolytic enzymes, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen intermediates, andN-methyl-d-aspartate-like toxins (3Banati R.B.

Therefore, activation of microglia is considered to contribute to neuronal injury and has important pathogenic implications in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, or immunodeficiency virus-associated dementia (4Giulian D.

Despite their clinical importance, the brain-derived factors that control microglial activation and the precise intracellular mechanisms involved in microglial cytotoxicity remain elusive. The main constituent of amyloid plaques, β-amyloid protein, is believed to play a causal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and other neuropathological disorders (9McGeer P.L. Kawamata T. Walker D.G. Akiyama H. Tooyama I. McGeer E.G Glia. 1993; 7: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 10Cotman C.W. Su J.H.

Studies with synthetic peptides show that β-amyloid protein is directly toxic to cultured neurons (12Meda L. Cassatella M.A. Szendrei G.I. Otvos L. Baron P. Villalba M. Ferrari D. Rossi F. Nature. 1995; 374: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 13Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H. Roher A. Slattery T. Zhao L. Nagashima M. Morser J. Migheli A. Nawroth P. Stern D.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 9McGeer P.L. Kawamata T. Walker D.G. Akiyama H. Tooyama I.

Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 321-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). However, the initial events that precede the deposit of the neurotoxic form of β-amyloid protein as well as the direct contribution of activated microglia to the execution of neuronal apoptosis are not clear. Understanding these steps may therefore be relevant for the identification of novel therapeutic strategies in treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Chromogranin A (CGA)1 is a polypeptide chain of 431–445 amino acids corresponding to a 48–52-kDa glycoprotein (14Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) that is widely distributed in endocrine and nervous tissue. In all tissues examined so far, CGA is proteolytically processed into peptides, of which some have defined biological activity (14Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 20Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J.

For instance, CGA-derived peptides have been shown to regulate secretion in various endocrine cell types (22Tatemoto K. Efendic S. Mutt V. Makk G. Feistner G.J. Barchas J.D. Nature. 1986; 324: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 23Fasciotto B.H. Trauss C.A. Greeley G.H. Cohn D.V.

CGA and its proteolytic fragments have been found together with β-amyloid protein in senile and pre-amyloid plaques (11Dickson D.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Hirnforsch. 1998; 39: 175-181PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be one of the endogeneous factors released from damaged neurons into brain deposits. We previously determined that CGA is able to induce an activated phenotype in cultured microglia, characterized by changes in morphology and actin organization, generation of nitric oxide, secretion of tumor necrosis factor α, and production of heat-stable diffusable factors that provoke neuronal degeneration (26Taupenot L.

A recombinant N-terminal fragment of human CGA, vasostatin I, corresponding to residues 1–78, stimulates secretion of microglial neurotoxins to a similar extent, suggesting that the active domain is present in the N-terminal region of the CGA molecule (27Ciesielski-Treska J.

In the present study, we focused on the mechanisms underlying neuronal death induced by CGA-activated microglia. We found that the death domain-containing receptors Fas/Apo1/CD95, which belong to tumor necrosis factor receptor family (29Green D. Kroemer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), and the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 are possible transductors of the neuronal response to microglial neurotoxins. The pathways mobilized in neurons also include release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (28Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar) and activation of caspases 8 and 3. These results further support the idea that CGA represents a potent brain endogenous inflammatory factor capable of inducing the production of microglial neurotoxins responsible for the mobilization of several apoptotic cascades within neurons. CGA was purified from bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin granules as described by Simon et al. (30Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), with an additional purification step on a column of Ultraspherogel Sec 2000 (7.5 × 30 mm, Beckman). Stock solutions usually containing 50 μm CGA were separated into aliquots and stored at −20 °C. The final CGA preparation was composed of the native 70-kDa CGA (60% of the total proteins) and smaller processed components (60 to 43 kDa), together representing 40% of the total protein, as estimated from scanned monodimensional electrophoretic profiles. Immunoblotting indicated that all protein bands were immunoreactive with specific anti-native CGA antibodies (31Cetin Y. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Galindo E. Jörns A. Bargstein G. Grube D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and anti-CGA(124–143) antibodies (30Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis (by automatic Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 473A microsequencer) demonstrated that the final CGA preparation contained only CGA-derived sequences with 80% of the sequenced material containing the N-terminal sequence of CGA (LPVNS). The activity of the CGA preparations was systematically controlled by measuring the production of NO in microglial cell cultures as described previously (26Taupenot L. Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Taupenot L. Chasserot-Golaz S. Corti A. Aunis D.

The content of endotoxin in the CGA preparations was determined at the Institut d'Hygiène et de Médecine Préventive (Strasbourg, France) with the chromogenic Limulus amoebocyte lysate test (Coamatic Endotoxin Chromogenix, Biogenic, Maurin, France). At 10 nm, the CGA preparations contained less endotoxin than the culture medium alone, which itself is unable to trigger the NO production in microglial cells. CGA was usually dissolved in serum-free defined medium and applied to cultures by changing the medium at the indicated concentrations. Neuronal cell cultures were established after mechanical dispersion of cerebral cortices from Wistar fetal (day 14 of gestation) rat brain as previously described (27Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G.

Briefly, cerebral cortices cleaned from meninges were forced through a nylon sieve (pore size 48 μm) in nutrient medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cell suspension was centrifuged, and cell viability was determined with trypan blue. Viable cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 24-multiwell Falcon plates coated with poly-l-ornithine in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For immunocytochemistry, each well contained a 12-mm glass coverslip. Cells were subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. The serum-containing medium was then replaced by serum-free defined medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with transferrin (100 μg/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), albumin (100 μg/ml), progesterone (6 ng/ml), and sodium selenite (5.2 ng/ml). Microglial cells were isolated from high density glial cell cultures as previously described (26Taupenot L. Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells dissociated from cerebral hemispheres of neonatal rat brain (Wistar strain) were plated at a density of 5 × 104cells/cm2 in culture medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Culture medium was changed after 5 days and then twice a week. After 2 weeks, cultures contained glial cells including amoeboid microglia, mostly localized on the top of the cellular layer. The loosely adherent microglial cells were recovered by shaking. After centrifugation (100 × g for 5 min), cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and viable cells were then plated at a final density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well on 24-multiwell Falcon plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Nonadherent cells were removed 30 min after plating by changing the medium for serum-free defined medium. Amoeboid microglia isolated from neonatal rat brain cultures consist of flat, round, or spindle-shaped highly adherent cells. They respond to bacterial endotoxin (32Bader M.F. Taupenot L. Ulrich G. Aunis D. Ciesielski-Treska J. Glia. 1994; 11: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and express Fc (33Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Aunis D. J. Neurosci.

Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was prepared by incubating microglial cell cultures for 24 h in serum-free defined medium with or without 10 nm CGA. Medium was subsequently collected and cleared by centrifugation (1000 × g for 20 min). When necessary, the medium was stored at −20 °C and used either nondiluted or diluted to 80% with serum-free defined medium. In all experiments, conditioned medium from CGA-untreated and CGA-treated microglia were collected simultaneously and used in parallel. Co-cultures of neurons and microglial cells were prepared by plating a suspension of isolated microglia (2.5 × 105 cells) on neurons maintained 4 days in culture. Cells were incubated for 30 min in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Serum-free defined medium with or without additives was then added, and co-cultures were grown for at least 6 days. Neurons were grown for 4 days before being incubated with conditioned media from CGA-untreated or CGA-treated microglia for the indicated period of time. Recombinant human APO-1/Fas-Fc IgG (Fas-Fc) and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) with enhancer antibodies (Alexis Corp., Coger, Paris, France) were diluted in the indicated culture medium. Inhibitors of caspases, Z-DEVD-FMK (Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone) and Z-IETD-FMK (Z-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp- fluoromethyl ketone) (Calbiochem), diluted in Me2SO were used at the indicated concentrations. Controls were performed in the presence of the same concentrations of Me2SO. Neuronal survival in living cultures was estimated by incubating cells at 37 °C for 10 min with 2.5 μg/ml nuclear fluorochrome propidium iodide (PI, Sigma). Alternatively, cultures were incubated for 5 min with 0.1% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stained cells were immediately counted in three randomly chosen fields. Nuclei in paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were visualized by staining with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for 10 min at a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. Cultures were examined with a microscope equipped with an epifluorescence system and appropriate filters (Zeiss Axioscope, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and those neurons with clearly condensed and segmented chromatin were counted as apoptotic. Binding of annexin V was performed by incubating living cells (30 min, room temperature) with fluorescein-conjugated annexin V (Bioproducts, France) diluted 1/30 in serum-containing culture medium in the presence of 0.01% sodium azide. After washing and fixation, cultures were further processed for immunocytochemistry. DNA fragmentation was detected in fixed cells using the apoptosis detection system fluorescein kit (Promega) by incorporating fluorescein-12-dUTP at the 3′-OH ends of the DNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by a 5-min permeabilization with 0.02% Triton X-100 in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cultures were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min in PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin to inhibit nonspecific binding before a 1-h incubation with primary antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2, SMI 52 Sternberger Monoclonals Inc.) were used at 1/500 dilution. Monoclonal anti-cytochromec antibodies (Pharmingen clone 6H2.B4) were used at a 1/500 dilution. For detection of FasL with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (N-20 or C-178, Santa Cruz, CA), living cells were incubated with 0.1–0.2 μg/ml of IgG in serum-containing culture medium in the presence of 0.01% sodium azide at room temperature for 30 min and then fixed. After washing with PBS (5 changes, 30 min), the coverslips were incubated for 1 h with either fluorescein- or rhodamine (tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate)-conjugated affinity-purified F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse class G immunoglobulins used at 1/300 dilution (Fc fragment-specific, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Coverslips were subsequently washed with PBS (5 changes, 30 min) and mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem). Mounted coverslips were examined with a Zeiss Axioscope microscope equipped with an epifluorescence system and appropriate filters. Sequential through-focus images of labeled cells were obtained using a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 410 invert) equipped with a planapo oil (63×) immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.4) and argon 488 nm and a He/Ne 543-nm lasers. The emission signals were filtered with a 515–565 nm filter (fluorescein) or with a long pass 595-nm filter (TRITC). The images were recorded using identical laser power, wavelength, and photomultiplier tube voltage. They were recorded digitally in a 768 × 556-pixel format and saved on a magneto optical disc. Cell cultures were washed with PBS and lyzed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm leupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 100 mm sodium fluoride) containing 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 μg/ml DNase I. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) and both supernatants (Triton X-100-soluble cytosolic fractions) and pellets (Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fractions) were resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer, heated at 100 °C for 10 min, and stored in aliquots at −20 °C before processing. Cell extracts were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). Blots were processed using the Western-Light Plus chemiluminescent detection system (Tropix, Bedford, MA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The following antibodies to MAP kinases were used: anti-p38 MAP kinase, anti-phospho-specific p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182), anti-c-Jun, anti-phospho-specific c-Jun (Ser-63) II (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA), anti-p46 c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) (C-17) (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-active JNK pAb (Promega, Madison WI). Immunoreactive bands were visualized after exposure to Kodak BioMax Light-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). In some cases, blots were stripped in buffer containing 200 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Tween 20, pH 2.2, followed by washings before incubating with blocking buffer and with antibodies to actin. Cell lysates (400 μg protein) were incubated on a shaking platform overnight at 4 °C with 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose conjugated with 1 μg of either anti-p38 MAP kinase or anti-p46 JNK1 antibodies (StressGen Biotechnologie Corp., Victoria, Canada). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 500 mm NaCl followed by two washes with the same buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Kinase activity was assayed by incubating the resuspended pellet at 30 °C in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and the appropriate substrate: myelin basic protein (3 μg) for p38 MAP kinase and glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun (1 μg) for JNK1. After 20 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The proteins were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, and the gels were dried and exposed to phosphoimaging screens (BioMax Light-1, Kodak). Experiments were performed on at least six different cell cultures. In the figures, data are representative of a typical experiment and are given as the mean of at least three determinations (± S.E.). The comparison between data obtained under different experimental conditions was analyzed by Student'st test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant when p < 0.01. We previously reported that exposure of neuron/microglial co-cultures to either bovine or recombinant human CGA induces a marked reduction in neuronal-specific [γ-3H]aminobutyric acid uptake and leads to neuronal degeneration (27Ciesielski-Treska J.

To further characterize neuronal death induced by CGA-activated microglia, we examined the binding of annexin V and the fragmentation of nuclear DNA in neuron/microglial co-cultures treated with 10 nm CGA. Binding of annexin V to the cell surface reveals the translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner side of the plasma membrane to the outer layer. When used in conjunction with propidium iodide exclusion to establish membrane integrity, it indicates cells undergoing apoptosis (34Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J.

Rev. 1999; 29: 137-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, we used the TUNEL technique to label DNA fragments at the 3′-OH DNA and, thus, identify nuclear DNA that is cleaved by endonucleases (35Walton M. Connor B. Lawlor P. Young D. Sirimanne E. Gluckman P. Cole G. Dragunow M. Brain Res. Rev. 1999; 29: 137-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows representative confocal images of neurons in co-culture with microglia for 3 days incubated with or without 10 nm CGA. In untreated co-cultures (Fig.1 A) annexin V (conjugated with fluorescein) did not bind to neurons identified with anti-MAP2 antibody. In contrast, most neuronal bodies and processes in CGA-treated co-cultures were simultaneously stained for annexin V and MAP2 (Fig. 1 B). In both untreated and CGA-treated co-cultures, nuclei were generally not labeled with PI when living cells were exposed to PI before fixation, indicating that the plasma membrane is impermeable to the dye. The percentages of PI-positive, MAP2-positive neurons in resting and CGA-stimulated co-cultures were 5.8 ± 1.6 and 9.5 ± 1.9 (mean ± S.E.; n = 3), respectively. Using the TUNEL technique, labeling of nuclei was observed in only a few MAP2-positive neurons in untreated co-cultures (Fig. 1 C). However, almost all nuclei of MAP2-positive neurons were stained in co-cultures exposed to CGA (Fig. 1 D). In addition, CGA-treated co-cultures contained a substantial proportion of TUNEL-positive, MAP2-negative cells, probably corresponding to microglia. Taken together, these results suggest that CGA induces an apoptotic cascade leading to neuronal death in neuron/microglial co-cultures. To further analyze the neurotoxic effect of microglia activated by CGA, we performed experiments on neurons maintained in pure culture. We previously reported that the toxic factors secreted by CGA-activated microglia are released into the culture medium and, as such, can be collected (27Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Taupenot L. Chasserot-Golaz S. Corti A. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14339-14346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, cortical neurons were exposed to cell-free conditioned medium (CM) collected from either resting microglia or microglia treated for 24 h with 10 nm CGA, and the rate of apoptosis and necrosis was determined. In the early stages of apoptosis, the plasma membrane remains intact and impermeable to inert dyes such as trypan blue (36Joashi U.C. Greenwood K. Taylor D.L. Kozma M. Mazarakis N.D. Edwards A.D. Mehmet H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, necrosis is accompanied by a rapid loss of membrane integrity, and the cell membrane becomes permeable. As shown in Fig.2, the proportion of necrotic neurons (stained with trypan blue) in CM from resting microglia does not exceed 10% of the total cell population. Furthermore, the percentage of apoptotic neurons revealed with the nuclear stain Hoechst 33342 remained lower than 15% over the whole experimental period. In contrast, in CM from CGA-treated microglia, the proportion of neurons with apoptotic Hoechst-positive nuclei rapidly increased and reached about 50% of the total neuronal population by 96 h. The number of neurons permeable to trypan blue also increased but after a lag time of 48 h. These data indicate that the neurotoxic factors secreted by CGA-activated microglia do not directly affect the integrity of the neuronal membrane but are more likely to induce an apoptotic process in neurons. To investigate whether the neurotoxic factors secreted by CGA-treated microglia stimulate MAP kinases in neurons, we examined the presence and activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase using antibodies that recognize all forms or the phosphorylated forms of the kinases.

Recognition of these sequences by AUF1 is associated with acceleration of mRNA decay, likely involving recruitment or assembly of multi-subunit trans-acting complexes. Previously, we demonstrated that AUF1 deletion mutants formed tetramers on U-rich RNA substrates by sequential addition of protein dimers (Wilson, G. M., Sun, Y., Lu, H., and Brewer, G. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 33374–33381). Here, we show that binding of the full-length p37 isoform of AUF1 to these RNAs proceedsvia a similar mechanism, allowing delineation of equilibrium binding constants for both stages of tetramer assembly. However, association of AUF1 with the ARE from tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) mRNA was significantly inhibited by magnesium ions. Further fluorescence and hydrodynamic experiments indicated that Mg2+ induced or stabilized a conformational change in the TNFα ARE. Based on the solution of parameters describing both the protein-RNA and Mg2+-RNA equilibria, we present a dynamic, global equilibrium binding model describing the relationship between Mg2+ and AUF1 binding to the TNFα ARE. These studies provide the first evidence that some AREs may adopt higher order RNA structures that regulate their interaction withtrans-acting factors and indicate that mRNA structural remodeling has the potential to modulate the turnover rates of some ARE-containing mRNAs.

A+U-rich element cyanine 3 fluorescein fluorescence resonance energy transfer tumor necrosis factor α In eukaryotes, the cytoplasmic concentration of an mRNA is a critical determinant of its potential for translation and hence the production rate of the encoded gene product. As such, the rate of cytoplasmic mRNA decay influences both the timing and level of expression of many gene products, involving either defined constitutive mRNA decay rates or modulation of mRNA turnover rates in response to external stimuli (reviewed in Refs. 1Ross J.

Many mammalian mRNAs encoding oncoproteins, cytokines/lymphokines, inflammatory mediators, and G protein-coupled receptors are unstable, owing to the presence of A+U-rich elements (AREs)1 in their 3′-untranslated regions (3Shaw G.

AREs comprise a diverse family of U-rich RNA sequences varying in length from 40 to 150 bases and frequently containing one or more motifs of the form AUUUA, which may be overlapping or dispersed (7Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). In general, mRNA turnover mediated by AREs is characterized by rapid shortening of the poly(A) tail followed by degradation of the mRNA body (8Shyu A.-B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 9Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34770-34774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16174-16179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although several proteins have been identified that may bind A+U-rich RNA sequences (reviewed in Ref. 11Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the mechanisms linking association oftrans-acting factors with accelerated mRNA decay remain largely unknown. The ARE-binding protein that has been most extensively characterized is AUF1. The AUF1 gene encodes a family of four protein isoforms generated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing that are denoted by their apparent molecular weights as p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1, and p45AUF1 (12Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Normally, the p42 and p45 isoforms appear exclusively nuclear (13Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 14Arao Y. Kuriyama R. Kayama F. Kato S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), likely owing to an isoform-specific protein sequence that binds scaffold attachment factor-B, a protein associated with the nuclear matrix (14Arao Y. Kuriyama R. Kayama F. Kato S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence demonstrate that association of cytoplasmic p37AUF1 and/or p40AUF1 with an ARE is associated with acceleration of mRNA turnover. First, a protein complex containing cytoplasmic p37AUF1 and p40AUF1 is sufficient to destabilize polysomal c-myc mRNA in vitro (15Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Second, AUF1 associates directly with A+U-rich RNA sequences, and the affinity of recombinant p37AUF1 for an ARE closely correlates with the potential of the ARE to destabilize an mRNA in cis (16DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Third, inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway stabilizes ARE-containing mRNAs (17Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell.

Fourth, the efficiency of ARE-directed mRNA turnover is compromised in cells expressing low levels of endogenous p37AUF1 and p40AUF1 (20Buzby J.S. Lee S. van Winkle P. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G.

Conversely, an increase in AUF1 protein levels during congestive heart failure accompanies a decrease in levels of β1-adrenergic receptor mRNA (23Bristow M.R. Minobe W.A. Raynolds M.V. Port J.D.

The β1-adrenergic receptor transcript also contains an ARE in its 3′-untranslated region that associates with AUF1 (24Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W.A. Sherman J.A.

Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) including the translation initiation factor eIF4G, poly(A)-binding protein, and the heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsc70 (27Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), we proposed that the oligomerization of AUF1 on an ARE nucleates the assembly of a trans-acting, mRNA-destabilizing complex on the RNA (11Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As such, the potential of an ARE to associate with AUF1 and promote protein oligomerization may be a critical determinant of mRNA turnover efficiency. In this work, we have continued to define molecular mechanisms contributing to the recognition of AREs by AUF1. Using a fluorescence anisotropy-based assay for RNA-protein binding, we observed that the association of AUF1 to the ARE from tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA was inhibited by magnesium ions, whereas AUF1 binding to a similarly sized polyuridylate sequence was largely unaffected. We present evidence that the TNFα ARE exhibits a conformational change upon association with Mg2+ with the net result of restricting RNA flexibility and shortening the distance between the 5′- and 3′-termini of the RNA substrate. Based on independent assessments of AUF1-ARE and Mg2+-ARE binding equilibria, we have constructed a model for inhibition of AUF1 binding and oligomerization to the TNFα ARE in the presence of Mg2+. To our knowledge, this represents the first indication that higher order RNA structures may regulate the association of trans-acting factors with an ARE. The sequences and fluorophore positions of RNA substrates (2′-hydroxyl) used in this study are listed in Table I. All substrates containing 5′-fluorescein (Fl) or 5′-cyanine 3 (Cy3) groups were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Boulder, CO), then 2′-O-deprotected according to the manufacturer's instructions (28Scaringe S.A. Wincott F.E. Caruthers M.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11820-11821Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and evaporated to dryness in a Speed-Vac. Deprotected RNA substrates were dissolved in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and quantified by A260, with estimates of RNA extinction coefficients calculated as described (29Fasman, G. D. (ed.).

For fluorescein-conjugated RNA probes, A260 was corrected by quantitation of the fluorescein moiety at 493 nm with ε493, Fl = 74,600m−1·cm−1 and ε260, Fl = 26,000m−1·cm−1 as described (30Heyduk T.

Fluorescein labels were added to the 3′-ends of these RNAs by periodate oxidation and conjugation with Alexa Fluor 488 hydrazide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described (31Qin P.Z. Pyle A.M. Methods Compan. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 18: 60-70Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to generate TNFα ARE-Fl and P-TNF3′-Fl. Unconjugated fluorophore was removed from the labeled RNA preparations by passage through two Quick Spin G-25 spin columns (Roche Molecular Biologicals). The yields of RNA and conjugated fluorophore were monitored by absorbance as described above, with fluorophore coupling efficiencies typically >95%. The double-labeled RNA oligonucleotide Cy-TNF-Fl was constructed by ligation of RNA substrates Cy-TNF5′ and P-TNF3′-Fl using T4 DNA ligase and a bridging antisense DNA oligonucleotide as described (32Yu Y.-T. Methods Compan. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 18: 13-21Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Following ligation, the reaction was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and quickly cooled on ice to denature DNA-RNA hybrids. The bridging DNA oligonucleotide was then digested with RQ1-DNaseI. Ligated RNA molecules were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were recovered as described (33Ford L.P. Wilusz J. Methods Compan. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 21-27Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The yield of Cy-TNF-Fl RNA was estimated by measurement of total fluorescence intensity of the Cy3 moiety (λex = 535 nm; λem = 580 nm) and comparison with a standard curve of Cy-TNFα ARE RNA. This assumes that the fluorescence quantum yield of the 5′-Cy3 group was not significantly affected by the addition of the fluorescein moiety to the 3′-end of the RNA, because placement of the fluorophores on opposite ends of the RNA substrate and the overall hydrophilicity of RNA make it unlikely that the 3′-Fl could substantially alter the chemical environment of the 5′-Cy group. The complete coding sequence of p37AUF1 was excised from pTrcHisB-p37AUF1(16DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) by digestion with Acc65I + HindIII and subcloned into similarly digested pBAD/HisB (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to generate pBAD/HisB-p37AUF1. Recombinant His6-p37AUF1 was expressed from this plasmid inEscherichia coli TOP10 cells induced with 0.0002% arabinose for 4 h. Cells were disrupted by four rounds of sonication as described (34Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods Compan. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, inclusion of polyethylene glycol-6000 in the lysis buffer (5% final) abrogated the need for freeze-thaw cycles. Purification of His6-p37AUF1 was performed by Ni2+ affinity chromatography using a HiTrap Chelating affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column (1 ml) was prerinsed at 120 ml/h with 8 column volumes of deionized water, charged with 6 volumes of 20 mm NiCl2, rinsed with 8 volumes of deionized water and 6 volumes of native imidazole elution buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mmNaCl, 300 mm imidazole, pH 6.3), and equilibrated with 8 volumes buffer 1 (50 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The cleared bacterial cell lysate was applied at 60 ml/h and washed with buffer 1 until A280 reached base line. His6 proteins were eluted in native imidazole elution buffer at 30 ml/h with fractions monitored by A280. Peak fractions were pooled, buffer exchanged into 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) using HiTrap Desalting columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer, and concentrated using a Centricon YM-30 concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Protein concentrations were determined by comparison of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing recombinant His6-p37AUF1 and a titration of bovine serum albumin. Quantitation of band intensities was performed using the Kodak EDAS 120 gel documentation system and accompanying one-dimensional image analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Association of recombinant His6-p37AUF1 with fluorescent RNA substrates was monitored by changes in the anisotropy of the fluorescein moiety following protein binding. Anisotropy is related to the rotational relaxation time of the fluorophore in solution (35Weber G. Biochem. J. 1952; 51: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 36Checovich W.J. Bolger R.E. Burke T. Nature. 1995; 373: 254-256Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which, for a linear polymer like RNA, is dependent on gross molecular volume and/or intramolecular segmental motion under conditions of constant temperature and viscosity (35Weber G. Biochem. J. 1952; 51: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made using the Beacon 2000 Variable Temperature Fluorescence Polarization System (Panvera, Madison, WI) equipped with fluorescein excitation (490 nm) and emission (535 nm) filters. Binding reactions were performed with a range of His6-p37AUF1protein concentrations and 0.2 nm fluorescein-labeled RNA in a final volume of 100 μl containing 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mmdithiolthreitol, 0.1 mm spermine, and 0.1 μg/μl acetylated bovine serum albumin. Heparin (1 μg/μl) was included in RNA-protein binding reactions to inhibit nonspecific RNA binding activity. This concentration of heparin effectively prevented association of His6-p37AUF1 (up to 250 nm protein dimer) with a fluorescent RNA substrate encoding a fragment of the β-globin coding region (Ref. 25Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and data not shown). Magnesium acetate was used as a source of Mg2+ ions where indicated. Samples lacking Mg2+ contained 0.5 mm EDTA unless otherwise noted. For equilibrium binding experiments, the polarimeter was operated in static mode, with each sample read as blank prior to addition of fluorescent RNA substrates. Following probe addition, samples were incubated for 1 min at 25 °C before anisotropy was measured. Preliminary on-rate analyses demonstrated that anisotropic equilibrium was reached within 10–20 s at this temperature for all binding equilibria described in this report (data not shown). Data points represent the mean of 10 anisotropy measurements for each binding reaction. For evaluation of Mg2+ binding events involving RNA in the absence of protein, Mg2+ titrations were monitored by fluorescence ansiotropy as described above but in buffers lacking heparin. Parallel titrations including heparin (1 μg/μl) yielded consistent equilibrium constants for data sets between 0 and 5 mm Mg2+ but with small increases in absolute anisotropy values (data not shown). At higher Mg2+concentrations, however, more significant nonspecific increases in anisotropy were observed in the presence of heparin, possibly because of increases in sample viscosity resulting from the formation of heparin·Mg2+ aggregates. Concomitant with measurement of anisotropy values, total fluorescence intensity was monitored for each sample to detect changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of the fluorescein moiety as described (25Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For all experiments described in this work, total fluorescence intensity did not vary significantly as a result of protein or cation binding (see Fig. 1, A and B, and data not shown). Accordingly, the total measured fluorescence anisotropy (At) of a mixture of fluorescent species was interpreted by simple additivity using Equation 1.At=∑iAifiEquation 1 Ai represents the intrinsic anisotropy of each fluorescent species and fi its fractional concentration (35Weber G. Biochem. J. 1952; 51: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 37Otto M.R. Lillo M.P. Beechem J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2511-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Jameson D.M. Sawyer W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Using C-terminal deletion mutants of AUF1, a previous study demonstrated that AUF1 association with short U-rich RNA substrates was well described by sequential binding of AUF1 dimers (25Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Applying this model to Equation 1, the total measured anisotropy of AUF1-RNA binding reactions performed in the absence of Mg2+ plotted against the concentration of added protein dimer (P2) resolved to Equation 2 under conditions of limiting [RNA] (i.e. [P2]free≈ [P2]total).At=AR+AP2RK1[P2]+AP4RK1K2[P2]21+K1[P2]+K1K2[P2]2Equation 2 Here, AR,AP2R, andAP4R represent the intrinsic anisotropy values of the free RNA (R), AUF1 dimer-bound RNA (P2R), and AUF1 tetramer-bound RNA (P4R), respectively. K1 is the constant describing the R + P2 ⇌ P2R equilibrium, whereasK2 describes the P2R+ P2⇌ P4R equilibrium (see Fig. 1 E). Additional algorithms employed in analysis of binding equilibria by fluorescence anisotropy are described in the text where applicable. The application of binding algorithms to experimental data was performed by nonlinear regression using PRISM, version 2.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The validity of all mathematical models was evaluated by the coefficient of determination (R 2) and analysis of residual plot nonrandomness to detect any bias for data subsets (PRISM). Where necessary, pair-wise comparisons of sum-of-squares deviations between mathematical models were performed using theF test (PRISM), with differences exhibitingp < 0.05 considered significant. Changes in the distance between the 5′- and 3′-termini of double-labeled RNA substrates were monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), using a modification of the method of Walter et al. (39Walter N.G. Hampel K.J. Brown K.M. Burke J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Reactions were assembled as described above for evaluation of cation binding events involving RNA in the absence of protein. All measurements of fluorescence intensity were made using the Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarimeter (Panvera) operating in direct fluorescence mode. Prior to addition of fluorescent RNA substrates, background fluorescence emission (λex = 490 nm) was measured for each sample at 535 and 580 nm, given byB535 and B580, respectively. Following probe addition, samples were incubated for 1 min at 25 °C prior to measurement of total fluorescence intensity at the same wavelengths, giving F535 andF580. FRET efficiency in this system was approximated by the ratio Q = (F580 −B580)/(F535 −B535). For analysis of cation-RNA binding equilibria, Q was normalized to an approximation of the FRET efficiency in the absence of cation (Q0), to give the relative FRET efficiency (Q −Q0)/Q0. For size fractionation of RNA substrates, a 0.9 × 30-cm column loaded with Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was washed with 0.1 m NaOH for 2 h prior to equilibration with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated gel filtration buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, 100 mmpotassium acetate, 2 mm dithiolthreitol, pH 8.0) containing or lacking 5 mm magnesium acetate. RNA samples (1 nmol) were loaded in 0.2 ml of gel filtration buffer containing 2% dextrose and either 0.5 mm EDTA or 5 mm magnesium acetate. Elution of RNA was monitored by A254. The column was calibrated by monitoring the elution of protein standards (Sigma) by A280: soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), and aprotinin (6.4 kDa). Column void volume was determined using blue dextran. Previously, we demonstrated that a recombinant p37AUF1 deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 29 amino acid residues (His6-p37AUF1-(1–257)) interacts with the core ARE sequence from TNFα mRNA, encoded by the RNA substrate Fl-TNFα ARE (TableI), by monitoring changes in the anisotropy of the fluorescein moiety of the RNA resulting from protein binding (25Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This RNA sequence is a potent mRNA-destabilizing element (40Xu N. Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and contributes to the extreme instability of TNFα mRNA in vivo (41Raabe T. Bukrinsky M.

Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Like the full-length His6-p37AUF1, His6-p37AUF1 (1) contains an N-terminal dimerization domain (26DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27635-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and exists as a dimer in solution (25Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the presence of an RNA substrate containing the TNFα ARE or the polyuridylate sequence contained within Fl-U32 (Table I), His6-p37AUF1- (1) dimers associate sequentially to form a tetrameric protein complex on the RNA (25Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Neither the dimerization (26DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27635-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) nor the RNA-binding activities (25Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) of AUF1 proteins are affected by the presence of the N-terminal His6 tag. The association of recombinant His6-p37AUF1with the RNA substrates Fl-TNFα ARE and Fl-U32 was analyzed by measurement of the total fluorescence intensity and fluorescence anisotropy of binding reactions containing the fluorescent RNA substrates and titrations of recombinant protein (Fig.1). For both the Fl-TNFα ARE and Fl-U32 substrates, increasing the concentration of His6-p37AUF1 had little effect on total fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that the fluorescence quantum yield was not significantly affected by the presence of His6-p37AUF1. As such, the contribution of each fluorescent species (RNA or RNA·protein complexes) to the total measured anisotropy (At) could be defined as the product of its intrinsic anisotropy (Ai) and its fractional concentration (fi), described in Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Adapting this algorithm to the RNA-dependent formation of AUF1 tetramers by sequential association of protein dimers (Fig. 1 E) yields Equation 2(25Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G."

The amount of G6PD mRNA at different stages of processing was measured in RNA isolated from the nuclear matrix fraction of mouse liver. This nuclear fraction contains nascent transcripts and RNA undergoing processing. Using a ribonuclease protection assay with probes that cross an exon-intron boundary in the G6PD transcript, the abundance of mRNAs that contain the intron (unspliced) and without the intron (spliced) was measured. Refeeding resulted in 6- and 8-fold increases in abundance of G6PD unspliced and spliced RNA, respectively, in the nuclear matrix fraction. However, the amount of G6PD unspliced RNA was at most 15% of the amount of spliced RNA. During refeeding, G6PD spliced RNA accumulated at a rate significantly greater than unspliced RNA. Further, the amount of partially spliced RNA exceeded the amount of unspliced RNA indicating that the enhanced accumulation occurs early in processing. Starvation and refeeding did not regulate either the rate of polyadenylation or the length of the poly(A) tail. Thus, the G6PD gene is regulated during refeeding by enhanced efficiency of splicing of its RNA, and this processing protects the mRNA from decay, a novel mechanism for nutritional regulation of gene expression.

All cells contain G6PD activity; however, nutritional and hormonal factors only regulate the expression of the enzyme in liver and adipose tissue (1Glock G.E. McLean P. Biochem. J. 1954; 56: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2Glock G.E. McLean P. Biochem. J. 1955; 61: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 3Tepperman H.M. Tepperman J. Am. J. Physiol. 1964; 206: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Regulation of G6PD activity in these tissues is because it plays a critical role in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids by providing 50–75% of the NADPH for the fatty acid synthase reaction (4Rognstad R. Katz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11969-11972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, G6PD is a member of the lipogenic enzyme family. The activities of the lipogenic enzymes are coordinately regulated so that flux of substrate through the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway is high when animals consume a diet rich in carbohydrate and flux is decreased by starvation or the addition of polyunsaturated fat to the diet (reviewed in Ref. 5Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms causing these changes in flux vary considerably between enzymes. The enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway are regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional steps. Fatty acid synthase (6Blake W.L. Clarke S.D. J.

Commun. 1992; 189: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) undergo large changes in their transcriptional rates in response to dietary manipulations. Regulation of malic enzyme expression during a chow to fat-free diet transition occurs by changes in mRNA stability in the cytoplasm (13Dozin B. Rall J.E. Nikodem V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, cytoplasmic mRNA stability is also involved in the regulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase expression by fatty acids in yeast (14Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25801-25809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and in adipocytes (15Sessler A.M. Kaur N. Palta J.P. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol.

Posttranscriptional regulation is the primary mechanism involved in the nutritional regulation of G6PD expression and the mechanism involved occurs entirely within the nucleus. G6PD expression undergoes large changes in expression in the livers of starved and refed mice and rats (3Tepperman H.M. Tepperman J. Am. J.

Despite the 12–15-fold increase in G6PD mRNA abundance in the refed mouse, the transcriptional activity of the gene is not changed (22Stabile L.P. Hodge D.L. Klautky S.A. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This increase in cytoplasmic G6PD mRNA due to refeeding is accompanied by an increase in the amount of G6PD precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) in the nucleus implicating steps early in the processing pathway as a potentially regulated point (23Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Further, the increases in the cytoplasmic pool of G6PD mRNA are preceded by changes in the amount of the nuclear pool indicating that nuclear transport of the mature mRNA is not regulated (23Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nutritional regulation of gene expression primarily at a nuclear posttranscriptional level is a novel observation for a lipogenic gene. G6PD is an excellent model to further study nuclear posttranscriptional regulation because of the absence of transcriptional changes, which confound the interpretation of results. The steps involved in processing of nascent transcripts into mature mRNA appear to be organized in a dynamic manner within the nucleus. Both the transcription of an RNA and its processing are spatially linked within the nucleus, such that only the mature mRNA leaves the site of transcription. The insoluble portion of the nucleus, which is the material remaining after sequential extraction of cells with detergent, DNase I, and salt (24Berezney R. Coffey D.S. J.

The spatial link between transcription and processing appears to be facilitated by RNA polymerase II. Upon phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of polymerase II, proteins involved in capping, splicing and polyadenylation bind to this domain and are thought to be transported to their site of action during the elongation process (35Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,36McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). RNA that is not correctly processed does not leave the site of transcription and is degraded (37Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Geraghty F. Pereira H.S. Grosveld F. Antoniou M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, the entry of a nascent transcript into the processing pathway and its efficient maturation are potential control points in the regulation of gene expression. In this report, we present new results that nutritional regulation of G6PD expression occurs by changes in the efficiency of G6PD pre-mRNA splicing. We have explored this mechanism for regulation by measuring the amount of G6PD RNA that is undergoing processing in the livers of mice during starvation and refeeding a high carbohydrate diet. Refeeding a high carbohydrate diet enhanced the accumulation of G6PD mRNA in the processing pathway. The enhanced accumulation of G6PD mRNA was observed for RNA that was undergoing splicing regardless of the presence or absence of the poly(A) tail. Further, the length of the poly(A) tail was not regulated by nutritional changes. Thus, regulation by changes in the efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing represents an important mechanism for control of gene expression by nutritional status. Understanding the mechanisms by which nutrients alter nuclear posttranscriptional events will provide new information on the breadth of mechanisms involved in gene regulation. HepG2 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (v/v; Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells were a gift of Dr. Mike Miller (West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (50 μg/ml). Rat hepatocytes were prepared as described previously (38Stabile L.P. Klautky S.A. Minor S.M. Salati L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1951-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates of MCF7 cells and rat hepatocytes were prepared by sonication of cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Male C57BL/6 mice (NCI, Charles River Laboratory, Frederick, MD; 4 weeks of age) were adapted to a reverse-cycle room (light cycle 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.; dark cycle 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) for 7 days while maintained on a standard chow diet (Harlan Teklad). Adaptation to a reverse light cycle permits the experiments to be done during typical work hours. Mice were switched to a fat-free diet with glucose as the carbohydrate source (PMI Feeds) supplemented with 1% (by weight) safflower oil as a source of essential fatty acids. Diet was prepared fresh daily, and the safflower oil was stored under N2 to minimize oxidation. Mice received the high carbohydrate, low fat diet ad libitumfor 7 days. On day 8, the food was removed for a 24-h starvation period followed by returning the diet for 24 h or for the times indicated in the figures. Cellular fractionation was by a modification of the method of Leppard and Shenk (39Leppard K.N. Shenk T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All steps except the DNase I digestion were preformed at −20 °C with 40% glycerol added to the buffers to prevent freezing (28Ciejek E.M. Nordstrom J.L. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4945-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All solutions and glassware were treated to be RNase-free. Intactness of the RNA was monitored using Northern gels (data not shown); only intact RNA was used in subsequent steps. This modification was found to be superior to the use of vanadyl ribonucleoside complexes or a placental ribonuclease inhibitor in obtaining intact RNA. Each mouse liver (or 2 × 107 cells in half the buffer volume) was homogenized in 6 ml isotonic buffer (150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 40% glycerol) with a motor driven Teflon pestle for 30 s. The cells were lysed by addition of 300 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 (0.05%) and incubation at −20 °C for 5 min. The cytoplasmic fraction was collected following centrifugation at 2500 × g for 10 min. The crude nuclear pellet was washed in 3 ml of isotonic buffer and then was resuspended in 3 ml of isotonic buffer containing Nonidet P-40 (0.5%) and sodium deoxycholate (0.25%). The mixture was vortexed and incubated at −20 °C for 5 min. The nuclear mixture was centrifuged as before, the supernatant was reserved, and was the nuclear membrane fraction. The remaining nuclear pellet was washed in 2 ml of reticulocyte suspension buffer (RSB; 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 40% glycerol), pelleted as before, and the supernatant was added to the nuclear membrane fraction. The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in 500 μl of RSB (no glycerol) and incubated with RNase-free DNase I (1000 units, Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 500 units of Prime RNase inhibitor (5Prime → 3Prime, Inc.) at 4 °C for 25 min (for Western analysis, ribonucleoside vanadyl complexes (5 mm; Sigma) were added instead of the protein based inhibitor). At the end of the DNase I digestion, glycerol (40%) was added and the mixture was centrifuged (2500 × g, −20 °C, 15 min). The supernatant was reserved and was the nuclear soluble fraction. Nuclei were depleted of digested chromatin and associated proteins by addition of 2 ml of RSB and NaCl (1 m) and incubation for 10 min at −20 °C. The remaining nuclear material was pelleted as before, and the supernatant was added to the nuclear soluble fraction. The final pellet of insoluble nuclear material was reserved and is referred to here as the nuclear matrix (39Leppard K.N. Shenk T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from the cytoplasm, nuclear membrane, and nuclear soluble fractions by addition of an equal volume of denaturing solution (8 m urea, 350 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) (39Leppard K.N. Shenk T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An equal volume of phenol/chloroform (6:4) and 0.1 volume sodium acetate (2 m, pH 4.0) were added, and the mixture was vortexed and incubated on ice for 15 min. Following centrifugation to separate the layers, the aqueous phase from each fraction was removed and the RNA was precipitated by addition of equal volume of isopropanol. RNA from the nuclear matrix pellet was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (40Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared by the citric acid protocol as described (23Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from the nuclear pellet by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (40Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Proteins in the cellular fractions (except nuclear matrix) were concentrated using a Centricon 30 (Amicon, Inc.). The protein concentration was measured by a modified Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as the standard (Sigma). The protein samples were separated by size in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in duplicate (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). One gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the other gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 500 mA overnight at 4 °C. Western analysis for NuMA (nuclear mitoticapparatus protein) used anti-NuMA monoclonal antibody-1 (mAb-1; recognizes amino acids 900–2100, Oncogene Research Products; 1:500 dilution in PBS), and anti-NuMA mAb-2 (recognizes amino acids 658–691, Oncogene Research Products; 1:100 dilution in PBS) per the manufacturer's instructions. After washing with PBS, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL) secondary antibody (1:15,000 dilution in PBS). For detection of SRm160 (SR-related matrix protein of approximately 160 kDa), mAb-B1C8 was used (42Wan K.M. Nickerson J.A. Krockmalnic G. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); mAb-B1C8 was a gift of Dr. Jeffrey Nickerson (University of Massachusetts, Worchester, MA). After washing with PBS, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (KPL) secondary antibody (1:15,000 dilution in PBS plus Tween 20). In other experiments to detect the nonspecific binding, the primary antibody was omitted. Signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL™) detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Several probes were designed for use in ribonuclease protection assays (Fig. 1). In all cases, the full-length transcripts were designed to be larger than the protected fragments so that incompletely digested probe could be differentiated from the target signal in the ribonuclease protection assay. All probes were sequenced to verify their structure. The nucleotide distribution in all probes and resulting protected fragments was similar. Two G6PD probes, exon 2-intron 2 and intron 8-exon 9, were made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a genomic clone of G6PD using gene-specific primers and have been described previously (23Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The G6PD exon 2-intron 2 probe was shortened by 121 nt by digestion with KpnI. The next probe, which spans exon 8, intron 8, exon 9, and intron 9, was made to detect more than one pre-mRNA. The pBG 2 subclone was made using a G6PD genomic clone (G6PD-B; Ref. 22Stabile L.P. Hodge D.L. Klautky S.A. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which contains a 1.2-kilobase pair HindIII-SacI fragment spanning intron 7-intron 9. This genomic subclone was digested withHindIII, PstI, and SacI and the fragment spanning exon 8 to intron 9 was ligated into pBluescript KS+. Prior to use in the probe synthesis reaction, the plasmid was linearized with XhoI. The final G6PD probe spans the polyadenylation/cleavage site in the 3′-UTR so it can detect the abundance of polyadenylated RNA after cleavage, as well as uncleaved RNA in a ribonuclease protection assay. DNA was amplified using PCR between the XbaI site in the 3′-UTR of the G6PD mRNA and 157 nt downstream of the cleavage site. A Bpu1102I site was added to the 3′ primer for cloning purposes. The amplified sequence was ligated into pBluescript KS+, and the plasmid was linearized with NotI prior to use in the probe synthesis reaction. The spot 14 subclone was synthesized from mouse genomic DNA by PCR amplification. The 5′ primer was 5′-GGAATTCGCAGCCTCCATCACATCCTTAC-3′; the underlined sequence is an EcoRI site for subcloning followed by spot 14 exon 1 sequence (43Grillasca J.P. Gastaldi M. Khiri H. Dace A. Peyrol N. Reynier P. Torresani J. Planells R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The 3′ primer was 5′-GGGATCCACCGCCATTTATCTCCTCCCTC-3′; the BamHI restriction site for subcloning is underlined and is followed by spot 14 intron sequence (this sequence was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Planells, INSERM, Marseille, France). The β-actin subclone was synthesized from mouse genomic DNA by PCR amplification using the 5′ primer, 5′-GGAATTCGGCAGCGGCTGCTCTTGG-3′ and the 3′ primer, 5′-GGGATCCGCCCACGATGGAGGGGA-3′. The 5′ primer includes anEcoRI restriction site (underlined) followed by β-actin intron 1 sequence (this sequence was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Getz, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). The 3′ primer includes theBamHI restriction site (underlined) followed by β-actin exon 2 sequence (44Elder P.K. French C.L. Subramaniam M. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Following amplification, the DNA fragments were gel-purified and ligated into pBluescript KS+. The β-actin exon protected fragment (114 bp) was too close in size to the spot 14 exon protected fragment (118 bp). Thus, the β-actin clone was cleaved with SmaI and EcoRI and ligated into pBluescript KS+ restriction sites, resulting in a β-actin exon protected fragment of 90 bp. The 18 S rRNA probe, which was used as a control for RNA loading, was made from pRTI 18 S template (Ambion, Austin, TX). An additional probe was made for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) RNA, to check for contamination of cytoplasm RNA into the nuclear fractions. The CAT probe was derived from pRTI CAT (Ambion). To make both sense and antisense CAT RNA, the pRTI CAT template was digested withSstI and BamHI, blunt-ended, and ligated into theSmaI site. Synthesis of the RNA probes using an in vitro transcription reaction and the ribonuclease protection assay were as previously described (23Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). RNA (20 μg) was hybridized with 2 × 104 cpm32P-labeled each G6PD probe (specific activity ∼108 cpm/μg) and 5000 cpm of 18 S rRNA probe (specific activity ∼10,000 cpm/μg) or 7 μg of RNA hybridized with 4 × 104 cpm each of 32P-labeled spot 14 and β-actin probe (specific activity ∼108 cpm/μg) at 45 °C for 16 h. The amount of probe was determined empirically to ensure that it was present in molar excess over the transcript. The hybrids protected from digestion with RNase were resolved in a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The dried gel was placed into a storage phosphor cassette (for 1–3 days). Images were visualized and quantified using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). Statistical analysis in Fig. 5 was done using analysis of variance, and the slopes were tested for parallelism. RNase H analysis was done by a modification of the method of Curthoys and Porter (45Porter D. Curthoys N.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μg of RNA from the nuclei of starved mice and 15 μg of nuclear RNA from refed mice was mixed with 370 ng of a G6PD specific oligonucleotide (5′-CTAAGGCTCCTCCCCATTGTTCC-3′, nucleotides 1972–1994 of the cDNA sequence) (46Zollo M. D'Urso M. Schlessinger D. Chen E.Y. DNA Seq. 1993; 3: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mixture was heated to 70 °C and then cooled to room temperature over 10 min (47Carrazana E.J. Pasieka K.B. Majzoub J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2267-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Digestion with RNase H was for 20 min at 37 °C. The samples were run on a Northern gel, transferred to GeneScreen, and hybridized with a probe to the 3′ end of the G6PD mRNA. Experiments were performed to determine the amount of cytoplasmic RNA present in each nuclear fraction. The 6 ml of homogenization buffer for each liver sample was spiked with 5 ng of in vitro synthesized sense CAT RNA. Fractionation was carried out as before. RNA (20 μg) from each fraction was hybridized with 4 × 104 cpm32P-labeled CAT antisense RNA and 5000 cpm 18 S rRNA in a ribonuclease protection assay. The cytoplasmic fraction contained greater than 90% of total cellular RNA, while each nuclear fraction contained ∼2% of the total cellular RNA. After correction for these differences in RNA abundance between cellular fractions, 97% of CAT RNA was retained in the cytoplasm, less than 1% of the CAT RNA was in the nuclear membrane and nuclear soluble fractions, and less than 0.01% was in the nuclear matrix fraction. These data indicate that the cytoplasmic RNA contribution to the signal for spliced RNA in the nuclear fractions was quite low. Regulation of G6PD expression occurs at a step after transcription but prior to the exit of the mRNA from the nucleus (23Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the potential regulatory step is during RNA processing. To measure G6PD RNA accumulation during processing, we used sequential extraction of cells with detergent, DNase I, and salt to isolate the insoluble nuclear fraction. Isolation of this fraction provides an experimental tool to measure pre-mRNAs that are both newly synthesized and undergoing processing (28Ciejek E.M. Nordstrom J.L. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4945-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Zeitlin S. Parent A. Silverstein S. Efstratiadis A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 48Fey E.G. Krochmalnic G. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Further, RNA in the processing pathway is separated from mature RNA at the nuclear pore. Historically, this fraction was called the nuclear matrix, and we will use this term for simplicity. To validate our protocol, we used Western analysis with antibodies against two proteins, NuMA and SRm160, which are associated with the nuclear matrix (42Wan K.M. Nickerson J.A. Krockmalnic G. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 49Kallajoki M. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3351-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Staining should only occur against proteins of the expected size within the nuclear matrix fraction. Appearance of these proteins in the nuclear soluble and/or the nuclear membrane factions would indicate that the detergent was extracting the nuclear matrix. NuMA, also known as centrophilin (50Tousson A. Zeng C. Brinkley B.R. Valdivia M.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), SPN (49Kallajoki M. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3351-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and SP-H (51Maekawa T. Leslie R. Kuriyama R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 255-267PubMed Google Scholar), is an ∼240-kDa nuclear protein that resides at the spindle poles during mitosis and is required for processing of precursor mRNA during interphase (52Zeng C. He D."

Biotin attachment is catalyzed by biotin protein ligases, called holocarboxylase synthetase in mammals and BirA in prokaryotes. These enzymes show a high degree of sequence similarity in their biotinylation domains but differ markedly in the length and sequence of their N terminus. BirA is also the repressor of the biotin operon, and its DNA attachment site is located in its N terminus. The function of the eukaryotic N terminus is unknown. Holocarboxylase synthetase with N- and C-terminal deletions were evaluated for the ability to catalyze biotinylation after expression in Escherichia coli using bacterial and human acceptor substrates. We showed that the minimum functional protein is comprised of the last 349 of the 726-residue protein, which includes the biotinylation domain. Significantly, enzyme containing intermediate length, N-terminal deletions interfered with biotin transfer and interaction with different peptide acceptor substrates. We propose that the N terminus of holocarboxylase synthetase contributes to biotinylation through N- and C-terminal interactions and may affect acceptor substrate recognition. Our findings provide a rationale for the biotin responsiveness of patients with point mutations in the N-terminal sequence of holocarboxylase synthetase.

From bacteria to animals and plants, biotin is used as a cofactor in various carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions (reviewed in Refs. 1Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev.

S-484S): 477Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, a single enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, requires biotin as a cofactor. However in mammals, four enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and pyruvate carboxylase, utilize biotin. In such species, biotin is covalently linked to the ε-amino group of a lysine residue, which is part of the conserved (A/V)MKM sequence (3Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Nutr... 1999; 129 (. S-484S): 477Google Scholar). The attachment of biotin to the lysine residue is enzymatically catalyzed by biotin protein ligase (BPL).1 In E. coli, BirA adds biotin to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, whereas in mammals, plants, and yeast, holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) adds biotin to the respective domain of each biotin-dependent enzyme. The BPL attaches the biotin to the apocarboxylase in an ATP-dependent process that occurs in the following two half-reactions.ATP+Biotin→Biotinyl­5′­AMP+PPiREACTION1Biotinyl­5′­AMP+Apocarboxylase→Holocarboxylase+AMPREACTION2To attach biotin to its substrate, the BPL recognizes a 60–90-amino acid domain containing the acceptor lysine residue (3Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Nutr... 1999; 129 (. S-484S): 477Google Scholar). The biotin binding site is often part of a larger subunit of the carboxylase enzyme. E. coli BCCP is a 156-amino acid polypeptide of which only the last 82 are required for biotin attachment by the BirA protein (4Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 855-863Google Scholar, 5Reche P. Li Y.L. Fuller C. Eichhorn K. Perham R.N. Biochem. J... 1998; 329: 589-596Google Scholar). The 1.3 S biotin acceptor subunit of Propionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase is a 123-amino acid peptide of which the last 75 have been shown to be sufficient to be biotinylated (6Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 10327-10333Google Scholar). Human pyruvate carboxylase, a homotetramer of a 1180-amino acid polypeptide, has its biotin acceptor sequence confined to the last 86 residues of the protein (referred to as p-86, Ref. 7Val D.L. Chapman-Smith A. Walker M.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J... 1995; 312: 817-825Google Scholar). Human propionyl-CoA carboxylase, a heteropolymer of α- and β-subunits, contains its biotin binding region in the last 67 of the 703-amino acid α-subunit (referred to as p-67, Ref. 8Leon-Del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 22964-22968Google Scholar). All of these sequences have been expressed independently of their larger polypeptide and are readily biotinylated in vitro. BCCP and the 1.3 S subunit have been characterized structurally and have been shown to share a similar three-dimensional structure, which is related to the lipoic acid binding domains of dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes (9Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure.. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Google Scholar, 10Yao X. Wei D. Soden C.J. Summers M.F. Beckett D. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 15089-15100Google Scholar, 11Reddy D.V. Shenoy B.C.

Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Google Scholar). BPLs share a common catalytic domain (see Fig. 1), which was initially determined from the crystal structure of E. coli BirA complexed with biocytin (biotinyl-lysine, Ref. 13Wilson K.P. Shewchuk L.M. Brennan R.G. Otsuka A.J. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 9257-9261Google Scholar). It spans about 130 of the 321 amino acids of BirA. This sequence also shows a high level of identity with sequences in the C-terminal half of the human, yeast, and Arabidopsis enzymes (3Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Nutr... 1999; 129 (. S-484S): 477Google Scholar). In E. coli BirA, the N terminus contains a DNA binding domain involved in transcription repression of the biotin operon (14Barker D.F. Campbell A.M. J. Mol.

Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 3210-3219Google Scholar). In contrast, the N terminus of the 726-amino acid human HCS is unrelated to the bacterial sequence and has no known role in transcriptional regulation (17Leon-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 4626-4630Google Scholar). The yeast BPL shares some resemblance to the human enzyme, encoding a polypeptide of 690 amino acids (18Bower S. Perkins J. Yocum R.R. Serror P. Sorokin A. Rahaim P. Howitt C.L. Prasad N.

This BPL is similar to the bacterial enzyme except for a chloroplast-targeting sequence at its N terminus. Years ago, it was shown that BPLs were interchangeable between organisms (6Cronan Jr., J.E.

More recently, this has been applied to the expressed biotin attachment domains as substrates, where E. coli BirA has been shown to successfully biotinylate BCCP87(E. coli), p-75 (P. shermanii), p-86 (yeast), and p-67 (human) among the above carboxylases (6Cronan Jr., J.E.

Cloning of human HCS allowed the first functional dissection of an eukaryotic BPL through mutation analysis of patients suffering from an inherited deficiency of HCS activity. This deficiency results in depressed activity of all four biotin-dependent carboxylases, hence the term early onset “multiple carboxylase deficiency” to describe the disease (27Wolf B. Scriver C.R.

HCS containing these mutations has been shown to be “biotin responsive” in expression experiments and has been shown to be defective in biotin binding (35Dupuis L. Campeau E. Leclerc D. Gravel R.A.

Several other point mutations (R183P, L216R, L237P, V333E, and V363D) form a cluster outside the region of homology and, as such, appear to define a distinct region important for HCS activity (35Dupuis L.

This suggests that some residues in the N-terminal domain of HCS might participate in the reaction even though this region has no bacterial counterpart. To test this hypothesis, we randomly generated N-terminal deletions and tested their effect on HCS activity toward either the human (p-67) or bacterial peptide substrates (BCCP or BCCP-87). Also, two C-terminal deletions were engineered to test the importance of the C-terminal domain. E. coli strainbirA104 and purified apoBCCP87 were the kind gifts of A. Campbell (Stanford University) and D. Beckett (University of Maryland at College Park), respectively. p-67 was expressed and purified using the Pichia pastoris expression system from Invitrogen. 2E. Campeau and R. Gravel, manuscript in preparation. The exo-size deletion kit was from New England BioLabs, [14C]biotin (53 mCi/mmol) from Dupont Chemicals, IPTG from Life Technologies, Inc., the Wizard miniprep kit from Promega, and the Qiafilter Midiprep kit from Qiagen. The High Fidelity long PCR kit was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Mouse MGRS-His antibody and Ni2+-NTA-agarose were from Qiagen. All subcloning and plasmid transfections for vector constructions were done in E. coli TOP10F′. We used the shortest functional HCS clone (clone BL-04) that we previously isolated by functional complementation of birA104 (17Leon-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 4626-4630Google Scholar). It encodes a protein of 669 amino acids counting from Met-58 relative to the full-length 726-amino acid enzyme. Both isoforms have previously been shown to have equivalent activity (Ref.17Leon-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 4626-4630Google Scholar). 3L. Del Rio and R. Gravel, unpublished results. This cDNA was subcloned from the original pSE936 plasmid (40Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1991; 88: 1731-1735Google Scholar) into theEcoRI site of Bluescript SK-. The plasmid was digested withSmaI and HindIII for subcloning the cDNA into the pQE30 poly(His) expression vector (Qiagen) to generate pQE30/HCS04. HCS expression could then be induced with IPTG, and the protein produced was fused with a polyhistidine tag (MRGS-His6) at its N terminus. The exo-size deletion kit was used following the manufacturer's instructions to generate unidirectional-nested digestion of double-stranded DNA. The pQE30/HCS04 plasmid was digested with SmaI andSacI, treated with mung bean nuclease for various times, religated, and transfected into E. coli TOP10F′. Colonies were picked and analyzed by sequencing and restriction endonuclease digestion. When required, the reading frame was restored by excising the corresponding insert with SphI and HindIII and placing it into the pQE31 or pQE32 version of pQE30. Other deletions were made using restriction endonuclease sites present in the cDNA. In one, the HCS cDNA in Bluescript was digested withKpnI/HindIII and inserted in the pQE32 to generate an HCS starting at R290. In another, digestion withPstI/HindIII and insertion in pQE31 generated an HCS starting at L460. Boundaries were verified by sequencing to confirm the reading frame and conservation of restriction sites. We used long PCR with oligonucleotides encoding restriction endonuclease sites to generate C-terminal deletions of HCS. HCS ending at L695 was generated from the HCS cDNA in Bluescript using the following oligonucleotides (written 5′ to 3′) for the long PCR: CTCGAGCTCCACGAAGGCCGGACG (primer I) and GGTGACCCGGGAGGAAGCCAGAAT (restriction sites used for subcloning underlined). The PCR product was digested withSacI/SmaI and inserted into pQE32. For HCS ending at G655, the primers were: primer I and GGAAGGAAGCTTGTTGGGCCCTTT. The PCR product was digested withSacI/HindIII and inserted into pQE32. As a control, the complete HCS cDNA (clone BL-04) was also amplified by long PCR, subcloned into pQE32, and tested for its ability to complement birA104. It was amplified with primer I and GACGCCCGGGATTACCGCCGTTT. The PCR product was digested withSacI/SmaI for subcloning. Each construct was generated twice from two independent PCR reactions. Plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing the insert boundaries. The various constructs were purified using the Qiafilter Midiprep kit, and 50–100 ng of plasmid were used to transfect competent E. coli birA104 that had already been transfected with plasmid pREP4 (Qiagen), encoding the lacI q repressor. Three colonies were picked for each construct and tested independently for reproducibility of results. E. coli birA104 carrying each construct was streaked onto LB-agar plates containing 50 nm biotin, 2 mm IPTG, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin for incubation at the restrictive temperature of 42 °C or on plates containing 5 μm biotin, 2 mm IPTG, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin for incubation at the permissive temperature of 30 °C. In these conditions, growth of E. coli at 42 °C is directly correlated with the level of residual HCS activity. Each construct was tested for its ability to biotinylate the bacterial substrate BCCP or the human substrate fragment, p-67 (8Leon-Del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 22964-22968Google Scholar). The E. coli extract was the source of unbiotinylated BCCP. E. coli birA104 harboring each construct was grown overnight at 30 °C in LB medium containing 5 μm biotin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. They were diluted 1:100 in fresh LB with 5 μm biotin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 30 °C until they reached anA 600 of 0.4–0.5. HCS expression was induced by adding 2 mm IPTG and incubating the cells at 30 °C for 2 h. The cells were centrifuged and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. They were resuspended in resuspension buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by freeze-thaw in a methanol-dry ice water bath followed by sonication. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad assay kit. For the HCS assay, 150 μg of protein lysate was mixed with 25 μl of 2× biotinylation assay buffer (100 mm reduced glutathione, 600 mm Tris-HCl. pH 7.5, 50 mm MgCl2), 2 μl of 100 mmATP, 2 μl of [14C]biotin (0.1 μCi), and 5 μm p-67 in a final volume of 50 μl. Lysates were incubated in duplicate at 42 °C for 1–2 h. After termination of the reaction by the addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.71 mβ-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue), the lysates were denatured 5 min at 100 °C and loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and migrated at 30 mA for 3 h. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by Western blotting overnight at 34 V. The membranes were exposed to a Fujix-BAS 2000 Bioimaging analyzer phosphorimage plate to quantify the amount of [14C]biotin incorporated into p-67 and/or BCCP. The membranes were subsequently incubated with the MRGS-His antibody according to the supplier's instructions for detection of the poly(His)·HCS fusion protein. Enzyme from several of the HCS constructs that showed activity in the in vitro assay were purified on Ni2+-NTA-agarose using the supplier's protocol. Quantification of the partially purified HCS was done by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with known amounts of purified BirA (kindly provided by D. Beckett) and interpolating the concentration of HCS while correcting for the protein size difference. Each HCS construct was tested for its ability to biotinylate p-67, BCCP87, or p-67 and BCCP87 together. The final volume of the reaction was 25 μl and contained 10 μm p-67 or BCCP87 or a 5 μm mixture of each substrate, 1 μl of [14C]biotin (0.05 μCi), 1 μl of 100 mmATP, 12.5 μl of 2× biotinylation assay buffer, and 0.5 μm of purified HCS. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were denatured and loaded on a 16% (49.5% T, 6% C) 0.7 mm Tris/Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (41Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem... 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar) and migrated at 35 mA for 6 h. Transfer onto nitrocellulose, exposure to the phosphorimage plate, and detection of the BCCP87 and p-67 reaction products and poly(His) fusion protein were done as in the in vitro assay. HCS clone BL-04, starting at Met-58 relative to the longest cDNA clone isolated by Leon Del Rio et al. (17Leon-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 4626-4630Google Scholar), was subcloned into the E. coli expression vector pQE30 to generate pQE30/HCS4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The HCS protein produced by this system is fused at its N terminus with a polyhistidine tag. This poly(His) HCS construct was tested for its ability to complement the temperature-sensitive E. coli mutant birA104. Transformation of birA104 with pQE30/HCS04 and incubation at the restrictive temperature of 42 °C results in normal growth comparable with that obtained for HCS fused to the lacZ gene in Bluescript or HCS expressed from plasmid pSE936 used in previous experiments (Ref. 35Dupuis L. Campeau E. Leclerc D. Gravel R.A. Mol. Genet. Metab... 1999; 66: 80-90Google Scholar and results not shown). No growth is obtained forbirA104 grown alone at 42 °C. Western transfer of bacterial cell lysates onto nitrocellulose membranes and detection of the poly(His) fusion proteins using the MRGS-His antibody gives a protein of the expected size (see Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Control orM58 lanes).Figure 3Effects of N-terminal deletions on HCS activity. The various N-terminal-deleted constructs were tested for complementation of birA104 at 42 °C (panel A), ability to biotinylate p-67 and BCCP in E. coliextracts (panel B) and production of the poly(His) fusion protein (panel C), as detailed in the legend to Fig. 2. Met-58 is the control HCS construct and is one of the original isolates obtained during the cloning of the human HCS cDNA by complementation of birA104 (17Leon-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 4626-4630Google Scholar).

Bottom panel, detection of the fusion protein using the poly(His) antibody. The difference in size of the constructs is not as pronounced as in Figs. 3 and 4 because a higher percentage acrylamide (16%) was used to enable separation of BCCP87 and p-67, along with detection of the HCS protein. The panelfor BirA is blank because purified BirA was used for this experiment; there is no reaction with MRGS-His antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We designed oligonucleotides encoding restriction endonuclease sites to subclone C-terminal truncated versions of HCS after amplification by long PCR. Two C-terminal deletions of HCS were generated: a 31-amino acid deletion ending at Leu-695 and a 71-amino acid deletion ending at Gly-655 (Fig. 1). Each deletion was tested for its ability to complement E. coli birA104 at the restrictive temperature of 42 °C, as well as for its ability to biotinylate BCCP and p-67 in extract assays. Both C-terminal deletions fail to complement birA104 at 42 °C and do not display any biotinylating activity toward p-67 or BCCP in vitrodespite production of a protein of the expected size by Western blot (Fig. 2). In contrast, full-length HCS clones (from Met-58) generated similarly by long PCR support growth ofbirA104 at 42 °C, show biotinylation of both substratesin vitro and produce a protein of the expected size (Fig.2). N-terminal deletions were generated by exonuclease treatment and subcloned into reading frame variants of the expression vector so as to permit expression of the truncated HCS. In this manner, eight N-terminal deletions were obtained with HCS starting at Ala-80, Leu-165, Leu-166, Ala-235, Thr-266, Pro-338, Lys-378, and Pro-569 (Fig. 1). Two additional constructs, generating HCS starting at Arg-290 and Leu-460, took advantage of restriction endonuclease sites present in the HCS cDNA. Each construct was tested for its ability to complement E. coli birA104 at the restrictive temperature (Fig.3 A). HCS cDNAs starting at Ala-80, Leu-165, or Leu-166 complement birA104 at 42 °C, showing growth at levels only slightly less than obtained for Met-58. In contrast, HCS starting at Ala-235 fails completely to complement theE. coli mutant, providing an initial border to the minimum functional enzyme. However, further deletion to Thr-266 shows partial growth and still further deletion of N-terminal sequences to Arg-290, Pro-338 or Lys-378 restores growth to levels obtained for constructs starting at Met-58 to Leu-166. Finally, removal of additional sequences to Leu-460 or Pro-569 completely abolishes growth ofbirA104. These data indicate that the complementing deletion constructs generate truncated enzymes capable of biotinylating BCCP at a level sufficient to support growth of the E. colimutant. Each of the N-terminal-deleted constructs was assayed in extracts for biotinylation of BCCP and p-67, the former derived from the broken cell extract and the latter added directly into the assay (Fig. 3 B). Most of the in vitro assay results are in accord with those obtained by the complementation growth of birA104. Several HCS constructs that are able to complement birA104 (HCS starting at Met-58, Arg-290, Pro-338, and Lys-378) are able to biotinylate BCCPin vitro, whereas constructs unable to complementbirA104 (HCS starting at Ala-235, Leu-460, Pro-569) fail to show BCCP biotinylation. One construct, HCS starting at Thr-266, which complements birA104 weakly, also shows weak biotinylation of BCCP. Some constructs are discordant between the complementation growth tests and the in vitro assays: HCS starting at Ala-80 is able to complement birA104 but does not incorporate any labeled biotin into BCCP in the in vitro assay. However, this proved to be because the BCCP was already fully biotinylated in culture, thereby preventing any further biotinylation in the extract assay. When the same log phase cell extract was mixed with an equivalent amount of a culture producing HCS starting at Ala-235 (negative by complementation and in vitro assay) to provide an independent source of unbiotinylated BCCP, transfer of biotin to BCCP was observed (result not shown). Western detection of the fusion protein also shows that the Ala-80 clone produced a higher level of HCS than the Met-58 control construct (Fig. 3 C). Another discrepancy is with HCS starting at Leu-165 or Leu-166. Both constructs could complement birA104 but they do not show any"

Here we report that CD45 negatively regulates monocyte differentiation by inhibiting phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-dependent activation of protein kinase C (PKC) δ. We found that antisense reduction of CD45 in U937 monocytic cells (CD45as cells) increased by 100% the ability of PMA to enlarge cell size, increase cell cytoplasmic process width and length, and induce surface expression of CD11b. In addition, reduction in CD45 expression caused the duration of peak PMA-induced MEK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activity to increase from 5 min to 30 min while leading to a 4-fold increase in PMA-dependent PKCδ activation. Importantly, PMA-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was also increased 4-fold in CD45as cells. Finally, inhibitors of MEK (PD98059) and PKCδ (rottlerin) completely blocked PMA-induced monocytic cell differentiation. Taken together, these data indicate that CD45 inhibits PMA-dependent PKCδ activation by impeding PMA-dependent PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, this blunting of PKCδ activation leads to an inhibition of PKCδ-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and ERK1/2-dependent monocyte differentiation.

It is a long single-chain type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular portion that suggests three fibronectin type III domains and an intercytoplasmic tail that contains two phosphatase domains in direct repeat (1Trowbridge I.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). There are currently five expressed isoforms of CD45, and these are generated by differential splicing of exons 4–6, while exons 1–3 and 7–33 remain constant (2Hall L.R. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2781-2787PubMed Google Scholar). Presently, the functional variations in these CD45 isoforms appear primarily due to their extracellular motifs and cell of expression as opposed to differences in their catalytic domains (3Donovan J.A.

Recent studies in monocytes have shown that cross-linking of CD45 stimulates an increase in the respiratory burst following tumor necrosis factor-α treatment (10Liles W.C. Ledbetter J.A. Waltersdorph A.W. Klebanoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2175-2184PubMed Google Scholar) and that ligation of CD45 induces both tumor necrosis factor-α and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor production in monocytes (11Hayes A.L.

Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)1 can induce monocytic cells to differentiate by a mechanism dependent on the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). The PKC family currently comprises 10 related isozymes that have been divided into three groups based on their structure and cofactor requirements. The conventional PKC isoforms α, βI, βII, and γ require diacylglyerol (DAG), phosphatidylserine, and Ca2+ for activity. The novel PKC isoforms δ, ε, η, and θ do not require Ca2+ as a cofactor but do require DAG and phosphatidylserine. The atypical PKC isoforms ζ and ι do not require either Ca2+ or DAG but do bind phosphatidylserine when active (reviewed in Refs. 12Nishizuka Y.

Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). PMA activates the atypical PKC isoforms and conventional PKCs because it is similar in structure to DAG (17Sharkey N.A. Leach K.L. Blumberg P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). PMA, like DAG, binds to a cysteine-rich region contained within the PKC C1 domain producing a contiguous hydrophobic region that allows PKC to associate with the cell membrane (18Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). This facilitates conventional PKC and novel PKC isoform binding of phosphatidylserine (19Newton A.C. Keranen L.M.,. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Binding of PKC family members to relevant cofactors initiates removal of the inhibitory pseudosubstrate domain from the PKC core inducing autophosphorylation on COOH-terminal serines and release of activated PKC from the cell membrane to the cytosol (20Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase activation is a critical step in PMA-induced differentiation of promyelocytic cells (21Pedrinaci S. Ruiz-Cabello F. Gomez O. Collado A. Garrido F. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and is associated with activation of the Raf-1/MAP kinase-signaling pathway (22Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Emoto Y. Stone R. Rapp U. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 872-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MAP kinase family can be loosely divided into three arms that end in the activation of Jun amino-terminal kinases, p38/HOG1 kinases, or extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) (23Boulton T.G.

Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar). PMA-induced ERK activation is through a kinase cascade that requires Raf-1-dependent phosphorylation of MEK1/2 on serines 217 and 221 and MEK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 on threonine 202 and tyrosine 204 (26Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 27Alessi D.R. Saito Y.

PKC-dependent activation of Raf-1 appears to be by direct phosphorylation of serines 43, 259, and/or 499 (28Kolch W. Heldecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidl H. Mishcak H. Finkenzeller G. Marmé D.

Wang X. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. Trush M.A. Cell Growth Diff. 1999; 10: 307-315PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that that CD45 negatively regulates PMA-induced monocytic cell differentiation by impeding PMA-dependent PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation, PKCδ activation, and PKCδ-dependent activation of ERK1/2. These findings indicate that CD45 is a critical regulator of monocytic cell development.

All other molecular biology reagents and chemicals were purchased from Promega (Maddison, WI). U937 and U266 cells were grown in growth media (RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.0 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 2.5 g/liter glucose, 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4). Cells were passaged 1:1 with fresh media every 3 days. For PMA treatment, cells were washed twice and resuspended in growth media supplemented with 100 nm PMA. The episomal CD45 antisense (CD45as) vector was created to target the expressed 5′ sequence in exons 1, 2, and 3 that is shared by all known CD45 isoforms (1Trowbridge I.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 2Hall L.R. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2781-2787PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, total cellular RNA from 5 × 106 U266 cells was isolated in Trizol reagent and the target sequence amplified by polymerase chain reaction from random hexamer-primed cDNA using the forward primer (5′-GCGGATCCGGAAATTGTTCCTCGTCTGA-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-GCAAGCTTCAGTGGGGGAAGGTGTTGG-3′) by methods we have described (34Cengel K.A. Kason R.E. Freund G.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The resultant 196-base pair polymerase chain reaction product was introduced into the pCEP4 vector using the BamHI andHindIII restrictions sites included in the forward and reverse primer sequences and the construct verified by sequence analysis. The U937 cell lines U937-CD45as and U937-pCEP4 were created by introducing the vectors CD45as and pCEP4, respectively, by electroporation. 20 × 106 U937 cells were washed twice in and resuspended in 800 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Cells were added to 4-mm gap electroporation cuvettes with either 20 μg of CD45as or pCEP4 vector and electroporated at 400 V in an EC 100 electroporator (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). Cells were recovered in growth media for 24 h and then removed to growth media supplemented with 250 μg/ml hygromycin B. After 2 weeks, CD45as cells were labeled with FITC-conjugated CD45 antibody (35Kulas D.T. Freund G.G. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 755-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and sorted for low CD45 expression on a MoFlo flow cytometer (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). Immunolabeling of cells was performed as previously described (36Schacher D.H. VanHoy R.W. Liu Q. Arkins S. Dantzer R. Freund G.G. Kelley K.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In brief, after indicated treatments, cells were incubated in growth media supplemented with 5 mm EDTA for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed once in 0.5% bovine serum albumin containing phosphate-buffered saline. FITC-conjugated antibodies at 7 μg/ml/test were added to 1 × 106cells and incubated on ice for 15 min. Fluorescence was detected at an excitation of 480 nm on an Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) quantifying 1 × 104 events using gates to exclude nonviable cells as determined by propidium iodide staining. Western analysis was performed as described previously (37Cengel K.A. Freund G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27969-27974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, 15 × 106 cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Tritron X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mm Tris base, pH 7.4). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (250 μg/lane) under reducing conditions in 10% gels and then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the indicated primary antibodies and enhanced ECL reagents followed by autoradiography and densitometry. Where indicated, experimental data was analyzed by Student's t test for comparison of medians using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). PMA is a potent activator of monocytic cells increasing surface expression of CD45 and CD11b and inducing phenotypic maturation (21Pedrinaci S. Ruiz-Cabello F. Gomez O. Collado A. Garrido F. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine the role of CD45 in PMA-dependent monocytic cell activation, CD45, CD11b, and cell morphology were examined in U937 cells transfected with the CD45 antisense vector (U937-CD45as cells) and U937 cells transfected with the vector backbone (U937-pCEP4 cells) treated with 100 nmPMA for 2 days. Fig. 1 A shows that PMA increased CD45 surface expression in U937-pCEP4 cells by 80% at 2 days from a median fluorescence of 22.8 ± 2.3 to 41.7 ± 7.2. In contrast, CD45 surface expression in U937-CD45as cells was 50% that of U937-pCEP4 cells basally (day 0) at a median fluorescence of 11.9 ± 0.9 and after 2 days of PMA treatment at a median fluorescence of 20.9 ± 2.1. Fig. 1 B demonstrates that in U937-pCEP4 cells PMA induced a 3-fold elevation in surface CD11b expression at 2 days as median fluorescence increased from 0.31 ± 0.13 to 1.03 ± 0.06. However, in U937-CD45as cells, PMA exposure increased CD11b expression by 14-fold as median fluorescence increased from 0.28 ± 0.01 to 4.05 ± 0.79. To confirm that the CD45as vector did not down-regulate all surface makers, CD33 expression was examined. As Fig. 1 C shows, CD33 surface expression in U937-pCEP4 and U937-CD45as cells was similar both basally (median fluorescence, 1.72 ± 0.11 versus 1.60 ± 0.07) and after PMA treatment (median fluorescence, 1.93 ± 0.03versus 1.91 ± 0.07). Finally, Fig. 1 Ddemonstrates that PMA increased U937-pCEP4 cell nuclear size, cell size, and cell process length by 2-fold after 2 days. In U937-CD45as cells, PMA induced a 2-fold increase in nuclear size but a 4-fold increase in cell size and cell process length. Additionally, when cells were pre-treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (25 μm) for 15 min prior to PMA treatment, PMA-induced morphologic differentiation was blocked. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that transfection of the episomal CD45as vector in U937 cells reduces by 50% the surface expression of CD45. Importantly, reduction in CD45 expression induces at least a doubling of PMA-dependent CD11b expression, cell size, and cell process length when compared with control (U937-pCEP4) cells and that these phenotypic changes are sensitive to MEK inhibition. PMA mediates its effect on monocytic cell differentiation through activation of the MAP kinases (22Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Emoto Y. Stone R. Rapp U. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 872-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether CD45 affected PMA-dependent MAP kinase activation, MEK and ERK1/2 activation were examined by Western analysis. Fig.2 A shows that in U937-pCEP4 cells PMA induced a 5-fold activation of MEK at 5 min and that by 30 min MEK activation had decreased to 2-fold over basal. In U937-CD45as cells, PMA treatment also caused a 5-fold activation of MEK at 5 min but at 30 min MEK activation still remained 5-fold over basal. Likewise, in Fig. 2 B, PMA induced a 5-fold increase in ERK1/2 activation at 5 min and by 30 min this increase had returned to basal levels. In U937-CD45as cells, however, ERK1/2 activation was 5-fold over basal at 5 min and remained elevated at 4-fold over basal at 30 min. Importantly, in split samples, mass of MEK and ERK1/2 was unchanged by antisense expression (Fig. 2, A andB, lower panels). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that antisense reduction of CD45 leads to an extension of peak MEK and MAP kinase activation from 5 to 30 min, indicating that CD45 attenuates MAP kinase activation in PMA activated monocytic cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 D, the MEK kinase inhibitor PD98059 blocks PMA-induced phenotypic maturation. To demonstrate that loss of CD45-dependent regulation of MAP kinase activation was the cause for PMA-dependent increased CD11b expression in U937-CD45as cells when compared with U937-pCEP4 cells, MAP kinase normalization studies were performed. Fig.3 A shows that, as in Fig.1 B, PMA at 2 days leads to more than a doubling of CD11b expression in U937-CD45as cells when compared with U937-pCEP4 cells (median fluorescence, 5.34 ± 0.32 versus 1.91 ± 0.31). Importantly, treating of U937-CD45as cells with 3 μm PD98059 15 min prior to PMA exposure resulted in U937-CD45as cells and U937-pCEP4 cells having similar CD11b expression at 2 days (median fluorescence, 2.20 ± 0.03 versus1.91 ± 0.31). Fig. 3 B demonstrates the impact of 3 μm PD98059 on PMA-dependent ERK1/2 activation in U937-CD45as cells. As with Fig. 2 B, PMA-induced ERK1/2 activation is reduced at 15 min by 50% in U937-pCEP4 cells when compared with U937-CD45as cells. However, when U937-CD45as cells are treated with 3 μm PD98059 for 15 min prior to PMA exposure, U937-CD45as cell ERK1/2 activation at 5 and 15 min is equivalent to that of U937-pCEP4 cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that activation of ERK1/2 is required for PMA-dependent CD11b expression and indicate that regulation of ERK1/2 activation by CD45 controls CD11b surface levels. PMA-dependent initiation of the MAP kinases cascade requires activation of PKCs (21Pedrinaci S. Ruiz-Cabello F. Gomez O. Collado A. Garrido F. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Emoto Y. Stone R. Rapp U. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 872-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether CD45 impacted PKC activation Western analysis was performed using a phospho-PKC antibody to isoforms α, βI, βII, γ, and δ. Fig. 4 A shows that in U937-pCEP4 cells 100 nm PMA induced a maximal 3-fold PKC autophosphorylation on serine 660 at 5 min. In U937-CD45as cells, however, PMA led to a 12-fold PKC autophosphorylation at the same time point. In addition, masses of PKCα, βI, βII, γ, and δ, measured in split samples, were not altered by antisense expression (Fig. 4 A, lower panels). Since PKCδ has been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in the myeloid progenitor line 32D in response to PMA (38Li W. Mischak H., Yu, J.-C. Wang L.-M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2349-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the next step was to determine its role in monocytic cell differentiation and its regulation by CD45. Fig.4 B demonstrates that the PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin (39Gschwendt M. Müller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), at 2.5 μm blocked by 66% PMA induced surface expression of CD11b in U937 cells at 2 days reducing median fluorescence from 7.20 ± 0.30 in PMA-treated cells to 2.4 ± 0.32 in rottlerin/PMA-treated cells. Importantly, rottlerin did not markedly alter cell viability, as measured by propidium iodide staining in that control cells were 94% viable, rottlerin-treated cells 88% viable, PMA-treated cells 88% viable, and rottlerin/PMA-treated cells 73% viable after 2 days of treatment. To confirm that PMA activated PKCδ and that PKCδ autophosphorylation was regulated by CD45, Western analysis was performed on using a PKCδ-specific immunoprecipitating antibody. Fig. 4 C (top panel) shows that, in U937-pCEP4 cells, 100 nm PMA induced a 3-fold autophosphorylation of PKCδ at 5 min but that, in U937-CD45as cells, PMA caused a 12-fold autophosphorylation of PKCδ. To determine the potential mechanism by which CD45 modulates PMA-dependent PKCδ activity, phosphorylation of PKCδ was examined in split immunoprecipitates. Fig. 4 C (upper panel) demonstrates that PMA induced a 3-fold increase in PKCδ serine 660 phosphorylation in U937-pCEP4 cells and that CD45 antisense expression quadrupled this effect. The middle panel demonstrates that PMA also induced a 3-fold increase in PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in U937-pCEP4 cells and that CD45 antisense expression quadrupled this effect. The lower panel of Fig. 4 C shows that in split immunoprecipitates the mass of PKCδ was unaffected by CD45 expression or PMA treatment. Finally, to examine PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ activation and tyrosine phosphorylation, Western analysis was again performed on split immunoprecipitates. Fig. 4 D demonstrates that the PKC isoforms α, βI, βII and γ are neither phosphorylated on serine 660 (top panel) nor phosphorylated on tyrosine (middle panel) in response to PMA. The lower panel of Fig.4 D shows that PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ were present in the immunoprecipitates from PMA-treated cells and that PKCα, -βI, -βII and -γ mass were unaffected by CD45 expression. These findings show that PKCδ is required for PMA-induced CD11b surface expression and that CD45 negatively regulates the autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Overall, these data indicate that control of PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation by CD45 regulates PMA-induced PKCδ activity and subsequent monocyte differentiation. These data establish that CD45 negatively regulates PMA-dependent monocytic cell differentiation by impairing PKCδ activation and tyrosine phosphorylation. Flow cytometry demonstrated that antisense reduction of CD45 reduces PMA-dependent expression of CD45 while quadrupling that of CD11b and not affecting that of CD33 (Fig. 1, A–C). Morphologic studies showed that phenotypic characteristics of monocyte differentiation such as increased cell size and cell process length were doubled in U937-CD45as cells when compared with that of U937-pCEP4 (Fig. 1 D). In addition, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked all morphologic changes induced by PMA in both cell lines (Fig.1 D). Antisense reduction of CD45 increased the duration of peak PMA-induced MEK and ERK1/2 activation from 5 min to nearly 30 min (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, normalization of PMA-induced ERK1/2 activity in U937-CD45as cells to that in U937-pCEP4 cells resulted in equivalent PMA-dependent CD11B surface expression in these two cell lines (Fig. 3, A andB). Finally, PMA activation in U937-CD45as cells was 4-fold greater than that in U937-pCEP4 cells (Fig. 4 A). Importantly, the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin reduced by 66% PMA-dependent CD11b expression (Fig. 4 B) while CD45 antisense expression quadrupled PMA-dependent PKCδ activation and tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). Notably, PKC isoforms α, βI, βII, and γ were neither activated nor tyrosine-phosphorylated by PMA (Fig. 4 D). Taken together, these findings indicate that CD45 blunts PKCδ activation by reducing PMA-dependent PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation and that this inhibition in PKCδ autophosphorylation results in reduced activation of ERK1/2 and ERK1/2-dependent monocyte differentiation. PMA-dependent monocytic cell differentiation requires PKC activation and ERK1/2 activation (21Pedrinaci S. Ruiz-Cabello F. Gomez O. Collado A. Garrido F. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Emoto Y. Stone R. Rapp U. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 872-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the PKC isoforms involved in this process have only recently become better defined. In the interleukin-3-dependent myeloid cell line 32D, transfection studies initially demonstrated that PKCα and PKCδ were essential for PMA-induced macrophage differentiation while PKCβII, -ε, -ζ, and -η were not required (40Mischak H. Pierce J.H. Goodnight J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20110-20115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in the same cell system demonstrated that only PKCδ appeared to be required for phorbol ester-induced macrophage differentiation (41Wang Q.J. Acs P. Goodnight J. Giese T. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 76-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our data support these findings in that we found that PKCδ but not PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ were autophosphorylated on serine 660 after PMA treatment and autophosphorylation of serine 660 has been shown to be required for PKC activation (42Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that rottlerin a competitive inhibitor of the PKC ATP-binding site, which preferentially inhibits the δ isoform at concentrations between 3 and 6 μm (39Gschwendt M. Müller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), blocked by 66% PMA-induced monocyte differentiation. Since phorbol esters lead to PKC autophosphorylation (42Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and activated PKC initiates the MAP kinase cascade (21Pedrinaci S. Ruiz-Cabello F. Gomez O. Collado A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 872-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the increased serine 660 phosphorylation of PKCδ we observed in CD45 antisense cells is the likely cause of the increased MEK and ERK1/2 activity we also observed in these cells. In addition, since ERK1/2 activation is required for PMA-dependent monocyte differentiation as shown by us here with MEK inhibition studies and by others (33He H. Wang X. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. Trush M.A. Cell Growth Diff. 1999; 10: 307-315PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that PKCδ is the critical PKC responsible for PMA-induced monocyte differentiation in U937 cells and that its autophosphorylation on serine 660 probably controls this process. Furthermore, from the 32D cell studies sited above, PKCδ would be expected to play an important role, generally, in the phorbol ester activation pathway (43Kontny E. Kurowska M. Szczepañska K. Maœliñski W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in monocytes. CD45 is expressed in nearly all cells of hematopoietic origin (44Woodford-Thomas T. Thomas M.L. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but its function in cells of the myeloid lineage is especially ill defined.In vitro, the tyrosine phosphatase activity of CD45 is relatively substrate nonspecific consistent with what is found with many of the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatases (45Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8695-8701Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This has made knockout and antisense approaches critical to defining the role of CD45 in hematopoietic cells. Our stable episomal antisense vector to the conserved exons 1, 2, and 3 led to a 50% reduction in CD45 expression in unstimulated and PMA-stimulated U937 cells. Surprisingly, this led to an increase in differentiation as measured by CD11b expression and morphologic examination. Expected results were that, as in the T and B cells systems, loss of CD45 would be associated with decreased maturation and reduced ability to respond to activating stimuli. The reason for this incongruity may be due to the role of the Scr family kinases in PMA-induced differentiation. Unique to PKCδ is that it is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after cells are PMA-stimulated (38Li W. Mischak H., Yu, J.-C. Wang L.-M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2349-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the kinases involved in this process are not fully delineated, v-Src, Lyn, and Fyn have been shown to associate and/or phosphorylate PKCδ (46Zang Q. Lu Z. Curto M. Barile N. Shalloway D. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13275-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 47Song J.S. Swann P.G. Szallasi Z. Blank U. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J.

Studies have demonstrated that PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation can both increase (38Li W. Mischak H., Yu, J.-C. Wang L.-M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2349-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reduce (49Li W. Li W. Chen X.-H,. Kelley C.A. Alimandi M. Zhang J. Chen Q. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26404-26409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) PCKδ activity. Here we show that PKCδ is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PMA and that antisense reduction in CD45 expression increases PMA-dependent PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. Importantly, the increase in PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation seen with loss of CD45 expression is associated with increased PKCδ autophosphorylation, ERK1/2 activation, and differentiation, indicating that CD45-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation is likely responsible for reducing PKCδ serine 660 phosphorylation and, hence, its autophosphorylation and activation. It is then this reduction in PKCδ activity that results in reduced ERK1/2 activation and reduced CD11b expression. Unclear, however, is how CD45 might regulate PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. In terms of the Src family kinases, CD45 is generally thought to dephosphorylate an inhibitory tyrosine thereby activating the kinase (50Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Hasegawa K. Arimura Y. Mitomo K. Okada M. Clark M.R. Mizuno K. Yakura H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1321-1326PubMed Google Scholar). In our system, loss of CD45 expression would be expected to lead to reduced Src family kinase activity and decreased PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation contrary to what we observed. Interestingly, CD45 has also been implicated in dephosphorylating the activating tyrosine 394 on Lyn and reducing Lyn kinase activity (6Yanagi S. Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Sabe H. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. J. Bio. Chem. 1996; 271: 30487-30492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,50Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Hasegawa K. Arimura Y. Mitomo K. Okada M. Clark M.R. Mizuno K. Yakura H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1321-1326PubMed Google Scholar). In CD45 knockout macrophage precursors, Lyn activity is increased nearly 5-fold (51Roach T. Slater S. Koval M. White L. McFarland E.C. Okumura M. Thomas M. Brown E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 408-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), implicating Lyn as potentially important to increased PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in CD45-deficient monocytic cells. Finally, CD45 may directly dephosphorylate PKCδ controlling PKCδ activity at the inner membrane surface. Preliminary data from our laboratory show that CD45 can dephosphorylate in vitrotyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ, but, as indicated above, tyrosine phosphatases tend to have little in vitro substrate specificity. In summary, we found that CD45 negatively regulates PMA-induced PKCδ autophosphorylation, PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation, and monocytic cell differentiation. We conclude that CD45 inhibits PMA-dependent PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby blunting PKCδ activation and PKCδ-dependent activation of ERK1/2. Reduced ERK1/2 activity then limits monocyte differentiation."

Like for all class II receptors, the extracellular N-terminal domain of the human VPAC1 receptor plays a predominant role in peptide ligand recognition. To determine the three-dimensional structure of this N-terminal domain (residues 1–144), the Protein Data Bank (PDB) was screened for a homologous protein. A subdomain of yeast lipase B was found to have 27% sequence identity and 50% sequence homology with the N-terminal domain (8) of the VPAC1receptor together with a good alignment of the hydrophobic clusters. A model of the N-terminal domain of VPAC1 receptor was thus constructed by homology. It indicated the presence of a putative signal sequence in the N-terminal extremity. Moreover, residues (Glu36, Trp67, Asp68, Trp73, and Gly109) which were shown to be crucial for VIP binding are gathered around a groove that is essentially negatively charged. New putatively important residues for VIP binding were suggested from the model analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis and stable transfection of mutants in CHO cells indicated that Pro74, Pro87, Phe90, and Trp110 are indeed important for VIP binding and activation of adenylyl cyclase activation.

The residues (Glu36, Trp67, Asp68, Trp73, Gly109, and Lys143) which are crucial for VIP binding affinity are dispersed along the primary sequence of the N-terminal extracellular region of the human VPAC1 receptor. We question whether their spatial distribution is responsible for their functional properties. In this paper, we have developed the first threee-dimensional model of a large part of the N-terminal domain of the human VPAC1 receptor by homology modeling. Although the already available data from site-directed mutagenesis experiments (7Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hypotheses were experimentally tested by mutagenesis. Altogether, molecular modeling and mutagenesis suggest that an electronegative groove topped at one end by a tryptophan shell could constitute a partial VIP-binding domain in the human VPAC1receptor. Enzymes and vectors were obtained from Promega(Charbonnière, France) and culture medium from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy-Pontoise, France). Synthetic VIP was from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). 125I-VIP was prepared and purified as described (17Laburthe M. Rousset M. Rouyer-Fessard C. Couvineau A. Chantret I. Chevalier G. Zweibaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10180-10184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other highly purified chemicals used were from Sigma (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France). A three-dimensional model of the 1–144 N-terminal domain of the human VPAC1 receptor was calculated using the Modeller 4.0 software (18Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar, 19Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. Van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). This method uses sequence homology between the receptor protein domain and a protein whose three-dimensional structure is known to predict a three-dimensional model. To find an homologous sequence to the VPAC1 receptor 1–144 sequence, we screened the Protein Data Bank using the FASTA algorithm (20Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). The 152–262 region of a yeast lipase was selected (Protein Data Bank code: 1LBS), carrying 27% sequence identity and 50% sequence homology with residues 8–117 of the VPAC1 receptor. To further check the homology, the HCA (hydrophobic cluster analysis) plots of both sequences were compared using the Visualfasta program (Patrick Durand, Paris, France). Briefly, the HCA method is based on a two-dimensional helical plot of the sequence, allowing detection of hydrophobic clusters in proteins (21Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Alignment of hydrophobic clusters mostly supports homologous folds. The quality of alignment is evaluated by the HCA score. In this case, the score is 60%. The resulting alignment is used as input for Modeller 4.0. The three-dimensional structure d1 calculated by Modeller4 is then minimized using the Hyperchem 5.0 software (Hypercube Inc.). The energy minimization is carried out using the conjugate gradient method with the AMBER forcefield. The stereochemical quality of the minimized three-dimensional model is finally checked using Procheck (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The model has 88% of the Φ,Ψ angle pairs in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, indicating a correct stereochemistry. Electrostatic potentials were calculated and drawn using CHIME (MDL Information system Inc.). Molecular views were drawn with the WinMGM program (23Rahman M. Brasseur R. J. Mol. Graph. 1994; 12: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously described (4Ulrich C.D. Holtmann M. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 382-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Identification of the desired mutations was obtained by direct double-stranded sequencing of the mutated region (7Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To control the correct expression of the wild-type and mutated VPAC1 receptor in transfected cells, each construction was fused in the C-terminal position with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the eukaryote expression vector pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as described (11Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Momany F.A. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the presence of GFP at the C terminus of VPAC1 receptor does not modify its phenotype with respect to VIP binding and activation of adenylyl cyclase (11Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Momany F.A. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For mutants with null phenotypes, new constructs were developed in which a Flag sequence was inserted after the leader peptide between Ala30 and Ala31 as described (15Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4990-4996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that this insertion does not modify the dissociation constant for VIP or the dose response of VIP in stimulating cAMP production as compared with the native VPAC1 receptor (15Gaudin P.

Wild-type and mutated VPAC1receptors were stably transfected into CHO cells as previously described (25Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A. Martinez J.

After transfection and 48 h of culture, GFP fluorescence was observed to estimate receptor expression as previously reported (11Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Momany F.A. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). CHO cells were selected in the presence of geneticin (G418) at a final concentration of 0.8 g/liter for 4 days, then they were grown for 3–4 days without G418. After a second round of G418 selection (0.8 g/liter) for 4 days, CHO cells were grown without G418 and used for fluorescence studies (see below) or for membrane preparation as described (7Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The binding properties of the wild-type and mutated VPAC1 receptors were analyzed by competitive inhibition of125I-VIP binding to transfected cell membranes by unlabeled VIP as previously described (17Laburthe M.

Binding parameters (Kd and Bmax) were determined using the LIGAND computer program (26Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 197: 220-239Crossref Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity was assayed as previously reported (27Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 23-27PubMed Google Scholar). Each experiment consisted of a full concentration-response curve and the concentration of VIP which induced half-maximal response (EC50) was determined. Protein content in membrane preparations was evaluated by the procedure of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 78: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Microscopy immunofluorescence studies on transfected CHO cells were performed on nonpermeabilized cells using anti-Flag antibodies as described (15Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C.

Briefly, transfected cell suspensions are incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibodies diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, washed, and then incubated with anti-mouse immunoglobulin G conjugated to rhodamine. Cells are then collected directly on microscope slides by centrifugation at 700 rpm for 10 min (Cytospin3, Shandon Pittsburgh PA) and selected fields are observed using a Leica DM IRB microscope. The fluorescence of GFP in stably transfected living cells was observed directly on a Leica DM IRB microscope. All images were obtained and treated with the Archimed Pro software (Micromécanique, Evry, France). Cell surface expression of mutated receptors with null phenotypes was assessed using the mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibodies as described (15Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C.

Briefly, transfected cells were incubated with anti-Flag antibodies diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, then washed and incubated in presence of the radiolabeled second antibodies (125I-labeled goat anti-mouse whole IgG). The radioactivity was determined in cell lysates. Nonspecific binding was determined with cells only incubated with radiolabeled second antibodies. Binding of anti-Flag antibodies to epitope-tagged mutant receptors was given as a percentage of specific anti-Flag antibodies binding to epitope-tagged wild type receptor (15Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4990-4996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of the VPAC1 receptor is isolated from the rest of the protein in the extracellular medium. It has a predicted length of 144 residues (24Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and thus is large enough to be folded as an independent domain (29Orengo C.A. Michie A.D. Jones D.T. Swindells M.B. Thornton J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1093-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We looked for a protein sharing sequence homology with the N-terminal sequence of the VPAC1 receptor in the Protein Data Bank that contains proteins with known three-dimensional structures. Using the FASTA algorithm (20Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar), the 152–262 fragment of Candida antarctica yeast lipase B (PDB code 1LBS) was selected. This region is a subdomain of the lipase with a self fold. It shares 27% sequence identity and 50% sequence homology with the 8–117 region of the VPAC1 receptor (Fig.1A) which will be referred to as VPAC1-(8–117), the sequence homology and identity, the good alignment of hydrophobic clusters, and the similar distribution of proline and glycine residues validate the calculation of a three-dimensional model of the 8–117 region of the VPAC1 receptor based on the crystal structure of theC. antarctica yeast lipase B. A three-dimensional model of VPAC1-(8–117) was therefore built using Modeller 4.0 (18Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar, 19Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. Van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), refined by energy minimization, and validated by Procheck (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 2,A and B). The local root mean square distance between the VPAC1-(8–117) three-dimensional model obtained and the lipase subdomain is 3.8 Å, indicating a very similar fold of the two protein subdomains. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 which shows a three-dimensional image of the lipase structure versus the three-dimensional model of VPAC1-(8–117). The VPAC1-(8–117) structure shows an overall good compactness, except for the N-terminal extremity (residues 8–30) which looks as a separated, mostly helical structure (Fig. 2B). This fragment was previously hypothezised to be a signal peptide (24Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The model agrees with and even reinforces the suggestion. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the 11–23 fragment is sufficient to support an interaction with a membrane and furthermore, the structure is mobile around the loop located at residues 24–28. The main secondary structure of the 8–117 model is coil since the α helix percentage is 29% and the β structure represents 7%. This is due to the fact that the lipase subdomain taken as template is poor in α and β structures, with 35 and 9%, respectively. In previous work (1Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Nicole P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 94-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we have shown that the N-terminal domain of the human VPAC1 receptor plays an important role in the binding of its natural ligand, VIP. Within the 8–117 region of the receptor, many mutants were previously characterized (7Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Five residues, all dispersed along the N-terminal sequence of the VPAC1 receptor are crucial for VIP binding. They include Glu36, Trp67, Asp68, Trp73, and Gly109 whose mutation into alanine (7Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

All those residues are dispersed in the primary sequence (Fig. 1) but are clearly gathered around a groove in the three-dimensional model (Fig.3A). Conversely, residues whose mutation did not alter the receptor phenotype (see legend to Fig.3) are randomly mapped in the three-dimensional structure with no preferential localization in the groove (Fig. 3A). These observations strongly suggest that the groove is a VIP-binding site of the VPAC1 receptor (Fig. 3A). Using CHIME, the electrostatic potential of the three-dimensional model was calculated (Fig. 3B). The highly negatively charged nature of the groove (red potential on Fig. 3B) reinforces the hypothesis that it could be a VIP-binding site since VIP has several positively charged residues (Arg12, Arg14, Lys15, Lys20, and Lys21). A previous work supported that Arg14, Lys15, and Lys21 of VIP directly participate in the binding of the peptide to the human VPAC1 receptor (25Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C.

Beside an interesting concentration of charged residues, we also noticed the presence of three tryptophans (Trp67, Trp73, and Trp110) all gathered on top of the electronegative groove (Fig. 4). Two of those residues (Trp67 and Trp73) were previously shown to be crucial for the VIP recognition (see Table I). Another interesting feature is the proximity of two Phe residues (Phe90 and Phe93) (Fig. 4). Those amino acids could favor Π-Π interactions with their congeners in VIP (Phe6, Try10, and Tyr22). Indeed, those residues were suggested to be important for VIP structure and/or VIP binding to VPAC1 receptor (25Nicole P. Lins L. Rouyer-Fessard C. Drouot C. Fulcrand P. Thomas A. Couvineau A.

https://openalex.org/W1978591757,"Apc1638N mice, which are heterozygous for a germline mutation in Apc, typically develop three to five spontaneous intestinal tumors per animal. In most cases this is associated with allelic loss of wildtype Apc. We have previously reported that the multiplicity of intestinal tumors is increased dramatically by crossing Apc1638N with an Mlh1-deficient mouse strain that represents an animal model of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). The increased tumor multiplicity in these mice was associated with somatic mutations in the Apc tumor suppressor gene. Here, we have examined the nature and distribution of 91 Apc mutations implicated in the development of intestinal tumors in Mlh1−/−Apc1638N animals. Protein truncation mutations were detected in a majority of tumor samples, indicating that the prevailing mechanism of Apc mutation in tumors is altered from allelic loss to intragenic mutation as a result of Mlh1 deficiency. The observed mutations were a mixture of base substitutions (27%) and frameshifts (73%). Most frameshifts were detected within dinucleotide repeats and there were prominent mutational hotspots within sequences of this sort at codons 927–929, 1209–1211 and 1461–1464. The observed Apc mutations caused protein truncation upstream of the third 20 amino acid β-catenin binding domain and the first Axin-binding SAMP repeat, yielding Apc proteins that are predicted to be deficient in destabilizing β-catenin. Our results reveal a characteristic mutational signature in Apc that is attributable to Mlh1 deficiency. This demonstrates a direct effect of Mlh1 deficiency in the mutation of Apc in these tumors, and provides data that clarify the role of Mlh1 in mammalian DNA mismatch repair."

CFTR is a Cl− channel that is regulated by phosphorylation, nucleotide binding, and hydrolysis. However, the molecular basis for the functional regulation of wild type and mutant CFTR remains poorly understood. CFTR possesses two nucleotide binding domains, a phosphorylation-dependent regulatory domain, and two transmembrane domains that comprise the pore through which Cl− permeates. Mutations of residues lining the channel pore (e.g. R347D) are typically thought to cause disease by altering the interaction of Cl− with the pore. However, in the present study we show that the R347D mutation and diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (an open pore inhibitor) also inhibit CFTR ATPase activity, revealing a novel mechanism for cross-talk from the pore to the catalytic domains. In both cases, the reduction in ATPase correlates with a decrease in nucleotide turnover rather than affinity. Finally, we demonstrate that glutathione (GSH) inhibits CFTR ATPase and that this inhibition is altered in the CFTR-R347D variant. These findings suggest that cross-talk between the pore and nucleotide binding domains of CFTR may be important in the in vivoregulation of CFTR in health and disease.

Like CFTR, these family members possess two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), which bind and hydrolyze ATP, and membrane-spanning domains (transmembrane domains (TMDs)), which form (or regulate, in the case of SUR1) a pathway for the movement of certain substrates through the membrane (3Anderson M.P.

This current model is based on electrophysiological studies of channel gating and biochemical studies of ATPase activity. Several electrophysiological studies of the chloride channel function of phosphorylated CFTR show that MgATP, but not nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues, cause channel activation (3Anderson M.P.

Furthermore, nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues and ATPase transition-state analogues like orthovanadate and berillium chloride disrupt normal transitions from the open to the closed configuration (20Gunderson K.L.

Our studies of purified, reconstituted CFTR revealed that CFTR, like other ABC proteins, possesses intrinsic ATPase activity and that, like channel gating, this catalytic activity is activated by phosphorylation (18Li C.

Furthermore, chelation of magnesium, an essential cofactor of catalytic activity by other ATPases, inhibited CFTR ATPase activity and altered the rate of channel gating (18Li C. Ramjeesingh M.

Moreover, the disease-causing mutation in the conserved Walker C motif of the first NBD of CFTR, i.e.CFTR-G551D, impaired both ATPase activity and the rate of channel opening (18Li C. Ramjeesingh M.

These studies show that the NBDs can transmit signals (conferred by nucleotide occupancy and/or hydrolysis) to the channel pore and regulate the gate that controls chloride flux through the pore of CFTR.For the mammalian ABC membrane proteins P-glycoprotein, MDR3 and MRP1, there is evidence supporting long-range signal transduction from the membrane-spanning domains to the nucleotide binding domains. Substrates that bind to residues in the transmembrane domains of these transporters induce changes in the ATPase activity by the NBDs (26Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 27Szabo K. Welker E. Bakos Muller M. Roninson I. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1461: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In fact, ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein stimulated by certain substrates has been shown to correlate well with transport, since the turnover numbers are similar (26Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Inhibitors that bind to the membrane domain to block the transport of these substrates also cause a change in the catalytic activity (30Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, modification of certain cysteine residues strategically engineered into the transmembrane domains of P-glycoprotein inhibited its catalytic activity, and this effect could be protected by substrates of P-glycoprotein (30Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Therefore, cross-talk between the pore and NBDs is an important means of regulation of these ABC transporters.To date, there are several clues that signals originating from the transmembrane domains of CFTR may regulate the catalytic activity of this protein. For example, diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC), an inhibitor that permeates the chloride channel pore of CFTR, not only causes a change in the rate of chloride ion flux but also the rate of channel gating (33Zhang Z.R. McDonough S.I. McCarty N.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 298-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, certain disease-causing mutations in the transmembrane domains of CFTR have been shown to cause a change in gating (33Zhang Z.R. McDonough S.I. McCarty N.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 298-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Tabcharani J.A. Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J. Gen.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5429-5435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).In the present work, we found that perturbations of the pore either by the channel blocker DPC or through mutagenesis inhibited ATP turnover rate by purified CFTR protein. These results provide direct biochemical evidence suggesting that pore properties can signal feedback inhibition to the NBDs. Furthermore, low millimolar concentrations of GSH appear to inhibit CFTR ATPase activity via a similar pathway, revealing the potential physiological significance of this regulatory mechanism in health and disease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction and Purification of CFTR-His ProteinsProcedures describing productions and purification of CFTR-His proteins were published previously (36Ramjeesingh M. Garami E. Galley K. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 227-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9-baculovirus expression system was used for large scale production of wild type or mutant CFTR proteins. Crude plasma membranes from frozen Sf9 cell pellets expressing recombinant CFTR-His proteins were obtained and solubilized in 8% pentadecafluorooctanoic acid, 25 mm phosphate, pH 8.0. Purification of CFTR-His proteins was performed using nickel affinity chromatography. The solubilized and filtered samples were applied to a freshly generated nickel column at a rate of 2 ml/min. A pH gradient (pH 8.0–6.0) was then applied to the column using fast protein liquid chromatography, and 5-ml fractions were collected.Identification and Analysis of Immunopositive FractionsDot blot was used for analyzing the fractions eluted from the column for the presence of CFTR protein. Immunopositive fractions were selected, and each was concentrated separately in a Centricon YM-100 concentrator (molecular mass cut off 100,000 Da; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) to a final volume of ∼100 μl. Concentrated samples in 4% pentadecafluorooctanoic acid (w/v), 25 mm phosphate, and 100 mm NaCl were diluted 1:10 in buffer containing 8 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.2, and further concentrated to a final volume of 100 μl to reduce the pentadecafluorooctanoic acid concentration to 0.4%. Three microliters from each concentrated fraction were subjected to 6% SDS/polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (Novex, Carlsbad, CA) and analyzed for the quantity and purity of CFTR proteins by Western blot and silver-stained protein gel, as described previously (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205964) Google Scholar, 38Kartner N. Hanrahan J. Jensen T. Naismith L. Sun S. Ackerley C. Reyes E. Tsui L.-C. Rommens J.M. Bear C.E. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 681-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an anti-CFTR polyclonal antibody generated against a fusion protein corresponding to the predicted NBD2 and C terminus of CFTR, amino acids N1197-L1480. Immunopositive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).CFTR-His Reconstitution into LiposomesProcedures describing liposome preparation are reported elsewhere (36Ramjeesingh M. Garami E. Galley K. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 227-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Concentrated fractions containing purified CFTR-His in 0.4% pentadecafluorooctanoic acid (∼100 μl) were mixed with an excess (1 mg) of a sonicated liposome preparation containing phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylcholine:ergosterol (5:2:1:1 by weight; phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Birmingham, AL). A lipid control was generated by diluting 1 mg of liposome mixture containing phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylcholine:ergosterol into 100 μl of a buffer containing 8 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.2. The concentrated CFTR fractions and lipid control were dialyzed in a Spectra/Por dialysis membrane (Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA; molecular mass cut off 50,000 Da) overnight at 4 °C against 4 liters of a buffer containing 8 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.2.Phosphorylation of CFTR-HisHalf of the reconstituted CFTR protein (200–500 μg of total purified CFTR) and the lipid control were phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA (Promega, Madison, WI) for 1 h at room temperature. Phosphorylation reaction mixture contained 250 nm catalytic subunit of PKA, 1 mmMgCl2, and 500 μm ATP in 50 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The other half of the reconstituted protein and lipid control were mock-phosphorylated (i.e. catalytic subunit of PKA omitted from reaction). PKA was removed after phosphorylation by dialyzing all samples in a Specta/Por dialysis membrane (molecular mass cut off 50,000 Da) overnight at 4 °C against 4 liters of a buffer containing 8 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.025% NaN3, pH 7.2. The next day the buffer was changed to one containing no NaN3, and the samples were further dialyzed at 4 °C overnight.Assay of the Catalytic Activity of CFTR ProteinThe catalytic activity was measured as the production of [α-32P]ADP from [α-32P]ATP by purified, reconstituted CFTR, as described previously (18Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.B. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 227-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled ADP and ATP were separated by polyethyleneimine chromatography. Correction for spontaneous hydrolysis of ATP in reactions containing proteoliposomes was done by subtracting the [α-32P]ADP/[α-32P]ATP ratio of control liposomes. Unless otherwise stated, the ATPase assay was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 30 μl of freshly dialyzed proteoliposomes or liposomes, 1 mm nonradioactive ATP, 20 mm Tris, 40 mm NaCl, 4 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (10 μCi/μl; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In few ATPase reactions, NaCl was substituted for sodium gluconate or NMDG-Cl. When the final concentration of chloride, gluconate, or NMDG-chloride was other than 48 mm, the concentration of the inorganic anion was adjusted accordingly to obtain either 14 or 144 mm. However, the concentration of all other components was unchanged, and osmolarity was maintained constant by adjusting with mannitol.ATPase reaction mixtures were incubated at 33 °C for 2 h and then stopped by the addition of 14 μl of 10% SDS, 88% formic acid (v/v). One-microliter samples from the ATPase reaction were spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (VWR, Mississauga, ON) and developed in 1 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl, as described previously (39Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.-J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A STORM840 Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager was used to visualize ADP production by phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated CFTR samples. The quantity of ATP hydrolyzed was determined using the ImageQuant software package (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).For ATPase reactions carried out in the presence of DPC, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) or glibenclamide, the respective drug was first added to 30 μl of freshly dialyzed proteoliposomes followed by a 2-h incubation at 4 °C. The remaining reaction mixture containing 1 mmnonradioactive ATP, 20 mm Tris, 40 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP was added to the proteoliposomes followed by a 2-h incubation at 33 °C.Statistical AnalysisResults are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA; with or without trend, as appropriate) or by two-tailed Student's t test. For comparison of drug treatment to 100% control, one-population Student's t test was used.RESULTSThe Pore Blocker DPC Inhibits ATPase Activity of Wild Type CFTRAs reported previously (18Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28463-28468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), purified and reconstituted CFTR protein displays low level ATPase activity unless phosphorylated by exogenous PKA (Fig. 1 A). Electrophysiological studies have shown that PKA phosphorylation is also required for the chloride channel function of CFTR (4Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 40Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1 B, the open channel blocker DPC inhibited the catalytic activity of phosphorylated CFTR at concentrations of 2 and 10 mm. This inhibitory effect was evident only for phosphorylated protein (Fig. 1 C), as expected if DPC acts inside the open channel pore. A modest (but statistically insignificant) decrease in ATPase activity (∼6%) in phosphorylated CFTR samples was also observed with 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB), another channel blocker from the arylaminobenzolate family (data not shown). Kinetic analyses revealed that DPC inhibits CFTR ATPase activity through an effect on nucleotide turnover (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, DPC treatment caused a 4–5-fold decrease in theV max of CFTR-ATPase, from 0.84 (nmol of ATP hydrolyzed/2 h) to 0.18 (nmol of ATP hydrolyzed/2 h). On the other hand, DPC did not have a major effect on ATP binding to the NBDs of phosphorylated CFTR, with a K m (MgATP) (0.4 mm) close to that typically observed in the absence of drug (0.3 mm; (18Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28463-28468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)). These data suggest that DPC is unlikely to interact directly with the NBDs but, rather, decreases catalytic activity through its effect on the pore.Figure 2MgATP dependence of ATP hydrolysis by purified phosphorylated wild type CFTR protein in the presence and absence of DPC. Each point represents the mean activity for a set of duplicate values. Data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten equation to yield parameters for CFTR protein in the absence of DPC : V max = 0.84,K m = 0.98 mm, andr 2 = 0.98 or, in the presence of DPC :V max = 0.18, K m = 0.37 mm, r 2 = 0.92.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Both DIDS and glibenclamide are large organic anions thought to bind and occlude the CFTR pore. However, the site of action of these inhibitors is less clearly defined than for DPC (41Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J Physiol ( Lond. ). 1996; 496: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast to our findings with DPC, interaction of these blockers with CFTR failed to cause a significant change in the ATPase activity of either the unmodified or PKA-phosphorylated CFTR protein at concentrations typically used to block CFTR chloride channel activity (Refs. 41Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J Physiol ( Lond. ). 1996; 496: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and42Schultz B.D. DeRoos A.D. Venglarik C.J. Singh A.K. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L192-L200PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 3). In fact, both DIDS and glibenclamide tended to enhance (though not significantly) the ATPase activity of unmodified and PKA-phosphorylated forms of the protein relative to the effect of the vehicle alone (2.5% Me2SO). These data suggest that the sites of action of DIDS and glibenclamide on CFTR differ from that of DPC.Figure 3Effect of the channel blockers glibenclamide or DIDS on the catalytic activity of PKA-phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated CFTR. Me2SO (DMSO) was used as a solvent for glibenclamide. The effect of the treatment in each group was calculated as a percentage of no-drug control. Mean ± S.E. are shown. Two different protein preparations were studied independently with respect to the effect of glibenclamide or DIDS. For the Me2SO control, each point represents the mean activity for a set of duplicate values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Electrophysiological evidence supporting the claim that DPC binds in the open pore of CFTR was obtained in part through chloride competition studies (43McCarty N.A.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). McDonough et al. (44McDonough S. Davidson N. Lester H.A. McCarty N.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have shown that the avidity of DPC blockade was dependent on the concentration of chloride ions on the external side of the membrane, with the IC50for blockade by DPC decreasing with a concomitant decrease in chloride ion concentrations (44McDonough S. Davidson N. Lester H.A. McCarty N.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of DPC on CFTR ATPase activity was also sensitive to changes in chloride ion concentrations, we initially assessed the effect of varying NaCl concentrations on CFTR ATPase activity. Surprisingly, we found that the catalytic activity was affected by changes in NaCl concentration alone in the absence of DPC. These findings made the above competition studies problematic given that the protein is randomly oriented in the inside-out and outside-out conformations in our proteoliposomes. We found that increasing the concentration of NaCl from 14 to 144 mm caused a gradual decrease in the ATPase activity of the PKA-phosphorylated but not the unphosphorylated CFTR protein (p = 0.002, ANOVA with linear trend; Fig.4 A). A similar trend was observed when phosphorylated CFTR was exposed to increasing concentrations (14 to 144 mm) of sodium gluconate or NMDG-Cl salts (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between absolute ATPase measurements obtained with NaCl, sodium gluconate, or NMDG-Cl salts at any given concentration (Fig. 4 B). As all of these salt solutions evoked similar concentration-dependent effects on CFTR ATPase, we suggest that the response is not specific to chloride and may relate to changes in the ionic strength, affecting the conformation and function of phosphorylated CFTR protein. However, this hypothesis remains to be rigorously tested.Figure 4Effect of salt concentration on the ATPase activity of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated wild type CFTR protein. Panel A, changes in CFTR ATPase activity in the presence of different concentrations of NaCl relative to 48 mm NaCl control were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (p = 0.005), with a post-test for linear trend (p = 0.002). Each value is shown as the mean ± S.E. Three protein preparations, studied in duplicates, are shown for each treatment group, except for 30 mm chloride, where each value represents a mean of duplicate values. Panel B, comparison of the effect of 14 mm (hatched bar) or 144 mm (open bar) NaCl, sodium gluconate (Na-Glc), or NMDG-chloride on the catalytic activity of phosphorylated CFTR. The effect of the different salts with the same concentration relative to each other on the catalytic activity of CFTR was analyzed by ANOVA. No statistical differences were found among the different treatment groups with the same salt concentration. However, inhibition of ATPase was seen in all groups at high salt concentration (*, unpaired Student's t test, p < 0.02). Three different protein preparations were studied independently with respect to the effect of NaCl (14 and 144 mm) or Na-Glc (144 mm). For Na-Glc (14 mm) and NMDG-Cl (14 and 144 mm), each value represents the mean activity for a set of duplicate values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Pore Mutant CFTR-R347D Exhibits Altered ATPase ActivityDirect evidence for communication between the chloride channel pore and the catalytic domains of CFTR came from assessments of the ATPase activity of a disease-causing variant of CFTR bearing an amino acid substitution (Arg to Asp) at position 347 within the putative pore region. This disease-causing variant is associated with mild-disease phenotype and has been shown to have altered chloride ion conduction through the pore of CFTR (45Tabcharani J. Rommens J. Hou Y. Chang X.

Modeling of a longer RNA in this structure, using a T7DNAP-primer-template structure as a guide, suggests that the phosphate ribose backbone of the RNA contacts a stretch of mostly positively charged side chains between residues 385 and 395 of helix N of the thumb. Scanning mutagenesis of this region reveals that alanine substitutions of Arg391, Ser393, and Arg394 destabilize elongation complexes and that substitutions at 393 and 394 increase termination of transcripts 5 or more bases in length. The α-carbons of all 3 of these residues lie on the side of helix N, which faces into the template-binding cleft of the RNA polymerase, and modeling suggests that they can contact the RNA 4–5 bases away from the 3′-end. Alanine substitutions of other residues within 385–395 do not have marked effects on transcription complex stability, but alanine substitutions of Asp388 and Tyr385 reduce pausing and termination at the T7 concatemer junction. Both of these side chains lie on the outer side of helix N, pointing away from the template binding cleft.

RNA polymerase DNA polymerase elongation complex transcription complex initial TC concatemer junction wild type Tris-Borate EDTA Bacteriophage T7RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 is the best characterized member of a widespread family of RNAPs that includes many phage RNAPs as well as the eukaryotic mitochondrial RNAPs (1McAllister W.T.

With the recent description of crystal structures of a T7RNAP-promoter complex (3Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and an initial transcription complex (ITC) (4Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), T7RNAP presents an exceptional system for investigating the structural mechanisms of transcription, particularly because the transcription reaction mediated by the single-subunit T7RNAP is very similar to the transcription reactions mediated by the more complex, multi-subunit RNAPs (5McAllister W.T. Mechanisms of Transcription: Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 11. Springer Verlag, Berlin1997: 16-25Google Scholar). In particular, the mechanisms of pausing and termination in the T7-like RNAPs and the prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNAPs appear to be similar, because both classes of RNAPs recognize some pause and termination sequences in common (6Jeng S.T.

An especially intriguing question in the biochemistry of transcription concerns the mechanisms of elongation complex (EC) stability. Such mechanisms must make the EC sufficiently stable to keep the RNAP from releasing the template or RNA while it traverses multiple kilobases of DNA and negotiates obstacles such as DNA-bound proteins. Simultaneously, such stability mechanisms must be responsive to regulatory factors (9Reines D. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Reines D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Curr.

Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). One of the structural features used to meet the seemingly conflicting requirements of mobility, stability, and responsiveness is an element that, upon DNA binding, undergoes a conformational change that causes the polymerase to clamp onto the template (12Polyakov A.

Such elements (often dubbed “thumbs” because of their position and the resemblance of polymerases to a cupped right hand) appear to be a ubiquitous feature of polymerase structure and have been shown to be important in stabilizing DNAP-DNA complexes (19Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.R. Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19516-19523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Beard W.A.

The thumb subdomain of T7RNAP is archetypal. It is an extended structure composed of two α-helices connected by an irregularly structured loop (13Sousa R. Chung Y.J. Rose J.P. Wang B.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In the apoenzyme, a portion of the thumb that projects furthest from the rest of the polymerase is disordered (14Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4101-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Sousa R. Rose J. Wang B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Upon binding template this region becomes ordered and part of it assumes helical structure (3Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). A role for the thumb subdomain in stabilizing the EC was revealed by the observation that deletions in the T7RNAP thumb subdomain decrease EC processivity (16Bonner G. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25129-25136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stability (17Gopal V. Brieba L.G. Guajardo R. McAllister W.T. Sousa R. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, although deletions in the thumb affect EC stability, no direct interactions between the thumb and either the DNA or RNA are seen in a T7 RNAP ITC structure (4Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Because the RNA in this structure is only 3 bases in length, we modeled an extension of the RNA using the structure of the homologous T7DNAP complexed with primer-template (21Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) as a guide. This modeling suggested that the phosphate-ribose backbone of the RNA 4–5 nucleotides away from the RNA 3′-end could contact a segment of largely positively charged side chains between residues 385 and 395 of helix N of the thumb subdomain. We carried out scanning mutagenesis of this stretch of residues and characterized the effects of the mutations on RNAP activity. Our results reveal two distinct functions for this helix. The side chains of Arg391, Ser393, and Arg394 contribute to TC stability, apparently through interactions with the RNA 4–5 bases away from the 3′-end. The side chains of Tyr385 and Asp388are not important for TC stability, but mutation of these residues reduces pausing and termination at the T7 concatemer junction, a critical step in T7 phage maturation. Mutant RNAPs were constructed using theCLONTECH Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit and the pDPT7 plasmid (22Bonner G. Patra D. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and followed the manufacturer's instructions. Mutant and w.t. enzymes were expressed and purified as described as described (22Bonner G. Patra D. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Proteolytically nicked RNAP was prepared by incubating purified T7RNAP with whole Escherichia colicells as described by Muller et al. (23Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5671-5763Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions were run by mixing RNAPs and templates at twice the desired final concentrations (as specified in figure legends) in 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. After a 5-min preincubation, reactions were initiated by adding an equal volume of NTPs at twice the desired final concentration (typically 0.5 mm unless otherwise indicated in figure legends) in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Transcripts were labeled by including 10 μCi/μl of [α-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mm). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated, and reaction aliquots were taken at the times indicated in individual figures and stopped by addition of an equal volume of 95ɕ formamide, 25 mm EDTA, 0.01ɕ xylene cyanol, and the RNA components were resolved by electrophoresis in 20ɕ polyacrylamide, 1ɕ bis-acrylamide, 6 m urea gels in 1× TBE. Analysis of the resolved transcripts was carried out with a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager. RNase T1 treatment of halted ECs was carried out by first forming halted ECs on linearized pPK10 (18Mentesanas P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in reactions containing 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.05 μm[α-32P]UTP and 0.1 mm 3′-dCTP (the +1 to +16 transcript sequence from pPK10 is GGGAGAGGGAGGGAUC). After a 5-min incubation at room temperature to allow formation of the halted, chain-terminated EC, UTP was added to 1 mm to limit labeling of transcripts made following the first round of synthesis. RNase T1 was then added to 0.25 unit/μl, and reaction aliquots were taken at time points indicated in figure legends, terminated by phenol extraction, and mixed with equal volumes of 95ɕ formamide, 25 mm EDTA, 0.01ɕ xylene cyanol, and resolved by electrophoresis on 20ɕ polyacrylamide, 1ɕ bis-acrylamide, 6m urea gels in 1× TBE. Fig.1 A shows the structure of a T7RNAP ITC (4Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Superimposed on this structure are the first 4 nucleotides of the primer from a T7DNAP primer-template complex (21Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Superposition was carried out by maximizing the alignment of the main chain atoms of the active site asparates of each enzyme (T7 RNAP Asp537/Asp812 and T7DNAP Asp475/Asp654). When this is done the first 3 nucleotides of the primer from the T7 DNAP structure align with the 3 RNA nucleotides in the T7RNAP ITC, and the fourth primer nucleotide approaches a cluster of mostly positively charged side chains (residues 385–395) on helix N of the thumb subdomain. There are two models for the structure of the RNA-DNA hybrid in the T7RNAP TC. A model similar to one previously developed for E. coli RNAP and polymerase II (24Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) proposes that the RNA in the T7RNAP EC separates from the template after forming a 3-base pair hybrid and passes between the thumb and the N-terminal domain as suggested by the green arrow in Fig. 1 A (4Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Another model proposes that the RNA forms an 8–10-base pair hybrid with the template (25Temiakov, D., and McAllister, W. T. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press.Google Scholar). Although the paths of the RNA in these competing models ultimately diverge, both paths lead the RNA 4–5 nucleotides away from the 3′-end past the 385–395 segment of helix N. We therefore constructed the mutations shown in Fig. 1 B and characterized how these mutations affect RNAP function, TC stability, and termination. A deletion mutation (ThDel) that removes residues 359–381 in a part of the thumb subdomain that is disordered in the apoenzyme (14Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4101-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Sousa R. Rose J. Wang B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) but that becomes ordered upon binding DNA (3Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) was similarly characterized, as was an enzyme that was proteolytically cleaved between residues 172 and 173 but in which the separate fragments remain associated (“nicked” RNAP) (23Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5671-5763Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3790-3799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows the transcripts obtained in continuous initiation assays with the mutant enzymes using a template that generates a 59-base run-off transcript from a class III T7 promoter. The figure shows a reaction that was run for 20 min. Reactions run for 5 or 10 min exhibit fewer total transcripts but similar proportions of short and run-off transcripts. The short (2–9 bases) and run-off transcripts are made in large molar excess of the amount of template or RNAP, indicating that the transcripts are being continuously synthesized and released into solution. All of the enzymes are active and synthesize run-off transcripts at levels similar to the w.t. enzyme. However, some of the mutant enzymes show an increase in the proportion of short transcripts, indicating an increase in termination during initial transcription. Inspection of Fig.2 A reveals that the increases in termination vary as a function of transcript length. S393A, R394A (lanes 11 and12), and the glycine substituted enzymes (lanes 14–17) show increased termination for RNAs >4 bases in length, whereas the ThDel mutant (lane 2) shows the greatest increases in termination for RNAs >7 bases in length. The increases in termination at 5, 6, 8 or 9 bases also increase the amounts of shorter (2–4 bases) transcripts made because, following release of a transcript, the RNAPs reinitiate. As a consequence, an increase in termination at any point during initial transcription will increase the total number of initiation events and abortive transcripts. However, if the percentage of termination for each RNA is quantified as described in the legend to Fig. 2 B, we find that the increases in termination with the mutant enzymes are limited to RNAs >4 bases in length. The observed increases in termination during initial transcription could be due to a decrease in the rates of transcript extension and/or to an increase in the rates of transcript dissociation. To determine whether the mutations affect transcript dissociation, we measured the steady-state rates of transcript synthesis in reactions in which synthesis was limited to 2-mer (GG) or 6-mer (GGGAGA) production. Presteady-state and steady-state analyses carried out under conditions similar to those used here have shown that steady-state rates of abortive transcript synthesis are limited by the rates of transcript dissociation (27Villemain J. Guajardo R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 958-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Jia Y. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30147-30153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Jia Y. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Villemain J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), so that destabilization of the complex leads to an increase in the rate of abortive transcript synthesis (30Villemain J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Huang J. Villemain J. Padilla R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the 2-mer reaction the mutants all displayed synthesis rates similar to the w.t. enzyme (Fig.3, A and C), indicating that the mutations are not increasing 2-mer dissociation. However, when we measured 6-mer synthesis we found that the mutants that displayed increased termination during initial transcription also showed increased rates of 6-mer production (Fig. 3, B andD), indicating that these mutations increased the rate of 6-mer dissociation from the complex. The previous observations indicate that some of the thumb subdomain mutations destabilize ITCs that contain RNAs >4 bases in length. To determine whether these mutations would also destabilize ECs, we measured the rates of transcript synthesis in reactions in which transcript extension was halted during elongation by omitting an NTP. We used a template (pPK5) whose initially transcribed sequence is GGGAGGGAGGGAGACU (18Mentesanas P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), so that a 14-mer is made when only GTP and ATP are present. We first determined, for all of the mutant enzymes, whether the rates of 14-mer synthesis in these reactions would be limited by the rate of halted EC turnover or by the rate of promoter escape. Fig.4 shows a representative experiment measuring the rate of promoter escape for the w.t. and 5 mutants. On the promoter used here the RNAP pauses when the RNA reaches 6 nucleotides in length (43Huang J. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11571-11580Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As measured from the decrease in the amount of 6-mer and the appearance of the 14-mer, the w.t. enzyme (Fig. 4,A, lanes 1–5, and B) clears this promoter and forms the halted complex at a rate of ∼0.6 min−1 at room temperature. With the exception of S393G (Fig. 4, A, lanes 21–25, and B), the mutant enzyme rates of promoter escape are similar to that of the w.t. enzyme. We found that all of the mutants, with the exception of S393G and S393A (not shown), displayed rates of promoter escape similar to that of the w.t. enzyme. The escape rates for S393G and S393A were 2–3-fold slower. Therefore, in these reactions the synthesis of one 14-mer/template occurs rapidly. However, following this initial burst, the synthesis of additional 14-mer is much slower (Fig. 4). We therefore conclude that following the initial burst the rate of synthesis of the 14-mer (for all of the mutants) is limited by the rate at which the halted EC dissociates. We measured halted EC turnover in reactions in which halted complexes were formed on pPK5. The +1 to +16 sequence of the transcript from this template is GGGAGGGAGGGAGACU. By omitting CTP and including 3′-dCTP in reactions with pPK5, we could form halted ECs containing a 15-nucleotide RNA that could not be extended because it lacked a 3′-OH. This made it possible to measure the stability of the EC in either the presence or absence of UTP so that we could assess the effects of NTP binding on complex stability. It has been found that EC stability is affected by template supercoiling (17Gopal V. Brieba L.G. Guajardo R. McAllister W.T. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Mentesanas P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), so we measured EC stability on both linear and supercoiled templates. Representative data for the four different reaction conditions (supercoiled or linear template; ±1 mmUTP) are shown in Fig. 5 A for the w.t. RNAP and for four modified RNAPs that exhibit distinctive behavior. The w.t. enzyme and the D388A mutant are seen to form stable complexes that turn over at a rate of <0.01 min−1 under all four conditions. The nicked enzyme forms a less stable complex; without UTP present the nicked EC turns over at a rate of 0.1–0.2 min−1 on both the linear and supercoiled templates. Addition of 1 mm UTP stabilizes the nicked complex and reduces turnover to <0.01 min−1. Because GTP and ATP are present at 0.5 mm in these experiments, it is clear that this stabilizing effect requires an NTP that is complementary to the template base immediately downstream of the RNA 3′-end (with a template whose initial transcript sequence is GGGAGAGGGAGGGAUC stabilization of complexes halted by 3′-dUMP incorporation required CTP addition; data not shown). The complex formed by R391G is stable on the linear template, but on the supercoiled template it turns over at a rate similar to that of the nicked complex. Addition of UTP stabilizes the R391G complex. Data for all the enzymes are summarized in panels B–D of Fig. 5. Because some of the thumb mutants affect EC stability they might be expected to affect termination. T7RNAP terminates specifically at two types of terminators (32Macdonald L.E. Durbin R.K. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 33Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34He B. Kukarin A. Temiakov D. Chin-Bow S.T. Lyakhov D.L. Rong M. Durbin R.K. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18802-18811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The class I terminator is similar to classic E. coli RNAP intrinsic terminators and is comprised of a sequence that can form a stable hairpin in the RNA immediately upstream of a run of uracils (32Macdonald L.E. Durbin R.K. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Class II terminators are comprised of the sequence AUCUGUU followed by a run of uracils (33Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34He B. Kukarin A. Temiakov D. Chin-Bow S.T. Lyakhov D.L. Rong M. Durbin R.K. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18802-18811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In T7 DNA this sequence is found at the concatemer junction (CJ), and termination or pausing by T7RNAP at the CJ is essential for phage development (35Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fig.6 A shows that none of the mutations had marked effects on class I termination; the percentage termination for all of the enzymes reproducibly fell in the 63–70ɕ range. Fig. 6 B shows termination at a class II terminator. As reported previously, the nicked enzyme fails to recognize the class II terminator (<5ɕ termination) (34He B. Kukarin A. Temiakov D. Chin-Bow S.T. Lyakhov D.L. Rong M. Durbin R.K. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18802-18811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The ThDel and Y385A mutants also show almost complete bypass of the class II terminator (3–4ɕ and 7–8ɕ termination for ThDel and Y385A, respectively), whereas the D388A mutation exhibits a substantial reduction in termination (19ɕ termination). The percentage of class II termination for the w.t. enzyme and the other mutants reproducibly fell between 54 and 73ɕ. Class II terminators act as both pause and termination signals. Sequences that contain the class II CAUCUGUU recognition element (the CJ sequence) but that lack a run of uracils act as pause sites (33Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine whether the thumb mutations affect pausing at such a site, we measured the rate of appearance of run-off and paused/terminated transcripts in continuous initiation assays with the w.t., Y385A, nicked, and ThDel enzymes (Fig. 7). In the case of the w.t. enzyme, the pause at the class II site delays the appearance of significant amounts of run-off transcripts until ∼80 s after initiation of the reaction. However, in the reactions with nicked, ThDel, and Y385A enzymes, run-off transcript is detected 20 s after initiation, and little or no pausing or termination at the class II site is detected. Thus, bypass of the class II site by these enzymes is not due to the fact that they pause but fail to terminate. Instead these enzymes fail to both pause at the CAUCUGUU element and to terminate at a class II terminator. Eight nucleotides of RNA are fully protected from RNase T1 in a T7 RNAP EC, possibly because they are paired with the template (25Temiakov, D., and McAllister, W. T. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press.Google Scholar,38Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 308-347Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An additional 4–6 nucleotides upstream of this strongly protected region are partially protected from T1 digestion (25Temiakov, D., and McAllister, W. T. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press.Google Scholar, 38Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 308-347Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In an EC formed with a nicked enzyme the strong protection of 8 nucleotides of RNA is retained, but protection of the upstream region is reduced (38Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 308-347Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), indicating that nicking of the N-terminal domain disrupts the interaction between the RNAP and the upstream region of the RNA. To determine whether the effects of the thumb mutations on EC stability and termination are due to a similar change in the RNA-RNAP interaction, we treated thumb mutant ECs with RNase T1. Fig.8 shows representative data for the w.t. complex (lanes 1–4), the nicked complex (lanes 5–8), and five thumb mutants (lanes 9–28). The reduced protection of the upstream region of the RNA in the nicked complex is apparent; T1 treatment of the nicked complex results in the rapid degradation of the RNA to 8 nucleotides in length, whereas in the reaction with the w.t. complex the 8-mer is generated more slowly and 11–15-mers accumulate. Quantitation reveals that the ThDel EC also shows loss of protection of the upstream region of the RNA, but to a more modest extent than the nicked enzyme. With the four point mutants, the T1 digestion patterns are similar to that seen with the w.t. complex, and all of the other thumb mutant complexes also showed patterns of T1 sensitivity like the w.t. complex (not shown). Thus, the reduced EC stability and termination for the thumb mutants cannot be attributed to the kind of large change in the RNA-RNAP interaction that is seen with the nicked enzyme. The effects of alanine substitutions at Arg391, Ser393, and Arg394 indicate that these side chains are involved in stabilizing the TC. Their contributions to complex stability become important once the RNA reaches a length of 4–5 bases (Fig. 2). This supports modeling that places the phosphate-ribose backbone of the RNA 4–5 bases away from the 3′-end close to the 385–395 segment of the thumb (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig. 9 the different contributions of the side chains within this segment to complex stability can be interpreted in terms of their positions on helix N. The side chains of Ser393 and Arg394 face toward the RNA and into the large template binding cleft of the polymerase. The side chain of Arg391 faces away from the cleft, but its α-carbon is on the same side of helix N as that of Arg394, so Arg391 could swing into position to interact with the RNA. The S393A and the R394A mutations destabilize both ITCs (Fig. 2) and ECs (Fig. 5), whereas the R391A mutation destabilizes ECs (Fig. 5) but does not markedly increase termination during initial transcription (Fig. 2). Arg391 may only move into position to interact with the RNA following the isomerization that accompanies promoter release. Side chains 385–389, 392, and 395 either point away from the RNA and template binding cleft or are too far from the RNA, as indicated by modeling, to contact it (Fig. 9). Consistent with this, alanine substitutions at these positions do not have large effects on TC stability (Figs. 2, 3, and 5). Upon binding template, part of helix N that is disordered in the apoenzyme assumes a helical conformation (3Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 14Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4101-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Sousa R. Rose J. Wang B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), indicating both that this part of the thumb subdomain is sensitively poised between helical and nonhelical conformations and that its secondary structure is important for function. To test this we introduced glycines at positions 391–394. Glycine is helix destabilizing (36Muñoz V. Serrano L.,. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), so if the secondary structure of helix N is both important for function and sensitive to perturbation, the glycine substitutions should disrupt its activity. We found that glycine substitutions had larger effects on termination during initial transcription and on EC stability than did alanine substitutions (Figs.2 and 5). In fact, although Lys392 points away from the RNA and the template binding cleft and a K392A substitution does not affect TC stability, a K392G substitution markedly destabilizes the EC and increases termination during initial transcription. Similarly, although an R391A substitution has little effect on initial transcription, an R391G substitution has a large effect. A partial deletion of the thumb subdomain results in an EC, which is exceptionally unstable on supercoiled, but not linear, templates (Fig. 5). It has been suggested that this is because an extended RNA-DNA hybrid forms on supercoiled templates and destabilizes the EC (17Gopal V. Brieba L.G. Guajardo R. McAllister W.T. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Mentesanas P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The point mutations in the thumb show a DNA topology-dependent effect on EC stability similar to the thumb deletion. The effects of the thumb mutations on EC stability may be contrasted with the effect of nicking the N-terminal domain, which similarly destabilizes ECs on supercoiled or linear templates (Fig. 5 and Refs. 17Gopal V. Brieba L.G. Guajardo R. McAllister W.T. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 18Mentesanas P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The decreased stability, processivity, and RNA displacement activity of the nicked EC has been proposed to be due to disruption of an interaction between the single-stranded RNA and an RNA binding site on the N-terminal domain (18Mentesanas P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5671-5763Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3790-3799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Huang J. Villemain J. Padilla R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The loss of protection from RNase T1 in the RNA 8–14 bases away from the 3′-end in the nicked EC supports this hypothesis, and the lack of an effect on protection from RNase T1 with the thumb point mutants (Fig. 8) reinforces the conclusion that the thumb and N-terminal domain stabilize the TC through distinct mechanisms. Although the effects of the thumb deletion and the point mutations on EC stability and RNA interactions are similar (and distinct from the effects of nicking), the thumb deletion and the point mutants have distinct effects on initial transcription. Point mutations between 391 and 394 increase termination for RNAs >4 bases in length, but the largest increases in termination for the ThDel enzyme are for 8- and 9-base RNAs (Fig. 2). The small effect of the thumb deletion on termination for shorter RNAs is consistent with modeling (Fig. 9), which indicates that the amino acids within the deleted segment are too far away to contact RNAs 4–6 nucleotides in length. The effect of the deletion on the stability of TCs with longer (>7 bases) RNAs indicates either that the deleted portion of the thumb makes interactions with the RNA 8 or more bases away from the 3′-end or that the destabilizing effect of the deletion is only manifest once the RNA reaches a length of ∼8 bases and the RNAP releases the promoter. NTP binding reduces the turnover rates of the w.t. and mutant ECs to below detectable levels (Fig. 5). Similar observations were made by Mentesanas et al. (18Mentesanas P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and have also been observed in human immunodeficiency virus, and type 1 reverse transcriptase (37Patel P.H. Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Raag R. Nanni R.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5351-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition to the strong stabilization against dissociation, we have also found that NTP binding restricts the lateral mobility (sliding) of the EC on the template (38Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 308-347Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). EC stabilization caused by NTP binding may be due directly to template-NTP-RNAP interactions, or it may reflect an NTP induced isomerization from an “open” to a “closed” conformation in the RNAP. Such an isomerization has been detected kinetically (39Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) and proteolytically (40Dzantiev L. Romano L.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in DNAPs homologous to T7RNAP and has been observed directly in crystal structures (21Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 41Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The latter studies revealed that this isomerization causes the fingers domain of the polymerase to close around the template strand. Presumably, such an NTP-induced isomerization could significantly enhance EC stability. Three amino acids (Tyr385, Arg391, and Ser393) within 385–395 are well conserved among the phage RNAPs, and at another two positions (Asp388 and Arg394) there is conservation of charge (Fig.1 B). As judged from the effects of alanine substitutions, Arg391, Ser393, and Arg394 make the most important contributions to TC stability. To evaluate the importance of charge at positions 391 and 394, we made lysine substitutions at both positions. Relative to the alanine substituted enzymes, both the R391K and R394K mutants form more stable ECs (Fig.5), indicating that charge is a functionally important feature of the side chains at these positions. Mutation of the other two well conserved side chains (Tyr385 and Asp388), which both project from the outer surface of helix N (Figs. 1 and 9), does not affect TC stability but does reduce pausing and termination at the T7 DNA CJ. Proteolytic nicking of the N-terminal domain and deletion of part of the thumb that is close to Tyr385 (Fig. 9) also reduce pausing and termination at the CJ. The mechanism of termination at the CJ is not well understood, so it is difficult to speculate on how these alterations in RNAP structure affect response to the CJ. It is, however, likely that nicking of the N-terminal domain and the thumb mutations work through distinct mechanisms, because nicking leads to a large change in protection from RNase digestion (38Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 308-347Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), as well as to reduced EC stability (17Gopal V. Brieba L.G. Guajardo R. McAllister W.T. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Mentesanas P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and processivity (23Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5671-5763Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3790-3799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a defect in RNA displacement (38Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 308-347Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Y385A and D388A mutations have none of these effects. The effect of nicking on CJ recognition may, therefore, be a consequence of a gross alteration in the RNA-RNAP interaction, whereas the effects of the Y385A and D388A mutations are limited to CJ pausing and termination. It is possible that the Tyr385 and Asp388 side chains directly recognize the CJ in the RNA. In one model for the RNA path in the T7RNAP TC, the RNA passes through a cleft formed by the thumb and N-terminal domain (4Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The RNA, after emerging from this cleft, could contact Tyr385/Asp388 on the outer surface of helix N (Fig. 1). The distance between the RNA 3′-end and the RNA in contact with Tyr385/Asp388 would then be ∼9 nucleotides, which is consistent with the position at which termination occurs relative to the CJ. However, a recent cross-linking analysis proposes a distinct RNA path in which the RNA 8–10 nucleotides away from the 3′-end lies near the RNAP promoter specificity loop (25Temiakov, D., and McAllister, W. T. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press.Google Scholar). In this case, a direct role for Tyr385 and Asp388in recognition of the CJ appears unlikely, although it cannot be ruled out because it is not known whether the RNA path in a normal EC differs from that in a complex paused at the CJ. It is also possible that the CJ is recognized, not through interactions with the RNA, but with the DNA. Finally, it is possible that the effect of the Y385A and D388A mutations is not due to disruption of RNA or DNA interactions but to an effect on conformational changes important for responding to the CJ. For example, because an isomerization in the thumb is important for TC stability, it is possible that pausing or termination involves conformational changes in the thumb that destabilize the TC. Mutations in the thumb could interfere with these conformational changes. Resolution of these questions requires a better understanding of the RNA and DNA interactions in the T7RNAP EC and of the mechanism of pausing and termination at the CJ."
https://openalex.org/W2314421088,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein has been shown to bind directly and inhibit a transcriptionally-important amino-terminal kinase domain of TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250. Cyclin D1 also is able to associate with the amino terminus of TAFII250 in a region very similar to or overlapping the Rb-binding site. In this study, we have examined whether cyclin D1 affects the functional interaction between Rb and TAFII250. We observed that when cyclin D1 is co-incubated with Rb and TAFII250, the ability of Rb to inhibit TAFII250 kinase activity is effectively blocked. However, cyclin D1 by itself has no apparent effect on TAFII250 kinase activity. We further found that the Rb-related protein p107 can inhibit TAFII250 kinase activity, and this inhibition is likewise alleviated by cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 prevents the kinase-inhibitory effect of an Rb mutant unable to bind to D-type cyclins, indicating that it is acting through its association with TAFII250 and not with Rb. However, we found no evidence of TAFII250-binding competition between Rb and cyclin D1 in vitro. The adenovirus E1A protein, which also binds to both Rb and TAFII250, exhibited a suppressive effect on Rb-mediated kinase inhibition similar to that seen with cyclin D1. Our results suggest a novel means by which cyclin D1 may be able to independently regulate the activity of Rb."

To study this interaction, the head and tail domains were expressed, purified, and assayed for various characteristics of complex formation. Analytical centrifugation demonstrated a strong interaction in solution and formation of a complex more asymmetric than either of the individual domains. A survey of binding conditions using a solid-phase binding assay revealed characteristics of both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces involved in the binding. In addition, circular dichroism of the individual domains and the complex demonstrated that conformational changes likely occur in both domains during association. The interaction sites were more closely mapped on the protein sequence by deletion mutagenesis. Amino acids 181–226, a basic region within the acidic head domain, were identified as a binding site for the vinculin tail, and residues 1009–1066 were identified as sufficient for binding the head. Moreover, mutation of an acidic patch in the tail (residues 1013–1015) almost completely eliminated its ability to interact with the head domain further supporting the significance of ionic interactions in the binding. Our data indicate that the interaction between the head and tail domains of vinculin occurs through oppositely charged contact sites and results in conformational changes in both domains.

Our data indicate that the interaction between the head and tail domains of vinculin occurs through oppositely charged contact sites and results in conformational changes in both domains. Focal adhesions are dynamic complexes of structural and signaling proteins located at sites of very close contact between the extracellular matrix and the plasma membrane. These complexes function to link filamentous actin to the extracellular matrix via integrin receptors and a number of cytoplasmic proteins. Vinculin, a soluble 116-kDa protein, is a component of focal adhesions and also plays a role in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (1Hazan R.B. Kang L. Roe S. Borgen P.I. Rimm D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32448-32453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although the specific role of vinculin within focal adhesions is unknown, genetic approaches have been used to demonstrate the importance of vinculin in both cell culture and animal model systems (2Coll J.L. Ben-Ze'ev A. Ezzell R.M. Rodriguez Fernandez J.L. Baribault H. Oshima R.G. Adamson E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Xu W. Baribault H. Adamson E.D. Development. 1998; 125: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vinculin possesses no known enzymatic activity and is believed to play its crucial role through its ability to associate with a large number of other cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. Vinculin has been shown to associate with talin, α-actinin, paxillin, F-actin, and members of the VASP/Ena and ponsin/ArgBP52/vinexin families (4Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 5Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J.

Interactions such as these may play an important role in vinculin function as its association with focal adhesions has been shown to rely on the presence of protein components in these structures (8Ball E.H. Freitag C. Gurofsky S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). By binding to both structural and signaling proteins and bringing them into proximity, vinculin may act as an adaptor protein and may play an important structural role through cross-linking actin filaments. Structurally, vinculin is composed of two domains: a large 90-kDa globular head and a 30-kDa elongated tail connected by a proline-rich hinge region. A strong interaction (K d ∼50 nm) between the vinculin head and tail domains has been observed (9Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inactivation of binding sites for other proteins on both the head and the tail domains has been demonstrated to occur during this self-association. For example, both the binding of the head domain to talin and the binding of the tail to actin filaments are inhibited by the head-tail interaction (10Volberg T. Geiger B. Kam Z. Pankov R. Simcha I. Sabanay H. Coll J.L. Adamson E. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kroemker M. Rudiger A.H. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These observations have led to a model for the vinculin activation in which cytosolic vinculin exists in an inactive, “closed” state, and factors that inhibit the head-tail binding induce vinculin to adopt an active, “open” conformation allowing its recruitment into focal adhesions. The binding sites involved in this intramolecular interaction have been investigated previously using deletion mutagenesis. The deletion of residues 167–207 resulted in an inability of the head domain to bind the tail in vitro (12Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) suggesting that this small region either was structurally important for activity or contained the binding site. C-terminal truncation mutants of the vinculin head domain have been used to localize the tail-binding site to the N-terminal 258 amino acids (12Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), but no attempts have been made to more clearly define the boundaries of this site. Similar strategies have been used to identify the head-binding site within the vinculin tail domain. C-terminal deletions of the vinculin tail were used to define the C-terminal boundary of the site to between residues 1028 and 1036 (9Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the extent of the binding region is not clear. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of the vinculin tail has also been implicated in binding to actin, phospholipids, and paxillin and is one of two sites responsible for focal adhesion targeting of vinculin (13Huttelmaier S. Bubeck P. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1136-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Johnson R.P. Niggli V. Durrer P. Craig S.W.

Many of the tail-binding sites lie within helix 5 and the terminal arm of the vinculin tail. To investigate the vinculin intramolecular association, we have separately expressed recombinant polypeptides of the vinculin tail domain and the N-terminal 266 amino acids of the vinculin head region. We have used these constructs to examine their shapes individually and in a complex by analytical centrifugation and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Further, we developed a solid-phase binding assay to characterize their interaction quantitatively and map regions of the polypeptides sufficient to support the interaction. In this paper, we demonstrate the head-tail binding to be strongly ionic in character and propose that it is the result of the interaction between two oppositely charged faces of amphiphilic helices: a basic region (residues 182–226) within the acidic head domain and an acidic region (residues 1009–1066) within the highly basic tail. In agreement with this, we find that residues Asp-1013, Glu-1014, and Glu-1015 in the tail domain are necessary for interaction with the vinculin head domain. Recombinant DNA techniques were from Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Vinculin domains were amplified from a cDNA pool synthesized from the reverse transcription of total human RNA. Initially, DNA encoding vinculin residues 5–266 was amplified using primers 1 and 2 (TableI). This PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionTBSTris-buffered salineGSTglutathioneS-transferaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid product was cloned into the XbaI and SalI sites of the pGEX-KG vector (19Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this plasmid was used as a template in a PCR reaction using primers 3 and 2 to add the five N-terminal residues. This product was cloned into the PCRBlunt (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) vector and subsequently into the NcoI and SalI sites in the pGEX-KG vector creating construct pKG-V-(1–266).Table IPrimer sequences used for PCR amplification of vinculin deletionsSequences corresponding to vinculin cDNA are underlined.

Non-underlined sequences are 5′ restriction endonuclease sites. Truncations of pKG-V-(1–266) were created using the internalHindIII and SacI restriction endonuclease sites. Construct pKG-V-(1–86) was created by digestion of pKG-V-(1–266) withHindIII and religation. pKG-V-(1–181) was created by digestion with SacI and religation. N-terminal truncations were constructed after digestion of pKG-V-(1–266) with eitherHindIII or SacI, isolation of the cleaved fragment, and re-insertion into the pGEX-KG vector to create pKG-V-(87–266) and pKG-V-(182–266), respectively. pKG-V-(182–226) was created by the digestion of pKG-V-(87–266) with HindIII and religation. To construct vectors to express regions of the vinculin C-terminal tail domain, cDNA encoding amino acid residues 833–1066 was amplified using primers 4 and 5 (Table I). This PCR product was digested usingXbaI and XhoI and cloned into pGEX-KG. This construct was amplified using primers 4 and 6 and cloned into theXbaI and XhoI sites in pGEX-KG. This construct was used for further PCR reactions using primers 6 and 7 and to clone two additional regions of the vinculin tail domain using primers 8 and 4. These two PCR products were cloned into a TA vector (Invitrogen) prior to cloning into the XbaI andXhoI sites of pGEX-KG thereby creating constructs pKG-V-(877–964) and pKG-V-(1009–1066). Site-directed mutagenesis of residues Asp-1013, Glu-1014, and Glu-1015 was performed using a PCR protocol (20Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was cloned, sequenced, and placed into pGEX-KG. Constructs were expressed in BL21(DE3) or RR1 strains ofEscherichia coli. Cultures were shaken at 37 °C until anA 600 of 1.0–1.5 was reached when they were then transferred to room temperature, and 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. Cultures were continuously shaken for an additional 6–8 h. Cells were harvested, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) per liter of bacterial culture. Protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, leupeptin (Sigma), and EDTA were added prior to lysis of cells by passage through a French press at 20,000 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed through centrifugation for 20 min at 30,000 ×g in a Beckman JA17 rotor. Purification of proteins on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) was performed in a manner similar to Ball et al. (21Ball E.H. Shephard L.B. Gill G.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Modifications to this procedure included the use of a 2-ml glutathione-agarose column rather than suspensions of glutathione-agarose. Constructs V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) were cleaved from the GST moiety using 2 μg/ml thrombin (ICN, Irvine, CA) at room temperature for 30 min and thereby eluted from the columns. Other constructs were eluted from the columns using reduced glutathione. Further purification of V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) was performed on ion-exchange columns. V-(1–266) was diluted 5-fold in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) plus protease inhibitors, applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a linear 50–250 mm NaCl gradient. V-(877–1066) was diluted 5-fold, applied to an S-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted using a 50–200 mm linear NaCl gradient. Ultracentrifugation was performed in a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 20 °C. Sample buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Scans were taken at 280 nm. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 30,000 rpm with protein concentrations of 20, 30, and 40 μm. In experiments containing two components, each component was at an equal concentration. Equilibrium was determined by coincidence of scans taken >2 h apart. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 60,000 rpm with scans taken at 10-min intervals. Data were analyzed by software provided by Beckman Instruments. Partial specific volumes were calculated by standard methods. In both one- and two-component experiments, data were fitted to a model of a single ideal interacting species. Proteins were labeled using IODO-GEN (Pierce) as described (22Judd R.C. Deutscher M.P. Guide to Protein Purification. Academic Press, Toronto1990: 613-626Google Scholar); specific activities of 1.5–4.0 × 106 cpm/μg of protein were obtained. A solid-phase binding assay was performed on 96-well polyvinyl chloride plates (Fisher). Unlabeled protein was coated on wells at 15 μg/ml in TBS for 2 h, and then the wells were blocked using 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS for 2 h. Labeled protein was added at a minimum concentration of 10 nm in 100 μl. At this concentration, equilibrium was reached after 8 h of incubation; therefore, all further assays were incubated for at least this length of time. Binding was performed in 20 mmMES, pH 6.8, 75 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm2-mercaptoethanol at 20 °C. After 8 h, unbound ligand was aspirated and the wells were washed three times using binding buffer. Wells were then separated, and bound radioactivity was measured in a Wallac model 1470 gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was determined for each assay by determining the amount of radioactivity bound to the wells in the presence of a 100-fold concentration of unlabeled protein over added radioligand. The amount of protein adsorbed to the plate was determined by coating wells with trace amounts of radiolabeled protein in a total concentration of 15 μg/ml. After 2 h, unadsorbed protein was removed, the wells were washed three times with TBS, and radioactivity adsorbed to individual wells was measured. When binding was performed at variable temperatures, wells containing binding reactions were overlaid with mineral oil, and the plates were wrapped in plastic film. Plates were placed in constant temperature rooms or incubators. All binding data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Reaction conditions within each experiment were performed in triplicate. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. The far UV circular dichroism spectra of vinculin domains V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) was determined using a Jasco-J810 spectropolarimeter. Each sample was scanned over the range of 200–260 nm in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm. Spectra were gathered using 2.5 μmprotein in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, with 50–150 mm NaCl. Spectra were analyzed to determine α-helix content using the CDNN circular dichroism deconvolution program (23Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Protein determination was performed by the Bradford assay (Sigma) and SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli buffer system (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar). To begin our investigation of the interaction between the head and tail domains of vinculin, we cloned and expressed regions of vinculin previously demonstrated to interact (9Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These constructs, V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066), were purified in high yield (20–40 mg/liter culture) and in high purity (>95%) (Fig.1) as assessed by scanning overloaded lanes on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Analytical centrifugation was used to measure the shape and interaction of the domains in solution (Table II). Data in each case were analyzed as ideal single component systems to determine whether the individual domains self-associate over a range of concentrations. The data are presented as a ratio of the observed molecular weight (M O) to the theoretical molecular weight (M T) (Table II). The observed molecular weights for V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) are 32,900 ± 750 and 22,900 ± 1000, respectively, which indicate that the domains act as monomers over the concentration range tested (20–40 μm). To examine the interaction in solution, an equimolar mixture of the two proteins was tested using sedimentation equilibrium. Analysis of the data by fitting to a single ideal species gave a molecular weight of 48,100 ± 1600, almost equal to the expected weight of the heterodimer, 50,925. This result indicates that the recombinant domains interact strongly to form a 1:1 complex. We attempted to calculate the K d by fitting the same data to a dimerization model using the average of the monomeric weights of each component (25Luckow E.A. Lyons D.A. Ridgeway T.M. Esmon C.T. Laue T.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2348-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but the near totality of the dimerization precluded determination of a dissociation constant. To further analyze the overall conformation of the domains, sedimentation velocity was used to determine hydrodynamic parameters. The sedimentation coefficients were determined at 60,000 rpm at 20 °C and were corrected to obtain s 20,w, the sedimentation coefficient in water at 20 °C. Thes 20,w for V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) was determined to be 2.75 and 2.47, respectively, and was then used to determine the frictional ratios of each domain (Table II). V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) have frictional ratios of 1.16 and 1.05, respectively, and thus appear to be globular. The complex of the two domains had a frictional ratio of 1.22, implying that the complex is more asymmetric than either of the two individual domains.Table IISize and shape determination using sedimentation equilibrium and velocity analysisConstructMolecular weight (M T) 2-aCalculated from known sequence.Observed molecular weight (M O) 2-bDetermined using data collected at protein concentration of 20 μm.M O M Ts 20,wFrictional ratio 2-cCalculated from observed molecular weight, partial specific volume, ands 20,w.V-(1–266)29,73632,900 ± 7501.102.751.16V-(877–1066)21,18922,900 ± 10001.082.471.05V-(1–266) + V-(877–1066)50,925 2-dDetermined as the sum of calculated molecular weights of V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066).48,100 ± 16001.893.751.222-a Calculated from known sequence.2-b Determined using data collected at protein concentration of 20 μm.2-c Calculated from observed molecular weight, partial specific volume, ands 20,w.2-d Determined as the sum of calculated molecular weights of V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066). Open table in a new tab To examine the secondary structure of the expressed domains, circular dichroism was used. V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) were found to be 66 and 45% α-helical, respectively, by this method (Fig.2). This fraction of α-helix calculated from the spectra is low for V-(877–1066) in comparison with the determined crystal structure of the vinculin tail, which shows this domain to be ∼60% helical (7Kilic F. Ball E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8734-8740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) were mixed the resulting α-helical content was 46%. The complex is clearly less α-helical than the theoretical average of the individual spectra (Fig. 2), indicating that conformational changes occur during the association of the head with the tail domain. Given the magnitude of the change, it is unlikely that a conformational change in either one of the individual domains alone could account for the observed spectra. For example, if a change in V-(877–1066) alone was responsible for the observed change in the secondary structure, it would require a 60% decrease of its α-helical content. Therefore, it is likely that more moderate changes in the structure of both domains occur during their association. We used a solid-phase binding assay to confirm and extend the results obtained from the analytical centrifugation experiments. A binding isotherm demonstrated specific and saturable binding with aB max of 7.2 ± 0.15 nm, which indicates a stoichiometry of 1.1 ± 0.45 mol of V-(1–266)/mol of V-(877–1066) (Fig. 3). TheK d of a single class of binding sites was determined to be 93 ± 10 nm (inset). The binding was salt-sensitive with over 50% inhibition at 200 mm NaCl (Fig. 4) due to an effect on binding affinity rather than on maximum binding capacity (data not shown). This salt sensitivity was not due to alteration of the conformation of the recombinant domains as the circular dichroism spectra were unaffected over a concentration range of 50–150 mm NaCl (data not shown). The affinity of the interaction was also affected by a temperature variation between 4 and 55 °C (Fig. 5). Lower temperatures led to a greater time to reach equilibrium (3 h at 45 °C versus24 h at 4 °C) and resulted in an ∼20-fold decrease in affinity from 45 to 4 °C (Fig. 5 A). Evidently the domains must be quite stable as binding was still observed at 55 °C. The pH optimum of binding was 7.5 (Fig. 5 B) with strong declines below pH 7.0 and above pH 8.0. Variation of the concentration of divalent cations (MgCl2, CaCl2, MnCl2) and the addition of EDTA had no effect on the interaction of V-(1–266) with V-(877–1066) (data not shown). These results indicate that the reaction between V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) is mediated by both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces.Figure 4Effect of NaCl on binding of V-(1–266) to V-(877–1066). Binding of 125I-V-(1–266) to V-(877–1066) immobilized on a 96-well assay plate in the presence of 0–500 mm sodium chloride was measured.

Within residues 1–266, five deletion mutants were constructed and studied (Fig. 1). Unstable without the GST moiety, these deletions were used as fusions. The GST moiety had no effect on binding of the domains when fused to either V-(1–266) or V-(877–1066) (not shown). The purified deletions of V-(1–266) were iodinated and tested for their ability to bind V-(877–1066). Mutants containing residues 1–86 and 1–181 showed no ability to bind V-(877–1066), but mutants GST-V-(87–226) and GST-V-(182–266) were able to bind to V-(877–1066) with K d values of 180 ± 20 nm and 770 ± 120 nm, respectively (Fig.6). To further delineate this binding region, the sequence common to GST-V-(87–226) and GST-V-(182–266) was expressed and tested for binding. This construct, GST-V-(182–226), bound to V-(877–1066) with a K d of 280 ± 40 nm (Fig. 6). Thus, this segment is sufficient to support binding to the tail although with a 3-fold decrease in affinity. Similarly, we created deletion mutants of the vinculin tail to help map a minimal binding region for the head domain. Constructs GST-V-(877–964) and GST-V-(1009–1066) were designed to collectively include all known binding sites of ligands of the vinculin tail. These proteins were expressed, purified, coated onto wells, and probed with125I-V-(1–266) to determine whether the deletions bind to the vinculin head (Fig.7 A). Of the two constructs, only V-(1009–1066) supported binding to V-(1–266). This interaction occurred with a K d of 630 ± 50 nm(Fig. 7 A). The inhibition of binding between V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) by salt is indicative of an ionic interaction. Because the 182–226 sequence was basic, we suspected that acidic residues within 1009–1036 would be involved, in particular an acidic patch near residue 1013 seen in the crystal structure. To test this possibility, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change three acidic residues (Asp-1013, Glu-1014, and Glu-1015) to alanine within V-(877–1066). The mutations had little effect on the conformation of the domain as measured by circular dichroism (Fig. 7 B). The difference in the measured α-helical content for V-(877–1066) and V-(877–1066/D1013A,E1014A,E1015A) was less than 1% helix, but the mutant was inactive when assayed for its ability to bind to V-(1–266) (Fig. 7 A). Regulation of protein function by intramolecular autoinhibition has been recognized to occur within a diverse group of proteins (26Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In these proteins, activity is inhibited in the intramolecularly associated state, and separation of the self-associated domains via binding of an activator, phosphorylation, or proteolysis restores activity. Expression of the separate interacting domains of vinculin facilitated characterization of the binding and better definition of the regions of the polypeptides involved. Our measuredK d of 93 ± 10 nm agrees with earlier observations of a tight interaction (K destimated at 50 nm) (9Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) between the separate domains, suggesting an extremely tight interaction within the whole molecule where the domains are physically connected. We have also found that the interaction is sensitive to increases in ionic strength and temperature. These data indicate that both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces play important roles in the interaction of the head and tail domains. Furthermore, the observation that the association is greatly decreased below pH 7 is in agreement with the observation that the head and tail domains of vinculin remain tightly associated after V8 protease cleavage within the proline hinge sequence but can be separated at a low pH (27Groesch M.E. Otto J.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 15: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The observed effect of salt concentration on the interaction of the head and tail domains is consistent with its observed effect on whole vinculin. At low and physiological concentrations of salt, vinculin is monomeric as observed using rotary shadowing and electron microscopy, but at high salt concentration vinculin is seen as multimers of four to six molecules (28Molony L. Burridge K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Winkler J. Lunsdorf H. Jockusch B.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on our data, high ionic strength might lead to the dissociation of the head-tail interaction allowing intermolecular interactions to occur. In addition, the dissociation of the head and tail that is induced by certain lipids is decreased at low ionic strength (30Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), possibly due to the higher head-tail binding affinity. As a first step toward identifying specific residues involved in the interaction, deletions were used to further define the interacting regions. In the N-terminal domain, we identified a small peptide (residues 182–226) as a binding site for the vinculin tail. Although this region has a somewhat reduced affinity in comparison with the complete V-(1–266), it must contain the major binding determinants. The location of the site between residues 182 and 226 likely explains the inactivity of the 167–207 deletion mutant (12Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) due directly to removal of interacting residues rather than structural change. This region likely adopts an α-helical conformation as the homologous region in the related protein, α-catenin, is also α-helical (31Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Molecular Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, our circular dichroism measurements point to a high α-helical content (Fig. 2). It is interesting that construct V-(1–266) has a theoretical pI of 5.11, whereas the tail-binding region within it, residues 182–226, has a calculated pI of 8.16. Thus, this binding site is a basic island exposed on the surface of an α-helix within the acidic head domain. This led us to look for an oppositely charged region in the tail sequence as possible interaction sites. It was unexpected that the shorter deletion mutant V-(182–226) rather than the larger V-(182–266) bound with a higher affinity, and we suspect that the extra 40 residues either affect the folding of the 182–226 region or bind to it in competition with the vinculin tail. There are a number of acidic residues in the 226–266 sequence (calculated pI is 4.8) that could interact with the basic V-(182–226) region. In the intact molecule, constraints of tertiary structure would presumably prevent these effects. Within the vinculin tail sequence, previous deletion analysis had defined a C-terminal boundary to the head-binding site. Truncations of the tail domain from 1066 back to residues 1043 or 1036 remain competent to bind the head domain, but the tail domain lacking residues 1028–1066 is inactive (12Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our finding that residues 1009–1066 can bind to the head limits the N-terminal boundary of the site to residue 1009, thus mapping the major site of contact to between residues 1009 and 1036. The reduced affinity of the V-(1009–1066) piece (K d 630 nm) versus the V-(877–1066) (93 nm) for the head indicates that there are sequences outside this area required for high affinity binding or structure determination. It is clear, however, that this region contains a site sufficient to support binding to the head. In the recently determined crystal structure, this sequence forms a loop and part of helix 5 at one end of the tail. Binding of the head to this loop could result in an elongated complex consistent with the ultracentrifugation data, which shows a higher degree of asymmetry than either individual domain. Another notable feature of this sequence is the preponderance of acidic residues; although the tail domain of vinculin is basic overall with a theoretical pI of 9.15, the calculated pI of residues 1009–1036 is 4.14. To verify our prediction that acidic residues are critical for the interaction, we mutated three consecutive residues (Asp-1013, Glu-1014, and Glu-1015) to alanine and found, as expected, a drastic decrease in binding affinity. Whereas the decreased affinity of V-(1009–1066) for V-(1–266) indicates that other regions of the tail contribute to the binding, the abrogation of binding as a result of these mutations within V-(877–1066) shows that those contributions alone cannot support the interaction. This clearly demonstrates that the region 1009–1036 is the major contact site for V-(1–266), and very likely one or more of the acidic residues mutated are directly involved in the binding. Deletion experiments demonstrating a requirement for residues 1028–1036 (12Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) are not inconsistent with our results and indicate that 1028–1036 are also necessary either to maintain the structure of the binding site or to make significant contacts. Taken together, these results strongly support ionic interactions between the oppositely charged sequences as major binding determinants. It is interesting to note that several other vinculin-binding sites are dependent upon sequences near the 182–226 and 1009–1036 binding sites. Talin has been demonstrated to bind the vinculin head (7Kilic F. Ball E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8734-8740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is dependent upon residues 167–207 (32Gilmore A.P. Jackson P. Waites G.T. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 719-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, a lipid binding domain (residues 1016–1066), a paxillin-binding site (requiring residues 978–1066) (15Wood C.K. Turner C.E. Jackson P. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an actin filament-binding site, and an oligomerization site (13Huttelmaier S. Bubeck P. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1136-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) all have been demonstrated to be near the head-binding site within the tail. The proximity of these sites suggests a direct mechanism for interactions and regulation to occur. A simple model for vinculin regulation postulates that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate “opens” vinculin by somehow causing head-tail dissociation. A lipid-binding site near or coincident with the head-binding site raises the possibility of direct competition. Further experiments are needed to resolve the precise mechanism. The conformational flexibility of vinculin is largely unexplored but seems considerable. Our circular dichroism data show the first evidence of conformational changes in the head domain, but there is supporting evidence for distinct conformations of the tail domain in the presence of actin or lipid (33Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Evidence of conformational change in both of these domains indicates that the head and tail domains may adopt different conformations in the vinculin open and closed states irrespective of ligand binding. The existence of multiple structures suggests that a steric blocking model for vinculin regulation may be too simplistic and that allosteric mechanisms may predominate. Thus, vinculin is expected to show complex behavior in response to its various binding partners and may function in both regulatory and structural roles. The studies described here will provide a basis for further investigation of this complicated protein.

Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements on the binding of cAMP to CRP* show that the binding mechanism changes from an exothermic independent two-site binding mechanism at pH 7.0 to an endothermic interacting two-site mechanism at pH 5.2, similar to that observed for CRP at both pH levels.

https://openalex.org/W2323963269,"The brest cancer predisposing genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 appear to be involved in DNA repair. In particular, the sensitivity of BRCA2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts to ionizing radiation and the demonstrated interaction of the BRCA2 protein with Rad51, a major factor in recombinational repair, indicate that BRCA2 is important for double strand break repair. The human BRCA2-deficient human cell line Capan-1, whilst being sensitive to ionizing radiation, is also sensitive to the alkylating agent methymethanesulfonate. The major lesions induced by this agent are methylated bases which are removed primarily by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. We have investigated the efficiency of BER in Capan-1 cells by an in vitro assay in which plasmid substrates containing a single lesion are repaired by mammalian cell extracts. In comparison to the control cell lines BxPC-3, T24 and MCF7, Capan-1 cells exhibited a reduced rate of DNA ligation during both the single-nucleotide insertion and PCNA-dependent pathways of BER. The reduced rate of DNA ligation exhibited by Capan-1 cell extracts was complemented by addition of bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase or human DNA ligase III. BRCA2-mutant Capan-1 cells may possess reduced DNA ligase activity during BER."

The interdependence of hydrolysis and signaling functions of GTPases has fostered intensive studies of the chemical mechanism of the Ras-catalyzed hydrolysis of GTP.Classical general base theory suggests that Ras might catalyze hydrolysis by abstracting a proton from the nucleophilic water, thereby activating it to attack the γ-phosphate. Careful inspection of the GTP-bound active site of Ras suggests five possible general base candidates (Asp-38, Asp-57, Gln-61, Glu-62, and glu-63). The GTPase activity of mutants of each of these amino acids has been studied (13Cales C. Hancock J.F. Marshall C.J. Hall A.

Biol. 1995; 2: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and it is generally agreed that the presumed base has not been identified. The lack of a conclusive identification of the base has spawned alternative suggestions for the chemical mechanism. A recent theory that has attracted considerable attention is the γ-phosphate general base theory, which hypothesizes that the γ-phosphate of GTP, rather than an amino acid R-group, is the general base.The idea that the γ-phosphate might be the general base in GTPase-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions was described first in a computational study that calculated that the hydrolysis ΔG ‡ for this mechanism is 24 ± 5 kcal/mol, which is close to the experimentally observed value (∼22 kcal/mol) (17Neal S.E. Eccleston J.F. Hall A. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19718-19722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Support for this theory was provided in a subsequent paper in which the 31P-NMR of Ras-bound GTP was studied as a function of pH. The α-, β-, and γ-resonances of GTP shift concomitantly at a pH midpoint of 2.9, which agrees, within error, with the midpoint obtained from pH rate studies of Ras-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis. pH rate studies of Ras kcatmutants were used to construct a free energy plot (ΔG ‡ versuspKa); the plot was linear, with a slope of 2.1 (18Schweins T. Warshel A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14232-14243Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with, but do not prove that, the observed midpoint is the pKa of the γ-phosphate of the bound GTP. Vibrational spectroscopy provides an unambiguous means of assigning the protonation state of phosphate and can be used to define the structural and bonding changes that occur upon protonation (20Deng H. Wang J.H. Ray W.J. Callender R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 3617-3623Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 1H. Cheng, S. Sukal, T. S. Leyh, and R. Callender, accepted for publication.1H. Cheng, S. Sukal, T. S. Leyh, and R. Callender, accepted for publication. To definitively assess whether the midpoint is, in fact, the pKa of the γ-phosphate and to define the bonding changes associated with the protonation, the pH dependence of the vibrational spectrum of the Ras·GTP·Mg2+ complex was investigated.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe materials and suppliers used in this study are as follows: restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs), Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), polyethyleneimine F-cellulose TLC plates (EM Science), KCNO (Acros Organics), radionucleotides (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 18O-water (96.2 atom % 18O) (Isotec), Q Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), P6 spin columns (Bio-Rad), DNA primers (Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine), BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli and pET-23a(+) plasmid (Novagen), and Centricon 10 (Amicon).

The amplified product contained NdeI and BamHI restriction sites at the 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively, that were used to insert theras coding region into pET-23a(+). Each strand of theras coding region in the pET-23a(+)/rasexpression vector was sequenced. The primary sequence predicted by the coding region exactly matched that of the published humanras sequence (GenBankTM accession numberJ00277). The expression system produced ras at ≥10% of the soluble cellular fraction (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis).The Ras PurificationRas was purified using standard procedures (21Tucker J.

U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5704-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 mg of >95% pure protein Ras was obtained per liter of cell culture. The pure protein was stored in buffer containing 0.10 mm GDP at −70 °C.The Ras Activity AssayGDP was removed from Ras stocks by incubating Ras (52 μm, final concentration) for 5 min in exchange buffer (23Hoshino M. Clanton D.J. Shih T.Y. Kawakita M. Hattori S. J Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1987; 102: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Moore K.J. Webb M.R. Eccleston J.F.

The enzyme/exchange solution was then loaded onto a P6 spin column (equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol) and eluted by centrifugation directly into 1.2 active site equivalents of GTP/[γ-32P]GTP tracer. Ras was nucleotide-free for less than 1 min. The GTP hydrolysis reaction was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 (10 mm, final concentration) and quenched by the addition of Na4EDTA, pH 9.5 (200 mm, final concentration). 10-min time points were taken, spotted on polyethyleneimine F-cellulose TLC plates, and developed in a 0.90 m LiCl mobile phase. The radioactive reactants were quantitated using an AMBIS two-dimensional radioactivity scanner. The resulting time course fit a single exponential to give a calculated turnover number of 0.013 ± 0.005 min−1.The Synthesis of [γ-18O3]GTP460 μmol of fresh PCl5 was added quickly to a 30-fold molar excess (250 μl) of rapidly stirred 18O-water. The solution was brought to pH 7.0 by addition of 10 m KOH. 460 μmol of sodium acetate was then added from a 1.0 m stock. The mixture was diluted 2-fold with unlabeled water, and 7.5 molar equivalents of KCNO were added from a freshly prepared 6 m stock. The reaction solution was maintained at 30 °C and kept at pH 6.5 by the addition of glacial acetic acid in 5-min intervals over 30 min. Two additional molar equivalents of KCNO were added, and pH monitoring was continued for an additional 30 min. 4.0 ml of a solution containing ADP (115 mm (460 μmol)), MgSO4 (116 mm), and Tris (0.58 m, pH 7.3) was added, followed by 17 units (μmol of substrate converted to product per min atVmax) of carbamate kinase, and the mixture was incubated at 38 °C for 30 min to convert the ADP and carbamyl phosphate to [γ-18O3]ATP. The nucleotide was diluted to 5.5 mm using an 11 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 11 mm MgSO4 buffer. Five mole equivalents of GDP and 200 units of nucleoside-5′-diphosphate kinase were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h.The nucleotide was purified on a Q Sepharose Fast Flow anion exchange column using a 10 mm to 1.2 m triethylamine bicarbonate (pH 7.6) linear gradient. GTP eluted at 1.0 mtriethylamine bicarbonate. Fractions containing GTP were collected and rerun under similar conditions to further remove nucleotide contaminants. Triethylamine was removed by rotary evaporation to dryness; the GTP was suspended and rotary evaporation three times in methanol and three times in water. The nucleotide was then dissolved in water, and the pH was adjusted to 8.5 by addition of 10m KOH. The purified product was stored at −70 °C. TLC on polyethyleneimine F-cellulose plates showed that the [γ-18O3]GTP was more than than 95% pure.Electrospray Mass SpectrometryThe nucleotides were analyzed by mass spectrometry at the Hunter College Mass Spectrometry Facility, New York, NY, on an Agilent Technologies (formerly Hewlett Packard) HP1100 liquid chromatography/mass selective detector instrument. Negative ion electrospray spectra were analyzed to give 89.6 and 88.0% enrichment in 18O for [γ-18O3]GTP.Nucleotide ExchangeRas·GDP storage buffer was replaced with nucleotide exchange buffer (200 mmTris-HCl, 200 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.55 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm NaN3, 0.6 mmEDTA, pH 7.5) by repeated concentration and dilution at 4 °C using Centricon 10 concentrators. After buffer exchange, Ras was adjusted to ∼0.50 mm, and a 10-fold molar excess of [γ-18O3]GTP was added. Nucleotide exchange was complete after 30 min at 25 ± 2 °C.Sample Preparation for γ-Phosphate ExperimentsFollowing nucleotide exchange, nucleotide exchange buffer and excess nucleotide were removed, as described above, and replaced by 20 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmNaN3, pH 7.5. The pH was adjusted by addition of HCl or NaOH. The final concentration of Ras used in the experiments was 2 to 4 mm.Sample Preparation for Amide I ExperimentsRas·GDP was exchanged into deuterized buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NaN3, D2O solvent, pD*27.5). The pD was adjusted with DCl or NaOD. The final Ras concentration was 0.4 mm. Ras·GTP was exchanged into 20 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 mm NaN3, 0.6 mm EDTA, D2O solvent, pD 7.5. The EDTA sequesters Mg2+and prevents GTP hydrolysis. Concentrated protein was then added to different buffers (chloroacetic acid, formic acid, and acetic acid) containing MgCl2 just before the IR experiments.SpectroscopyThe IR studies of the phosphate stretch modes involve isotope editing procedures that have been discussed previously.1 All Fourier transform IR spectra were measured on either an IFS-66 Fourier transform spectrometer (Bruker Instruments Inc., Billerica, MA) or a Magna 760 Fourier transform spectrometer (Nicolet Instrument Corp., WI). A dual cell shuttle accessory was used to perform the 18O-16O difference spectroscopy. This procedure makes sure the environments of two subtracted samples are essentially identical. The Teflon spacer between two BaF2 cells was set at 25 μm. Typically, the sample and reference spectra are not exactly identical. In this case, the parent spectra are factored such that the amide II bands are nulled after subtraction. The protocol for buffer subtraction is identical except that the baseline between 1750 cm−1 and 2000 cm−1 is nulled. The contribution from vapor was also removed by subtraction.Amide I MeasurementsThe IR spectra of the protein complexes in the amide I region were obtained at various pH values. The spectra were enhanced by Fourier spectral deconvolution (FSD) (enhancement factor = 1.5; intrinsic bandwidth = 17 cm−1). The FSD method helps to resolve the peak position of each component in the original spectra. From the FSD spectra, we could determine the frequencies that characterize the high and low pH forms. To find the pKa of the transition from low to high pH, the difference in the intensity pairs that changed the most during the titration were plotted as a function of pH (1640–1635 cm−1 and 1641–1638 cm−1 for the Ras·GTP·Mg2+ and Ras·GDP·Mg2+ complexes, respectively). Because of slightly varying protein concentrations at the different pHs, the intensity differences were normalized by the area of the corresponding amide I band. A linear transformation of the data was performed to make the differences lie between 0 and 1, and the resulting normalized intensity versus pH plots were fit using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to obtain apparent pKa values (see Fig. 3).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe validity of the γ-phosphate general base hypothesis rests on the proposition that the γ-phosphate of Ras-bound GTP partially abstracts a proton from the nucleophilic water, making it more hydroxide-like, thereby activating it to attack the γ-phosphate and cleave the β,γ-bond of GTP. Experimental support for this hypothesis is provided by 31P-NMR pH titration studies of Ras·GTP·Mg2+ in which the α−, β−, and γ-31P resonance positions shifted concomitantly at a pH midpoint of 2.9. This midpoint was interpreted as the pKa of the GTP γ-phosphate in the Ras·GTP complex (16Schweins T. Geyer M. Scheffzek K. Warshel A. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In solution, the α−, β−, and γ-31P resonances shift independently as they become protonated (25Cohn M. Hughes T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3250-3253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the results of the enzyme-bound studies are interpreted on the basis of the addition of a single proton to the tripolyphosphate chain of GTP, the simultaneous shift of all three resonances creates an unavoidable ambiguity regarding which of the three phosphoryl groups receives the proton; it is as if the proton “belongs” to each of them.The vibrational spectrum of phosphate provides a sensitive, site-specific measure of its protonation state. The frequencies of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the P–O bonds of phosphate and phosphate monoesters undergo large (∼75 cm−1) shifts as phosphate switches between its mono- and dianionic forms (20Deng H. Wang J.H. Ray W.J. Callender R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 3617-3623Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In favorable cases (i.e.when both the symmetric and antisymmetric frequencies of the oscillator can be assigned) it is possible to quantitate changes in bond length and bond order with accuracies of better than ±0.004 Å and 0.04 valence units,1 respectively. To obtain a more complete description of the structural and bonding changes that the γ-phosphate undergoes as the pH passes through the 2.9-midpoint, the pH dependence of the vibrational spectrum of the γ-phosphate of GTP in the Ras·GTP·Mg2+ complex was studied using IR spectroscopy.The vibrational spectrum of the Ras·GTP·Mg2+ complex is quite complex, and identifying the stretch band of γ-phosphate of GTP is difficult (26Wang J.H. Xiao D.G. Deng H. Webb M.R. Callender R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11106-11116Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This problem can be overcome using an isotope-editing scheme in which the natural abundance spectrum of Ras·GTP·Mg2+ is subtracted from that of an identical complex in which the nonbridging oxygen atoms of the GTP γ-phosphate have been enriched in 18O. Increasing the mass of an oxygen nucleus shifts the vibrational frequencies of the modes in which it participates; this frequency offset is what is revealed in the difference spectrum. Properly subtracted parent spectra produce a difference spectrum that contains only the differences in the absorption bands associated with the bonds that involve the labeled nuclei (26Wang J.H. Xiao D.G. Deng H. Webb M.R. Callender R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11106-11116Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).1To aid in assigning the Ras·GTP·Mg2+ difference spectra and to provide comparisons between the active site and solution behavior of the γ-phosphate, the difference spectra for the γ-phosphate-protonated and -deprotonated forms of GTP·Mg2+ in solution were obtained. To select the pH values at which to acquire the protonated and deprotonated spectra, the pKa of the GTP·Mg2+ complex (4.2 ± 0.2) was determined in water at 25 °C (data not shown). The unprotonated (pH 5.9), intermediate (pH 4.5), and fully protonated (pH 2.8) difference spectra are presented in Fig.1 A. The protonated and deprotonated spectra do not change at higher and lower pH values, respectively. The intermediate spectrum, pH 4.5, appears to be a weighted composite of the protonated and deprotonated spectra, suggesting that the system is well described by a two-state (protonated/deprotonated) model.Figure 1pH dependence of the GTP γ-Phosphate IR Difference Spectra. A, the GTP·Mg2+ solution spectra. The sample composition was as follows: [γ-18O3]GTP or GTP (4.0 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm);T = 20 ± 1 °C. B, the Ras·GTP·Mg2+ spectra. The solutions contained the following: Ras·[γ-18O3]GTP·Mg2+ or Ras·GTP·Mg2+ (2.0 mm), Mg2+ (10 mm), Tris/Cl (20 mm), pH 7.5; T= 4 ± 1 °C. Samples were prepared and measurements were made as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The pH dependence of the Ras·GTP·Mg2+ difference spectra is shown in Fig. 1 B. The position and18O-isotopic shift of the Ras-bound (pH 7.5) and solution phase (pH 5.9) γ-phosphate difference spectra of GTP·Mg2+ are extremely similar. The ∼12 cm−1 spectral shift that occurs when the nucleotide binds to Ras results from specific interactions between the γ-phosphate and the active site (27Cepus V. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10263-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Du X. Frei H. Kim S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8492-8500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).1 These similarities strongly support the notion that the γ-phosphate is dianionic at the active site. The spectrum begins to change at pH 3.3, indicating that the γ-phosphate remains largely unprotonated at this pH. Thus, the active site of Ras has decreased the pKa of the γ-phosphate by >1.1 units compared with solution. As the pH decreases below 3.3, the difference spectrum becomes distinctly different, indicating a considerable change in the electronic structure of the γ-phosphate. However, the spectrum does not resemble that for the protonated GTP·Mg2+ in solution. Therefore, the spectral change below pH 3.3 cannot be explained simply on the basis of a protonation of the γ-phosphate. Whether or not γ-phosphate protonation occurs, there must be a substantial change at the active site to yield the very unusual observed bands.The conclusions from the IR data agree in many respects with previous NMR results. The decreased pKa and change in the γ-phosphate environment are consistent with the NMR results, as is the fact that most (greater than 90%) of the nucleotide remains bound at the low pH; if this were not the case, the protonated solution spectrum would be observed. However, despite our efforts to reverse the low pH transition, we could only partially recover the high pH spectrum, suggesting that an irreversible event occurs at low pH. Given the low pH of the event, it was probably caused by an unfolding of the complex. To further investigate the unfolding issue, the pH dependence of the amide I spectrum of the nucleotide-bound complex was studied.The pH-dependent Unfolding of RasProtein amide I spectra (∼1600–1700 cm−1) arise from the C=O stretch of the polypeptide backbone. The position of a C=O band within the amide I region is determined primarily by its hydrogen bonding and transition dipole coupling to other C=O groups, which is distance- and orientation-dependent (29Bandekar J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The unique geometric and bonding characteristics of the different secondary structures result in structure-specific amide I absorbance bands. Previous correlations between band position and secondary structure (30Prestrelski S.J. Byler D.M. Thompson M.P. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1991; 37: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Prestrelski S.J. Byler D.M. Liebman M.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have assigned absorbance centered at 1650–1655 cm−1 to the α-helix and absorbance at 1635 and 1675 cm−1 to the low (intense) and high (weak) frequency components of the β-sheet structure; peaks at 1668, 1675, and 1686 cm−1 are indicative of turns, and the 1645 cm−1 region is associated with a disordered polypeptide. Despite ongoing efforts, accurate quantitation of the secondary structural composition from amide I spectra is not yet generally feasible (32Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar); however, changes in an amide I spectrum are frequently used as a sensitive indicator of secondary structural change (33Fraser P.E.

The samples were prepared in D2O to shift the intense IR absorption band of water out of the amide I region. To better visualize the amide I regions that change as a function of pD, the spectra were enhanced by FSD (37Wi S. Pancoska P. Keiderling T.A. Biospectroscopy. 1998; 4: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 38Kauppinen J.K. Moffatt D.J. Mantsch H.H. Cameron D.G. Appl. Spectrosc. 1981; 35: 271-276Crossref Google Scholar). The FSD spectra are shown in Fig. 2, C and D. The pD-dependent changes in the amide I spectra of these complexes clearly indicate changes in their secondary structure. The GTP complex undergoes two denaturing transitions. The first, between pD* 5.4 and 2.6, is well behaved and reversible. The second, between pD* 2.6 and 1.7, is not well behaved. The results were not reproducible at pD* values below 2.7. We suspect that this is due to a tendency for Ras to aggregate at this low pD* value, a common finding for acid-unfolded proteins.Figure 2The pH dependence of the amide I spectra of Ras·GTP·Mg2+ and Ras·GDP·Mg2+.

Low pH denatures both the α-helical and β-sheet structures, because the 1635 and 1651 cm−1 peaks in the high pD* are replaced by peaks at 1640 and 1657 cm−1. At lower values of pD, below 2.6, the changes in the amide I absorbance indicate disruption of still more secondary structure in the second transition.To better understand the pD dependence of the first (reversible) transition, titration curves of the amide I changes were constructed (Fig. 3). The curves were fit using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (the fits are shown as solid curves). The Ras·GDP·Mg2+ titration is fit well by a model in which the observed changes are due to the addition of a single proton, with a pKa of 4.8. The single-proton scheme did not describe the Ras·GTP·Mg2+ titration well; however, a two-proton uptake model provided an excellent fit. The apparent pKa predicted by the fit was 3.7.

Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 306-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Restriction-modification enzymes are traditionally divided into three classes designated type I, II, and III on the basis of enzyme subunit composition, cofactor requirements, substrate specificity characteristics, and reaction products (2Yuan R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An increasing number of restriction endonucleases that do not fit into the conventional classification however have been reported (3Szybalski W. Kim S.C. Hasan N. Podhajska A.J.

Their differences from the type I and type III enzymes are so substantial that a classification as new kinds of restriction endonucleases; type IIS, type IIT, type IV, and Bcg-like has been suggested (3Szybalski W.

The type IV restriction endonuclease Eco57I has been studied in detail (4Janulaitis A. Petrusyte M. Maneliene Z. Klimasauskas S. Butkus V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6043-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similar to type IIS endonucleases, it recognizes an asymmetric nucleotide sequence, cleaves both DNA strands outside the target site 5′-CTGAAG(N)16/14↓ and exists in solution as a monomer. Other features of Eco57I, however, such as stimulation of endonucleolytic reaction with the DNA methyltransferase cofactorS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) and methylation of one strand of the recognition duplex, makes it similar to type III enzymes. Both endonucleolytic and methylation activities reside within a single large polypeptide of the enzyme. In addition to the bifunctional restriction endonuclease, the Eco57I R-M system also includes a separate Eco57I methyltransferase, which modifies both DNA strands of the target duplex. The methylation domain has been previously assigned to the carboxyl-half of theEco57I restriction endonuclease, where conserved amino acid sequence motifs typical for m6A DNA methyltransferases involved in AdoMet binding and catalysis of methyl group transfer are located (9Janulaitis A. Vaisvila R. Timinskas A. Klimasauskas S. Butkus V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6051-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The location and identity of the endonuclease active center though remains to be determined and is addressed here. In contrast to DNA methyltransferases, the amino acid sequences of restriction endonucleases share little similarity. This observation therefore reduces the possibility of identifying catalytic sites of restriction enzymes on the basis of sequence alignment. Structural and mutational analysis of type II restriction endonucleases revealed however the PDXn(D/E)XK motif as a catalytic/Mg2+ binding signature motif (8Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 10Anderson J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 24-30Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Aggarwal A.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Two putative catalytic/Mg2+ binding motifs (i.e. 77PDX13EAK and811PDX20DQK, located in the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of Eco57I, respectively) have been described in the amino acid sequence of the enzyme (10Anderson J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 24-30Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The statistical significance of these motifs however is low, and their presence does not allow unambiguous prediction of the active site, as is evidenced by the following observations. (i) Cfr10I contains the PDXn(D/E)XK motif, but it is not part of its catalytic center (12Skirgaila R. Grazulis S. Bozic D. Huber R. Siksnys V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and (ii) EcoRI contains two such motifs, one of which is not involved in catalysis (10Anderson J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 24-30Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand it cannot be excluded that two active centers are necessary for monomeric Eco57I to cleave both DNA strands. The asymmetric nature of the Eco57I target sequence is inconsistent with the use of a symmetric dimer for recognition and DNA cleavage, as in the type II restriction endonucleases. A single molecule containing two endonucleolytic centers could cleave both DNA strands. It has been suggested that a molecule recognizing an asymmetric nucleotide sequence with a single catalytic center must rearrange the catalytic center for sequential cleavage of each DNA strand, or it must form a higher order complex to cleave both strands of DNA (13Waugh D.S. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9596-9600Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This second mechanism is utilized by the restriction endonuclease FokI, the only type IIS enzyme characterized in this respect so far (14Bitinaite J. Wah D. Aggarwal A.K. Schildkraut I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10570-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The identification of the Eco57I catalytic center(s) would increase our understanding of the functional organization of a unique enzyme, which shares properties with type IIS and type III enzymes. We therefore constructed single amino acid substitutions in the putative catalytic motifs of Eco57I to determine the role of the two putative active centers, if any, in DNA cleavage. The properties of the mutants suggest that of the two putative catalytic motifs, only the motif77PDX13EAK is involved in DNA cleavage catalysis. TheEscherichia coli strain ER2267 was used as host for cloning procedures and was used to assess the endonuclease activity of the wtEco57I and mutants in vivo. It was kindly provided by E. Raleigh. The E. coli CJ236 strain of genotypeF′ cat (= pCJ105; M13sCmR)/dut ung1 thi-1 relA1 spoT1 mcrA was used to prepare single-stranded DNA for site-directed mutagenesis. The E. coli BL21 strain (Novagen) was used for the expression of the wild-typeeco57IR and mutant genes. The pUC19-based phagemid pTZ19R (15Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) was used as a vector in site-directed mutagenesis experiments and DNA sequencing. The plasmid pEco57IR3.6 (ApR) was constructed by subcloning eco57IR from pEco57IRM6.3 (9Janulaitis A. Vaisvila R. Timinskas A. Klimasauskas S. Butkus V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6051-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) into the pET-21b expression vector (Novagen) in the orientation coinciding with that of the T7 promoter. It was used for the construction of mutant eco57IR genes and their expression for purposes of protein purification. Plasmid pEco57IM3.3 (CmR) carries the Eco57I methyltransferase gene cloned in the vector pACYC184 (9Janulaitis A. Vaisvila R. Timinskas A. Klimasauskas S. Butkus V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6051-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transformations of E. coli were carried out by the CaCl2 heat shock method (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C. The following concentrations of antibiotics were used when necessary: ampicillin (Ap), 60 μg/ml; kanamycin (Km), 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol (Cm), 30 μg/ml. λvir was used to test the in vivo function of the wild-type Eco57I and mutants. Stocks of this phage were prepared according to Sambrooket al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All enzymes, including a homogeneous preparation of wt Eco57I, kits, and λ DNA were provided by MBI Fermentas and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. [α-33P]dATP and [γ-33P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Synthetic oligonucleotides were synthesized at the facilities of MBI Fermentas. All other chemicals were reagent grade commercial products. The ability of strains harboring wt or mutantEco57I to survive in the presence or absence ofEco57I methylase was tested by transforming E. coli strain ER2267 containing or lacking pEco57IM3.3 with plasmids carrying either wt or mutant eco57IR genes. An aliquot of 0.5 μg of each plasmid DNA (in a total volume of 10 μl) was used to transform a 100-μl aliquot of competent cells. ApR or ApRCmR transformants were selected. The transformation efficiency of competent cells was tested by transforming them with the control plasmid pBR322. Two independent transformation experiments were carried out. Plasmids were prepared by the alkaline lysis procedure (17Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9907) Google Scholar) and purified additionally as described by Marko et al. (18Marko M.A. Chipperfield R. Birnboim H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 121: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmid construction and isolation of DNA fragments from agarose gels were performed according to standard techniques (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was carried out by the chain termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar). To generate the single-stranded DNA needed for mutagenesis, a 180-bpEco88I-Bst1107I and 680-bpPstI-Eco105I DNA fragments of theeco57IR gene (GenBankTM/EBI accession no.X61122) containing N-terminal (SM I) and C-terminal (SM II) putative catalytic motifs, respectively were subcloned into the pTZ19R phagemid, which was then multiplied in the CJ236 strain. Site-directed mutants were obtained by oligonucleotide mutagenesis using the method of Kunkelet al. (20Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Eco57I mutant proteins that differ from the wild type by only a single amino acid were made using the corresponding oligonucleotides: D78N, TAAAAAGCCAAACTACACG; D78A, TAAAAAGCCAGCCTACACGT; D78K, TAAAAAGCCAAAGTACACGTTT; E92Q, TTTTTCCTTCAAGCCAAA; D812A, TATTAAGCCGGCGCCAACTGGC; D833N, CTGCGATGTTAACCAGAAGCT; D833A, CTGCGATGTTGCGCAGAAGCT. After introducing changes verified by DNA sequencing, the fragments of the eco57IR containing desired point mutations were exchanged with the corresponding fragments of the wild-type gene in the pEco57IR3.6. The integrity of subcloning sites was checked by restriction analysis. Gel electrophoresis of proteins under denaturing conditions was performed as previously described (21Ausubel F.M. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Short Protocols In Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Green Publishing Associates and John Wiley & Sons, NY1992: 10-7-10-28Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 7.5% separating gel. Protein bands were visualized after Coomassie Blue R250 staining. E. coli BL21, freshly transformed by the plasmid containing one of the mutant eco57IR genes, was used as the source of the mutant enzyme. Expression was induced by adjusting the culture to 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at anA600 of about 0.6. After 3 h, the cells were chilled on ice, harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. All further steps were carried out at +4 °C. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was used throughout all purification steps to identify chromatographic fractions containing mutant Eco57I proteins. The purification procedure described below was used for isolation of all mutant proteins used in experiments. Twenty five grams of frozen cells were thawed and suspended in 80 ml of buffer A (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.1 m NaCl. Cells were disrupted by sonication and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to a Heparin-Sepharose column (1.5 × 30 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. The column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient of 0.1–1.0m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing the mutantEco57I protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, eluted at ∼0.28–0.44 m NaCl. They were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.05 m NaCl and applied to a Sepharose Q column (1.5 × 20 cm). The column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with a 340-ml linear gradient of 0.05–0.3 m NaCl in buffer A. The peak fractions, which eluted at ∼0.12–0.17 m NaCl were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl and applied to an AH-Sepharose column (1.5 × 9 cm). After the column was washed with the same buffer, sample was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0.1–1.0 m NaCl in buffer A. The peak fractions (eluted at 0.31–0.38 m NaCl) were pooled, dialyzed against the storage buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 7 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol) and stored at −20 °C. Essentially the same procedure was used for purification of wtEco57I, which was kindly provided by MBI Fermentas. The proteins were homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 120,390 m−1 cm−1 for a monomer calculated from the amino acid composition (22Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar). The concentrations ofEco57I are given in terms of the monomeric protein. The endonuclease activity in vitro was tested by incubation of serial dilutions of purified proteins or cell-free extracts prepared as previously described (23Whitehead P.R. Brown N.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with 1 μg of λ DNA at 37 °C for 1 h in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.01 mm AdoMet, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (standard reaction mixture), followed by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels. The same reaction buffer was used for determination of specific activity of purified proteins. 1 unit of the endonuclease was defined as the amount required to hydrolyze 1 μg of λ DNA in 1 h at 37 °C until no change in the cleavage pattern was observed. In some experiments the standard reaction mixture was modified to include MnCl2 instead of MgCl2 and Sinefungin instead of AdoMet. In vivo activity of wt and mutant restriction endonucleases was tested by comparison of plating efficiency of the λvir bacteriophage on the strain ER2267 expressing wtEco57I or mutants, in the presence of Eco57I methyltransferase on the compatible plasmid pEco57IM3.3, to that on ER2267 cells expressing only Eco57I methylase (nonrestricting host). Portions of serially diluted phage stock were spotted on a lawn of bacteria, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C. The phage titer was determined (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The efficiency of plating (e.o.p.) was defined as the phage titer on the host under investigation divided by the phage titer on a nonrestricting host. The modification activity in vitro was tested by the DNA protection assay where 1 μg of λ DNA served as substrate in 50 μl of reaction mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm AdoMet). The reaction was initiated by the addition of varying amounts of sample solution and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by heating at 65 °C for 20 min. MgCl2 solution (final concentration of 10 mm), and an excess of Eco57I was then added to the reaction mixture. The incubation was continued for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. 1 unit of the modification activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme that in 1 h at 37 °C rendered 1 μg of λ DNA resistant to cleavage by Eco57I. A 210-bp EcoRI-HindIII DNA fragment excised from pEco57IRM6.3 containing a single Eco57I site in the middle of the sequence was used as the specific DNA fragment. It was cloned into the phagemid pTZ19R, and a single-nucleotide substitution was introduced using a mispaired oligonucleotide by the method of Kunkelet al. (20Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar), generating a PstI site instead of the Eco57I site. The resultant nonspecific 210-bp DNA fragment was excised from the phagemid with EcoRI andHindIII restriction endonucleases. Both specific and nonspecific fragments were gel purified and radiolabeled using Klenow polymerase to fill in their 5′ extensions with [α-33P]dATP and the other three dNTPs (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. Binding reactions (20 μl) contained the 33P-endlabeled- specific or -nonspecific DNA fragment (final concentration 10 pm) and the wtEco57I or mutant protein (final concentration in the range of 0–10 nm). The incubation was performed in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol) for 20 min at room temperature, and then the samples were applied to a 6% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bis). Electrophoresis was carried out at 11 V/cm at room temperature in 40 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0 for 2 h. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried, and radioactive bands were visualized using the OptiQuantTMImage Analysis Software (Pacard). Analysis of the Eco57I amino acid sequence revealed two putative catalytic/Mg2+ binding sites: sequence motifs77PDX13EAK (SM I) and811PDX20DQK (SM II) (10Anderson J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 24-30Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To assess their relevance, if any, to cleavage activity of the enzyme, we constructed a range of single amino acid substitution mutants of the acidic residues of the motifs; the residues most conserved in catalytic/Mg2+ binding centers of restriction endonucleases (8Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 11Aggarwal A.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The following mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis: D78N, D78A, D78K, E92Q for SM I and D812A, D833N, D833A for SM II. The mutants were analyzed for their cleavage, methylation, and DNA binding activities. Plasmids carrying either wild-type or mutantEco57I genes were used to transform E. coliER2267 strains with or without the Eco57I methylase gene (intrans). As expected the plasmid encoding the wtEco57I did not transform E. coli unless it harbored the protecting Eco57I methylase (see TableI). Plasmids encoding the SM II mutants D812A, D833A, and D833N expressed sufficient Eco57I endonuclease activity to be lethal in the absence of protecting methylase, but transformation was effective in cells that expressed theEco57I methylase. Cells expressing the SM I mutants D78N, D78A, D78K, and E92Q did survive without cognate methylase protection however, suggesting that the mutants had no or very low endonucleolytic activity.Table IEnzymatic activities of wild-type Eco57I and mutants in vivo and in vitroEnzymeSurvival in Eco57I methylase-deficient cells1-aTwo independent transformation experiments were carried out. −, no transformants; +, effective transformation.Efficiency of plating of λvir1-bAll determinations were carried out at least in triplicate.

Open table in a new tab Wild-type Eco57I and mutants were also characterized for their ability to protect E. coli cells against λvir phage infection. Phage titers were determined onE. coli ER2267 strains expressing wild-type or mutanteco57IR genes in the presence of the Eco57I methyltransferase and were compared with λvir phage titers on cells expressing only Eco57I methylase. The e.o.p. of λvir on the cells expressing mutants D78N, D78A, D78K, and E92Q of SM I was practically the same as that on the nonrestricting host indicating that the mutants failed to restrict the incoming phage (see Table I). The ability of the D812A mutant to restrict the λvir phage was the same as that of the wild-type Eco57I. The e.o.p. of λvir phage on the ER2267 strain expressing the D833N and D833A mutants was about three orders and two orders of magnitude higher than on the cells with the wild-type enzyme, respectively, indicating that the restriction activity of these mutants was reduced as compared with the wild-typeEco57I. To assess the activities of the mutants in vitro, crude cell lysates were used to cleave the λ DNA substrate. D812A, D833N, and D833A mutants of SM II cleaved DNA specifically, like wild-typeEco57I (see Table I). No cleavage activity was detected in crude cell lysates obtained from cells expressing the D78N, D78A, D78K, and E92Q mutants of SM I. For further studies of mutant protein enzymatic properties, the D78N, E92Q, D812A, D833A, and D833N mutants were purified to apparent homogeneity, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mutants of the conserved motif SM II-D812A, D833A, and D833N retained specific activities ranging from approximately the same as wt Eco57I (D812A) to ∼40% (D833N) of wt Eco57I specific activity (see Table I). The D78N and E92Q mutant proteins did not show any DNA cleavage activity under standard reaction conditions, even at the highest protein concentrations tested (52 μg/ml), whereas partial DNA digestion was observed with wt Eco57I at 0.013 μg/ml (data not shown). Hence, the D78N and E92Q substitutions reduced Eco57I endonuclease activity at least 4000-fold. The activity of E92Q (but not that of D78N) was detected only after Mg2+ in the reaction mixture was replaced with Mn2+ (Fig.1). The activity of the E92Q mutant in the presence of Mn2+ was lower than the activity of wtEco57I, as assessed under the same reaction conditions. Both activities were lower than the cleavage activity of the wtEco57I tested in the presence of Mg2+. Even at the highest wt Eco57I concentration (26 μg/ml) used in our experiments in the presence of Mn2+, only partial DNA digestion was observed (see Fig. 1), whereas 7.2 μg/ml was sufficient in the presence of Mg2+ to yield complete DNA cleavage (data not shown). In vitro cleavage activity correlated well enough with the restriction activities observed in vivo to suggest that amino acids Asp-78 and Glu-92 are essential for the endonucleolytic activity of the Eco57I restriction endonuclease, whereas Asp-812 and Asp-833 of SM II are not. To test whether this effect was caused by the loss of ability to cleave DNA by the D78N and E92Q mutants or a deficiency in specific DNA binding, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used for characterization of the mutants as compared with wild-type Eco57I. The effects of mutations on binding of the mutantEco57I proteins to DNA were examined using the gel mobility shift assay. Two DNA fragments were used: a 210-bp DNA fragment containing one Eco57I site in the middle of the sequence (specific DNA) and a nonspecific DNA fragment, which had the same sequence, except it lacked the Eco57I site as a result of a 1-bp substitution. The experiments were performed with purified wild-type Eco57I, D78N, and E92Q mutant proteins. In initial experiments, the DNA binding for the wild-type Eco57I restriction endonuclease was characterized. Increasing amounts of theEco57I endonuclease were added to a fixed amount of33P-endlabeled specific or -nonspecific DNA fragment, and the free DNA was separated by electrophoresis from the DNA complexed with the protein. Several attempts to visualize specificEco57I-DNA complexes in the absence of divalent metal ions were unsuccessful. As previously described for EcoRV (24Vipond I.B. Halford S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2084044289,"We have examined a replication terminus (ψL1) located on the left arm of the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis and within the yxcC gene and at or near the left replication checkpoint that is activated under stringent conditions. The ψL1 sequence appears to bind to two dimers of the replication terminator protein (RTP) rather weakly and seems to possess overlapping core and auxiliary sites that have some sequence similarities with normal Ter sites.

The key points of mechanistic interest that emerge from the present work are: (i) strong binding of a Ter (ψL1) sequence to RTP did not appear to be essential for fork arrest and (ii) polarity of fork arrest could not be correlated in this case with just symmetrical protein-DNA interaction at the core and auxiliary sites of ψL1. On the basis of the result it would appear that the weak RTP-L1Ter interaction cannot by itself account for fork arrest, thus suggesting a role for DnaB-RTP interaction.

The alarmone shuts down the synthesis of several RNAs including rRNA. It is an adaptive response to metabolic stress and it promotes energy conservation by turning off some of the synthetic processes (1Cashel M. Rudd K.E. Neidhart F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schachter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. 2. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1997: 1410-1438Google Scholar). In E. coli, ppGpp synthesis is mediated by two genes called relA and spoT that encode ppGpp synthetase I and a gene product that catalyzes both the synthesis and degradation of ppGpp, respectively (2Gentry D.R. Cashel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1373-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, a relA homolog has been found but no homolog for spoT has been discovered so far (see Ref. 1Cashel M. Rudd K.E. Neidhart F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schachter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. 2. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1997: 1410-1438Google Scholar). Apparently, inhibition of protein synthesis by amino acid analogs, such as arginine hydroxamate causes intracellular accumulation of uncharged tRNA, that in turn activates the relA gene. Synthesis of ppGpp is thus induced and the alarmone binds to the β subunit of RNA polymerase, causing turning off of transcription from certain promoters (3Chatterji D. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Genes to Cells. 1998; 3: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The effect of stringent response on DNA replication has been investigated in bacteria and in bacteriophage λ. In B. subtilis, induction of stringent response by addition of arginine hydroxamate causes replication forks initiated from oriC to be arrested at check points, that we have labeled as ψL and ψR (Fig. 1), that are located ∼200 kilobases on either sides oforiC (4Serore S.J. Levine S. Vanniere V. Hencke G. Nature. 1986; 321: 709-710Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 5Levine A. Vanniere F. Dehbi M. Henckes G. Serore S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Apparently, arrest at both of the checkpoints requires the replication terminator protein (RTP), suggesting the existence of Ter-like sites about the checkpoints. Upon return to relaxed conditions, the forks are released from the checkpoints and continue the duplication of the chromosome until arrested and terminated at the terminus region called TerC (Fig. 1, top; see Ref. 16Levine A. Autret S. Seror S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In bacteriophage λ, stringent response causes the turning off of the ori-O-P transcript, thereby shutting down the synthesis of O and P proteins and possibly also abrogating the transcriptional activation of the λ ori. λ Replication is thereby turned off at the initiation step (6Szalewska-Palasz A. Wegrzyn A. Herman A. Wegrzyn G. EMBO, J. 1994; 13: 5779-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Initiation from oriC of E. coli appears to be terminated at the origin under stringent conditions (5Levine A. Vanniere F. Dehbi M. Henckes G. Serore S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interaction of ppGpp with RNA polymerase is believed to promote fork passage by dislodging the RNA polymerase stalled at damaged sites on DNA and thus, in this context, stringent conditions promote rather than block fork progression (7McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A recent article reported the existence of a short sequence of 17 bp that was located at or near the left checkpoint and had some homology with the core sequence of the Ter sites of B. subtilis. The sequence bound to a single dimer of RTP and was reported to have arrested replication in a polar fashion under stringent but not under relaxed conditions (8Autret S. Levine A. Vanniere F. Serore S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1665-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This result was surprising because two interacting dimers of RTP, bound to the core and auxiliary site are known to be essential for replication termination (9Carrigan C.M. Peck R.A. Smith M.T.

Cell. 1995; 80: 651-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) by differential interaction with the core and auxiliary sites of Ter (13Bussiere D.E. Bastia D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1611-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In view of these apparently puzzling differences between the behavior of a normal Ter and the one present at or near the left checkpoint of B. subtilis, we decided to reinvestigate the characteristics of the site in vivo and in vitro. We identified a 28-bp long terminator site that we call ψL1 that bound to two dimers of RTP and arrested replication in a bipolar modein vivo, when present in a plasmid context. The 17-bp sequence reported by Autret et al. (8Autret S. Levine A. Vanniere F. Serore S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1665-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) is included in the 28-bp sequence. The isolated 17-bp core site of ψL1 (L1), on the other hand, neither arrested replication in vivo nor DnaB helicase in vitro. The RTP-L1 complex had a half-maximal stability of just a few seconds whereas the Ter1-RTP complex under identical conditions had a half-life of ∼180 min. The observation that a very weak terminator-RTP complex still showed appreciable replication arrest in vivo tends to support the conclusion that strong protein-DNA interaction by itself is not obligatory for replication fork arrest at the Ter sites ofB. subtilis. The E. coli strains JM109 (sup E44, rel A1,recA, endA1,gyrA96,hsdR17D, Δ[lac,proAB],[F′tra D36,lacIq Δ (lacZ)M15,proA+,rk−,mk−B+) was used for making M13 DNA, DH5α [F′sup E44,lacU169 (φ80 lacZ Δ M15), hsdR17,recA1, endA1, gyrA96,thi-1, relA1} was used for cloning purposes. Wild type B. subtilis IS58 (trpC2lys3), isogenic relA− mutant ofBacillus IS 56 were used for RNA mapping and genomic DNA preparation. The RTP overproducer strain SU230 of B. subtilis (20Smith M.T. Wake R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was used for transforming shuttle vector clones and preparation of replication intermediates. Total RNA was prepared from wild type B. subtilis IS 58 RelA and IS 56 rel A− strains which were grown in relaxed and stringent conditions. To 25 ml of cell culture pellet, 1 ml of TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies) was added, mixed, and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min to lyse the cells. Chloroform (200 μl) was added, mixed, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper aqueous layer having RNA was precipitated using equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. The RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in RNase-free water. The RNA samples were resolved on formaldehyde-agarose gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. YxcC gene of B. subtilis was amplified from genomic DNA using the primer set 5′-GATCAGGTTAGCCGCCGATAACACCAAAGTCG-3′ and 5′-AAATGTCTTAATCAAACCTTACTCCGCGCGGG-3′. The PCR product was radiolabeled using the random priming NEBlot kit (New England Biolabs) and used for Northern hybridization. The assays were carried out as described (10Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Bastia D. EMBO, J. 1995; 14: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR products of Ter 1, core, L1 and L1 core-binding sites were amplified from pUC18BS3 (Ter1 RTP-binding site cloned as EcoRI-HindIII fragment), pUC18core (Ter1 core-binding site cloned asEcoRI-HindIII fragment), pBAG 62 (LI RTP-binding site cloned as EcoRI-BamHI fragment in pWS64-1 vector (20Smith M.T. Wake R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and pBAG60 (L1 core RTP-binding site cloned asEcoRI-BamHI fragment in pWS 64-1) plasmids, respectively, using universal M13 forward and reverse primers. These fragments were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. 10 Fmol of labeled DNA was used in each reaction, that were carried out in 20-μl volumes of 40 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 5 μg of calf thymus DNA, and increasing amounts of RTP protein (0, 20, 30, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 300, 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, and 4000 fmol). The reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min and resolved on 8% native polyacrylamide gels. Dissociation rate analysis was performed using 10 fmol of end-labeled Ter1 and L1 PCR products and 100 pmol of respective oligo pairs having eitherTer1- or L1-binding sites. L1 and Ter1 were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with 400 fmol and 40 pmol of wild-type RTP, respectively, in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm potassium glutamate. 10,000-fold excess of unlabeled annealed homologous oligonucleotide was added for increasing time intervals from 0 to 3 h. The reaction was stopped with 4 μl of 6 × DNA loading dye and samples resolved on 8% native polyacrylamide gels. Helicase assays were performed as described (14Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 pmol of complementary oligonucleotides havingTer1, L1, or L1 core-binding sites were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to 1 pmol of M13mp18BS3REV (Ter1 RTP-binding site cloned in nonblocking orientation as EcoRI-HindIII fragment) or M13 mp19BS3 (Ter1 RTP-binding site cloned in blocking orientation as EcoRI-HindIII fragment), M13 mp18 L1 (L1 RTP-binding site cloned in nonblocking orientation asEcoRI-BamHI fragment), M13 mp19 L1 (L1 RTP-binding site cloned in blocking orientation asEcoRI-BamHI fragment) and M13 mp19 L1 core (L1 core RTP-binding site cloned in blocking orientation asEcoRI-BamHI fragment) single-stranded DNA, respectively. These helicase substrates was purified through CL 4B-Sepharose spin column and 10 fmol of the substrate used in each reaction of 20 μl volumes containing 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and increasing amounts of RTP (0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 2.4, 3.2, and 4.0 pmol), after 15 min incubation at room temperature 100 ng of DnaB helicase was added to the reaction mixture and continued incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with SDS-EDTA-bromphenol blue dye and resolved on 8% native polyacrylamide gels. Ter1 and L1 sequences were cloned as EcoRI-BamHI fragments in both orientations in the shuttle vector pWS 64-1 (20Smith M.T. Wake R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and transformed into RTP overproducer B. subtilis strain SU230. These clones were grown in 50 ml of SM minimal medium (0.2% ammonium sulfate, 1.4% potassium phosphate dibasic, 0.6% potassium phosphate monobasic, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.02% magnesium sulfate, 0.02% casein hydrolysate, 0.6% glucose, 0.05% tryptophan) or in rich LB medium having 20 μg/ml erythromycin at 30 °C 240 rpm to 0.5 OD590 and RTP was induced by adding 0.4 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h and 250 μg/ml arginine hydroxamate added for 2 h to induce stringent response. 10 mm sodium azide was added and cells kept on ice, sedimented at 6,000 × g and the cell pellet was processed as follows. Briefly, the cells were suspended in 4 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 25% sucrose, and 200 μg/ml lysozyme and kept on ice for 15 min. 1 ml of 10% SDS was very gently mixed and incubated on ice for 15 min and then 4.2 ml of 5 m NaCl was added and left on ice overnight. The supernatant was collected by centrifuging at 25,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min and plasmid DNA precipitated with 0.8 volume of isopropyl alcohol. The pellet washed in 70% ethanol was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA (TE). The samples were digested with pancreatic RNase (2 mg/ml), phenol extracted, precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol, air dried, and dissolved in TE. The samples were quantitated and used for digestion with PstI or HindIII and subjected to one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel analysis. TheHindIII-digested samples were resolved on a 25-cm 1% agarose gel and used for Southern transfer to nitrocellulose filters. The blots were baked under vacuum at 80 °C for 2 h and prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 6 × SSC, 0.4% fat-free milk. PWS 64-1 shuttle vector DNA was radiolabeled with random priming using the NEBlot kit (New England Biolabs) and used as a probe for hybridizations at 42 °C overnight. The blots were washed in 1–0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and exposed to x-ray film. The HindIII- andPstI-digested samples were used for two-dimensional analysis and was performed according to published methods (15Brewer B.J. Fangman W. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). ThePstI- and HindIII-digested replication intermediate samples were subjected to first dimension electrophoresis on 25-cm long 0.6% agarose gel without ethidium bromide at 30 V for 16 h and stained the gel in 1 mg/ml ethidium bromide. The sample lanes were excised and run in 1.5% agarose, 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide for the second dimension at 150 volts for 8 h. The resolved samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet and probed with labeled vector (pWS 64-1) DNA, washed, and exposed to an x-ray film. Previous work (16Levine A. Autret S. Seror S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) had placed the left replication checkpoint of B. subtilis between the gnt andsacXY markers (Fig. 1,top). We endeavored to search for sequences that had homology with the consensus core sequence of Ter and came up with a sequence marked as ψL1 (Fig. 2,A and B). Our strategy was to look for sequences, initially identified by a computerized search of the genome (for homology with consensus core sequence of Ter sites), that yielded a double gel mobility shifts upon binding to purified RTP. We were guided by a wealth of prior information on RTP-Terinteraction that had established that a single dimer of RTP bound to DNA was not competent to arrest replication forks and that two interacting dimers bound to the appropriate sequence were essential for replication fork arrest (11Manna A.C. Pai K.S. Bussiere D.E. White S.W.A. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3253-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29138-29144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our expectation was that barring surprises, the approach mentioned above might identify a terminus sequence in this region of B. subtilis. By examining sequences in the gnt-sacXY region we found a 28-nucleotide long sequence that yielded the expected double shift when bound to RTP as described below. The sequences of ψL1 (called L1 hereafter) is shown in Fig. 1, bottom panel,panel B. A comparison with the Ter1,Ter1 core, with L1 and the presumptive core sequence of L1 are shown (Fig. 1, bottom, panels A and B). The G residues that were identified by methylation protection analysis ofTer1 are underlined (10Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Bastia D. EMBO, J. 1995; 14: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The G residues of L1 that might correspond to the contact points on Ter1 are also underlined (Fig. 1, bottom, panel B). Ter1 (complete RTP-binding site), core (TerI site with only the core sequence), L1 (complete, 28-bp long RTP-binding site), and L1 core (17-bp long putative L1 core site) were used for gel shift analysis. It should be noted that the DNA sequences were first cloned into a plasmid vector and then the DNA fragments (∼200 bp long) containing the specific sequences and flanking vector sequences were amplified by PCR and end labeled. Increasing concentrations of RTP were added to these DNA fragments and analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gels.Ter1 shows filling of first and the second site represented by the two gel shifts and conversion of all of the free DNA into the second shifted band required 40-fold excess of RTP (Fig.2 A). Core sequence showed only one shift because it bound only one dimer of RTP (Fig. 2 B). L1 DNA also showed a single shift when lower amounts of RTP were used. But at higher levels (160–4000 fmol) of RTP, a second shift indicative of binding of two dimers was visible (Fig. 2 C). There were major differences between the gel shift pattern of Ter1 and L1 sequences in that L1 was not only a very weak binder but showed minimal cooperativity. In fact we could not elicit complete binding and shifting of a majority of the free L1 DNA to the position of the second shift under the experimental condition that included some carrier DNA. The binding of L1 to RTP was quantitated and is shown in Fig.2 E. L1 core DNA showed a single gel shift over the entire range of RTP concentrations, indicating that only a single dimer of RTP bound to the DNA (Fig. 2 D). A comparison of the binding profiles of L1 with L1 core supports the conclusion that the complete L1 sequence bound to two dimers RTP. The binding was rather weak and showed little or no cooperativity in comparison with the Ter1 sequence. We followed up the binding experiments described above with competition experiments with an excess of unlabeled double stranded, homologous oligonucleotides. First, Ter1 and L1 were fully complexed with an excess of RTP and then challenged with a 10,000-fold molar excess of the unlabeled DNA and aliquots were run on nondenaturing gels to resolve and measure the released free DNA from the DNA-RTP complex. Typical autoradiograms of the competition experiments for theTer1 and L1 DNAs are shown in Fig.3, A and B, respectively. The quantitative analysis was performed from data averaged from three sets of gels and are shown in Fig. 3 C. It is clear from the data that whereas the Ter1-RTP complex dissociated to a half-maximal value in over 180 min, the L1-RTP complex dissociated fully in a few seconds after the addition of the competing unlabeled DNA. In the absence of the competing DNA, both complexes were stable past 180 min (Fig. 3, A and B, lane C2). The L1 sequence is located within the yxcC gene that is transcribed in a direction opposite to that of replication fork progression. We wished to determine whether this gene was under the stringent control for two reasons. First, because the L1 site is located within the reading frame of the gene, we were interested in investigating if ppGpp-mediated modulation of transcription might have some effect on replication termination at this site and second, we wished to use the transcriptional status of this gene upon addition of arginine hydroxamate as a reporter that the cells were truly under stringent conditions. Stringent response deficient relA− and isogenic wild type B. subtilis strains were analyzed for the levels of yxcC mRNA in vivo during normal and stringent conditions. The Northern blots showed that the transcript that hybridized to the yxcC DNA probe was present inrelA cells regardless of arginine hydroxamate treatment (compare the lanes RelA − stringentwith the one marked RelA − relaxed, Fig. 4). In contrast, in isogenic wild type cells treatment with arginine hydroxamate caused the transcript to be greatly reduced in comparison with the nontreated sample (compare the lane marked RelA+ relaxed withRelA+ stringent in Fig. 4). Thus, the data support the conclusion that the transcription of theyxcC gene was under stringent control and the arginine hydroxamate treatment as used in our experiments appeared to induce stringent control. The shuttle vector pWS 64-1 was used for cloning L1 andTer1 sequences is a chimera of pGEM3Zf(+) (Promega) and the unidirectionally replicating B. subtilis plasmid pAMβ1 (20Smith M.T. Wake R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The vector had ampicillin and erythromycin resistance markers that were expressed in E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively. The L1 and Ter1 sequences were cloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites in both orientations and transformed into the RTP overproducer strain SU230 of B. subtilis. The replication intermediates from cells grown under stringent and relaxed conditions were purified and analyzed by one- and two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, after digestion with either PstI or HindIII. The plasmid DNA was cut once by PstI but twice byHindIII (Fig. 5). As expected, Ter1 yielded a replication intermediate (a band with slower mobility than the linear DNA band) that were indicative of an arrested fork. The arrested fork was seen in the blocking but not in the nonblocking orientation, even though by design we had loaded 4–5-fold more of the nonblocking orientation DNA in the gels (Fig.6 A, compare the first two lanes; arrow). In contrast, L1 was able to block replication fork in both relaxed and stringent conditions in both orientations, although the level of blockage was less in comparison to that ofTer1 (lanes 3–6 of Fig. 1 A, arrow). Thus, L1 appeared to be bipolar and did not really have a blocking or nonblocking orientation. We wanted to make sure that the bands whose position is marked by anarrow in Fig. 6 A were authentic replication intermediates rather than artifacts (of perhaps incomplete cleavage or due to residual protein-bound DNA), by examining them in Brewer-Fangman two-dimensional gels (15Brewer B.J. Fangman W. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). If the band represented authentic Y-shaped stalled forks, they would form a spot on the replication arc and at the correct expected position in the two-dimensional gels. The blocking orientation of Ter1 (predigested with PstI) but not the nonblocking orientation, had an abundance of stalled intermediates (Fig. 6 B, arrow). No arrested forks were seen in the nonblocking orientation. The arrest of the fork is so strong that a replication arc is not visible at this level of exposure and the monomer spot and the arrested intermediate predominate at this level of exposure of the autoradiogram. Thus the “bubble arc” leading upto the Ter1 and the Y and double Y (Xs) arc generated by the few forks that move past the terminus are not visible in the autoradiogram. We have previously reported the expected pattern of an unidirectional ori in two-dimensional gels when the forks are arrested at a Ter site (14Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The present pattern is consistent with that result. The L1 DNA, in the so-called blocking orientation (forks approaching the core site), after PstI digestion generated a replication arc that was visible leading up to and just beyond the spot corresponding to a stalled replication fork (see arrow in Fig. 6 D). The generated correspond to the pattern expected from a bubble arc (14Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the parts of the arc that would be generated by the few forks that go past the L1 site forming single and double Y-shaped molecules are not visible even in this moderately long exposure. Similar analysis was performed in the so-called nonblocking (forks approaching the auxiliary site) orientation of L1 with the same results (not shown). We cut the DNA samples at both HindIII sites (Fig. 5) to examine if the termination spot still survived the digestion. If the spot were an artifact produced by partial digestion of circular plasmid DNA by a single cutter, it would not fall on the replication arc and would not be visible after cutting of the DNA at two sites.HindIII digested DNA. L1(blocking orientation) from cells kept under both relaxed and stringent conditions yielded the termination spot (Fig. 6 C, arrow). It should be kept in mind that L1 has no nonblocking orientation. The “blocking” and “nonblocking” simply mean whether the core or the auxiliary site first encounters the approaching forks. Once again it should be noted that the monmer spot and the stalled intermediate predominated and the bubble arc was not visible at this level of exposure. The arc can be seen in very long exposure of the autoradiogram that obliterates the termination spot due to overexposure (not shown). It should be noted that the pattern of replication intermediates shown here agrees with those reported previously for that generated from an unidirectional replicon bearing a Ter site, when the replication intermediates are cut within the bubble near the Ter site (10Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Bastia D. EMBO, J. 1995; 14: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We have also examined the replication intermediates from the same plasmid containing the L1 core sequence by one-dimensional gels and found no evidence of replication arrest, consistent with earlier published results (Ref. 8Autret S. Levine A. Vanniere F. Serore S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1665-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and data not shown). The rationale was to authenticate the bipolar arrest of L1 forks seenin vivo by an in vitro approach. We expected that L1 should arrest DnaB helicase in both orientations whereas,Ter1, used as a control should show polar arrest of helicase under identical conditions. The results confirmed these expectations. The autoradiograms of typical helicase assays showed that while theTer1 partial duplex substrate arrested DnaB in an orientation-dependent fashion, L1 arrested the helicase in an orientation-independent fashion (Fig.7, A and B). The quantitative analysis of the data from three separate assays showed that both the core site of L1 and the nonblocking orientation ofTer1, as expected, elicited very low levels of helicase arrest at high RTP concentrations. Both orientations of L1 were more efficient in helicase arrest than both the preceding controls but clearly less efficient than the blocking orientation of Ter1 (Fig. 7 C). Thus the in vitro helicase arrest data appear to be consistent with the in vivo replication arrest data. The work reported here makes a mechanistically significant point,i.e. despite very weak binding of RTP to a variantTer site (L1) and despite the fact that the L1-RTP complex was unstable and dissociated almost completely in a few seconds after being challenged with an excess of competitor DNA, the complex was still able to arrest replication forks in vivo and DnaB helicase in vitro. The bacterial chromosome probably does not exist as naked DNA but is coated with proteins (18Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 721-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), some of which are strong DNA binders (e.g. lac repressor), but the replication forks apparently are able to navigate through the bound proteins without detectable arrest until reaching the TerC region where they are terminated. This consideration would suggest that any protein bound to DNA, much less a weak DNA-protein complex such as the L1-RTP complex, by itself, would not be expected to be able to arrest replication forks unless the complex had some special attributes such as an ability to interact with the helicase and abrogate its activity. The observation reported here, along with published evidence (11Manna A.C. Pai K.S. Bussiere D.E. White S.W.A. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3253-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), taken together, would suggest that in addition to RTP-Ter (L1) interaction, protein-protein interaction between RTP and the helicase is probably involved in fork arrest. It is surprising that L1 was able to arrest forks from both directions unlike the unipolar arrest that characterizes most Ter sites with the exception of a bipolar Ter in a plasmid of B. subtilis (19Meijer W.J.J. Smith M.T. Wake R.G. de Boer A.L. Venema G. Bron S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1295-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the plasmid-based bipolar Ter, unlike the L1 site, has a symmetrical sequence and it makes symmetrical base to amino acid contacts with RTP. 2B. K. Mohanty, D. E. Bussiére, T. Sahoo, K. S. Pai, W. J. J. Meijer, S. Brow, and D. Bastia. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. in press. At this time, we do not have a reasonable molecular explanation for the observed bipolar nature of L1 with respect to replication fork arrest. One would speculate that the L1-RTP complex creates a conformation that promotes helicase-RTP contacts with the helicase coming from either direction and results in abrogation of DNA unwinding. It might be worthwhile to discuss as to what might have caused another laboratory to conclude that the L1 sequence bound a single dimer of RTP. Perhaps the explanation for the difference is that only the 17-bp core sequence of L1 was used by them for RTP binding experiments and the binding behavior of the complete core and auxiliary sequence was not examined (8Autret S. Levine A. Vanniere F. Serore S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1665-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is, however, more difficult to explain as to why stringent response-dependent conditional arrest of replication was observed by the other group in a genomic DNA fragment that included L1 (8Autret S. Levine A. Vanniere F. Serore S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1665-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We saw no evidence that replication arrest at L1 was modulated by stringent response. Is L1 involved at all in stringent control dependent fork arrest? It is possible that it might be one component of the conditional fork arresting system and that other RTP-binding sites, that cooperate with L1 to create an efficient conditional barrier to fork movement, may exist downstream of this site in the chromosome. It should be kept in mind that L1 by itself was not as strong an arrester of replication forks as the Ter1 terminus. In the future, genomic knock out of the L1 site, more precise mapping of the site of arrest of the forks in cells under stringent conditions, and more novel approaches to actually isolate the stalled fork from the bacterial chromosome are likely to be needed to solve the interesting mechanism."
