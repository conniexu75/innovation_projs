https://openalex.org/W2082334266,"Hydrogenases are the most active molecular catalysts for hydrogen production and uptake, and could therefore facilitate the development of new types of fuel cell. In [FeFe]-hydrogenases, catalysis takes place at a unique di-iron centre (the [2Fe] subsite), which contains a bridging dithiolate ligand, three CO ligands and two CN(-) ligands. Through a complex multienzymatic biosynthetic process, this [2Fe] subsite is first assembled on a maturation enzyme, HydF, and then delivered to the apo-hydrogenase for activation. Synthetic chemistry has been used to prepare remarkably similar mimics of that subsite, but it has failed to reproduce the natural enzymatic activities thus far. Here we show that three synthetic mimics (containing different bridging dithiolate ligands) can be loaded onto bacterial Thermotoga maritima HydF and then transferred to apo-HydA1, one of the hydrogenases of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae. Full activation of HydA1 was achieved only when using the HydF hybrid protein containing the mimic with an azadithiolate bridge, confirming the presence of this ligand in the active site of native [FeFe]-hydrogenases. This is an example of controlled metalloenzyme activation using the combination of a specific protein scaffold and active-site synthetic analogues. This simple methodology provides both new mechanistic and structural insight into hydrogenase maturation and a unique tool for producing recombinant wild-type and variant [FeFe]-hydrogenases, with no requirement for the complete maturation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2054926064,"Attention is a critical component of perception. However, the mechanisms by which attention modulates neuronal communication to guide behaviour are poorly understood. To elucidate the synaptic mechanisms of attention, we developed a sensitive assay of attentional modulation of neuronal communication. In alert monkeys performing a visual spatial attention task, we probed thalamocortical communication by electrically stimulating neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus while simultaneously recording shock-evoked responses from monosynaptically connected neurons in primary visual cortex. We found that attention enhances neuronal communication by increasing the efficacy of presynaptic input in driving postsynaptic responses, by increasing synchronous responses among ensembles of postsynaptic neurons receiving independent input, and by decreasing redundant signals between postsynaptic neurons receiving common input. The results demonstrate that attention finely tunes neuronal communication at the synaptic level by selectively altering synaptic weights, enabling enhanced detection of salient events in the noisy sensory environment."

Cellular protective mechanisms against oxidative stress include transcriptional control of cytoprotective enzymes by the transcription factor, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). This study investigated the relationship between Nrf2 and osteoclastogenesis. Stimulation of osteoclast precursors (mouse primary peritoneal macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells) with RANKL resulted in the up-regulation of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), a negative regulator of Nrf2. It also decreased the Nrf2/Keap1 ratio, and it down-regulated cytoprotective enzymes (heme oxygenase-1, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). Nrf2 overexpression up-regulated the expression of cytoprotective enzymes, decreased ROS levels, decreased the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells, reduced marker genes for osteoclast differentiation, and attenuated bone destruction in both in vitro and in vivo models. Overexpression of Keap1 or RNAi knockdown of Nrf2 exerted the opposite actions. In addition, in vivo local Nrf2 overexpression attenuated lipopolysaccharide-mediated RANKL-dependent cranial bone destruction in vivo. This is the first study to show that the Keap1/Nrf2 axis regulates RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenesis through modulation of intracellular ROS signaling via expression of cytoprotective enzymes. This raises the exciting possibility that the Keap1-Nrf2 axis may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of bone destructive disease."
https://openalex.org/W2099660845,"The honey bee, Apis mellifera, is frequently used as a sentinel to monitor environmental pollution. In parallel, general weakening and unprecedented colony losses have been reported in Europe and the USA, and many factors are suspected to play a central role in these problems, including infection by pathogens, nutritional stress and pesticide poisoning. Honey bee, honey and pollen samples collected from eighteen apiaries of western France from four different landscape contexts during four different periods in 2008 and in 2009 were analyzed to evaluate the presence of pesticides and veterinary drug residues.A multi-residue analysis of 80 compounds was performed using a modified QuEChERS method, followed by GC-ToF and LC-MS/MS. The analysis revealed that 95.7%, 72.3% and 58.6% of the honey, honey bee and pollen samples, respectively, were contaminated by at least one compound. The frequency of detection was higher in the honey samples (n = 28) than in the pollen (n = 23) or honey bee (n = 20) samples, but the highest concentrations were found in pollen. Although most compounds were rarely found, some of the contaminants reached high concentrations that might lead to adverse effects on bee health. The three most frequent residues were the widely used fungicide carbendazim and two acaricides, amitraz and coumaphos, that are used by beekeepers to control Varroa destructor. Apiaries in rural-cultivated landscapes were more contaminated than those in other landscape contexts, but the differences were not significant. The contamination of the different matrices was shown to be higher in early spring than in all other periods.Honey bees, honeys and pollens are appropriate sentinels for monitoring pesticide and veterinary drug environmental pollution. This study revealed the widespread occurrence of multiple residues in beehive matrices and suggests a potential issue with the effects of these residues alone or in combination on honey bee health."
https://openalex.org/W2022361776,"Most stars and their planets form in open clusters. Over 95 per cent of such clusters have stellar densities too low (less than a hundred stars per cubic parsec) to withstand internal and external dynamical stresses and fall apart within a few hundred million years. Older open clusters have survived by virtue of being richer and denser in stars (1,000 to 10,000 per cubic parsec) when they formed. Such clusters represent a stellar environment very different from the birthplace of the Sun and other planet-hosting field stars. So far more than 800 planets have been found around Sun-like stars in the field. The field planets are usually the size of Neptune or smaller. In contrast, only four planets have been found orbiting stars in open clusters, all with masses similar to or greater than that of Jupiter. Here we report observations of the transits of two Sun-like stars by planets smaller than Neptune in the billion-year-old open cluster NGC6811. This demonstrates that small planets can form and survive in a dense cluster environment, and implies that the frequency and properties of planets in open clusters are consistent with those of planets around field stars in the Galaxy."

https://openalex.org/W1975949520,"Aim Accumulating evidence suggests that extracellular galectin-1 and galectin-3 promote angiogenesis. Increased expression of galectin-1 and/or galectin-3 has been reported to be associated with tumour progression. Thus, it is critical to identify their influence on angiogenesis. Methods We examined the individual and combined effects of galectin-1 and galectin-3 on endothelial cell (EC) growth and tube formation using two EC lines, EA.hy926 and HUVEC. The activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) was determined by ELISA and Western blots. We evaluated the VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 levels in endosomes by proximity ligation assay. Results We observed different responses to exogenous galectins depending on the EC line. An enhanced effect on EA.hy926 cell growth and tube formation was observed when both galectins were added together. Focusing on this enhanced effect, we observed that together galectins induced the phosphorylation of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, whereas galectin-1 and −3 alone induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation only. In the same way, the addition of a blocking VEGFR1 antibody completely abolished the increase in tube formation induced by the combined addition of both galectins. In contrast, the addition of a blocking VEGFR2 antibody only partially inhibited this effect. Finally, the addition of both galectins induced a decrease in the VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 endocytic pools, with a significantly enhanced effect on the VEGFR1 endocytic pool. These results suggest that the combined action of galectin-1 and galectin-3 has an enhanced effect on angiogenesis via VEGFR1 activation, which could be related to a decrease in receptor endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2092818205,"The activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID; also known as AICDA) enzyme is required for somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination at the immunoglobulin locus. In germinal-centre B cells, AID is highly expressed, and has an inherent mutator activity that helps generate antibody diversity. However, AID may also regulate gene expression epigenetically by directly deaminating 5-methylcytosine in concert with base-excision repair to exchange cytosine. This pathway promotes gene demethylation, thereby removing epigenetic memory. For example, AID promotes active demethylation of the genome in primordial germ cells. However, different studies have suggested either a requirement or a lack of function for AID in promoting pluripotency in somatic nuclei after fusion with embryonic stem cells. Here we tested directly whether AID regulates epigenetic memory by comparing the relative ability of cells lacking AID to reprogram from a differentiated murine cell type to an induced pluripotent stem cell. We show that Aid-null cells are transiently hyper-responsive to the reprogramming process. Although they initiate expression of pluripotency genes, they fail to stabilize in the pluripotent state. The genome of Aid-null cells remains hypermethylated in reprogramming cells, and hypermethylated genes associated with pluripotency fail to be stably upregulated, including many MYC target genes. Recent studies identified a late step of reprogramming associated with methylation status, and implicated a secondary set of pluripotency network components. AID regulates this late step, removing epigenetic memory to stabilize the pluripotent state."
https://openalex.org/W2002213743,"Renal proximal tubular epithelial cells play a central role in renal physiology and are among the cell types most sensitive to ischemia and xenobiotic nephrotoxicity. In order to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of kidney injuries, a stable and well-characterized primary culture model of proximal tubular cells is required. An existing model of proximal tubular cells is hampered by the cellular heterogeneity of kidney; a method based on cell sorting for specific markers must therefore be developed. In this study, we present a primary culture model based on the mechanical and enzymatic dissociation of healthy tissue obtained from nephrectomy specimens. Renal epithelial cells were sorted using co-labeling for CD10 and CD13, two renal proximal tubular epithelial markers, by flow cytometry. Their purity, phenotypic stability and functional properties were evaluated over several passages. Our results demonstrate that CD10/CD13 double-positive cells constitute a pure, functional and stable proximal tubular epithelial cell population that displays proximal tubule markers and epithelial characteristics over the long term, whereas cells positive for either CD10 or CD13 alone appear to be heterogeneous. In conclusion, this study describes a method for establishing a robust renal proximal tubular epithelial cell model suitable for further experimentation."
https://openalex.org/W2028457028,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal inherited genetic disorder affection Caucasians. Even with medical advances, CF is life-shortening with patients typically surviving only to age 38. Infection of the CF lung by Burkholderia cenocepacia presents exceptional challenges to medical management of these patients as clinically this microbe is resistant to virtually all antibiotics, is highly transmissible and infection of CF patients with this microbe renders them ineligible for lung transplant, often the last lifesaving option. Here we have targeted two abundant components of the B. cenocepacia biofilm for immune intervention: extracellular DNA and DNABII proteins, the latter of which are bacterial nucleic acid binding proteins. Treatment of B. cenocepacia biofilms with antiserum directed at one of these DNABII proteins (integration host factor or IHF) resulted in significant disruption of the biofilm. Moreover, when anti-IHF mediated destabilization of a B. cenocepacia biofilm was combined with exposure to traditional antibiotics, B. cenocepacia resident within the biofilm and thereby typically highly resistant to the action of antibiotics, were now rendered susceptible to killing. Pre-incubation of B. cenocepacia with anti-IHF serum prior to exposure to murine CF macrophages, which are normally unable to effectively degrade ingested B. cenocepacia, resulted in a statistically significant increase in killing of phagocytized B. cenocepacia. Collectively, these findings support further development of strategies that target DNABII proteins as a novel approach for treatment of CF patients, particularly those whose lungs are infected with B. cenocepacia."
https://openalex.org/W2138993728,"Actinoporin equinatoxin II (EqtII) is an archetypal example of α-helical pore-forming toxins that porate cellular membranes by the use of α-helices. Previous studies proposed several steps in the pore formation: binding of monomeric protein onto the membrane, followed by oligomerization and insertion of the N-terminal α-helix into the lipid bilayer. We studied these separate steps with an EqtII triple cysteine mutant. The mutant was engineered to monitor the insertion of the N terminus into the lipid bilayer by labeling Cys-18 with a fluorescence probe and at the same time to control the flexibility of the N-terminal region by the disulfide bond formed between cysteines introduced at positions 8 and 69. The insertion of the N terminus into the membrane proceeded shortly after the toxin binding and was followed by oligomerization. The oxidized, non-lytic, form of the mutant was still able to bind to membranes and oligomerize at the same level as the wild-type or the reduced form. However, the kinetics of the N-terminal helix insertion, the release of calcein from erythrocyte ghosts, and hemolysis of erythrocytes was much slower when membrane-bound oxidized mutant was reduced by the addition of the reductant. Results show that the N-terminal region needs to be inserted in the lipid membrane before the oligomerization into the final pore and imply that there is no need for a stable prepore formation. This is different from β-pore-forming toxins that often form β-barrel pores via a stable prepore complex.Background: Actinoporins are pore-forming toxins that damage cellular membranes by α-helices.Results: An engineered mutant of actinoporin equinatoxin II reveals sequential steps during pore formation.Conclusion: Pore formation is composed of a succession of ordered steps: fast membrane binding followed by the N-terminal region association with the membrane and oligomerization.Significance: Equinatoxin II pore formation does not require stable prepore intermediate as is often found in other pore-forming toxins.

https://openalex.org/W2010142306,"Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) has emerged as an important factor in pancreatic beta cell biology, and tight regulation of TXNIP levels is necessary for beta cell survival. However, the mechanisms regulating TXNIP expression have only started to be elucidated. The forkhead boxO1 transcription factor (FOXO1) has been reported to up-regulate TXNIP expression in neurons and endothelial cells but to down-regulate TXNIP in liver, and the effects on beta cells have remained unknown. We now have found that FOXO1 binds to the TXNIP promoter in vivo in human islets and INS-1 beta cells and significantly decreases TXNIP expression. TXNIP promoter deletion analyses revealed that an E-box motif conferring carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP)-mediated, glucose-induced TXNIP expression is necessary and sufficient for this effect, and electromobility shift assays confirmed FOXO1 binding to this site. Moreover, FOXO1 blocked glucose-induced TXNIP expression and reduced glucose-induced ChREBP binding at the TXNIP promoter without affecting ChREBP expression or nuclear localization, suggesting that FOXO1 may compete with ChREBP for binding to the TXNIP promoter. In fact, a FOXO1 DNA-binding mutant (FOXO1-H215R) failed to inhibit TXNIP transcription, and the effects were not restricted to TXNIP as FOXO1 also inhibited transcription of other ChREBP target genes such as liver pyruvate kinase. Together, these results demonstrate that FOXO1 inhibits beta cell TXNIP transcription and suggest that FOXO1 confers this inhibition by interfering with ChREBP DNA binding at target gene promoters. Our findings thereby reveal a novel gene regulatory mechanism and a previously unappreciated cross-talk between FOXO1 and ChREBP, two major metabolic signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1974948633,"Three novel peptides were isolated from the venom of the sea anemone Urticina grebelnyi. All of them are 29 amino acid peptides cross-linked by two disulfide bridges, with a primary structure similar to other sea anemone peptides belonging to structural group 9a. The structure of the gene encoding the shared precursor protein of the identified peptides was determined. One peptide, π-AnmTX Ugr 9a-1 (short name Ugr 9-1), produced a reversible inhibition effect on both the transient and the sustained current of human ASIC3 channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. It completely blocked the transient component (IC50 10 ± 0.6 μM) and partially (48 ± 2%) inhibited the amplitude of the sustained component (IC50 1.44 ± 0.19 μM). Using in vivo tests in mice, Ugr 9-1 significantly reversed inflammatory and acid-induced pain. The other two novel peptides, AnmTX Ugr 9a-2 (Ugr 9-2) and AnmTX Ugr 9a-3 (Ugr 9-3), did not inhibit the ASIC3 current. NMR spectroscopy revealed that Ugr 9-1 has an uncommon spatial structure, stabilized by two S-S bridges, with three classical β-turns and twisted β-hairpin without interstrand disulfide bonds. This is a novel peptide spatial structure that we propose to name boundless β-hairpin."
https://openalex.org/W1964046916,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by symptoms attributable to the death of striatal and cortical neurons. The molecular mechanisms mediating neuronal death in HD involve oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), an irreversible inhibitor of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, in rodents has been proposed as a useful experimental model of HD. This study evaluated the effects of probucol, a lipid-lowering agent with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, on the biochemical parameters related to oxidative stress, as well as on the behavioral parameters related to motor function in an in vivo HD model based on 3-NP intoxication in rats. Animals were treated with 3.5 mg/kg of probucol in drinking water daily for 2 months and, subsequently, received 3-NP (25 mg/kg i.p.) once a day for 6 days. At the end of the treatments, 3-NP-treated animals showed a significant decrease in body weight, which corresponded with impairment on motor ability, inhibition of mitochondrial complex II activity and oxidative stress in the striatum. Probucol, which did not rescue complex II inhibition, protected against behavioral and striatal biochemical changes induced by 3-NP, attenuating 3-NP-induced motor impairments and striatal oxidative stress. Importantly, probucol was able to increase activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), an enzyme important in mediating the detoxification of peroxides in the central nervous system. The major finding of this study was that probucol protected against 3-NP-induced behavioral and striatal biochemical changes without affecting 3-NP-induced mitochondrial complex II inhibition, indicating that long-term probucol treatment resulted in an increased resistance against neurotoxic events (i.e., increased oxidative damage) secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction. These data appeared to be of great relevance when extrapolated to human neurodegenerative processes involving mitochondrial dysfunction and indicates that GPx is an important molecular target involved in the beneficial effects of probucol."
https://openalex.org/W2068660921,"The 2009/2010 pandemic influenza virus (H1N1pdm) contains an avian-lineage PB2 gene that lacks E627K and D701N substitutions important in the pathogenesis and transmission of avian-origin viruses in humans or other mammals. Previous studies have shown that PB2-627K is not necessary because of a compensatory Q591R substitution. The role that PB2-701N plays in the H1N1pdm phenotype is not well understood. Therefore, PB2-D701N was introduced into an H1N1pdm virus (A/New York/1682/2009 (NY1682)) and analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Mini-genome replication assay, in vitro replication characteristics in cell lines, and analysis in the mouse and ferret models demonstrated that PB2-D701N increased virus replication rates and resulted in more severe pathogenicity in mice and more efficient transmission in ferrets. In addition, compared to the NY1682-WT virus, the NY1682-D701N mutant virus induced less IFN-λ and replicated to a higher titer in primary human alveolar epithelial cells. These findings suggest that the acquisition of the PB2-701N substitution by H1N1pdm viruses may result in more severe disease or increase transmission in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2054162246,"We have undertaken an extensive survey of a group of epimerases originally named Gne, that were thought to be responsible for inter-conversion of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc). The analysis builds on recent work clarifying the specificity of some of these epimerases. We find three well defined clades responsible for inter-conversion of the gluco- and galacto-configuration at C4 of different N-acetylhexosamines. Their major biological roles are the formation of UDP-GalNAc, UDP-N-acetylgalactosaminuronic acid (UDP-GalNAcA) and undecaprenyl pyrophosphate-N-acetylgalactosamine (UndPP-GalNAc) from the corresponding glucose forms. We propose that the clade of UDP-GlcNAcA epimerase genes be named gnaB and the clade of UndPP-GlcNAc epimerase genes be named gnu, while the UDP-GlcNAc epimerase genes retain the name gne. The Gne epimerases, as now defined after exclusion of those to be named GnaB or Gnu, are in the same clade as the GalE 4-epimerases for inter-conversion of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) and UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal). This work brings clarity to an area that had become quite confusing. The identification of distinct enzymes for epimerisation of UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GlcNAcA and UndPP-GlcNAc will greatly facilitate allocation of gene function in polysaccharide gene clusters, including those found in bacterial genome sequences. A table of the accession numbers for the 295 proteins used in the analysis is provided to enable the major tree to be regenerated with the inclusion of additional proteins of interest.

Sixty-eight MCI patients underwent cognitive testing, [11C]-PIB PET and [18F]-FDG PET at baseline and follow-up. Regions of interest were defined on co-registered MRI. PIB distribution volume ratio (DVR) was calculated using Logan graphical analysis, and the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) on the same regions was used as quantitative analysis for [18F]-FDG. Thirty (44.1%) of all 68 MCI patients converted to AD over 19.2±7.1 months. The annual rate of MCI conversion was 23.4%. A positive Aβ PET biomarker significantly identified MCI due to AD in individual MCI subjects with a sensitivity (SS) of 96.6% and specificity (SP) of 42.1%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 56.8%. A positive Aβ biomarker in APOE ε4/4 carriers distinguished with a SS of 100%. In individual MCI subjects who had a prominent impairment in episodic memory and aged older than 75 years, an Aβ biomarker identified MCI due to AD with a greater SS of 100%, SP of 66.6% and PPV of 80%, compared to FDG biomarker alone or both PET biomarkers combined. In contrast, when assessed in precuneus, both Aβ and FDG biomarkers had the greatest level of certainty for MCI due to AD with a PPV of 87.8%. The Aβ PET biomarker primarily defines MCI due to AD in individual MCI subjects. Furthermore, combined FDG biomarker in a cortical region of precuneus provides an added diagnostic value in predicting AD over a short period."
https://openalex.org/W2158461614,"This report describes the metabolic and lipidomic profiling of 97 low-molecular weight compounds from the primary metabolism and 124 lipid compounds of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. The metabolic profiles were created for diatoms perturbed for 24 hours with four different treatments: (I) removal of nitrogen, (II) lower iron concentration, (III) addition of sea salt, (IV) addition of carbonate to their growth media. Our results show that as early as 24 hours after nitrogen depletion significant qualitative and quantitative change in lipid composition as well as in the primary metabolism of Thalassiosira pseudonana occurs. So we can observe the accumulation of several storage lipids, namely triacylglycerides, and TCA cycle intermediates, of which citric acid increases more than 10-fold. These changes are positively correlated with expression of TCA enzymes genes. Next to the TCA cycle intermediates and storage lipid changes, we have observed decrease in N-containing lipids and primary metabolites such as amino acids. As a measure of counteracting nitrogen starvation, we have observed elevated expression levels of nitrogen uptake and amino acid biosynthetic genes. This indicates that diatoms can fast and efficiently adapt to changing environment by altering the metabolic fluxes and metabolite abundances. Especially, the accumulation of proline and the decrease of dimethylsulfoniopropionate suggest that the proline is the main osmoprotectant for the diatom in nitrogen rich conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2053506625,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a pivotal role in promoting podocyte dysfunction and albuminuria, however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully delineated. In this study, we found that Ang II induced Wnt1 expression and β-catenin nuclear translocation in cultured mouse podocytes. Blocking Wnt signaling with Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) or β-catenin siRNA attenuated Ang II-induced podocyte injury. Ang II could also induce the phosphorylation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in cultured podocytes. Blockade of this pathway with CK59 or CREB siRNA could significantly inhibit Ang II-induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling and podocyte injury. In in vivo studies, administration of Ang II promoted Wnt/β-catenin signaling, aggregated podocyte damage, and albuminuria in mice. CK59 could remarkably ameliorate Ang II-induced podocyte injury and albuminuria. Furthermore, ectopic expression of exogenous Dkk1 also attenuated Ang II-induced podocytopathy in mice. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the CaMK II/CREB/Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade plays an important role in regulating Ang II-induced podocytopathy.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a pivotal role in promoting podocyte dysfunction and albuminuria, however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully delineated. In this study, we found that Ang II induced Wnt1 expression and β-catenin nuclear translocation in cultured mouse podocytes. Blocking Wnt signaling with Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) or β-catenin siRNA attenuated Ang II-induced podocyte injury. Ang II could also induce the phosphorylation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in cultured podocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1986070124,"Plastids sustain life on this planet by providing food, feed, essential biomolecules and oxygen. Such diverse metabolic and biosynthetic functions require efficient communication between plastids and the nucleus. However, specific factors, especially large molecules, released from plastids that regulate nuclear genes have not yet been fully elucidated. When tobacco and lettuce transplastomic plants expressing GFP within chloroplasts, were challenged with Erwinia carotovora (biotic stress) or paraquat (abiotic stress), GFP was released into the cytoplasm. During this process GFP moves gradually towards the envelope, creating a central red zone of chlorophyll fluorescence. GFP was then gradually released from intact chloroplasts into the cytoplasm with an intact vacuole and no other visible cellular damage. Different stages of GFP release were observed inside the same cell with a few chloroplasts completely releasing GFP with detection of only red chlorophyll fluorescence or with no reduction in GFP fluorescence or transitional steps between these two phases. Time lapse imaging by confocal microscopy clearly identified sequence of these events. Intactness of chloroplasts during this process was evident from chlorophyll fluorescence emanated from thylakoid membranes and in vivo Chla fluorescence measurements (maximum quantum yield of photosystem II) made before or after infection with pathogens to evaluate their photosynthetic competence. Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion serve as signal molecules for generation of reactive oxygen species and Tiron, scavenger of superoxide anion, blocked release of GFP from chloroplasts. Significant increase in ion leakage in the presence of paraquat and light suggests changes in the chloroplast envelope to facilitate protein release. Release of GFP-RC101 (an antimicrobial peptide), which was triggered by Erwinia infection, ceased after conferring protection, further confirming this export phenomenon. These results suggest a novel signaling mechanism, especially for participation of chloroplast proteins (e.g. transcription factors) in retrograde signaling, thereby offering new opportunities to regulate pathways outside chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W2064721219,"Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) is well known as a co-receptor for class 3 semaphorins and vascular endothelial growth factors, involved in axon guidance and angiogenesis. Moreover, NRP2 was shown to promote chemotactic migration of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) toward the chemokine CCL21, a function that relies on the presence of polysialic acid (polySia). In vertebrates, this posttranslational modification is predominantly found on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), where it is synthesized on N-glycans by either of the two polysialyltransferases, ST8SiaII or ST8SiaIV. In contrast to NCAM, little is known on the biosynthesis of polySia on NRP2. Here we identified the polySia attachment sites and demonstrate that NRP2 is recognized only by ST8SiaIV. Although polySia-NRP2 was found on bone marrow-derived DCs from wild-type and St8sia2(-/-) mice, polySia was completely lost in DCs from St8sia4(-/-) mice despite normal NRP2 expression. In COS-7 cells, co-expression of NRP2 with ST8SiaIV but not ST8SiaII resulted in the formation of polySia-NRP2, highlighting distinct acceptor specificities of the two polysialyltransferases. Notably, ST8SiaIV synthesized polySia selectively on a NRP2 glycoform that was characterized by the presence of sialylated core 1 and core 2 O-glycans. Based on a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis study, we localized the polySia attachment sites to an O-glycan cluster located in the linker region between b2 and c domain. Combined alanine exchange of Thr-607, -613, -614, -615, -619, and -624 efficiently blocked polysialylation. Restoration of single sites only partially rescued polysialylation, suggesting that within this cluster, polySia is attached to more than one site."

The CS chain is covalently attached to the bikunin protein core by an O-glycosidic link between the serine residue on the protein core and a xylopyranose residue on the CS chain. HCs are covalently bound to the CS chain via an ester bond between the α-carbon of the C-terminal Asp and carbon-6 of an internal N-acetylgalactosamine on the CS chain (3.Enghild J.J. Salvesen G.

HCs covalently attached to the bikunin CS chain present in IαI and PαI/HC-bikunin can be transferred to HA via a trans-esterification process in which HA substitutes for the CS chain on bikunin to bind to the HCs via an ester bond.

All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Plasma and urine samples were obtained under ethics approval by The University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee and The University of New South Wales Human Ethics Advisory Panel, respectively. Data from healthy volunteers with no known medical conditions are presented. Samples were collected and used fresh or stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Anion exchange chromatography using a diethylaminoethyl column (1-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, GE Healthcare) attached to an FPLC system (ÄKTA purifier, GE Healthcare) was used to purify proteoglycans from plasma and urine. Briefly, the DEAE column was equilibrated at 1 ml/min with running buffer (250 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) before the addition of urine (20 ml) or plasma (1 ml), and base-line absorbance was re-established with running buffer. Molecules of interest were eluted using an eluting buffer (1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and concentrated. Additionally, some samples were reloaded onto the DEAE column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–1.0 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 over 36 column volumes at 0.2 ml/min and collected in 1-ml fractions. Proteoglycan-enriched fractions were subsequently concentrated and analyzed for protein concentration using a Coomassie Blue protein assay (Thermo Scientific, Scoresby, Australia). Alternatively, pooled samples were ethanol-precipitated to enrich for proteins. Ice-cold 100% (v/v) ethanol was added to the urine or plasma samples in a volume ratio of 4:1 and incubated at 4 °C for 5 min before centrifuging at 4000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was discarded and replaced with an equal volume of ice-cold 100% (v/v) ethanol, incubated at 4 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was discarded and replaced with SDS-PAGE running buffer. Samples of proteoglycan-enriched material were digested with 50 milliunits/ml chondroitinase ABC in 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 8 at 37 °C for 16 h to confirm the presence and structure of the CS. Selected samples were further digested with a final concentration of 500 milliunits/ml chondro-4-sulfatase or chondro-6-sulfatase at 37 °C for 16 h. Alternatively, selected samples were treated with 100 mm NaOH for 10 min at 25 °C and then neutralized with 100 mm HCl. Proteoglycan-enriched samples (50 μg/ml based on Coomassie Blue protein assay) with and without endoglycosidase digestion were coated onto high binding 96-well ELISA plates (Greiner, Australia) for 2 h at 25 °C. Wells were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (DPBS) followed by blocking with 0.1% (w/v) casein in DPBS for 1 h at 25 °C. Wells were rinsed twice with DPBS with 1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in 0.1% (w/v) casein in DPBS for 2 h at 25 °C. Wells were rinsed twice with PBST followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:1000) diluted in 0.1% (w/v) casein in DPBS for 1 h at 25 °C, rinsed again twice with PBST, and then incubated with streptavidin-HRP (1:500) for 30 min at 25 °C. Binding of the antibodies to the samples was detected using the colorimetric substrate, 2,2′-azinodi-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid), and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. A sandwich ELISA was performed by coating ELISA plates with a capture antibody, ab43073, in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 for 16 h at 4 °C. Wells were rinsed twice with DPBS followed by blocking with 0.1% (w/v) casein in DPBS for 2 h at 25 °C. Wells were rinsed with PBST followed by incubation with the proteoglycan-enriched samples (200 μg/ml based on Coomassie Blue protein assay) for 2 h at 25 °C and subsequent detected with primary and secondary antibodies as for the standard ELISA. Data for both the ELISA and sandwich ELISA were corrected for background absorbance. Proteoglycan-enriched samples (200 μg/ml based on Coomassie protein assay) with and without endoglycosidase digestion were electrophoresed in 4–12% (w/v) BisTris gels (Invitrogen) under non-reducing conditions using MES buffer (50 mm MES, 50 mm Tris, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3) at 200 V for 45 min. A series of molecular mass markers (Precision Plus All Blue, Bio-Rad) was electrophoresed on each gel. Samples were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane using transfer buffer (5 mm Bicine, 5 mm BisTris, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml SDS, 10% (v/v) methanol, pH 7.2) in a semidry blotter at 300 mA and 20 V for 60 min. The membrane was blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mm Tris base, 136 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 h at 25 °C followed by incubation with primary antibody diluted in 1% (w/v) BSA in TBST for 2 h at 25 °C. Membranes were subsequently rinsed with TBST, incubated with secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies (1:50,000) for 45 min at 25 °C, and rinsed with TBST and TBS before being imaged using chemiluminescence reagent (Femto reagent kit, Pierce) and x-ray film. DEAE-enriched samples (50 μg/ml) were reduced (10 mm DTT for 10 min at 95 °C), alkylated (25 mm iodoacetamide for 20 min at 25 °C), and electrophoresed on 4–12% (w/v) BisTris gels as described above. The gels were stained with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue G-250 in 2% (v/v) phosphoric acid, 10% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 20% (v/v) methanol at 25 °C for 16 h followed by destaining with 50% (v/v) methanol. Gels were imaged prior to excising bands of interest for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS2) analysis. Excised bands were destained with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 50 mm NH4HCO3, washed with 100% (v/v) acetonitrile, and dried in an oven at 50 °C. Trypsin (sequencing grade; Promega, Sydney, Australia) at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml in 50 mm NH4HCO3 was added to the dried bands and incubated at 30 °C for 16 h. Ten microliters of 50 mm NH4HCO3 was then added to each band prior to sonication for 5 min. Twenty microliters of each sample was subjected to peptide analysis by LC-MS2. Alternatively, samples were prepared for LC-MS2 analysis by in-solution digestion, which involved reduction with 10 mm DTT for 10 min at 95 °C and alkylation with 25 mm iodoacetamide for 20 min at 25 °C. Samples were then incubated with 20 μg/ml sequencing grade trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 30 °C for 16 h and subjected to peptide analysis by LC-MS2. Samples were analyzed by LC-MS2 using an LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The results were analyzed with XcaliburTM software (Bioworks version 3.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Mascot database with a National Center for Biotechnology Information protein (Homo sapiens) database.

https://openalex.org/W1991514920,"Cervical cancer is caused by high-risk, cancer-causing human papillomaviruses (HPV) and is the second highest cause of cancer deaths in women globally. The majority of cervical cancers express well-characterized HPV oncogenes, which are potential targets for immunotherapeutic vaccination. Here we develop a rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine designed for immunotherapy against HPV16 positive tumours. An RHDV-VLP, modified to contain the universal helper T cell epitope PADRE and decorated with an MHC I-restricted peptide (aa 48-57) from the HPV16 E6, was tested for its immunotherapeutic efficacy against the TC-1 HPV16 E6 and E7-expressing tumour in mice. The E6-RHDV-VLP-PADRE was administered therapeutically for the treatment of a pre-existing TC-1 tumour and was delivered with antibodies either to deplete regulatory T cells (anti-CD25) or to block T cell suppression mediated through CTLA-4. As a result, the tumour burden was reduced by around 50% and the median survival time of mice to the humane endpoint was almost doubled the compared to controls. The incorporation of PADRE into the RHDV-VLP was necessary for an E6-specific enhancement of the anti-tumour response and the co-administration of the immune modifying antibodies contributed to the overall efficacy of the immunotherapy. The E6-RHDV-VLP-PADRE shows immunotherapeutic efficacy, prolonging survival for HPV tumour-bearing mice. This was enhanced by the systemic administration of immune-modifying antibodies that are commercially available for use in humans. There is potential to further modify these particles for even greater efficacy in the path to development of an immunotherapeutic treatment for HPV precancerous and cancer stages."
https://openalex.org/W2002340855,"Lactosylceramide (LacCer) is a member of the glycosphingolipid family and is known to be a bioactive lipid in various cell physiological processes. However, the direct targets of LacCer and cellular events mediated by LacCer are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of LacCer on the release of arachidonic acid (AA) and the activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α). In CHO-W11A cells, treatment with 1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP), an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, reduced the glycosphingolipid level, and the release of AA induced by A23187 or platelet-activating factor was inhibited. The addition of LacCer reversed the PPMP effect on the stimulus-induced AA release. Exogenous LacCer stimulated the release of AA, which was decreased by treatment with an inhibitor of cPLA2α or silencing of the enzyme. Treatment of CHO-W11A cells with LacCer induced the translocation of full-length cPLA2α and its C2 domain from the cytosol to the Golgi apparatus. LacCer also induced the translocation of the D43N mutant of cPLA2α. Treatment of L929 cells with TNF-α induced LacCer generation and mediated the translocation of cPLA2α and AA release, which was attenuated by treatment with PPMP. In vitro studies were then conducted to test whether LacCer interacts directly with cPLA2α. Phosphatidylcholine vesicles containing LacCer increased cPLA2α activity. LacCer bound to cPLA2α and its C2 domain in a Ca(2+)-independent manner. Thus, we propose that LacCer is a direct activator of cPLA2α."

Some Yersinia spp. also secrete the Rho protein activator cytotoxic necrotizing factor-Y (CNF-Y), but it has been unclear how the bacteria may benefit from Rho protein activation. We show here that CNF-Y increases Yop translocation in Yersinia enterocolitica-infected cells up to 5-fold. CNF-Y strongly activated RhoA and also delayed in time Rac1 and Cdc42, but when individually expressed, constitutively active mutants of Rac1, but not of RhoA, increased Yop translocation.

The genus Yersinia comprises three species that are pathogenic for humans. Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of bubonic plague, and the enteropathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis elicit acute enteritis and enteric lymphadenitis (1.Prentice M.B.

Yersinia outer proteins: role in modulation of host cell signaling responses and pathogenesis.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). After oral ingestion, the enteropathogenic Yersinia spp. reach the distal small intestine, from where a subset invades and crosses the intestinal mucosa mainly via M-cells (3.Trülzsch K.

Once the yersiniae have reached the mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue, they subvert immune cell responses such as phagocytosis and cytokine production and proliferate extracellularly (4.Heesemann J.

Dixon J.E. Functions of the Yersinia effector proteins in inhibiting host immune responses.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cornerstone of this phase of infection is the 70-kb virulence plasmid (pYV), which encodes for the Yersinia type III secretion system, and bacterial effector proteins termed Yops that are translocated through the type III secretion system into infected cells (6.Cornelis G.R.

The Yersinia Yop virulon: a bacterial system for subverting eukaryotic cells.Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Effector translocation is tightly controlled, and Yops are only translocated when there is intimate contact between the bacteria and host cells (8.Pettersson J. Nordfelth R. Dubinina E. Bergman T.

The main function of Rho GTP-binding proteins is regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and through this, they are involved in a wide range of cellular functions including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and establishment of polarity (30.Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Rho GTPases: biochemistry and biology.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar). Most Rho GTP-binding proteins cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state. The cycling is tightly controlled by three sets of regulatory proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for GTP; GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), 3The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; CNF, cytotoxic necrotizing factor; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PAK, p21-activated kinase; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding. which strongly accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity; and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, which extract the GDP-bound form from membranes and keep it in the cytosol (30.Jaffe A.B.

YopE acts as a GAP for Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 in vitro, and in cellular infection systems in which endogenous Rho family proteins were investigated, it showed a preference for Rac (36.Aepfelbacher M.

Functional analysis of the YopE GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1020-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). YopT is a cysteine protease that removes the C-terminal isoprenoid moiety of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro, thereby dislocating these proteins from the plasma membrane and from their guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (38.Schmidt G. Yersinia enterocolitica outer protein T (YopT).Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 90: 955-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is well accepted that by blocking Rho proteins YopE, YopO/YpKA, and YopT can down-regulate chemotactic and phagocytic activities of leukocytes as well as other immune cell functions such as superoxide anion production and IL1β-release (39.Schotte P.

This notion comes from the finding that Yersinia YopE mutants hypertranslocate the other Yops and that there is an inverse correlation between the amount of translocated YopE and general Yop translocation activity (9.Aili M. Isaksson E.L. Carlsson S.E. Wolf-Watz H. Rosqvist R. Francis M.S. Regulation of Yersinia Yop-effector delivery by translocated YopE.Int. J. Med.

These and further studies brought forward the concept that activation of Rho GTP-binding proteins and the ensuing actin reorganization, which occurs upon adhesion of Yersinia to host cells, support Yop delivery (42.Mejía E.

While Yop delivery progresses, the increasing amount of YopE in the host cell cytoplasm is thought to prevent further translocation by down-regulating Rho GTP-binding proteins. Inactivation of Rho (A, B, and C) with bacterial toxins as well as knockdown of Rac1 via siRNA were reported to inhibit Yop translocation (42.Mejía E. Bliska J.B. Viboud G.I.

Although the Yersinia virulence machinery is very effective at down-regulating Rho GTP-binding proteins, some Yersinia strains also secrete a Rho protein activator termed cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF)-Y (45.Aktories K.

Gillespie R.A. Baker B.D. Shakhnovich E. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis produces a cytotoxic necrotizing factor.Infection Immunity. 2002; 70: 2708-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CNF-Y is a close homolog of cytotoxic necrotizing-factors 1–3 from Escherichia coli, and like these, it deamidates Rho GTP-binding proteins at Gln-63 (RhoA) or Gln-61 (for Rac and Cdc42). Deamidation at this position inhibits the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activities of these Rho family proteins and thereby renders them permanently active (47.Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M.

Aktories K. Gln 63 of Rho is deamidated by Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1.Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Although CNF-1 was reported to act equally well on Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 in vitro and in cell cultures, CNF-Y was found to preferentially modify and activate RhoA (49.Hoffmann C. Pop M. Leemhuis J. Schirmer J. Aktories K. Schmidt G. The Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNFY) selectively activates RhoA.J. Biol.

Presently, there have been no reports of how the activity of CNF-Y may fit into the virulence strategy of Yersinia. Here, we report that CNF-Y strongly increases the translocation of Yops into Y. enterocolitica-infected cells. The CNF-Y effect appears to be due to activation of mainly Rac and, to a minor extent, Cdc42, but not RhoA, and to the failure of Yops to down-regulate CNF-Y-activated translocation.

Contribution of the major secreted yops of Yersinia enterocolitica O:8 to pathogenicity in the mouse infection model.Infection Immunity. 2004; 72: 5227-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, mutants were generated by consecutively replacing the coding region of yopT by a chloramphenicol resistance cassette (Cmr) and replacing the coding region of yopO by a spectinomycin resistance cassette (Spr) in the pYVΔE plasmid. Correct replacement of the respective yop genes by the resistance cassettes was verified by PCR and SDS-PAGE of secreted Yop proteins and Western blotting. To rule out any unwanted recombination in the chromosome due to the action of Redα and Redβ, we transferred the mutated plasmids to the previously pYV-cured strain WA-C. For infection, overnight cultures grown at 27 °C were diluted 1:20 into fresh LB broth and grown for another 1.5 h at 37 °C. Shift of the growth temperature to 37 °C triggers activation of the Yersinia type III secretion machinery for efficient translocation of effectors into the host cell upon cellular contact.

https://openalex.org/W2023593657,"The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit, also known as the stem cell factor receptor, plays a key role in several developmental processes. Activating mutations in c-Kit lead to alteration of these cellular processes and have been implicated in many human cancers such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, acute myeloid leukemia, testicular seminomas and mastocytosis. Regulation of the catalytic activity of several kinases is known to be governed by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the kinase domain. However, in the case of c-Kit phosphorylation of Tyr-823 has been demonstrated to be a late event that is not required for kinase activation. However, because phosphorylation of Tyr-823 is a ligand-activated event, we sought to investigate the functional consequences of Tyr-823 phosphorylation. By using a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutant of tyrosine 823, we investigated the impact of Tyr-823 on c-Kit signaling. We demonstrate here that Tyr-823 is crucial for cell survival and proliferation and that mutation of Tyr-823 to phenylalanine leads to decreased sustained phosphorylation and ubiquitination of c-Kit as compared with the wild-type receptor. Furthermore, the mutated receptor was, upon ligand-stimulation, quickly internalized and degraded. Phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl was transient, followed by a substantial reduction in phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules such as Akt, Erk, p38, Shc, and Gab2. Thus, we propose that activation loop tyrosine 823 is crucial for activation of both the MAPK and PI3K pathways and that its disruption leads to a destabilization of the c-Kit receptor and decreased survival of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013978675,"Background In Chad, several species of tsetse flies (Genus: Glossina) transmit African animal trypanosomoses (AAT), which represents a major obstacle to cattle rearing, and sleeping sickness, which impacts public health. After the failure of past interventions to eradicate tsetse, the government of Chad is now looking for other approaches that integrate cost-effective intervention techniques, which can be applied by the stake holders to control tsetse-transmitted trypanosomoses in a sustainable manner. The present study thus attempted to assess the efficacy of restricted application of insecticides to cattle leg extremities using footbaths for controlling Glossina m. submorsitans, G. tachinoides and G. f. fuscipes in southern Chad. Methodology/Principal Findings Two sites were included, one close to the historical human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) focus of Moundou and the other to the active foci of Bodo and Moissala. At both sites, a treated and an untreated herd were compared. In the treatment sites, cattle were treated on a regular basis using a formulation of deltamethrin 0.005% (67 to 98 cattle were treated in one of the sites and 88 to 102 in the other one). For each herd, tsetse densities were monthly monitored using 7 biconical traps set along the river and beside the cattle pen from February to December 2009. The impact of footbath treatment on tsetse populations was strong (p < 10-3) with a reduction of 80% in total tsetse catches by the end of the 6-month footbath treatment. Conclusions/Significance The impact of footbath treatment as a vector control tool within an integrated strategy to manage AAT and HAT is discussed in the framework of the “One Health” concept. Like other techniques based on the treatment of cattle, this technology should be used under controlled conditions, in order to avoid the development of insecticide and acaricide resistance in tsetse and tick populations, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1985533385,"Background The 12Ala allele of the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma gene (PPARG) Pro12Ala polymorphism produces a decreased binding affinity of the PPARγ2 protein, resulting in low activation of the target genes. The 12Ala allele carriers display a significantly improved insulin sensitivity that may result in better glucose utilisation in working skeletal muscles. We hypothesise that the PPARG 12Ala allele could be associated with strength athlete status in Polish athletes. Methodology The genotype distribution of PPARG Pro12Ala was examined in 660 Polish athletes. The athletes were stratified into four subgroups: endurance, strength-endurance, sprint-strength and strength. Control samples were prepared from 684 unrelated sedentary volunteers. A χ2 test was used to compare the PPARG Pro12Ala allele and genotype frequencies between the different groups of athletes and control subjects. Bonferroni’s correction for multiple testing was applied. Results A statistically significant higher frequency of PPARG 12Ala alleles was observed in the subgroup of strength athletes performing short-term and very intense exertion characterised by predominant anaerobic energy production (13.2% vs. 7.5% in controls; P = 0.0007). Conclusion The PPARG 12Ala allele may be a relevant genetic factor favouring strength abilities in professional athletes, especially in terms of insulin-dependent metabolism, a shift of the energy balance towards glucose utilisation and the development of a favourable weight-to-strength ratio."

Actin is an abundant component of the cortical cytoskeleton, and it forms a large submembrane filamentous network. Although stable, it is also a highly dynamic structure. Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to various stimuli is important in many cellular processes, including motility, adhesion, phagocytosis, cytokinesis, secretion, and ion transport across the plasma membrane (13.Mitchison T.J.

Several transporters are known to be directly associated with and modulated by the actin cytoskeleton, such as epithelial sodium channels (20.Berdiev B.K. Prat A.G. Cantiello H.F. Ausiello D.A.

Physiol. 1995; 269: F637-F643PubMed Google Scholar), among others. We have previously shown that purified actin in its filamentous form (F-actin) inhibits the activity of PMCA by ∼50% with an apparent affinity in the micromolar range (12.Vanagas L. de La Fuente M.C. Dalghi M. Ferreira-Gomes M. Rossi R.C. Strehler E.E. Mangialavori I.C. Rossi J.P. Differential effects of G- and F-actin on the plasma membrane calcium pump activity.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 66: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that not only was actin depolymerization associated with a loss in the inhibitory effect (11.Vanagas L. Rossi R.C. Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Rossi J.P. Plasma membrane calcium pump activity is affected by the membrane protein concentration: evidence for the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) but incubation of PMCA with G-actin caused the stimulation of the activity of the pump showing a continuous decrease in the magnitude of activation as polymerization progressed (12.Vanagas L. de La Fuente M.C. Dalghi M. Ferreira-Gomes M. Rossi R.C. Strehler E.E. Mangialavori I.C. Rossi J.P. Differential effects of G- and F-actin on the plasma membrane calcium pump activity.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 66: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we proposed that G-actin and/or short actin oligomers may be responsible for PMCA activation (12.Vanagas L. de La Fuente M.C. Dalghi M. Ferreira-Gomes M. Rossi R.C. Strehler E.E. Mangialavori I.C. Rossi J.P. Differential effects of G- and F-actin on the plasma membrane calcium pump activity.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 66: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The monomer pool of actin in non-muscle animal cells is around 50% of total cellular actin (24.Sheterline P. Clayton J. Sparrow J.C. Actin. 4th Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar). This unpolymerized pool is maintained by binding G-actin to a number of different monomer-binding proteins (25.dos Remedios C.G. Chhabra D. Kekic M. Dedova I.V. Tsubakihara M. Berry D.A. Nosworthy N.J. Actin binding proteins: regulation of cytoskeletal microfilaments.Physiol.

Data on the distribution and properties of the monomer pool is scarce, but some studies have indicated that it is associated with dynamic regions of the cell, and foci of unassembled actin were found to be concentrated in the cell periphery (27.Spudich A. Wrenn J.T. Wessells N.K. Unfertilized sea urchin eggs contain a discrete cortical shell of actin that is subdivided into two organizational states.Cell Motil.

Biol. 1989; 134: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, G-actin is known to be recruited to the plasma membrane in response to a variety of cell receptor activation signals (29.Brozinick Jr., J.T.

T-cell receptor-dependent actin regulatory mechanisms.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Short actin filaments are formed by severing proteins and debranching from the actin submembranous network (33.Billadeau D.D. Burkhardt J.K. Regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics at the immune synapse: new stars join the actin troupe.Traffic. 2006; 11: 1451-1460Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which can be followed by further depolymerization. From these observations, we can hypothesize that monomeric actin and short oligomers would be available in the cell cortex to interact with and potentially regulate PMCA. This is supported by the finding of nonfilamentous actin complexes in resting platelets that contain PMCA and other cytoskeletal proteins (34.Bozulic L.D. Malik M.T. Powell D.W. Nanez A. Link A.J. Ramos K.S. Dean W.L. Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase associates with CLP36, α-actinin, and actin in human platelets.Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 97: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, elucidating the role of nonfilamentous actin in PMCA regulation will be key to understanding the impact of dynamic changes of the membrane-proximal actin cytoskeleton in the regulation of Ca2+ transport. To this aim, we assessed the direct interaction between G-actin and PMCA by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Using this technology, we were able to determine the stoichiometry and affinity of the interaction. We also investigated the calmodulin binding domain of the pump as a putative binding site for the association with actin. We therefore measured the Ca2+-ATPase activity and the levels of phosphorylated intermediates of PMCA to functionally describe the effect of G-actin and short oligomers. We also investigated whether actin stimulation was associated with changes in the affinity of the pump for Ca2+ and/or in the Vmax. Finally, we assessed if the direct interaction with actin oligomers results in a conformational change in the PMCA similar to that observed for other activators of the pump. All chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma. Pyrene-actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc., and calmodulin was from Calbiochem. Sensor Chips CM5 and kit reagents for the immobilization process were purchased from Biacore-GE, Sweden. Recently drawn human blood for the isolation of PMCA was obtained from the Hematology Section of Fundación Fundosol (Argentina). Blood donation in Argentina is voluntary, and therefore the donor provides informed consent for the donation of blood and for the subsequent legitimate use of the blood by the transfusion service. PMCA4 is the predominant isoform of human erythrocytes, which contain about 80% of this isoform and 20% of PMCA1 (35.Guerini D. Pan B. Carafoli E. Expression, purification, and characterization of isoform 1 of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump: focus on calpain sensitivity.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38141-38148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PMCA was isolated from calmodulin-depleted erythrocyte membranes by the calmodulin-affinity chromatography procedure (36.Niggli V. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Purification of the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase from human erythrocyte membranes using a calmodulin affinity column.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9955-9958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane proteins were solubilized in a 0.5% C12E10-containing buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded into a Sepharose-calmodulin column in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+. The column was thoroughly washed with 0.05% C12E10-containing buffer. PMCA was eluted in 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.005% C12E10, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS-K (pH 7.4 at 4 °C), 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Purified PMCA was assayed for protein concentration and homogeneity (concentrations 350–800 nm; single band at Mr 134,000) by SDS-PAGE and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. It has been demonstrated previously that the activity and the regulatory properties of the protein are preserved in either solubilized or reconstituted purified preparations compared with that located in the erythrocyte (37.Filomatori C.V. Rega A.F. On the mechanism of activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase by ATP and acidic phospholipids.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle was prepared according to the method of Straub (38.Straub F.B. Actin II. Studies from the Inst.Med. Chem. Univ. Szeged. 1943; 3: 23-37Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C for 0–3 years. Actin was purified from the acetone powder following the method of Spudich and Watt (39.Spudich J.A. Watt S. The regulation of rabbit skeletal muscle contraction. I. Biochemical studies of the interaction of the tropomyosin-troponin complex with actin and the proteolytic fragments of myosin.J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.63 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1. SDS-PAGE was performed to assess the purity of the preparation (typically ∼98%). Purified monomeric actin was stored frozen at −80 °C after freezing in liquid nitrogen at high concentrations (≥5 mg/ml) in a small volume (≤100 μl). Under this storage condition, the sample was stable for 6 months (40.Xu J. Schwarz W.H. Käs J.A. Stossel T.P. Janmey P.A. Pollard T.D. Mechanical properties of actin filament networks depend on preparation, polymerization conditions, and storage of actin monomers.Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2731-2740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). At the time of use, frozen samples were thawed rapidly at 37 °C and clarified. The clarification step consists of ×20 dilution of the sample in fresh Buffer G (2 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.005% azide, pH 8.0 at 25 °C); after leaving the preparation at 4 °C for 1 h to depolymerize actin oligomers that could have been formed during the freeze-thaw steps, the sample was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min to remove residual nucleating centers. Biomolecular interaction analyses were carried out using a BIAcore T100 instrument (Biacore). All the experiments were carried out at 25 °C. For coupling of G-actin, PMCA, and C28 peptide on CM-dextran sensor chip (CM5), G-actin was coupled to the carboxymethyl-dextran matrix of CM5 sensor chips (Biacore) using the amine coupling kit (Biacore) as described previously (41.Johnsson B. Löfås S. Lindquist G. Immobilization of proteins to a carboxymethyldextran-modified gold surface for biospecific interaction analysis in surface plasmon resonance sensors.Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). The activation and immobilization periods were set between 3 and 7 min to couple the desired amount of protein yielding between 600 and 1200 resonance units (RU). Prior to immobilization, G-actin in Buffer G was diluted to 10 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0 at 25 °C). After immobilization, the sensor surface was extensively washed by several injections of a buffer containing 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 25 °C) and 0.2 mm CaCl2. PMCA was coupled using the same amine coupling procedure. Prior to immobilization, PMCA at a concentration of 50 nm was dialyzed at 4 °C against a buffer containing 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0 at 25 °C), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 70 μm CaCl2, 0.005% C12E10, and 20% glycerol. PMCA was injected for ∼7 min to obtain an immobilization level between 400 and 800 RU. Immediately after the immobilization procedure, the sensor surface was washed with a solution containing 15 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.2 at 25 °C), 1 mm MgCl2, 70 μm CaCl2, 0.005% C12E10 to have the immobilized PMCA reconstituted into detergent micelles. C28 peptide, which corresponds to the calmodulin binding domain of PMCA, was dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0 at 25 °C) at a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml and immobilized following the same procedure as described for PMCA. In all cases, an identical procedure was carried out on the surface of a second flow cell except for the protein injection, constituting the control cell for nonspecific binding. For binding analysis on PMCA and C28 peptide-immobilized surfaces, calmodulin was diluted 2-fold in a buffer composed of 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.2 at 25 °C), 120 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.005% C12E10, and 70 μm CaCl2, in a range between 0.4 and 25 nm and injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 60 s. 10 μm G-actin was dialyzed at 4 °C against a buffer composed of 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7 at 25 °C), 70 μm CaCl2, and 0.005% C12E10 and injected in a range of concentrations between 0.6 to 5 μm (obtained by 2-fold dilution) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 60 s. In both cases, dissociation and surface regeneration were carried out with the running buffer. For binding analysis on the G-actin immobilized surface, PMCA was dialyzed at 4 °C against a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.2 at 25 °C), 120 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 70 μm CaCl2, and 0.005% C12E10. Depending on the initial concentration, which varies according to the purification yield, PMCA was concentrated to 2.0 μm and diluted 2-fold in a range of concentrations between 0.01 nm to 2.0 μm. PMCA was injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 30 and 60 s. Pulses of a nonpolymerizing buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 at 25 °C, 200 μm CaCl2) were injected to regenerate the surface. For calculation of the affinity constants, dissociation constants (Kd) were determined under equilibrium conditions or by kinetics analysis after correction for nonspecific binding, for which proteins were passed over a reference surface constituted by a blocked empty flow cell, as described previously (42.Malchiodi E.L. Eisenstein E. Fields B.A. Ohlendorf D.H. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Superantigen binding to a T cell receptor β chain of known three-dimensional structure.J. Exp.

Prior to use, pyrene-actin (Cytoskeleton) was diluted from stock solution (20 mg/ml) and clarified as described above. Pyrene-actin in the supernatant was added to nonlabeled actin to obtain 6% of label. Actin polymerization was monitored by registering the change in the fluorescence signal in a thermostated spectrofluorimeter Jasco FP-6500 using a quartz cuvette of 3 × 3 mm. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 365 and 407 nm, respectively, with a bandwidth of 3 and 10 nm, respectively (44.Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. Pyrene actin: documentation of the validity of a sensitive assay for actin polymerization.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Measurements were done at 25 °C. To avoid bleaching the fluorophore, the sample was exposed to the lamp intermittently. Polymerization was initiated by addition of a small aliquot of a mixture of concentrated KCl, MgCl2, and ATP to final concentrations of 120 mm, 3.75 mm, and 30 μm, respectively, or buffer G as a control for the stability test. To evaluate the extent of actin polymerization in PMCA activity assays, polymerization was initiated under identical conditions as those used for PMCA activity measurements. ATP hydrolysis was assayed either by measuring the [32P]Pi released from [γ-32P]ATP as described by Richards et al. (45.Richards D.E. Rega A.F. Garrahan P.J. Two classes of site for ATP in the Ca2+-ATPase from human red cell membranes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or alternatively performed according to the method of Webb (46.Webb M.R. A continuous spectrophotometric assay for inorganic phosphate and for measuring phosphate release kinetics in biological systems.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) using a commercial kit (EnzChek Phosphate Assay kit from Molecular Probes). In both cases, the reaction medium contained 120 mm KCl, 30 mm MOPS-K (pH 7.4 at 25 °C), 3.75 mm MgCl2, 70 μg/ml C12E10, 10 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 1 mm EGTA, and enough CaCl2 to give the desired final [Ca2+]free. The reaction was started by the addition of ATP (final concentration of 30 μm for radioactive assays and 2 mm for the nonradioactive measurements). Enzyme concentration was 0.8 μg/ml. Blanks were carried out in the same medium without free Ca2+, in the presence of 1 mm EGTA; and control experiments for actin ATPase activity were done in the same medium in the absence of PMCA. Measurements were carried out at 25 °C. The phosphorylated intermediates (EP) were measured as the amount of acid-stable 32P incorporated in the enzyme from [γ-32P]ATP after stopping the reaction with an ice-cold solution containing 10% trichloroacetic acid. Phosphorylated PMCA was measured 1 min after initiation of the reaction in a medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm MOPS-K (pH 7.4 at 25 °C), 3.75 mm MgCl2, 70 μg/ml C12E10, 10 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 1 mm EGTA, and enough CaCl2 to give a final [Ca2+]free of 70 μm. PMCA concentration was 0.8 μg/ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 μm ATP concomitant with the addition of actin or buffer for control experiments. Measurements were carried out at 25 °C. The isolation and quantification of the EP intermediates were performed according to the method described by Echarte et al. (47.Echarte M.M. Levi V.

https://openalex.org/W2003457403,"Background Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in the defense against invading pathogens by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria, resulting in the induction and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. The WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1) regulates a variety of cellular biological processes. Here, we investigated whether WWP1 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in TLR-mediated inflammation. Methodology/Results Knocking down WWP1 enhanced the TNF-α and IL-6 production induced by LPS, and over-expression of WWP1 inhibited the TNF-α and IL-6 production induced by LPS, but not by TNF-α. WWP1 also inhibited the IκB-α, NF-κB, and MAPK activation stimulated by LPS. Additionally, WWP1 could degrade TRAF6, but not IRAK1, in the proteasome pathway, and knocking down WWP1 reduced the LPS-induced K48-linked, but not K63-linked, polyubiquitination of endogenous TRAF6. Conclusions/Significance We identified WWP1 as an important negative regulator of TLR4-mediated TNF-α and IL-6 production. We also showed that WWP1 functions as an E3 ligase when cells are stimulated with LPS by binding to TRAF6 and promoting K48-linked polyubiquitination. This results in the proteasomal degradation of TRAF6."
https://openalex.org/W2085013124,"Master regulators, which broadly affect expression of diverse genes, play critical roles in bacterial growth and environmental adaptation. However, the underlying mechanism by which such regulators interact with their cognate DNA remains to be elucidated. In this study, we solved the crystal structure of a broad regulator Ms6564 in Mycobacterium smegmatis and its protein-operator complex at resolutions of 1.9 and 2.5 Å, respectively. Similar to other typical TetR family regulators, two dimeric Ms6564 molecules were found to bind to opposite sides of target DNA. However, the recognition helix of Ms6564 inserted only slightly into the DNA major groove. Unexpectedly, 11 disordered water molecules bridged the interface of TetR family regulator DNA. Although the DNA was deformed upon Ms6564 binding, it still retained the conformation of B-form DNA. Within the DNA-binding domain of Ms6564, only two amino acids residues directly interacted with the bases of cognate DNA. Lys-47 was found to be essential for the specific DNA binding ability of Ms6564. These data indicate that Ms6564 can bind DNA with strong affinity but makes flexible contacts with DNA. Our study suggests that Ms6564 might slide more easily along the genomic DNA and extensively regulate the expression of diverse genes in M. smegmatis."
https://openalex.org/W2029227068,"The mechanisms and mediators underlying common renal impairment after myocardial infarction (MI) are still poorly understood. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) provides renoprotective effects after MI by preventing augmented intrarenal renin-angiotensin-system (RAS)-induced podocyte injury. Sprague–Dawley rats that underwent ligation of their coronary arteries were treated with losartan (20 mg/kg/d) or vehicle for 3 or 9 weeks. Renal function, histology and molecular changes were assessed. The current study revealed that MI-induced glomerular podocyte injury was identified by increased immunostaining for desmin and p16ink4a, decreased immunostaining for Wilms’ tumor-1 and podocin mRNA expression, and an induced increase of blood cystatin C at both 3 and 9 weeks. These changes were associated with increased intrarenal angiotensin II levels and enhanced expressions of angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II receptor mRNA and protein. These changes were also associated with decreased levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and decreased expressions of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) protein and mRNA and phosphorylated(p)-Akt protein at 9 weeks, as well as increased expressions of 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine at both time points. Treatment with losartan significantly attenuated desmin- and p16ink4a-positive podocytes, restored podocin mRNA expression, and decreased blood cystatin C levels. Losartan also prevented RAS activation and oxidative stress and restored the IGF-1/IGF-1R/Akt pathway. In conclusion, ARBs prevent the progression of renal impairment after MI via podocyte protection, partially by inhibiting the activation of the local RAS with subsequent enhanced oxidative stress and an inhibited IGF-1/IGF-1R/Akt pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2033502088,"In affluent countries, the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is often higher in certain ethnic minorities than in the majority population. In The Netherlands, we examined why CT prevalence is higher in Surinamese/Antilleans, the largest minority in the country.Heterosexuals were recruited for a cross-sectional survey from May through August 2010 at the sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinic in Amsterdam. Participants completed a questionnaire and were tested for STI. A causal directed acyclic graph was assumed to investigate whether the association between ethnicity and CT could be explained by differences in sexual risk behaviour and socio-economic status.Subjects included 1044 with Dutch background and 335 with Surinamese/Antillean background. Median age for the combined population was 25 (IQR 22-30) years, and 55.4% was female. Sexual risk behaviour did not differ significantly between the two groups. CT was diagnosed in 17.9% of Surinamese/Antilleans and in 11.4% of Dutch. Surinamese/Antilleans were significantly more likely to have CT (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.21-2.38). The association between ethnicity and CT remained statistically significant after adjusting for sexual risk behaviour, age, sex, and ethnic mixing (aOR 1.48; 95% CI 1.00-2.18), but not after adjusting for education and neighbourhood, markers of socio-economic status (aOR 1.08; 95% CI 0.71-1.64).The difference in CT prevalence between the minority and majority groups was not explained by differences in sexual risk behaviour. The higher CT prevalence found among Surinamese/Antilleans appeared to reflect their lower educational level and neighbourhood, two markers of lower socio-economic status. We hypothesise that the effect results from lower health-seeking behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W1966294291,"Calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion 1 (CAPS1) is a multidomain protein containing a Munc13 homology domain 1 (MHD1). Although CAPS1 and Munc13-1 play crucial roles in the priming stage of secretion, their functions are non-redundant. Similar to Munc13-1, CAPS1 binds to syntaxin-1, a key t-SNARE protein in neurosecretion. However, whether CAPS1 interacts with syntaxin-1 in a similar mode to Munc13-1 remains unclear. Here, using yeast two-hybrid assays followed by biochemical binding experiments, we show that the region in CAPS1 consisting of the C-terminal half of the MHD1 with the corresponding C-terminal region can bind to syntaxin-1. Importantly, the binding mode of CAPS1 to syntaxin-1 is distinct from that of Munc13-1; CAPS1 binds to the full-length of cytoplasmic syntaxin-1 with preference to its “open” conformation, whereas Munc13-1 binds to the first 80 N-terminal residues of syntaxin-1. Unexpectedly, the majority of the MHD1 of CAPS1 is dispensable, whereas the C-terminal 69 residues are crucial for the binding to syntaxin-1. Functionally, a C-terminal truncation of 69 or 134 residues in CAPS1 abolishes its ability to reconstitute secretion in permeabilized PC12 cells. Our results reveal a novel mode of binding between CAPS1 and syntaxin-1, which play a crucial role in neurosecretion. We suggest that the distinct binding modes between CAPS1 and Munc13-1 can account for their non-redundant functions in neurosecretion. We also propose that the preferential binding of CAPS1 to open syntaxin-1 can contribute to the stabilization of the open state of syntaxin-1 during its transition from “closed” state to the SNARE complex formation.Background: CAPS1 and Munc13-1 play crucial but non-redundant roles in exocytosis.Results: CAPS1 binds to the full-length, cytoplasmic syntaxin with preference to its open conformation, whereas Munc13-1 binds to the N terminus of syntaxin-1.Conclusion: The distinct binding modes of CAPS1 and Munc13-1 can account for their non-redundant functions.Significance: Mechanistic insights into how CAPS1 contributes to exocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W2044004326,"Crude extracts of Selaginellatamariscina, an oriental medicinal herb, have been evidenced to treat several human diseases. This study investigated the mechanisms by which Selaginellatamariscina inhibits the invasiveness of human oral squamous-cell carcinoma (OSCC) HSC-3 cells.Herein, we demonstrate that Selaginellatamariscina attenuated HSC-3 cell migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-metastatic activities of Selaginellatamariscina occurred at least partially because of the down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 gelatinase activity and the down-regulation of protein expression. The expression and function of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 were regulated by Selaginellatamariscina at a transcriptional level, as shown by quantitative real-time PCR and reporter assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data further indicated that binding of the cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein and activating protein-1 (AP-1) to the MMP-2 promoter diminished at the highest dosage level of Selaginellatamariscina. The DNA-binding activity of specificity protein 1 (SP-1) to the MMP-9 promoter was also suppressed at the same concentration. Selaginellatamariscina did not affect the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, but did inhibit the effects of gelatinase by reducing the activation of serine-threonine kinase Akt.These results demonstrate that Selaginellatamariscina may be a potent adjuvant therapeutic agent in the prevention of oral cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2044411832,"Aberrantly or excessively expressed proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum are identified by quality control mechanisms and dislocated to the cytosol for proteasome-mediated, ubiquitin-dependent degradation by a process termed endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). In addition to its role in degradation, ubiquitination has also been implicated in substrate dislocation, although whether direct ubiquitin conjugation of ERAD substrates is required for dislocation has been difficult to ascertain. An obstacle in probing the mechanism of quality control-induced ERAD is the paucity of ERAD substrates being dislocated and detected at any given time. To obviate this problem, we report here the use of a sensitive biotinylation system to probe the dislocation of major histocompatibility complex I (MHCI) heavy chain substrates in the absence of immune evasion proteins. Using this assay system the dislocation of MHCI heavy chains was found not to require potential ubiquitin conjugation sites in the cytoplasmic tail or Lys residues in the ectodomain. By contrast, dislocation of MHCI heavy chains did require deubiquitinating enzyme activity and rapid proteasome-mediated degradation required Lys residues in MHCI heavy chain ectodomain. These combined findings support the model that the endoplasmic reticulum quality control-induced dislocation of MHCI heavy chains may not require direct ubiquitination/deubiquitination as is required for proteasome-mediated degradation post dislocation."
https://openalex.org/W2064369501,"Several species of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) biting midges serve as biological vectors for the bluetongue virus (BTV) and the recently described Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in northern Europe. Since their recent emergence in this part of the continent, these diseases have caused considerable economic losses to the sheep and cattle industries. Much data is now available that describe the distribution, population dynamics, and feeding habits of these insects. However, little is known regarding the presence of Culicoides in unusual habitats such as peaty marshes, nor their potential vector capacity. This study evaluated Culicoides biting midges present in the bogs of a Belgian nature reserve compared to those residing at a nearby cattle farm. Culicoides were trapped in 2011 at four different sites (broadleaved and coniferous forested areas, open environments, and at a scientific station) located in the Hautes Fagnes Nature Reserve (Belgium). An additional light trap was operated on a nearby cattle farm. Very high numbers of biting midges were captured in the marshy area and most of them (70 to 95%) were Culicoides impunctatus, a potential vector of BTV and other pathogens. In addition, fewer numbers of C. obsoletus/C. scoticus species, C. chiopterus, and C. dewulfi were observed in the bogs compared to the farm. The wet environment and oligotrophic nature of the soil were probably responsible for these changes in the respective populations. A total of 297,808 Culicoides midges belonging to 27 species were identified during this study and 3 of these species (C. sphagnumensis, C. clintoni and C. comosioculatus) were described in Belgium for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2086211564,"The phylogenetic relationships between the different groups of Paleozoic gnathostomes are still debated, mainly because of incomplete datasets on Paleozoic jawed vertebrate fossils and ontogeny of some modern taxa. This issue is illustrated by the condition of the glossopharyngeal nerve relative to the parachordal plate, the otic capsules and the metotic fissure in gnathostomes. Two main conditions are observed in elasmobranchs (shark and rays) and osteichthyans (bony fishes and tetrapods). The condition in the other chondrichthyan taxon, the holocephalans, is still poorly known, and without any information on this taxon, it remains difficult to polarize the condition in gnathostomes. Based on the anatomical study of an embryo of the holocephalan Callorhinchus milii by means of propagation X-Ray Synchrotron phase contrast microtomography using both holotomography and single distance phase retrieval process, we show that, contrary to what was previously inferred for holocephalans (i.e. an osteichthyan-like condition), the arrangement of the glossopharyngeal nerve relative to the surrounding structure in holocephalans is more similar to that of elasmobranchs. Furthermore, the holocephalan condition represents a combination of plesiomorphic characters for gnathostomes (e.g., the glossopharyngeal nerve leaves the braincase via the metotic fissure) and homoplastic characters. By contrast, the crown osteichthyans are probably derived in having the glossopharyngeal nerve that enters the saccular chamber and in having the glossopharyngeal foramen separated from the metotic fissure."
https://openalex.org/W2015748610,"C. elegans PUD-1 and PUD-2, two proteins up-regulated in daf-2(loss-of-function) (PUD), are homologous 17-kD proteins with a large abundance increase in long-lived daf-2 mutant animals of reduced insulin signaling. In this study, we show that both PUD-1 and PUD-2 are abundantly expressed in the intestine and hypodermis, and form a heterodimer. We have solved their crystal structure to 1.9-Å resolution and found that both proteins adopt similar β-sandwich folds in the V-shaped dimer. In contrast, their homologs PUD-3, PUD-4, PUDL-1 and PUDL-2 are all monomeric proteins with distinct expression patterns in C. elegans. Thus, the PUD-1/PUD-2 heterodimer probably has a function distinct from their family members. Neither overexpression nor deletion of pud-1 and pud-2 affected the lifespan of WT or daf-2 mutant animals, suggesting that their induction in daf-2 worms does not contribute to longevity. Curiously, deletion of pud-1 and pud-2 was associated with a protective effect against paralysis induced by the amyloid β-peptide (1-42), which further enhanced the protection conferred by daf-2(RNAi) against Aβ."
https://openalex.org/W2034631308,"Pneumocystis carinii (Pc) β-glucans are major components of the organism cell wall; yet, the regulation of Pc cell wall genesis and remodeling is not well understood. Ace2 transcription factors, which are present in many fungi, regulate glucanases and other enzymes needed for cell wall remodeling. The cloning and heterologous expression of PcAce2 in ace2Δ Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that PcAce2 can restore the defective glucanase and endochitinase gene expression of the mutant as well as regulate cell wall β-glucan biosynthetic genes. Furthermore, when a reconstructed yeast system was used, PcAce2 activated the transcription of the Pneumocystis gsc1 β-glucan synthetase, confirming the activity of a Pc transcription factor on a native Pneumocystis promoter and gene for the first time. We further observed that Pneumocystis binding to host extracellular matrix proteins and lung epithelial cells induced the phosphorylation (activation) of the PcAce2 transcription factor. Finally, we present a novel method that confirms the role of PcAce2 in modulating organism virulence using ace2Δ Candida glabrata infection in neutropenic mice. Together, these results indicate that the adherence of Pc to lung matrix proteins and epithelial cells leads to the activation of the Ace2 transcription factor, which regulates cell wall degradation and biosynthesis genes that are required for cell wall remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2084583076,"FasL mediated preferential apoptosis of bystander CTLs while protection of infected CD4(+)T cells remains one of the hallmarks of immune evasion during HIV infection. The property of infected host cells to evade cell-autonomous apoptosis emanates from ability of HIV-1Nef-protein to physically interact with ASK-1 and thereby inhibit its enzymatic activity. The specific domains of HIV-1Nef through which it may interact with ASK1 and thereby impair the ASK1 activity remain unidentified so far and represent a major challenge towards developing clear understanding about the dynamics of this interaction. Using mammalian two hybrid screen in association with site directed mutagenesis and competitive inhibitor peptides, we identified constituent minimal essential domain (152 DEVGEANN 159) through which HIV-1Nef interacts with ASK1 and inhibits its function. Furthermore our study also unravels a novel alternate mechanism underlying HIV-1 Nef mediated ASK1 functional modulation, wherein by potentiating the inhibitory ser(967) phosphorylation of ASK1, HIV-1Nef negatively modulated ASK1 function."
https://openalex.org/W2082778585,"The altered aggregation of proteins in non-native conformation is associated with endoplasmic reticulum derangements, mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare hereditary systemic vasculopathy, caused by NOTCH3 mutations within the receptor extracellular domain, that lead to abnormal accumulation of the mutated protein in the vascular wall. NOTCH3 misfolding could cause free radicals increase also in CADASIL. Aim of the study was to verify whether CADASIL patients have increased oxidative stress compared to unrelated healthy controls. We enrolled 15 CADASIL patients and 16 gender- and age-matched healthy controls with comparable cardiovascular risk factor. Blood and plasma reduced and total aminothiols (homocysteine, cysteine, glutathione, cysteinylglycine) were measured by HPLC and plasma 3-nitrotyrosine by ELISA. Only plasma reduced cysteine (Pr-Cys) and blood reduced glutathione (Br-GSH) concentrations differed between groups: in CADASIL patients Br-GSH levels were higher (p = 0.019) and Pr-Cys lower (p = 0.010) than in controls. No correlation was found between Br-GSH and Pr-Cys either in CADASIL patients (rho 0.25, P = 0.36) or in controls (rho -0.15, P = 0.44). Conversely, 3-nitrotyrosine values were similar in CADASIL and healthy subjects (p = 0.82). The high levels of antioxidant molecules and low levels of oxidant mediators found in our CADASIL population might either be expression of an effective protective action against free radical formation at an early stage of clinical symptoms or they could suggest that oxidative stress is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of CADASIL."
https://openalex.org/W2105708319,"Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is an aggressive pediatric cancer of skeletal muscle. More than 70% of ARMS tumors carry balanced t(2;13) chromosomal translocation that leads to the production of two novel fusion genes, PAX3-FKHR and FKHR-PAX3. While the PAX3-FKHR gene has been intensely studied, the reciprocal FKHR-PAX3 gene has rarely been described. We report here the cloning and functional characterization of the FKHR-PAX3 gene as the first step towards a better understanding of its potential impact on ARMS biology. From RH30 ARMS cells, we detected and isolated three versions of FKHR-PAX3 cDNAs whose C-terminal sequences corresponded to PAX3c, PAX3d, and PAX3e isoforms. Unlike the nuclear-specific localization of PAX3-FKHR, the reciprocal FKHR-PAX3 proteins stayed predominantly in the cytoplasm. FKHR-PAX3 potently inhibited myogenesis in both non-transformed myoblast cells and ARMS cells. We showed that FKHR-PAX3 was not a classic oncogene but could act as a facilitator in oncogenic pathways by stabilizing PAX3-FKHR expression, enhancing cell proliferation, clonogenicity, anchorage-independent growth, and matrix adhesion in vitro, and accelerating the onset of tumor formation in xenograft mouse model in vivo. In addition to these pro-oncogenic behaviors, FKHR-PAX3 also negatively affected cell migration and invasion in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Taken together, these functional characteristics suggested that FKHR-PAX3 might have a critical role in the early stage of ARMS development."
