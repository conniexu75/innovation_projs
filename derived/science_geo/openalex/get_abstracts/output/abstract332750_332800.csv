https://openalex.org/W2076447103,"Instruments carried aboard an Aerobee rocket in April 1965 provided evidence for x-ray emission from the directions of the radio galaxies Cygnus A and M-87 and from the galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. A survey of the Cygnus region revealed a marked decrease in the flux of x-rays from Cygnus XR-1, which was identified in June 1964 as the second brightest object in the first Naval Research Laboratory list of x-ray sources. The detection sensitivity was improved over previous surveys and several new sources were detected at lower flux levels."
https://openalex.org/W2054354373,"The ""optical shuttle"" is an improved method of photographing with a motion-picture camera, one by one, sequential sections mounted on separate slides. The optical output from two microscopes is combined so that the images can be focused on a single film plane. Slides are photographed alternately through the microscopes. Simultaneous viewing of two successive sections in the microscopes enables initial precise alignment of images. Complex anatomical structures can thus be analyzed with relative ease."

https://openalex.org/W2078701506,"Eggs of the grasshopper, Romalea microptera, are laid in a tightcluster, encased within a matrix of hardened froth. When first laid, the eggs are yellow and soft, and the froth is white and lathery. During subsequent hours, eggs and froth undergo a tanning process, as a result of which they harden and darken. An exocrine secretion, supplied by a pair of glands situated beside the gonopore, is mixed with the froth as the eggs are laid, and serves to promote tanning. Similar glands are found in some, but not all grasshoppers."

In a late Pleistocene population of Limicolaria martensiana all the major color forms that occur in modern living snails may be distinguished, and the basic polymorphism is at least 8,000 to 10,000 year old."

The active morphogenetic substance in the coconut water has been partially purified."
