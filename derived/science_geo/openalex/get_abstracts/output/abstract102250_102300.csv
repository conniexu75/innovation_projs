https://openalex.org/W2164682544,"A phosphopeptide library was used to determine the sequence specificity of the peptide-binding sites of SH2 domains. One group of SH2 domains (Src, Fyn, Lck, Fgr, Abl, Crk, and Nck) preferred sequences with the general motif pTyr-hydrophilic-hydrophilic-Ile/Pro while another group (SH2 domains of p85, phospholipase C-gamma, and SHPTP2) selected the general motif pTyr-hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic. Individual members of these groups selected unique sequences, except the Src subfamily (Src, Fyn, Lck, and Fgr), which all selected the sequence pTyr-Glu-Glu-Ile. The variability in SH2 domain sequences at likely sites of contact provides a structural basis for the phosphopeptide selectivity of these families. Possible in vivo binding sites of the SH2 domains are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1991333931,"R2 is a non-LTR retrotransposable element that inserts at a specific site in the 28S rRNA genes of most insects. We have expressed the open reading frame of the R2 element from Bombyx mori, R2Bm, in E. coli and shown that it encodes both sequence-specific endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. The R2 protein makes a specific nick in one of the DNA strands at the insertion site and uses the 3' hydroxyl group exposed by this nick to prime reverse transcription of its RNA transcript. After reverse transcription, cleavage of the second DNA strand occurs. A similar mechanism of insertion may be used by other non-LTR retrotransposable elements as well as short interspersed nucleotide elements."
https://openalex.org/W2042043269,"The ligand for CD40 (CD40L) is a membrane glycoprotein on activated T cells that induces B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion. Abnormalities in the CD40L gene were associated with an X-linked immunodeficiency in humans [hyper-IgM (immunoglobulin M) syndrome]. This disease is characterized by elevated concentrations of serum IgM and decreased amounts of all other isotypes. CD40L complementary DNAs from three of four patients with this syndrome contained distinct point mutations. Recombinant expression of two of the mutant CD40L complementary DNAs resulted in proteins incapable of binding to CD40 and unable to induce proliferation or IgE secretion from normal B cells. Activated T cells from the four affected patients failed to express wild-type CD40L, although their B cells responded normally to wild-type CD40L. Thus, these CD40L defects lead to a T cell abnormality that results in the failure of patient B cells to undergo immunoglobulin class switching."
https://openalex.org/W2169584935,"The crystal structure of the Src SH2 domain complexed with a high affinity 11-residue phosphopeptide has been determined at 2.7 A resolution by X-ray diffraction. The peptide binds in an extended conformation and makes primary interactions with the SH2 domain at six central residues: PQ(pY)EEI. The phosphotyrosine and the isoleucine are tightly bound by two well-defined pockets on the protein surface, resulting in a complex that resembles a two-pronged plug engaging a two-holed socket. The glutamate residues are in solvent-exposed environments in the vicinity of basic side chains of the SH2 domain, and the two N-terminal residues cap the phosphotyrosine-binding site. The crystal structure of Src SH2 in the absence of peptide has been determined at 2.5 A resolution, and comparison with the structure of the high affinity complex reveals only localized and relatively small changes."
https://openalex.org/W1993861337,"In the CNS, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acts as an inhibitory transmitter via ligand-gated GABAA receptor channels and G protein-coupled GABAB receptors. Both of these receptor types mediate inhibitory postsynaptic transmission in the hippocampus. In addition to these direct postsynaptic actions, GABAB receptor agonists inhibit excitatory transmission through presynaptic receptors on excitatory afferent terminals. However, a physiological role for the GABAB receptors on excitatory nerve endings has not been established. In this study, we have found a brief, heterosynaptic depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampal slice following short-lasting repetitive stimulation and determined that this inhibition is mediated by presynaptic GABAB receptors. The inhibition of GABA uptake greatly enhanced both the presynaptic action of GABA and the slow GABAB-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic current. Transmitter uptake was also found to regulate the ""spill-over"" of GABA at conventional GABAA synapses. These results suggest that uptake mechanisms restrict the spatial range of both point-to-point synaptic transmission mediated by GABA and its action at a distance."
https://openalex.org/W2055485094,"We constructed a transgenic mouse model that mimics the human autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis in its spontaneous induction and pathology. Transgenic mice were constructed expressing genes encoding a rearranged T cell receptor specific for myelin basic protein (MBP). T cell tolerance was not induced in the periphery, and functional, autoreactive T cells were found in the spleen and lymph nodes of these mice. Transgenic mice developed experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) following immunization with MBP and adjuvant plus pertussis toxin as well as with administration of pertussis toxin alone. Spontaneous EAE can develop in transgenic mice housed in a non-sterile facility but not in those maintained in a sterile, specific pathogen-free facility. This model system affords a unique opportunity to dissect the genetic and environmental variables that may contribute to the development of spontaneous autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2034249407,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to be an autoimmune disease mediated by T lymphocytes that recognize myelin components of the central nervous system. In a 1-year double-blind study, 30 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS received daily capsules of bovine myelin or a control protein to determine the effect of oral tolerization to myelin antigens on the disease. Six of 15 individuals in the myelin-treated group had at least one major exacerbation; 12 of 15 had an attack in the control group. T cells reactive with myelin basic protein were reduced in the myelin-treated group. No toxicity or side effects were noted. Although conclusions about efficacy cannot be drawn from these data, they open an area of investigation for MS and other autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2087004183,"2-5A-dependent RNAase, an interferon-induced enzyme that is activated by 5'-phosphorylated, 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A), is implicated in both the molecular mechanisms of interferon action and the fundamental control of RNA stability in mammalian cells. Here we report the expression cloning and analysis of murine and human 2-5A-dependent RNAases. The 2-5A binding properties and RNAse activities of recombinant and naturally occurring forms of 2-5A-dependent RNAase were identical. Interferon induction of 2-5A-dependent RNAse expression was demonstrated by measuring the mRNA levels in cells treated with interferon and cycloheximide. Analysis of aligned murine and human 2-5A-dependent RNAse sequences revealed several intriguing features, including similarity to RNAase E, which is implicated in the control of mRNA stability in E. coli. Interestingly, a duplicated phosphate-binding loop motif was determined by deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis to function in the binding of 2-5A."
https://openalex.org/W2054323447,"The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is a membrane attachment structure of many proteins and occurs in a wide variety of eukaryotes from yeasts to mammals. The structure of the core of the GPI anchor is conserved in protozoa and mammals and so is its biosynthetic pathway. A complementary DNA encoding a human protein termed PIG-A (phosphatidylinositol glycan-class A) was cloned. PIG-A was necessary for synthesis of N-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol, the very early intermediate in GPI-anchor biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1489215358,"A novel synapse-associated protein, SAP90, accumulates around the axon hillock of Purkinje cells in rat cerebellum. By immuno-electron microscopy, SAP90 has been localized to the presynaptic termini of basket cells forming inhibitory, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synapses onto Purkinje cell axon hillocks. The amino acid sequence for SAP90 has been deduced from the nucleotide sequence of a series of overlapping cDNA clones. SAP90 is related to the gene product encoded by the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene dlg-A. SAP90 and the dlg-A product share an overall sequence identity of 54%. Three distinct domains can be identified: (i) a potential cytoskeletal region consisting of three repeats of 90 amino acids in length, (ii) a domain with similarity to SH3, a putative regulatory motif found in the src family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases and several proteins associated with the cortical cytoskeleton, and (iii) a carboxyl-terminal domain homologous to yeast guanylate kinase. These features suggest a possible role for SAP90 in a guanine nucleotide-mediated signal transduction pathway at a subset of GABAergic synapses in the rat cerebellum."

https://openalex.org/W2006392794,"The invariant chain (Ii) has aroused much interest because of its close association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Various functions have been proposed for it; several of these have received experimental support, but most have not been definitively proven, owing largely to uncertainties inherent in the experimental systems employed. We have now generated a line of mice devoid of the invariant chain by introducing a drastic mutation into the Ii gene. Cells from mutant animals show aberrant transport of MHC class II molecules, resulting in reduced levels of class II complexes at the surface, and these do not have the typical compact conformation indicative of tight peptide binding. Consequently, mutant cells present protein antigens very poorly and mutant mice are deficient in producing and at negatively selecting CD4+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1538346208,"Gastric mucin is a large glycoprotein which is thought to play a major role in the protection of the gastrointestinal tract from acid, proteases, pathogenic microorganisms, and mechanical trauma. In this paper we describe the isolation by expression cloning and characterization of cDNAs which code for human gastric mucin. The cDNA sequence is characterized by a tandem repeat region whose individual repeat unit is 507 base pairs (169 amino acids) long. The translated sequence is rich in threonine, serine, and proline (31, 18, and 15%, respectively) and contains a relatively large amount of histidine (7.1%) and alanine (5.6%). RNA blot analysis shows a polydisperse pattern which is characteristic of mucins. Expression of this gene is highest in the stomach and gall bladder, with weaker expression in the terminal ileum and right colon. This expression pattern is different from other human mucins and indicates that this gene codes for a unique mucin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques have localized this gene to chromosome 11p15.4-11p15.5. This is the third mucin to be localized to the 11p15 region and suggests a clustering of secretory mucin genes. We propose that this gene for human gastric mucin be called MUC6."
https://openalex.org/W2070065790,"Voltage-clamp analysis was applied to study the currents associated with the uptake of extracellular γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by the cloned transporter GAT1 expressed at high efficiency in Xenopus oocytes. Steady-state GABA currents were increased at higher extracellular [GABA], [Na+], and [CI−] and at more negative potentials. The Hill coefficient for Na+ exceeded unity, suggesting the involvement of two Na+ ions. In the absence of GABA, voltage jumps produced transient currents that behaved like capacitive charge movements; these were suppressed by the uptake inhibitor SKF-89976A, were shifted to more negative potentials at lower external [Na+] and [CI−], and had an effective valence of 1.1 elementary charge. A turnover rate per transporter of 6–13/s at maximal [GABA] (−80 mV, 96 mM NaCl, 22°C) is given both by the kinetics of voltage jump relaxations and by the ratio between the maximal GABA currents and the charge movements. These quantitative data are necessary for evaluating the roles of GAT1 in synaptic function."
https://openalex.org/W1532072084,"A chronic inflammatory disease may be characterized by an accumulation of activated leukocytes at the site of inflammation. Since the chemokine RANTES may play an active role in recruiting leukocytes into inflammatory sites, we investigated the ability of cultured human synovial fibroblasts isolated from patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis to produce this chemokine and compared its regulation to that of the closely related chemokine gene, interleukin-8 (IL-8). In unstimulated synovial fibroblasts, the expression of mRNA for both chemokines was undetectable, but was increased in both a time- and dose-dependent manner upon stimulation with the monokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Preincubation of the cells with cycloheximide superinduced the level of IL-8 mRNA stimulated by TNF alpha and IL-1 beta and RANTES mRNA stimulated by IL-1 beta, but decreased the expression of RANTES mRNA in response to TNF alpha. In addition, differential regulation of these genes was noted when synovial fibroblasts were stimulated with a combination of cytokines. IL-4 down-regulated and IFN gamma enhanced the TNF alpha- and IL-1 beta-induced increase in RANTES mRNA, whereas the induction of IL-8 mRNA by TNF alpha or IL-1 beta was inhibited by IFN gamma and augmented by IL-4. Moreover, a combination of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta synergistically induced IL-8 mRNA expression, whereas under the same conditions, the level of expression of RANTES mRNA was less than that induced by TNF alpha alone. These observations were also reflected at the level of chemokine secretion. These studies demonstrate that by expressing the chemokines RANTES and IL-8, synovial fibroblasts may participate in the ongoing inflammatory process in rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the observation that these chemokine genes are differentially regulated, depending upon the presence of different cytokines, indicates that the type of cellular infiltrate and the progress of the inflammatory disease is likely to depend on the relative levels of stimulatory and inhibitory cytokines."

https://openalex.org/W1992108755,"BASAL transcription by human RNA polymerase II requires the coordinate action of several ancillary factors (TFIIA-J)1 and can be regulated by various promoter-specific DNA binding proteins. An additional class of factors, called coactivators, are dispensable for basal transcription but are indispensable for regulation by transcriptional activators2–4. Biochemical studies established that some coactivators are associated with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form the TFIID complex3–6. We therefore set out to define the relationship between TBP and these TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here we describe the cloning, expression and properties of the first human TAF, hTAFII250. The hTAFII250 gene is identical to a gene, CCG1 (refs 7, 8), implicated in cell-cycle progression. Recombinant hTAFII250 binds directly to TBP both in vitro and in yeast, and participates in the formation of the TFIID complex. This largest TAF may therefore play a central role in TFIID assembly by interacting with both TBP and other TAFs, as well as serving to link the control of transcription to the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1482173390,"We have identified a novel transcription unit of 105 kilobases (called the Golli-mbp gene) that encompasses the mouse myelin basic protein (MBP) gene. Three unique exons within this gene are alternatively spliced into MBP exons and introns to produce a family of MBP gene-related mRNAs that are under individual developmental regulation. These mRNAs are temporally expressed within cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage at progressive stages of differentiation. Thus, the MBP gene is a part of a more complex gene structure, the products of which may play a role in oligodendrocyte differentiation prior to myelination. One Golli-mbp mRNA that encodes a protein antigenically related to MBP is also expressed in the spleen and other non-neural tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2041691970,"To examine the potential of cytoplasmic portions (“tails”) of desmosomal cadherins for assembly of desmosome plaque structures and anchorage of intermediate filaments (IFs), we transfected cultured human A-431 carcinoma cells, abundant in desmosomes and cytokeratin IFs, with constructs encoding chimeric proteins in which the transmembranous region of connexin 32 had been fused with tails of desmocollin (Dsc) or desmoglein (Dsg). The results show that the tail of the long splice form a of Dsc, but not its shorter splice form b, contains sufficient information to recruit desmoplakin and plakoglobin to connexon membrane paracrystals (gap junctions) and to form a novel kind of plaque at which cytokeratin IFs attach. By contrast, chimerase containing a Dsg tail, which accumulated in the plasma membrane, showed a dominant-negative effect: they not only were unable to form gap junction structures and plaques but also led to the disappearance of all endogenous desmosomes and the detachment of IFs from the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1513191136,"Rejoining of DNA single-strand breaks generated by treatment of plasmids with gamma-rays, neocarzinostatin, or bleomycin was catalyzed inefficiently by human cell extracts. The reaction was strongly promoted by the addition of NAD+, which was employed for rapid and transient synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose). The DNA rejoining reaction was accompanied by DNA repair replication, apparently due to replacement of damaged residues at termini. Selective depletion of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase from cell extracts improved the repair of DNA exposed to a variety of DNA-damaging agents by removing the NAD+ dependence of the repair reaction. NAD(+)-promoted DNA repair by soluble cell extracts also occurred with alkylated DNA as substrate and was suppressed by 3-aminobenzamide. A similar stimulatory effect by NAD+ was observed for repair of ultraviolet-irradiated DNA, and this could be ascribed to the presence of pyrimidine hydrates as minor radiation-induced DNA lesions. No effect was observed on the sealing of gamma-irradiated DNA by supplementation of cell extracts with purified mammalian DNA ligase I or DNA ligase II. The results indicate that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase interferes with base excision-repair processes because bound enzyme molecules block DNA strand interruptions. Release of bound poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase following automodification, or physical removal of the protein from reaction mixtures, facilitates DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1672583421,"We describe the genomic structure of the rat TRPM-2 gene. This gene is induced de novo during the regression of the prostate and other hormone-dependent tissues after hormone ablation and plays an important role in apoptosis, or active cell death. TRPM-2 is a single copy gene, organized into nine exons, ranging in size from 47 base pairs (exon I) to 412 base pairs (exon IV), spanning a region of 13,750 base pairs. Comparison with sequences registered in the data bases shows that it has extensive homology to SGP-2, a gene that is expressed constitutively in the testis, although the sequences diverge dramatically in the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA (coded for by exon I in TRPM-2), raising the possibility of alternative exon I usage in SGP-2. Primer extension, S1 nuclease protection, and extensive polymerase chain reaction analysis suggest that the TRPM-2 transcript from the prostate and the SGP-2 transcript from the testis are in fact identical and only contain the exon I sequence identified in the TRPM-2 genomic clone. Analysis of the promoter region of the TRPM-2 gene demonstrates that the putative control region contains several potential regulatory elements that may regulate the complex tissue-specific control of a gene which must be constitutively expressed in some tissues but repressed in others until induced during active cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2034115670,"The olfactory epithelium (OE) is unique in the mammalian nervous system as a site of continual neurogenesis. Though many studies have described this process in vivo and olfactory neurogenesis can be demonstrated in vitro, the specific factors that modulate this process have not been defined. Noting the common ectodermal origin and structural similarity between the OE and epidermis, peptide factors known to modulate epidermal differentiation were tested in OE cultures. Our results demonstrate that EGF acts as a mitogen for the basal cells that give rise to olfactory neurons and that transforming growth factor-beta s (TGF-beta s) promote neurogenesis. Using a neutralizing antibody, we show that it is likely that the endogenous neurogenic factor is TGF-beta 2, or a very closely related factor."

https://openalex.org/W1561949751,"Arrest of the human colonic cell line HT29 at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle resulted in changes in keratin assembly that were coupled with a significant increase in the O-linked glycosylation and serine phosphorylation of keratin polypeptides 8 and 18 (K8/18). With mitotic arrest, enhanced keratin phosphorylation occurred preferentially on K8, whereas K18 showed a higher glycosylation level than K8. Removal of the arresting agent allowed cells to proceed through the cell cycle with a concomitant decrease in K8/18 glycosylation. In contrast, keratins isolated from S phase-enriched cells, obtained after synchronization with aphidicolin, did not show enhanced glycosylation. Tryptic peptide analysis of keratins in G2/M-arrested cells showed changes in the glycopeptide pattern of K8 and in the phosphopeptide patterns of K8 and K18. Labeling of K8/18 immunoprecipitates, isolated from G2/M-arrested cells, with [3H]galactose followed by beta-elimination showed that K8/18 glycosylation consisted of single N-acetylglucosamine residues. Threonine was identified as the site of glycosylation after comparing acid hydrolysis products of beta-eliminated and non-beta-eliminated K8 and K18. Specific cleavage at tryptophan residues indicated that K18 glycosylation and phosphorylation were restricted to the head and proximal rod domains, whereas K8 did not show the same restriction. Our results show a unique association of the single O-linked N-acetylglucosamine type of modification of keratins with mitotic arrest in HT29 cells. There was no reciprocal relationship between K8/18 glycosylation and phosphorylation, and each keratin showed a preferential G2/M cell cycle-associated increase in either serine phosphorylation or threonine glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1539281575,"Insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 60-kDa protein (pp60) in rat adipocytes. After insulin treatment of these cells, pp60, as well as the 160-kDa insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), were found to be associated with the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns-3-kinase) in separate complexes. By contrast, pp60 was not detected in insulin-treated mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which contain abundant IRS-1. PtdIns-3-kinase complex. The pp60.PtdIns 3-kinase complex was located in both the soluble and membrane fractions of the rat adipocytes. Fusion proteins containing the isolated src homology 2 domains from the 85-kDa subunit of PtdIns-3-kinase bound to pp60 in lysates of insulin-treated rat adipocytes. This finding indicates that the most likely mode of association of pp60 with PtdIns-3-kinase is through binding of phosphotyrosine residues in pp60 to these domains. By immunoaffinity chromatography on a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine, pp60 was purified in high percentage yield from insulin-stimulated rat adipocytes, but the low amount of the protein obtained (about 3 ng from the adipocytes of one rat) precluded sequence analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1552034438,"Cell recognition and adhesion were first demonstrated in marine sponges. These phenomena were later shown in Microciona prolifera sponge to be mediated by a Ca(2+)-dependent self-association of adhesion proteoglycans (APs) attached in a species-specific manner to cell-surface receptors. Using the same experimental system we now provide three lines of evidence that highly polyvalent Ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions of a novel AP glycan represent the basis of AP-AP self-binding and thus of cell adhesion. 1) A specific monoclonal antibody which blocks cell aggregation and AP bead adhesion identified a highly repetitive novel carbohydrate epitope (2500 sites) in an acidic glycan of M(r) = 200 x 10(3) (g200) from AP. 2) Reconstitution of the Ca(2+)-dependent self-interaction activity of AP was achieved by cross-linking the purified protein-free g200 glycan into polymers of similar valency as the native AP. 3) Beads coated with the protein-free g200 glycan showed a Ca(2+)-dependent aggregation equivalent to that of AP beads. Carbohydrate and amino acid analyses of the g200 glycan purified by gel electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography yielded six components in the following proportions; 68 fucose, 32 glucuronic acid, 2 mannose, 18 galactose, 19 N-acetylglucosamine, and 1 asparagine residue. These unique chemical features together with immunological and enzymological analyses suggest that the g200 glycan is a large highly fucosylated, acidic, N-linked polysaccharide with a novel structure distinct from that of other known glycosaminoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1542955689,"A cDNA predicted to encode a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor with sequence features characteristic of known fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors was isolated from an expression library constructed from the human mammary epithelial cell line B5/589. This cDNA, designated cl44, encodes a product of 803 amino acid residues and was readily distinguishable from known FGF receptors. During the course of our studies, Partanen et al. (Partanen, J., Makela, T. P., Eerola, E., Korhonen, J., Hirvonen, H., Claesson, W. L., and Alitalo, K. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 1347-1354) isolated a new FGF receptor, designated FGFR4, from the human leukemia cell line, K562. Its amino acid sequence is identical to that of cl44 with the exception of 1 residue. The 5'-untranslated sequences of the two cDNAs diverged far upstream of the initiation codon. A myoblast line, L6E9, which lacks FGF receptors, was utilized to express high levels of FGFR4. We found, in contrast to Partenen et al., who reported only binding of acidic FGF, that FGFR4 bound both acidic and basic FGF with dissociation constants of 10-15 and 120 pM, respectively. No detectable binding of keratinocyte growth factor was observed. In studies aimed to determine whether FGF receptors contribute to the development of human tumors, we screened RNAs prepared from cell lines derived from a variety of solid tumors. High levels of the cl44 transcript were detected in 8 of 14 and 6 of 9 human mammary and kidney carcinomas, respectively, but only infrequently in other types of tumors. In contrast, FGFR1 was found to be frequently expressed in kidney, but not in breast tumor cells, suggesting a possible role for FGFR4 in human mammary cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1609922496,"Transient transfection studies using gonadotrope-derived, alpha T3-1 cells were used to determine the DNA sequences of the mouse glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit gene that mediate the transcriptional response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). The roles of phorbol esters and cyclic AMP in mediating the GnRH response were also investigated. The initial studies demonstrated that a construct containing approximately 500 base pairs of alpha-subunit flanking sequence was sufficient to mediate responses to a GnRH agonist (GnRHa), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and a cAMP analog. Responses to combinations of cAMP and GnRHa or cAMP and PMA were approximately additive, whereas the response to the combination of GnRHa and PMA was similar to that seen with either of the agents alone. Cotransfection studies with an expression vector for the heat-stable inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase demonstrated that GnRHa and PMA responses are not dependent on the cAMP-dependent kinase. Deletion analysis indicated that sequences between -507 and -205 were involved in mediating responses to GnRHa and PMA. To determine if this region alone could support responses to these agents, the -507 to -205 region was linked to a minimal promoter and tested in transient transfections. The results demonstrated that this region supports responses to GnRHa, PMA, and cAMP. Clustered point mutations of this region were used to further characterize sequences involved in the GnRH response. Mutations in two regions, one at positions -406 to -399 and one at positions -337 to -330, resulted in decreased responses to GnRH and PMA. There is no obvious sequence similarity between the two regions that are required for the GnRH response. An enhancer test demonstrated that multimers of the -416 to -385 region were able to function as a GnRH-responsive element when linked to a minimal promoter, although a single copy of this region was not sufficient to permit a response to GnRH. In contrast, multimers of the -344 to -300 region did not permit a response to GnRH, but enhanced basal transcription. These findings are consistent with the identification of a two-component GnRH response unit, which probably involves the functional cooperation of two different transcription factors. The observation that GnRH responsiveness appears to co-localize with PMA responsiveness suggests that GnRH effects on the alpha-subunit transcription are likely mediated by the protein kinase C pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1562857771,"In hair differentiation several families of keratin proteins with distinctive amino acid compositions are produced. To study the role and regulation of one of these families, the glycine/tyrosine-rich keratin-associated proteins encoded by the KAP6 gene family, a partial wool follicle cDNA clone encoding a sheep KAP6 protein was sequenced and the corresponding gene isolated from a sheep cosmid library. The KAP6.1 gene encodes a basic protein of 82 amino acids (M(r) = 8,296) with a combined glycine and tyrosine content of approximately 60 mol%. There are several KAP6 genes in the sheep genome, all located within a 1,050-kilobase SfiI fragment. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that at least one member of the KAP6 family is expressed in the wool follicle. A rabbit KAP6 gene was isolated and its sequence and expression patterns were compared with the sheep gene. The sheep and rabbit genes have a nucleotide sequence identity of 89%, suggesting that they are equivalent genes and indicating strong selection pressure during evolution. Both genes contain several conserved sequence motifs of 7-9 nucleotides in their 5'-flanking regions that may be involved in the regulation of their expression. Localization of KAP6 mRNAs in sheep wool and rabbit hair follicles by in situ hybridization suggests that the genes are expressed in the cells of the hair shaft cortex in varying expression patterns. KAP6 expression starts relatively late in hair follicle differentiation, and the proportion of hair cortical cells that express it may change from follicle to follicle."
https://openalex.org/W1519927919,"The binding of the stem cell factor (SCF) to the c-kit-encoded receptor tyrosine kinase stimulates a variety of biochemical responses that culminate in cellular proliferation, migration, or survival. The extracellular domain of p145kit consists of five immunoglobulin-like domains. To confine the ligand binding site to this portion of the receptor we generated a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the Kit protein and identified two mAbs that efficiently displaced receptor-bound SCF and also inhibited proliferation of SCF-dependent human megakaryocytes. To map the epitopes of these mAbs we constructed and expressed soluble portions of the extracellular domain of Kit, which included either the two amino-terminal Ig-like domains (denoted Kit 1-2), three Ig-like domains (Kit 1-2-3), or the entire extracellular portion (Kit-X). All three recombinant proteins were recognized by the ligand inhibitory mAbs, suggesting that the SCF binding site resides in the amino-terminal half of the ecto-domain. Consistent with this conclusion, all of the soluble proteins inhibited SCF binding to Kit-expressing cells, and they also underwent specific covalent cross-linking to the radiolabeled ligand. However, whereas Kit 1-2-3 and Kit-X displayed comparable ligand affinities, deletion of the third Ig-like domain, in Kit 1-2, involved significant reduction in SCF binding. Hence, the binding site of SCF probably includes Ig-like domains 1 and 2, but structural determinants distal to this portion may also participate in ligand recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1573856597,"The CD20(B1) gene encodes a B cell-specific protein involved in the regulation of human B cell proliferation and differentiation. Studies with 5' deletion CD20 promoter-CAT constructs have previously revealed two regions of the promoter between bases -186 and -280 and between bases -280 and -454 which contained positive regulatory elements. In this study we identified a sequence element present in the most proximal region located between bases -214 and -201, TTCTTCTAATTAA, which is important in the high constitutive expression of CD20 in mature B cells and the induction of CD20 in pre-B cells. This sequence element was referred to as the BAT box and its deletion significantly reduced the activity of a CD20 promoter-CAT construct in B cells. Mobility shift assays with various mutant probes and B cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that the core sequence TAAT was essential for binding to this site. Cross competition experiments with an octamer sequence from the Ig heavy chain promoter, the BAT box, and a TA-rich sequence present in the CD21 promoter revealed that all three sequences bound the same nuclear proteins suggesting that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2. Southwestern blotting and UV cross-linking studies confirmed that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2. The affinity of the BAT box binding proteins for the BAT box was approximately 25-fold less than for the octamer sequence and the BAT box binding proteins dissociated from the BAT box 10-fold more rapidly than from the octamer sequence. Despite this lower affinity, a trimer of the BAT box sequence was as efficiently transactivated by an Oct-2 expression vector as was a trimer of the octamer sequence in HeLa cells. The BAT box and Oct-2 were also implicated in the induction of CD20 in the pre-B cell line, PB-697, via phorbol esters. The induction of CD20 mRNA was temporally associated with induction of Oct-2 mRNA and a BAT box-deleted CD20-CAT construct, in contrast to the wild type, was poorly induced by phorbol esters. Together these results suggest that the BAT box binding proteins are important in the B cell specific expression of CD20 and perhaps CD21."

https://openalex.org/W1519834766,"The thyroid hormone (TH)-inducible expression of some genes has recently been shown to be enhanced by 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) receptor (RXR). This effect appears to be at least partially elicited by the ability of RXR to heterodimerize with TH receptor (THR) and enhance its binding to the cis-acting thyroid hormone responsive elements (TREs) found within those genes. However, whether RXR beta enhances TH/THR-mediated transactivation of all Tre-containing genes, and if RXR has any effect on TH-dependent negative regulation are not known. In the present study, we show that the TH/THR-inducible expression of the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene is not enhanced by RXR beta, despite high affinity binding of the RXR beta.THR alpha heterodimer to the MBP-TRE. We also demonstrate that RXR beta reverses the TH/THR-dependent down-regulation mediated by the negative TRE found within the promoter of the mouse thyroid stimulating hormone gene (TSH). The ligand for RXR beta (9-cis-RA), either alone or in combination with TH, did not enhance the transcription mediated by either the MBP-TRE, TSH-TRE, or the malic enzyme (ME)-TRE. However, the ME-TRE is known to confer RXR beta-dependent enhancement of TH-induced gene expression. Thus, the capacity of RXR beta to modulate TH-dependent transcriptional regulation depends upon the nature of the TRE."
https://openalex.org/W1488625838,"The transcribing ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) requires cellular actin for transcription of viral genome in vitro (De, B. P., Lesoon, A., and Banerjee, A. K. (1991) J. Virol. 65, 3268-3275). In this communication, we have studied the interactions between different molecular forms of actin and the RNP of HPIV-3 to understand the role of actin in mRNA synthesis. We demonstrate that both polymeric and monomeric forms of actin (obtained by DNase I treatment) bind strongly to the RNP at 100 mM KCl concentration (polymerizing buffer). The binding was virtually abolished at zero KCl concentration (depolymerizing buffer). Isolation of the RNP-actin complex and subsequent use in a transcription reaction showed that the bound actin alone was sufficient for mRNA synthesis in vitro. Interestingly, the DNase I-arrested monomeric form of actin failed to activate mRNA synthesis, indicating a requirement of polymerization of the bound actin during HPIV-3 transcription. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that a drastic structural modification of the RNP occurred because of the polymerization of actin from a loosely coiled and irregular structure to a condensed and flexible structure. Activation of transcription was observed also with poly-L-glutamic acid, a highly acidic polypeptide. However, unlike cellular actin, poly-L glutamic acid was able to activate only 10% of the input RNP. These results suggest that cellular actin activates HPIV-3 transcription by polymerizing specifically on the RNP complex. This event results in an alteration of the RNP structure that enhances its suitability for efficient transcription. The acidic domain of actin may play an important role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1501168073,"Abstract Four jacalin cDNA clones (pSKcJA1, pSKcJA3, pSKcJA15, and pSKcJA17) have been obtained from an Artocarpus integrifolia (jackfruit) seed cDNA library. These clones share over 94% sequence homology, and their deduced polypeptide sequences confirm the existence of multiple jacalin isolectins in jackfruit seeds. The deduced amino acid sequences show that jacalin appears to be initially synthesized as a prepropeptide with the following structure: N-signal (21 residues)-->propeptide (39 residues)-->beta-peptide (20 residues)-->linker region (4 residues)-->alpha-peptide (133 residues). These observations are supported by Western blot analysis of jackfruit seed extract and by immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated products of both pSKcJA3 transcript and jackfruit seed poly(A)+ RNA. Sequence analysis of the 39-residue propeptide reveals that it has the potential to facilitate proper folding of jacalin protein. The unusual primary structure of jacalin prepropeptide suggests a quite interesting processing of this lectin precursor into mature alpha- and beta-subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1498328976,"Globular proteins are composed of several modules that are contiguous polypeptide segments of compact conformation. Module boundaries are closely correlated with the intron positions of genes that encode proteins. The modules may thus have a one-to-one correspondence with exons in primordial genes. They may also be vestiges of polypeptide segments that initially appeared as primordial proteins in prebiological evolution. Clarification as to whether modules disconnected from one another have functional potentiality may validate these possibilities. Thus, in this study, each module of a protein was synthesized and assessed for functional potentiality. For this purpose, barnase, a bacterial ribonuclease, was decomposed into six modules (M1-M6), which were examined to determine whether they have an affinity for RNA and RNase activity. M2, M3, and M6, all of which form a shallow but wide cavity for RNA binding in native barnase, were found to bind to RNA and to possess RNase activity. However, M1 and M5, which support the other modules from the back side, and M4 did not bind to RNA and had no RNase activity. Protein modules with catalytic functions are described in this paper for the first time. That some modules of barnase possess catalytic activity indicates that protein modules may possibly have functioned as primitive catalysts in prebiological evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1502462419,"We recently described the molecular cloning of a murine cDNA encoding an endothelial cell surface ligand for the leukocyte adhesion molecule, L Selectin (Lasky, L. A., Singer, M., Dowbenko, D., Ima, Y., Henzel, W., Grimley, C., Gennie, C., Gillett, N., Watson, S., and Rosen, S. D (1992) Cell 69, 927-938). This glycoprotein ligand was found to resemble mucins in that it contained a large percentage of serine and threonine residues that were apparently O-glycosylated. At least one of the O-linked carbohydrates found on this endothelial ligand interacts with the lectin domain of L Selectin. These data suggest that this endothelial ligand is an adhesion molecule that accomplishes cell binding by presenting carbohydrate(s) to the lectin domain of L Selectin, and the name GLYCAM 1 (GLY-cosylation-dependent Cell Adhesion Molecule 1) has been proposed. In this paper we describe the genomic structure and chromosomal localization of this unique Selectin ligand. The gene has been found to be encoded on four separate exons, and it thus differs from the cell surface mucin leukosialin, whose coding region is contained on one exon, but is similar to glycophorin and CD34, other cell surface mucins whose genes are divided into multiple coding exons. While there is some correlation between exon division and protein domain structure, these relationships are not as clear as they are in other genes. The gene encoding GLYCAM 1 was found to map to murine chromosome 15."
https://openalex.org/W1591878785,"The human membrane-associated folate binding protein, or folate receptor (hFR), is a necessary component of folate and methotrexate (MTX) transport in some cell lines. To investigate the role of hFR in acquired MTX resistance in human cells, we characterized nine MTX-resistant clones selected from human nasopharyngeal epidermoid carcinoma (KB) cells (cells which transport folates/anti-folates via the hFR) cultured in media containing low folate concentrations. Compared with wild type KB cells, the level of resistance of the clones ranges from 2- to 80-fold higher and the resistant phenotypes of the clones are characterized as follows. 1) DHFR levels are increased (3-13-fold) in four of nine clones; 2) MTX polyglutamation is not detectably different; 3) the extents of MTX efflux are similar; 4) initial rates of MTX efflux are similar except for two clones which exhibit slightly faster efflux rates (approximately 2-fold); and 5) the Vmax for specific MTX and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate transport are decreased (2-18-fold) in all mutants. The Kt values for MTX transport of each mutant are similar to the Kt of KB cells. These results indicate that all nine MTX-resistant clones exhibit defective MTX transport and that four clones also have increased DHFR levels. Based on folic acid binding assays, the hFR is reduced by 1.8-24-fold in these clones relative to KB cell hFR expression. Western, Northern, and Southern analyses are consistent with decreased hFR expression in these clones rather than mutations, resulting in alterations in the size or ligand binding affinities of the hFR. The decrement in hFR expression correlates closely with the degree of reduction in MTX transport Vmax for each clone. Since folate and MTX influx proceed via hFR in KB cells and in these mutants, the correlation (R2 = 0.90) between hFR expression and the MTX transport Vmax of each clone indicates that hFR expression is an important determinant of acquired MTX resistance in this human tumor cell line. These studies demonstrate that defective transport (manifested by decreased Vmax) resulting from decreased expression of the hFR is frequent in KB cells cultured under these conditions and suggest that modulation of hFR may be relevant to MTX cytotoxicity or resistance in tissues or cells expressing functionally significant levels of hFR."
https://openalex.org/W1628616828,"Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are modular phosphotyrosine binding pockets found within a wide variety of cytoplasmic signaling molecules. Here we develop a new approach to analyzing protein-protein interfaces termed photoaffinity scanning, and apply the method to map regions of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 SH2 domain that participate in phospho-protein binding. Each residue except phosphotyrosine (pY) within a tightly binding, IRS-1-derived phosphopeptide (GNGDpYMPMSPKS) was substituted with the photoactive amino acid, benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa). Whereas most substitutions had little effect on binding affinity, Bpa substitution of either Met (+1 and +3 with respect to pY) reduced affinity 50-100-fold to confirm their importance in the pYMXM recognition motif. In three cases photolysis of SH2 domain/Bpa phosphopeptide complexes led to cross-linking of > 50% of the SH2 domain; cross-link positions were identified by microsequence, amino acid composition, and electrospray mass spectrometric analyses. Bpa-1 cross-links within alpha-helix I, whereas Bpa+1 and Bpa+4 cross-link the SH2 domain within the flexible loop C-terminal to alpha-helix II. Moreover, cross-linking at any position prevents SH2 domain cleavage at a trypsin-sensitive site within the flexible loop between beta-strands 1 and 2. Therefore, at least three distinct SH2 regions in addition to the beta-sheet participate in phosphoprotein binding; the loop cross-linked by phosphopeptide residues C-terminal to pY appears to confer specificity to the phosphoprotein/SH2 domain interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1494732422,"The SH2 region of signal-transducing proteins mediates binding to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. We analyzed the structure-function relationship of the SH2 region of the human CRK protein by using a series of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Seventeen mAbs against the CRK SH2 region were classified into 5 groups according to the reactivity with mutant CRK proteins expressed in COS7 cells and in Escherichia coli and by epitope scanning with synthetic nonapeptides. Two groups of mAbs (groups A and B) were reactive only with intact SH2. Mutation(s) in either the amino-terminal B box or the carboxyl-terminal C box, which are the two subdomains of SH2, abolished the reactivity of the CRK mutants to the mAbs of groups A and B. Group A mAbs competed the binding of the CRK SH2 region to the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. Moreover, the spectrum of the CRK mutants which were recognized by group A mAbs coincided with that of the CRK mutants which could bind phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, suggesting that group A mAbs were directed against the site of binding to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. Group C mAbs, directed against the region between the B and C boxes, were reactive with both wild-type and mutant CRK proteins and did not affect the capacity of SH2 to bind phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. Contrary to group A and B mAbs, mAbs belonging to groups D and E, which were mapped onto the C box, did not bind well to the native CRK proteins, but bound to CRK mutants with mutation(s) in either the B or the C box. These results suggest that the B and C boxes, which are separated by a hinge region, coordinately form the functional SH2 domain that binds to the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and to the group A mAbs."
https://openalex.org/W1560283302,"We have purified a high molecular weight ribonuclease (hmRNase) from human milk by a two-step column chromatographic procedure and characterized the enzyme. The molecular mass of hmRNase is 80 kDa as determined from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pH optimum of the enzyme is in the range of 7.5-8.0, similar to other secretory RNases. hmRNase is pyrimidine-specific and cleaves the phosphodiester bond 3' to a pyrimidine residue. It selectively degrades the pyrimidine strand in poly(rA):poly(rU) and poly(dA):poly(rU) double stranded substrates. The extent of degradation for naturally occurring RNAs vary in the order tRNA < rRNA < mRNA at low enzyme concentrations. hmRNase shows allosteric behavior with positive cooperativity in its reaction on polynucleotide substrates. The activity of the enzyme is enhanced in the presence of monoribonucleotides. Antiserum obtained against purified hmRNase did not cross-react with low molecular weight RNase which is also present in milk. In addition, an immunologically cross-reacting species could not be detected in the serum, suggesting the origin of hmRNase in the mammary gland but not blood."
https://openalex.org/W1486597752,"Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin resulted in activation of 2-deoxyglucose transport activity and translocation of glucose transporters (GLUT4 and GLUT1) from the cytoplasmic space to the plasma membrane. ML-9 (a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor) inhibited insulin stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose transport activity by 80% at 100 microM (IC50 = 27 microM) without affecting 2-deoxyglucose transport activity in the basal state. The inhibition was independent of extracellular Ca2+ concentration and almost fully reversible at 40 microM ML-9. ML-9 did not inhibit insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of 95-kDa protein in the wheat germ agglutinin-purified preparation and of 95- and 160-kDa proteins in intact cells. However, ML-9 inhibited insulin-induced translocation of both GLUT4 and GLUT1 in a dose-dependent manner. The dose-response curves were similar to those observed for the inhibition of insulin stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose transport activity. Neither insulin nor ML-9 affected the phosphorylation state of both heavy and light chains of myosin. Therefore, it seems likely that ML-9 inhibits the insulin-induced translocation of glucose transporters at a step beyond the insulin receptor kinase activity by a mechanism different from that affecting phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. Phosphorylating activity of microtubule-associated protein 2 and myelin basic protein was stimulated by insulin, and this stimulation was not affected by ML-9. ML-9, however, inhibited the phosphorylating activity in vitro and insulin stimulation of the phosphorylating activity of ribosomal protein S6 in intact cells in a dose-dependent manner similar to that observed for the inhibition of insulin stimulation of glucose transport. These results suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinase may be one of the constituents in intracellular insulin signaling to the glucose transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1602214435,"Nucleotides in tRNAs that are conserved among isoacceptors are typically considered as candidates for tRNA synthetase recognition, with less importance attached to non-conserved nucleotides. Although the anticodon is an important contributor to the identity of methionine tRNAs, the class I methionine tRNA synthetase aminoacylates microhelices with high specificity. The microhelix substrates are comprised of as few as the 1st 4 base pairs of the acceptor stems of the elongator and initiator methionine tRNAs. For these two tRNAs, only the central 2:71 and 3:70 base pairs are common to the 1st 4 acceptor stem base pairs. We show here that, although the flanking 4:69 base pair is not conserved, a particular substitution at this position substantially reduces the gel electrophoresis-detected aminoacylation of an acceptor stem substrate that has the conserved 2:71 and 3:70 base pairs. Although the two methionine tRNAs have either U:A or G:C at position 4:69, substitution with C:G reduces charging of 9- or 4-base pair substrates that recreate part or all of the acceptor stem of a methionine tRNA. This effect is sufficient for methionine tRNA synthetase to discriminate between the closely related methionine and isoleucine tRNA acceptor stems. The ability to distinguish G:C and U:A from C:G is contrary to a simple scheme for recognition of atoms in the RNA minor groove."
https://openalex.org/W1554071986,"Monoclonal antibodies were raised against purified bovine and human brain G-proteins. The epitopes recognized by three monoclonal antibodies (MONO, 3C2, and 3E7) were mapped by expressing defined parts of the bovine G(o) alpha-cDNA in bacteria, followed by immunoblotting. All three antibodies recognize the recombinant bovine alpha o-protein, but at distinct sites. The epitopes of MONO and 3C2 were mapped between alpha o amino acids 80 and 145, and both antibodies recognize alpha o exclusively. Heterotrimeric G(o)-proteins as well as guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-liganded free alpha o-subunits are readily immunoprecipitated by these monoclonal antibodies. Binding of MONO or 3C2 does not affect ADP-ribosylation of the alpha o-subunit by pertussis toxin. Apparently, the antibodies do not bind to or induce large conformational changes in regions of the alpha o-subunit that are involved in association with beta gamma-subunits or ADP-ribosylation. 3E7 behaves as an anti common alpha-subunit antibody when used in immunoblots. However, under nondenaturing conditions, 3E7 recognizes alpha o exclusively. After binding of 3E7, the pertussis toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation of alpha o is effectively blocked, while the ADP-ribosylation of the various alpha i-subunits is not affected. The epitope of 3E7 was mapped between alpha o amino acids 13-88, a region which has been implicated in the interaction between alpha- and beta gamma-subunits. Possibly, the inhibitory effect of 3E7 on ADP-ribosylation of G(o) is secondary to the loss of beta gamma-subunits that is observed upon binding of 3E7."
