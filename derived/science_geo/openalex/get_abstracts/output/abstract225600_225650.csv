https://openalex.org/W2025496599,"CORTISONE acetate (IIb) has so far only been synthesized1 from bile acids which possess the ‘normal’ configuration at C-5 (rings A/B cis). Since the potentially most abundant sources, such as the steroidal sapogenins, belong to the allo series (rings A\B trans) or are readily convertible to the latter, it is important to accomplish the transformation of an allosteroid to cortisone. We have recently described2 a method for the conversion of 3-keto-allosteroids into δ4-3-ketones, which involved dibromination to a 2,4-dibromo derivative, treatment of the latter with sodium iodide in acetone solution to yield a 2-iodo-δ4-3-ketone and subsequent deiodination with chromous chloride, collidine or zinc. This procedure was applied successfully in the androstane, etioallocholanic acid and allopregnane series. The usefulness of this method for the important 17,21-dihydroxy-20-keto steroids remained to be demonstrated."

https://openalex.org/W2043564226,"ANDRADE1 developed a theory of viscosity of liquids based on a model in which the molecules are regarded as executing vibrations essentially similar to those characteristic of the solid state, the chief difference between the solid and the liquid states being that in the latter the amplitudes of the vibrations are so large that molecules make collisions (resulting in ‘temporary unions’) with neighbours at every extreme displacement. His viscosity equation is where η is the viscosity of the liquid, m the mass of a molecule in the liquid, ν its vibration frequency, and σ the average distance between the centres of the molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2006168047,"IT has long been known that small round corpuscles may be found around the blood vessels of the central nervous system in subjects of advanced age. As the staining properties of these bodies are similar to those of starch, Virchow called them corpora amylacea. Several authors have examined them in attempts to determine their origin, but without definite result. The present contribution describes an attempt to define the morphology and some of the chemical properties of corpora amylacea, using the polarizing microscope as well as the periodic acid–leucofuchsin method1."
https://openalex.org/W2055835988,"THE well-known antiseptic properties of 8-hydroxyquinoline, and particularly experiments on the use of this compound as an antitubercular agent1, led one of us (T. U.) to prepare a few derivatives of 8-hydroxyquinoline, in order to examine their activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis."

https://openalex.org/W2020153482,"IT has been shown that coumarin derivatives are particularly active as inhibitors of germination and root-growth1–3, and it has been suggested4 that this action is at least partially due to the unsaturated lactone ring. Since other compounds, hexenolactone5,6 and protoanemonin7, containing this unsaturated lactone ring have clearly exhibited some influence on the growth of plants, it seemed interesting to test the simplest compounds having this structure. As an approach to this simple ring, several tetronic acid derivatives were selected which have been synthesized by J. Lecocq8, to whom we are indebted for the supply of the samples tested."
https://openalex.org/W1985307143,"IT is our duty, we believe, to direct the attention of research chemists to a tragic accident which should stand as a warning to all users of N-halogenimides. Our collaborator and friend, Dr. H. De Graef, who was a man of great experience and skill, was carrying out the chlorination of xylene by means of 1,3-di-chloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, when a violent explosion occurred. Wounded and badly burned, De Graef survived only three days."
https://openalex.org/W1986833455,"THE question of the mechanism of the iron (III) ion catalysed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide has been discussed in two recent communications1. The formation of free radicals initiating the polymerization of monomers during reaction between iron (II) ion and hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated by Baxendale, Evans and Park2, and the mechanism of the reaction of iron (II) ion and iron (III) ion with hydrogen peroxide has been discussed by Barb, Baxendale, George and Hargrave3."

https://openalex.org/W2052035229,"IN recent studies we were concerned with the detection of traces of nor-adrenaline in preparations of adrenaline derived from natural sources. Colorimetric methods1,2 proved to be of limited value with low concentrations of nor-adrenaline; but excellent results were obtained with paper chromatography, using modifications of the methods described by James and others3,4. The adrenaline samples are dissolved in methanol containing a minimum quantity of hydrochloric acid, and then transferred to paper strips for descending chromatography, or to circular disks of filter paper for chromatography by Rutter's technique5. Water-saturated phenol is used as the developing solvent in an atmosphere of hydrochloric acid4. The paper chromatograms are then dried and sprayed with an appropriate colour reagent."

https://openalex.org/W2094608923,"THE nitrifying bacteria, like the sulphur microorganisms, have been studied almost entirely from a physiological aspect. With the exception of Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, the descriptions of the various genera have been copied from those given by the original investigators1. This has led to the description of nitrifying genera with the morphological characters of Myxobacteria, with which the cultures were, apparently, contaminated."

https://openalex.org/W2029743746,"A STRAIN of abortion virus, isolated by us from a local case of sheep abortion in March 1950 and apparently similar to the virus isolated by Stamp, McEwen, Watt and Nisbet1, has been extensively used in an in ovo ‘screening test’. It has proved so satisfactory for this purpose that it is felt its usefulness should be more generally known. The virus in infected membranes remains viable indefinitely at − 20° and for some weeks at 0°, and regularly produces well-defined lesions on the chorioallantoic membrane; in both these respects it is superior to many other large viruses. So far as is known, it is not pathogenic to man."

https://openalex.org/W4240406549,"IN a recent communication1,2, we described experiments in which bromine migrated towards the cathode from acid HOBr solution across paper-collodion membranes. We interpreted this migration as evidence of ‘positive bromine ions’ (Br+ or H2BrO+ ions) that were present in these acid solutions. Further experiments revealed, however, that there was a considerable electro-endosmosis across the membranes in the direction of the cathode, and it became necessary to reconsider our results."

https://openalex.org/W2048472395,"IN a recent paper1, A. C. Walker has given tables and curves for the solubility–temperature relationship in the system ethylenediamine D-tartrate (anhyd.)–ethylenediamine D-tartrate monohydrate–water. Dr. Walker shows that the salt decomposes slowly in solution, and the consequent change of composition of the solute during the time taken by the solubility determinations introduces some uncertainty in the results. Usually, when preparing a solubility curve, a considerable time must be allowed, at each observed temperature, for equilibrium between solution and solute to be attained. The change of composition of the solute during the experiments is probably responsible for the difference in level, of the order of 1° C., in two of the published curves."
