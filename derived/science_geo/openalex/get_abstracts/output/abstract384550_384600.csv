https://openalex.org/W2085544302,"Mutation of the breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA2, leads to breast and ovarian cancers. Mechanistic insight into the functions of human BRCA2 has been limited by the difficulty of isolating this large protein (3,418 amino acids). Here we report the purification of full-length BRCA2 and show that it both binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). BRCA2 acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51–ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. BRCA2 does not anneal ssDNA complexed with RPA, implying it does not directly function in repair processes that involve ssDNA annealing. Our findings show that BRCA2 is a key mediator of homologous recombination, and they provide a molecular basis for understanding how this DNA repair process is disrupted by BRCA2 mutations, which lead to chromosomal instability and cancer. The two hereditary breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, have roles in responding to DNA damage. When they are mutated or absent, the outcome is genomic instability, a contributory factor to cancer development. Studies on BRCA2 have been hampered by its large size, which made purification of the full-length protein challenging. Steve Kowalczykowski and colleagues now report the first in vitro characterization of full-length BRCA2, and delineate the different ways by which BRCA2 facilitates RAD51-mediated homologous recombination.

https://openalex.org/W2121423419,"Despite abundant expression of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) in brain, the regulation and behavioral role of DNA methylation remain poorly understood. We found that Dnmt3a expression was regulated in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) by chronic cocaine use and chronic social defeat stress. Moreover, NAc-specific manipulations that block DNA methylation potentiated cocaine reward and exerted antidepressant-like effects, whereas NAc-specific Dnmt3a overexpression attenuated cocaine reward and was pro-depressant. On a cellular level, we found that chronic cocaine use selectively increased thin dendritic spines on NAc neurons and that DNA methylation was both necessary and sufficient to mediate these effects. These data establish the importance of Dnmt3a in the NAc in regulating cellular and behavioral plasticity to emotional stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2163953252,"Scholsburg and colleagues show that prolonged inactivation of monoacylglycerol lipase, the principal degradative enzyme for the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, antagonizes the brain endocannabinoid system. This is manifested as tolerance, impaired plasticity and receptor desensitization; these effects are similar to the effects of prolonged exposure to drugs of abuse. Prolonged exposure to drugs of abuse, such as cannabinoids and opioids, leads to pharmacological tolerance and receptor desensitization in the nervous system. We found that a similar form of functional antagonism was produced by sustained inactivation of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the principal degradative enzyme for the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol. After repeated administration, the MAGL inhibitor JZL184 lost its analgesic activity and produced cross-tolerance to cannabinoid receptor (CB1) agonists in mice, effects that were phenocopied by genetic disruption of Mgll (encoding MAGL). Chronic MAGL blockade also caused physical dependence, impaired endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity and desensitized brain CB1 receptors. These data contrast with blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase, an enzyme that degrades the other major endocannabinoid anandamide, which produced sustained analgesia without impairing CB1 receptors. Thus, individual endocannabinoids generate distinct analgesic profiles that are either sustained or transitory and associated with agonism and functional antagonism of the brain cannabinoid system, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2000766568,"The development of the human cerebral cortex is an orchestrated process involving the generation of neural progenitors in the periventricular germinal zones, cell proliferation characterized by symmetric and asymmetric mitoses, followed by migration of post-mitotic neurons to their final destinations in six highly ordered, functionally specialized layers. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding these intricate processes is in its infancy, substantially driven by the discovery of rare mutations that cause malformations of cortical development. Mapping of disease loci in putative Mendelian forms of malformations of cortical development has been hindered by marked locus heterogeneity, small kindred sizes and diagnostic classifications that may not reflect molecular pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate the use of whole-exome sequencing to overcome these obstacles by identifying recessive mutations in WD repeat domain 62 (WDR62) as the cause of a wide spectrum of severe cerebral cortical malformations including microcephaly, pachygyria with cortical thickening as well as hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Some patients with mutations in WDR62 had evidence of additional abnormalities including lissencephaly, schizencephaly, polymicrogyria and, in one instance, cerebellar hypoplasia, all traits traditionally regarded as distinct entities. In mice and humans, WDR62 transcripts and protein are enriched in neural progenitors within the ventricular and subventricular zones. Expression of WDR62 in the neocortex is transient, spanning the period of embryonic neurogenesis. Unlike other known microcephaly genes, WDR62 does not apparently associate with centrosomes and is predominantly nuclear in localization. These findings unify previously disparate aspects of cerebral cortical development and highlight the use of whole-exome sequencing to identify disease loci in settings in which traditional methods have proved challenging."
https://openalex.org/W1975600230,"Christian Abnet and colleagues report genome-wide association studies for gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in a Chinese population. They identified a new shared risk locus in the PLCE1 gene at 10q23. We conducted a genome-wide association study of gastric cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in ethnic Chinese subjects in which we genotyped 551,152 SNPs. We report a combined analysis of 2,240 gastric cancer cases, 2,115 ESCC cases and 3,302 controls drawn from five studies. In logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex and study, multiple variants at 10q23 had genome-wide significance for gastric cancer and ESCC independently. A notable signal was rs2274223, a nonsynonymous SNP located in PLCE1, for gastric cancer (P = 8.40 × 10−9; per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.31) and ESCC (P = 3.85 × 10−9; OR = 1.34). The association with gastric cancer differed by anatomic subsite. For tumors in the cardia the association was stronger (P = 4.19 × 10−15; OR = 1.57), and for those in the noncardia stomach it was absent (P = 0.44; OR = 1.05). Our findings at 10q23 could provide insight into the high incidence of both cancers in China."
https://openalex.org/W2120381562,"Castor bean (Ricinus communis) is an oilseed crop that belongs to the spurge (Euphorbiaceae) family, which comprises approximately 6,300 species that include cassava (Manihot esculenta), rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) and physic nut (Jatropha curcas). It is primarily of economic interest as a source of castor oil, used for the production of high-quality lubricants because of its high proportion of the unusual fatty acid ricinoleic acid. However, castor bean genomics is also relevant to biosecurity as the seeds contain high levels of ricin, a highly toxic, ribosome-inactivating protein. Here we report the draft genome sequence of castor bean (4.6-fold coverage), the first for a member of the Euphorbiaceae. Whereas most of the key genes involved in oil synthesis and turnover are single copy, the number of members of the ricin gene family is larger than previously thought. Comparative genomics analysis suggests the presence of an ancient hexaploidization event that is conserved across the dicotyledonous lineage."

https://openalex.org/W2078507463,"Maintaining the chemical identity of DNA depends on ribonucleotide exclusion by DNA polymerases. However, ribonucleotide exclusion during DNA synthesis in vitro is imperfect. To determine whether ribonucleotides are incorporated during DNA replication in vivo, we substituted leucine or glycine for an active-site methionine in yeast DNA polymerase ϵ (Pol ϵ). Ribonucleotide incorporation in vitro was three-fold lower for M644L and 11-fold higher for M644G Pol ϵ compared to wild-type Pol ϵ. This hierarchy was recapitulated in vivo in yeast strains lacking RNase H2. Moreover, the pol2-M644G rnh201Δ strain progressed more slowly through S phase, had elevated dNTP pools and generated 2-5-base-pair deletions in repetitive sequences at a high rate and in a gene orientation-dependent manner. The data indicate that ribonucleotides are incorporated during replication in vivo, that they are removed by RNase H2-dependent repair and that defective repair results in replicative stress and genome instability via DNA strand misalignment."
https://openalex.org/W2059514738,Leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) mutations are a common cause of Parkinson's disease. Here we identify inhibitors of LRRK2 kinase that are protective in in vitro and in vivo models of LRRK2-induced neurodegeneration. These results establish that LRRK2-induced degeneration of neurons in vivo is kinase dependent and that LRRK2 kinase inhibition provides a potential new neuroprotective paradigm for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
https://openalex.org/W2129237942,The authors report that the immediate-early gene Narp accumulates at excitatory synapses on parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Narp recruits AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses to rebalance network excitation and inhibition dynamics. Homeostatic synaptic scaling alters the strength of synapses to compensate for prolonged changes in network activity and involves both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The immediate-early gene Narp (neuronal activity–regulated pentraxin) encodes a secreted synaptic protein that can bind to and induce clustering of AMPA receptors (AMPARs). We found that Narp prominently accumulated at excitatory synapses on parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs). Increasing network activity resulted in a homeostatic increase of excitatory synaptic strength onto PV-INs that increased inhibitory drive and this response was absent in neurons cultured from Narp−/− mice. Activity-dependent changes in the strength of excitatory inputs on PV-INs in acute hippocampal slices were also dependent on Narp and Narp−/− mice had increased sensitivity to kindling-induced seizures. We propose that Narp recruits AMPARs at excitatory synapses onto PV-INs to rebalance network excitation/inhibition dynamics following episodes of increased circuit activity.

https://openalex.org/W1993698875,"How acentrosomal meiotic spindles separate chromosomes in anaphase has been unclear. Although kinetochores are required for the bi-orientation of chromosomes, chromosome separation may instead be driven by CLASP/CLS-2 mediated microtubule assembly. Although assembly of acentrosomal meiotic spindles has been extensively studied1, little is known about the segregation of chromosomes on these spindles. Here, we show in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes that the kinetochore protein, KNL-1, directs assembly of meiotic kinetochores that orient chromosomes. However, in contrast to mitosis, chromosome separation during meiotic anaphase is kinetochore-independent. Before anaphase, meiotic kinetochores and spindle poles disassemble along with the microtubules on the poleward side of chromosomes. During anaphase, microtubules then form between the separating chromosomes. Functional analysis implicated a set of proteins that localize to a ring-shaped domain between kinetochores during pre-anaphase spindle assembly and anaphase separation. These proteins are localized by the chromosomal passenger complex, which regulates the loss of meiotic chromosome cohesion2,3,4. Thus, meiotic segregation in C. elegans is a two-stage process, where kinetochores orient chromosomes, but are then dispensable for their separation. We suggest that separation is controlled by a meiosis-specific chromosomal domain to coordinate cohesin removal and chromosome segregation."

https://openalex.org/W2047117908,"Previously, we reported that Akt inactivation determines the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to bortezomib. In this study, we report that cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A), a cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), mediates the apoptotic effect of bortezomib in HCC. Silencing PP2A by small interference RNA (siRNA) abolishes bortezomib-induced down-regulation of phospho-Akt and apoptosis. Bortezomib increases PP2A activity in sensitive HCC cells, including Sk-Hep1, Hep3B and Huh-7, but not in resistant PLC5 cells. Bortezomib down-regulates CIP2A in a dose- and time-dependent manner in all sensitive HCC cells, whereas no alterations in CIP2A were found in resistant PLC5 cells. Knockdown of CIP2A by siRNA restored bortezomib’s effects on apoptosis and PP2A activity in PLC5 cells. Moreover, over-expression of CIP2A up-regulated phospho-Akt and protected Sk-Hep1 cells from bortezomib-induced apoptosis. It is significant that, ectopic expression of CIP2A decreased Akt-related PP2A activity, whereas silencing CIP2A increased this activity, indicating that CIP2A negatively regulates Akt-related PP2A activity in HCC cells, furthermore, our in vivo data showed that bortezomib down-regulates CIP2A and up-regulates PP2A activity in Huh-7 tumors, but not in PLC5 tumors. In conclusion, inhibition of CIP2A determines the effects of bortezomib on apoptosis and PP2A-dependent Akt inactivation in HCC."

Interrogation of the specificity of heparan sulfate-mediated activities demands a library of structurally defined oligosaccharides. Chemical synthesis of large heparan sulfate oligosaccharides remains challenging. We report the synthesis of oligosaccharides with different sulfation patterns and sizes from a disaccharide building block using glycosyltransferases, heparan sulfate C(5)-epimerase, and sulfotransferases. This method offers a generic approach to prepare heparan sulfate oligosaccharides possessing predictable structures."
https://openalex.org/W2041479617,"Cell-free reconstitution of membrane traffic reactions and the morphological characterization of membrane intermediates that accumulate under these conditions have helped to elucidate the physical and molecular mechanisms involved in membrane transport. To gain a better understanding of endocytosis, we have reconstituted vesicle budding and fission from isolated plasma membrane sheets and imaged these events. Electron and fluorescence microscopy, including subdiffraction-limit imaging by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), revealed F-BAR (FBP17) domain coated tubules nucleated by clathrin-coated buds when fission was blocked by GTPgammaS. Triggering fission by replacing GTPgammaS with GTP led not only to separation of clathrin-coated buds, but also to vesicle formation by fragmentation of the tubules. These results suggest a functional link between FBP17-dependent membrane tubulation and clathrin-dependent budding. They also show that clathrin spatially directs plasma membrane invaginations that lead to the generation of endocytic vesicles larger than those enclosed by the coat."
https://openalex.org/W2080778259,"Sperm competition is expected to favour the evolution of traits that influence the performance of sperm when they compete to fertilize a female's eggs. While there is considerable evidence that selection favours increases in sperm numbers, much less is known about how sperm quality contributes towards competitive fertilization success. Here, we determine whether variation in sperm quality influences competitive fertilization success in the green swordtail Xiphophorus helleri, a highly promiscuous livebearing fish. We use artificial insemination as a method of controlled sperm delivery and show that sperm swimming velocity is the primary determinant of fertilization success when ejaculates from two males compete to fertilize a female's eggs. By contrast, we found no evidence that sperm length had any effect on siring success. We also found no evidence that pre- and postcopulatory sexual traits were phenotypically integrated in this species, suggesting that the previous observation that reproductive skew favours males with high mating rates is unlikely to be due to any direct association between sperm quality and male sexual ornamentation."
https://openalex.org/W2023972288,"Structure-specific flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is known to interact with multiple nuclear proteins involved in DNA metabolism. Arginine methylation in FEN1 blocks phosphorylation of a nearby serine and enhances FEN1 binding to PCNA, which serves to channel FEN1 toward DNA replication and repair pathways. Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a structure-specific endo- and exonuclease, has multiple functions that determine essential biological processes, such as cell proliferation and cell death. As such, the enzyme must be precisely regulated to execute each of its functions with the right timing and in a specific subcellular location. Here we report that FEN1 is methylated at arginine residues, primarily at Arg192. The methylation suppresses FEN1 phosphorylation at Ser187. The methylated form, but not the phosphorylated form, of FEN1 strongly interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), ensuring the 'on' and 'off' timing of its reaction. Mutations of FEN1 disrupting arginine methylation and PCNA interaction result in unscheduled phosphorylation and a failure to localize to DNA replication or repair foci. This consequently leads to a defect in Okazaki fragment maturation, a delay in cell cycle progression, impairment of DNA repair and a high frequency of genome-wide mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2150168938,"Keratin 8 and 18 protect hepatocytes from apoptosis. Inhibiting keratin 18 glycosylation is shown to sensitize cells to liver and pancreatic injury and apoptosis, through a pathway involving Akt and PKCθ. Keratins 8 and 18 (K8 and K18) are heteropolymeric intermediate filament phosphoglycoproteins of simple-type epithelia. Mutations in K8 and K18 predispose the affected individual to liver disease as they protect hepatocytes from apoptosis. K18 undergoes dynamic O-linked N-acetylglucosamine glycosylation at Ser 30, 31 and 49. We investigated the function of K18 glycosylation by generating mice that overexpress human K18 S30/31/49A substitution mutants that cannot be glycosylated (K18–Gly−), and compared the susceptibility of these mice to injury with wild-type and other keratin-mutant mice. K18–Gly− mice are more susceptible to liver and pancreatic injury and apoptosis induced by streptozotocin or to liver injury by combined N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase inhibition and Fas administration. The enhanced apoptosis in the livers of mice that express K18–Gly− involves the inactivation of Akt1 and protein kinase Cθ as a result of their site-specific hypophosphorylation. Akt1 binds to K8, which probably contributes to the reciprocal hyperglycosylation and hypophosphorylation of Akt1 that occurs on K18 hypoglycosylation, and leads to decreased Akt1 kinase activity. Therefore, K18 glycosylation provides a unique protective role in epithelial injury by promoting the phosphorylation and activation of cell-survival kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2017457530,"Background Recent reviews suggest common infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of death among preschool children in developing countries. Identification of feasible strategies to combat this disease burden is an important public health need. We evaluated the efficacy of adding prebiotic oligosaccharide and probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 to milk, in preventing diarrhea, respiratory infections and severe illnesses, in children aged 1–4 years as part of a four group study design, running two studies simultaneously. Methods and Findings In a community based double-masked, randomized controlled trial, children 1–3 years of age, willing to participate, were randomly allocated to receive either control milk (Co; n = 312) or the same milk fortified with 2.4 g/day of prebiotic oligosaccharide and 1.9×107 colony forming unit (c.f.u)/day of probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 (PP; n = 312). Children were followed up for 1 year providing data for 1–4 years. Biweekly household surveillance was conducted to gather information on compliance and morbidity. Both study groups were comparable at baseline; compliance to intervention was similar. Overall, there was no effect of prebiotic and probiotic on diarrhea (6% reduction, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: −1 to 12%; p = 0.08). Incidence of dysentery episodes was reduced by 21% (95% CI: 0 to 38%; p = 0.05). Incidence of pneumonia was reduced by 24% (95% CI: 0 to 42%; p = 0.05) and severe acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) by 35% (95% CI: 0 to 58%; p = 0.05). Compared to children in Co group, children in PP group had 16% (95% CI: 5 to 26%, p = 0.004) and 5% (95% CI: 0 to 10%; p = 0.05) reduction in days with severe illness and high fever respectively. Conclusions/Significance Milk can be a good medium for delivery of prebiotic and probiotic and resulted in significant reduction of dysentery, respiratory morbidity and febrile illness. Overall, impact of diarrhea was not significant. These findings need confirmation in other settings. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00255385"
https://openalex.org/W2056193687,"There is a complex relationship between the evolution of segmental duplications and rearrangements associated with human disease. We performed a detailed analysis of one region on chromosome 16p12.1 associated with neurocognitive disease and identified one of the largest structural inconsistencies in the human reference assembly. Various genomic analyses show that all examined humans are homozygously inverted relative to the reference genome for a 1.1-Mb region on 16p12.1. We determined that this assembly discrepancy stems from two common structural configurations with worldwide frequencies of 17.6% (S1) and 82.4% (S2). This polymorphism arose from the rapid integration of segmental duplications, precipitating two local inversions within the human lineage over the last 10 million years. The two human haplotypes differ by 333 kb of additional duplicated sequence present in S2 but not in S1. Notably, we show that the S2 configuration harbors directly oriented duplications, specifically predisposing this chromosome to disease-associated rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W2007694404,"Multiple micronutrient deficiencies are highly prevalent among preschool children and often lead to anemia and growth faltering. Given the limited success of supplementation and health education programs, fortification of foods could be a viable and sustainable option. We report results from a community based double-masked, randomized trial among children 1-4 years evaluating the effects of micronutrients (especially of zinc and iron) delivered through fortified milk on growth, anemia and iron status markers as part of a four group study design, running two studies simultaneously.Enrolled children (n = 633) were randomly allocated to receive either micronutrients fortified milk (MN = 316) or control milk (Co = 317). Intervention of MN milk provided additional 7.8 mg zinc, 9.6 mg iron, 4.2 microg selenium, 0.27 mg copper, 156 microg vitamin A, 40.2 mg vitamin C, and 7.5 mg vitamin E per day (three serves) for one year. Anthropometry was recorded at baseline, mid- and end-study. Hematological parameters were estimated at baseline and end-study. Both groups were comparable at baseline. Compliance was over 85% and did not vary between groups. Compared to children consuming Co milk, children consuming MN milk showed significant improvement in weight gain (difference of mean: 0.21 kg/year; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12 to 0.31, p<0.001) and height gain (difference of mean: 0.51 cm/year; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75, p<0.001). Mean hemoglobin (Hb) (difference of 13.6 g/L; 95% CI 11.1 to 16.0, p<0.001) and serum ferritin levels (difference of 7.9 microg/L; 95% CI 5.4 to 10.5, p<0.001) also improved. Children in MN group had 88% (odds ratio = 0.12, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.20, p<0.001) lower risk of iron deficiency anemia.Milk provides an acceptable and effective vehicle for delivery of specific micronutrients, especially zinc and iron. Micronutrient bundle improved growth and iron status and reduced anemia in children 1-4 years old."
https://openalex.org/W2007792880,"There is no effective treatment for cocaine addiction despite extensive knowledge of the neurobiology of drug addiction. Here we show that a selective aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH-2) inhibitor, ALDH2i, suppresses cocaine self-administration in rats and prevents cocaine- or cue-induced reinstatement in a rat model of cocaine relapse-like behavior. We also identify a molecular mechanism by which ALDH-2 inhibition reduces cocaine-seeking behavior: increases in tetrahydropapaveroline (THP) formation due to inhibition of ALDH-2 decrease cocaine-stimulated dopamine production and release in vitro and in vivo. Cocaine increases extracellular dopamine concentration, which activates dopamine D2 autoreceptors to stimulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) in primary ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. PKA and PKC phosphorylate and activate tyrosine hydroxylase, further increasing dopamine synthesis in a positive-feedback loop. Monoamine oxidase converts dopamine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), a substrate for ALDH-2. Inhibition of ALDH-2 enables DOPAL to condense with dopamine to form THP in VTA neurons. THP selectively inhibits phosphorylated (activated) tyrosine hydroxylase to reduce dopamine production via negative-feedback signaling. Reducing cocaine- and craving-associated increases in dopamine release seems to account for the effectiveness of ALDH2i in suppressing cocaine-seeking behavior. Selective inhibition of ALDH-2 may have therapeutic potential for treating human cocaine addiction and preventing relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2004407173,"Overexpression of the Yes-associated protein (YAP), and TP53 family members ΔNp63 and p73, have been independently detected in subsets of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). YAP may serve as a nuclear cofactor with ΔNp63 and p73, but the functional role of YAP and their potential relationship in HNSCCs are unknown. In this study, we show that in a subset of HNSCC lines and tumors, YAP expression is increased but localized in the cytoplasm in association with increased AKT and YAP phosphorylation, and with decreased expression of ΔNp63 and p73. In another subset, YAP expression is decreased but detectable in the nucleus in association with lower AKT and YAP phosphorylation, and with increased ΔNp63 and p73 expression. Inhibiting AKT decreased serine-127 phosphorylation and enhanced nuclear translocation of YAP. ΔNp63 bound to the YAP promoter and suppressed its expression. Transfection of a YAP-serine-127-alanine phosphoacceptor-site mutant or ΔNp63 knockdown significantly increased nuclear YAP and cell death. Conversely, YAP knockdown enhanced cell proliferation, survival, migration and cisplatin chemoresistance. Thus, YAP function as a tumor suppressor may alternatively be dysregulated by AKT phosphorylation at serine-127 and cytoplasmic sequestration, or by transcriptional repression by ΔNp63, in different subsets of HNSCC. AKT and/or ΔNp63 are potential targets for enhancing YAP-mediated apoptosis and chemosensitivity in HNSCCs."

https://openalex.org/W2148858609,"Tenascin-C (TNC) is highly expressed in melanoma; however, little is known about its functions. Recent studies indicate that TNC has a role within the stem cell niche. We hypothesized that TNC creates a specific environment for melanoma cells to show a stem cell-like phenotype, promoting tumor growth and evading conventional therapies. TNC expression was strongly upregulated in melanoma cells grown as 3D spheres (enriched for stem-like cells) when compared to adherent cells. Downmodulation of TNC by shRNA lentiviruses significantly decreased the growth of melanoma spheres. The incidence of pulmonary metastases after intravenous injection of TNC knockdown cells was significantly lower in NOD/SCID IL2Rγnull mice compared with control cells. Melanoma spheres contain an increased number of side population (SP) cells, which show stem cell characteristics, and have the potential for drug resistance due to their high efflux capacity. Knockdown of TNC dramatically decreased the SP fraction in melanoma spheres and lowered their resistance to doxorubicin treatment, likely because of the downregulation of multiple ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including ABCB5. These data suggest that TNC is critical in melanoma progression as it mediates protective signals in the therapy-resistant population of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2012859385,"Here we report that ALDH1L1 (FDH, a folate enzyme with tumor suppressor-like properties) inhibits cell motility. The underlying mechanism involves F-actin stabilization, re-distribution of cytoplasmic actin toward strong preponderance of filamentous actin and formation of actin stress fibers. A549 cells expressing FDH showed a much slower recovery of green fluorescent protein-actin fluorescence in a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay, as well as an increase in G-actin polymerization and a decrease in F-actin depolymerization rates in pyren-actin fluorescence assays indicating the inhibition of actin dynamics. These effects were associated with robust dephosphorylation of the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin by PP1 and PP2A serine/threonine protein phosphatases, but not the cofilin-specific phosphatases slingshot and chronophin. In fact, the PP1/PP2A inhibitor calyculin prevented cofilin dephosphorylation and restored motility. Inhibition of FDH-induced apoptosis by the Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 or the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk did not restore motility or levels of phosphor-cofilin, indicating that the observed effects are independent of FDH function in apoptosis. Interestingly, cofilin small interfering RNA or expression of phosphorylation-deficient S3A cofilin mutant resulted in a decrease of G-actin and the actin stress fiber formation, the effects seen upon FDH expression. In contrast, the expression of S3D mutant, mimicking constitutive phosphorylation, prevented these effects further supporting the cofilin-dependent mechanism. Dephosphorylation of cofilin and inhibition of motility in response to FDH can also be prevented by the increased folate in media. Furthermore, folate depletion itself, in the absence of FDH, resulted in cofilin dephosphorylation and inhibition of motility in several cell lines. Our experiments showed that these effects were folate specific and not a general response to nutrient starvation. Overall, this study shows the presence of distinct intracellular signaling pathways regulating motility in response to folate status and points toward mechanisms involving folates in promoting a malignant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2083425325,"Background RNA silencing is a common term for pathways utilizing small RNAs as sequence-specific guides to repress gene expression. Components of the RNA silencing machinery are involved in different aspects of chromatin function in numerous organisms. However, association of RNA silencing with chromatin in mammalian cells remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Immunostaining of mitotic chromosomes with antibodies visualizing either endogenous or ectopically expressed Dicer in mammalian cells revealed association of the protein with ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats. Chromatin immunoprecipitations and bisulfite sequencing experiments indicated that Dicer is associated with transcribed regions of both active and silenced genes in rDNA arrays of interphase chromosomes. Metabolic labeling of the mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking Dicer did not reveal apparent defect in rRNA biogenesis though pre-rRNA synthesis in these cells was decreased, likely as a consequence of their slower growth caused by the loss of miRNAs. We analyzed in detail chromatin structure of rDNA but did not find any epigenetic changes at rDNA loci in Dicer−/− ES cells. Instead, we found that rDNA methylation is rather low in primary tissues, contrasting with rDNA methylation patterns in transformed cell lines. Conclusion/Significance We found that Dicer, a key component of RNA silencing pathways, can be detected in association with rDNA chromatin in mammalian cells. The role of this particular localization of Dicer is not readily apparent since the enzyme is associated with rDNA genes regardless of their transcriptional activity. However, localization of Dicer to the transcribed region suggests that transcription may contribute to the Dicer deposition at rDNA chromatin. We hypothesize that Dicer functions in maintaining integrity of rDNA arrays."

We determined the MenC-specific immunity before and after introduction of the MenC conjugate (MenCC) vaccine.Two cross-sectional population-based serum banks, collected in 1995/1996 (n = 8539) and in 2006/2007 (n = 6386), were used for this study. The main outcome measurements were the levels of MenC polysaccharide(PS)-specific IgG and serum bactericidal antibodies (SBA) after routine immunization, 4-5 years after catch-up immunization or by natural immunity. There was an increasing persistence of PS-specific IgG and SBA with age in the catch-up immunized cohorts 4-5 years after their MenCC immunization (MenC PS-specific IgG, 0.25 microg/ml (95%CI: 0.19-0.31 microg/ml) at age 6 years, gradually increasing to 2.34 microg/ml,(95%CI: 1.70-3.32 microg/ml) at age 21-22 years). A comparable pattern was found for antibodies against the carrier protein in children immunized above 9 years of age. In case of vaccination before the age of 5 years, PS-specific IgG was rapidly lost. For all age-cohorts together, SBA seroprevalence (> or =8) increased from 19.7% to 43.0% in the pre- and post-MenC introduction eras, respectively. In non-immunized adults the SBA seroprevalence was not significantly different between the pre- and post-MenC introduction periods, whereas PS-specific IgG was significantly lower in the post-MenC vaccination (GMT, age > or =25 years, 0.10 microg/ml) era compared to the pre-vaccination (GMT, age > or =25 years, 0.43 microg/ml) era.MenCC vaccination administered above 5 years of age induced high IgG levels compared to natural exposure, increasing with age. In children below 14 months of age and non-immunized cohorts lower IgG levels were observed compared to the pre-vaccination era, whereas functional levels remained similar in adults. Whether the lower IgG poses individuals at increased risk for MenC disease should be carefully monitored. Large-scale introduction of a MenCC vaccine has led to improved protection in adolescents, but in infants a single-dose schedule may not provide sufficient protection on the long-term and therefore a booster-dose early in adolescence should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1964577555,"Previous surveys on the relationship between physicians and pharmaceutical representatives (PRs) have been of limited quality. The purpose of our survey of practicing physicians in Japan was to assess the extent of their involvement in pharmaceutical promotional activities, physician characteristics that predict such involvement, attitudes toward relationships with PRs, correlations between the extent of involvement and attitudes, and differences in the extent of involvement according to self-reported prescribing behaviors.From January to March 2008, we conducted a national survey of 2621 practicing physicians in seven specialties: internal medicine, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology, psychiatry, and ophthalmology. The response rate was 54%. Most physicians met with PRs (98%), received drug samples (85%) and stationery (96%), and participated in industry-sponsored continuing medical education (CME) events at the workplace (80%) and outside the workplace (93%). Half accepted meals outside the workplace (49%) and financial subsidies to attend CME events (49%). Rules at the workplace banning both meetings with PRs and gifts predicted less involvement of physicians in promotional activities. Physicians valued information from PRs. They believed that they were unlikely to be influenced by promotional activities, but that their colleagues were more susceptible to such influence than themselves. They were divided about the appropriateness of low-value gifts. The extent of physician involvement in promotional activities was positively correlated with the attitudes that PRs are a valuable source of information and that gifts are appropriate. The extent of such involvement was higher among physicians who prefer to ask PRs for information when a new medication becomes available, physicians who are not satisfied with patient encounters ending only with advice, and physicians who prefer to prescribe brand-name medications.Involvement in pharmaceutical promotional activities is widespread among practicing physicians in Japan. The extent of such involvement varies according to certain physician characteristics. As a group, they are at risk for influence by promotional activities."
https://openalex.org/W2089645716,"The family of tripartite-motif (TRIM) proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, but are often characterized by critical protein-protein interactions necessary for their function. TRIM16 is induced in different cancer types, when the cancer cell is forced to proceed down a differentiation pathway. We have identified TRIM16 as a DNA-binding protein with histone acetylase activity, which is required for the retinoic acid receptor β(2) transcriptional response in retinoid-treated cancer cells. In this study, we show that overexpressed TRIM16 reduced neuroblastoma cell growth, enhanced retinoid-induced differentiation and reduced tumourigenicity in vivo. TRIM16 was only expressed in the differentiated ganglion cell component of primary human neuroblastoma tumour tissues. TRIM16 bound directly to cytoplasmic vimentin and nuclear E2F1 in neuroblastoma cells. TRIM16 reduced cell motility and this required downregulation of vimentin. Retinoid treatment and enforced overexpression caused TRIM16 to translocate to the nucleus, and bind to and downregulate nuclear E2F1, required for cell replication. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that TRIM16 acts as a tumour suppressor, affecting neuritic differentiation, cell migration and replication through interactions with cytoplasmic vimentin and nuclear E2F1 in neuroblastoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1975716459,"Due to the inherent sensitivity of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to manipulations, the recovery and survival of hESCs after fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) can be low. Additionally, a well characterized and robust methodology for performing FACS on hESCs using multiple-cell surface markers has not been described. The p160-Rho-associated coiled kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y-27632, previously has been identified as enhancing survival of hESCs upon single-cell dissociation, as well as enhancing recovery from cryopreservation. Here we examined the application of Y-27632 to hESCs after FACS to improve survival in both feeder-dependent and feeder-independent growth conditions.HESCs were sorted using markers for SSEA-3, TRA-1-81, and SSEA-1. Cells were plated after sorting for 24 hours in either the presence or the absence of Y-27632. In both feeder-dependent and feeder-independent conditions, cell survival was greater when Y-27632 was applied to the hESCs after sort. Specifically, treatment of cells with Y-27632 improved post-sort recovery up to four fold. To determine the long-term effects of sorting with and without the application of Y-27632, hESCs were further analyzed. Specifically, hESCs sorted with and without the addition of Y-27632 retained normal morphology, expressed hESC-specific markers as measured by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry, and maintained a stable karyotype. In addition, the hESCs could differentiate into three germ layers in vitro and in vivo in both feeder-dependent and feeder-independent growth conditions.The application of Y-27632 to hESCs after cell sorting improves cell recovery with no observed effect on pluripotency, and enables the consistent recovery of hESCs by FACS using multiple surface markers. This improved methodology for cell sorting of hESCs will aid many applications such as removal of hESCs from secondary cell types, identification and isolation of stem cell subpopulations, and generation of single cell clones. Finally, these results demonstrate an additional application of ROCK inhibition to hESC research."
https://openalex.org/W2009655852,"DNA damage checkpoints cause cell cycle arrest, allowing DNA repair before resumption of the cell cycle. These checkpoints can be activated through several signaling pathways. Checkpoint activators include p53, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), checkpoint kinase 2 and/or MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2). Many cancer cells lack p53 activity and, therefore, depend on alternative checkpoint activators to arrest the cell cycle following DNA damage. Inhibition of these pathways is expected to specifically sensitize these p53-deficient cells to DNA damage caused by chemotherapy. Using isogenic p53-proficient and p53-deficient cancer cell lines, we show that inactivation of CHK1, but not MK2, abrogates cell cycle arrest following chemotherapy, specifically in p53-deficient cells. However, we show that CHK1 is required to maintain genome integrity and cell viability, and that p53-proficient cells are no less sensitive than p53-deficient cells to CHK1 inhibition in the presence of DNA damage. Thus, combining CHK1 inhibition with DNA damage does not lead to preferential killing of p53-deficient over p53-proficient cells, and inhibiting CHK1 does not appear to be a promising approach for potentiation of cancer chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1995179726,"A decade has passed since metabolic syndrome (MetS) was documented to be highly prevalent in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. No follow-up epidemiologic study was done. This study aims to fill this gap. In this cross-sectional, observational study, a total of 2850 randomly selected Saudi adults aged 18-55 years were recruited. Subjects' information was generated from a database of more than 10,000 Saudi citizens from the existing Biomarkers Screening in Riyadh Program (RIYADH Cohort), Saudi Arabia. Anthropometrics included body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, as well as waist and hip circumferences. Fasting blood glucose and lipid profile were determined using routine laboratory procedures. The definition of ATP-III (NHANES III) was used for the diagnosis of the full MetS. The overall prevalence of complete MetS was 35.3% [Confidence-Interval (CI) 33.5-37.01]. Age-adjusted prevalence according to the European standard population is 37.0%. Low HDL-cholesterol was the most prevalent of all MetS risk factors, affecting 88.6% (CI 87.5-89.7) and hypertriglyceridemia the second most prevalent, affecting 34% (CI 32.3-35.7) of the subjects. The prevalence of the full MetS decreased from previous estimates but remains high, while dyslipidemia remains extremely high, affecting almost 90% of middle-aged Arabs. Screening for dyslipidemia among Saudi adults is warranted, especially among those most at risk. Scientific inquiry into the molecular causes of these manifestations should be pursued as a first step in the discovery of etiologic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1967113037,"Background Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is remarkably efficient at establishing persistent infection and is associated with the development of chronic liver disease. Impaired T cell responses facilitate and maintain persistent HCV infection. Importantly, CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) act by dampening antiviral T cell responses in HCV infection. The mechanism for induction and/or expansion of Tregs in HCV is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings HCV-expressing hepatocytes were used to determine if hepatocytes are able to induce Tregs. The infected liver environment was modeled by establishing the co-culture of the human hepatoma cell line, Huh7.5, containing the full-length genome of HCV genotype 1a (Huh7.5-FL) with activated CD4+ T cells. The production of IFN-γ was diminished following co-culture with Huh7.5-FL as compared to controls. Notably, CD4+ T cells in contact with Huh7.5-FL expressed an increased level of the Treg markers, CD25, Foxp3, CTLA-4 and LAP, and were able to suppress the proliferation of effector T cells. Importantly, HCV+ hepatocytes upregulated the production of TGF-β and blockade of TGF-β abrogated Treg phenotype and function. Conclusions/Significance These results demonstrate that HCV infected hepatocytes are capable of directly inducing Tregs development and may contribute to impaired host T cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2029770190,"The microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel has activity in relapsed ovarian cancer. dl922-947, an oncolytic adenovirus with a 24-bp deletion in E1A CR2, replicates selectively within and lyses cells with a dysregulated Rb pathway and has efficacy in ovarian cancer. In the aggressive A2780CP xenograft, combination treatment with weekly dl922-947 and paclitaxel has significantly greater efficacy than either treatment alone and can produce complete tumor eradication in some animals. We investigated the mechanisms of paclitaxel's synergy with dl922-947 in ovarian cancer. The host-cell microtubule network is grossly rearranged and stabilized following adenovirus infection, but paclitaxel does not increase this significantly. Paclitaxel does not synergize by increasing infectivity, viral protein expression or virus release. However, destabilizing the microtubule network with nocodazole reduces viral exit, revealing a novel microtubule-dependent pathway for non-lytic adenoviral exit. dl922-947 can override multiple cell cycle checkpoints but induces cell death by a non-apoptotic mechanism. In combination, dl922-947 and low-dose paclitaxel induces aberrant, multipolar mitoses, mitotic slippage and multinucleation, triggering an apoptotic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2117959558,"In many gregarious mammals, mothers and offspring have developed the abilities to recognise each other using acoustic signals. Such capacity may develop at different rates after birth/parturition, varying between species and between the participants, i.e., mothers and young. Differences in selective pressures between species, and between mothers and offspring, are likely to drive the timing of the onset of mother-young recognition. We tested the ability of Australian sea lion mothers to identify their offspring by vocalisation, and examined the onset of this behaviour in these females. We hypothesise that a rapid onset of recognition may reflect an adaptation to a colonial lifestyle.In a playback study maternal responses to own pup and non-filial vocalisations were compared at 12, 24 and every subsequent 24 hours until the females' first departure post-partum. Mothers showed a clear ability to recognise their pup's voice by 48 hours of age. At 24 hours mothers called more, at 48 hours they called sooner and at 72 hours they looked sooner in response to their own pup's vocalisations compared to those of non-filial pups.We demonstrate that Australian sea lion females can vocally identify offspring within two days of birth and before mothers leave to forage post-partum. We suggest that this rapid onset is a result of selection pressures imposed by a colonial lifestyle and may be seen in other colonial vertebrates. This is the first demonstration of the timing of the onset of maternal vocal recognition in a pinniped species."
https://openalex.org/W1982966355,"Microtubule-interfering cancer drugs such as paclitaxel (PTX) often cause chemoresistance and severe side effects, including neurotoxicity. To explore potentially novel antineoplastic molecular targets, we investigated the cellular response of breast carcinoma cells to short hairpin(sh)RNA-mediated depletion of the centrosomal protein transforming acidic coiled coil (TACC) 3, an Aurora A kinase target expressed during mitosis. Unlike PTX, knockdown of TACC3 did not trigger a cell death response, but instead resulted in a progressive loss of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bim that links microtubule integrity to spindle poison-induced cell death. Interestingly, TACC3-depleted cells arrested in G₁ through a cellular senescence program characterized by the upregulation of nuclear p21(WAF), downregulation of the retinoblastoma protein and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, formation of HP1γ (phospho-Ser83)-positive senescence-associated heterochromatic foci and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Remarkably, the onset of senescence following TACC3 knockdown was strongly accelerated in the presence of non-toxic PTX concentrations. Thus, we conclude that mitotic spindle stress is a major trigger of premature senescence and propose that the combined targeting of the centrosomal Aurora A-TACC3 axis together with drugs interfering with microtubule dynamics may efficiently improve the chemosensitivity of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2081505085,"Selective expression of retinal cone opsin genes is essential for color vision, but the mechanism mediating this process is poorly understood. Both vertebrate rod and medium wavelength-sensitive (M) cone photoreceptors differentiate by repression of a short wavelength-sensitive (S) cone differentiation program. We found that Pias3 acts in mouse cone photoreceptors to activate expression of M opsin and repress expression of S opsin, with the transcription factors Trbeta2 and Rxrgamma mediating preferential expression of Pias3 in M cones. Finally, we observed that Pias3 directly regulated M and S cone opsin expression by modulating the cone-enriched transcription factors Rxrgamma, Roralpha and Trbeta1. Our results indicate that Pias3-dependent SUMOylation of photoreceptor-specific transcription factors is a common mechanism that controls both rod and cone photoreceptor subtype specification, regulating distinct molecular targets in the two cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2079529029,"Background As the age of a population increases, so too does the rate of disability. In addition, disability is likely to be more common in rural compared with urban areas. The present study aimed to examine the influence of rapid population changes in terms of age and rural/urban residence on the prevalence of disability. Methods Data from the 1987 and 2006 China Sampling Surveys on Disability were used to estimate the impacts of rapid ageing and the widening urban-rural gap on the prevalence of disability. Stratum specific rates of disability were estimated by 5-year age-group and type of residence. The decomposition of rates method was used to calculate the rate difference for each stratum between the two surveys. Results The crude disability rate increased from 4.89% in 1987 to 6.39% in 2006, a 1.5% increase over the 19 year period. However, after the compositional effects from the overall rates of changing age-structure in 1987 and 2006 were eliminated by standardization, the disability rate in 1987 was 6.13%, which is higher than that in 2006 (5.91%). While in 1987 the excess due to rural residence compared with urban was <1.0%, this difference increased to >1.5% by 2006, suggesting a widening disparity by type of residence. When rates were decomposed, the bulk of the disability could be attributed to ageing, and very little to rural residence. However, a wider gap in prevalence between rural and urban areas could be observed in some age groups by 2006. Conclusion The increasing number of elderly disabled persons in China and the widening discrepancy of disability prevalence between urban and rural areas may indicate that the most important priorities for disability prevention in China are to reinforce health promotion in older adults and improve health services in rural communities."
https://openalex.org/W1987490732,"Q fever, a zoonosis due to Coxiella burnetii infection, exhibits sexual dimorphism; men are affected more frequently and severely than women for a given exposure. Here we explore whether the severity of C. burnetii infection in mice is related to differences in male and female gene expression profiles.Mice were infected with C. burnetii for 24 hours, and gene expression was measured in liver cells using microarrays. Multiclass analysis identified 2,777 probes for which expression was specifically modulated by C. burnetti infection. Only 14% of the modulated genes were sex-independent, and the remaining 86% were differentially expressed in males and females. Castration of males and females showed that sex hormones were responsible for more than 60% of the observed gene modulation, and this reduction was most pronounced in males. Using functional annotation of modulated genes, we identified four clusters enriched in males that were related to cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, defensins and cytokine/Jak-Stat pathways. Up-regulation of the IL-10 and Stat-3 genes may account for the high susceptibility of men with Q fever to C. burnetii infection and autoantibody production. Two clusters were identified in females, including the circadian rhythm pathway, which consists of positive (Clock, Arntl) and negative (Per) limbs of a feedback loop. We found that Clock and Arntl were down-modulated whereas Per was up-regulated; these changes may be associated with efficient bacterial elimination in females but not in males, in which an exacerbated host response would be prominent.This large-scale study revealed for the first time that circadian rhythm plays a major role in the anti-infectious response of mice, and it provides a new basis for elucidating the role of sexual dimorphism in human infections."
https://openalex.org/W2039657240,"Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor are the key initiating event of colorectal cancer. Although the control of WNT signalling is well established as a central tumour-suppressive function, the significance of APC in regulating chromosome instability is less well established. In this study, we test whether APC-deficient cells have a functional spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) in vivo by examining the response of these cells to Taxol and Vinorelbine. We also show for the first time that APC deficiency compromises the arrest response to Taxol in vivo. This effect is independent of the role that APC has in WNT signalling. At higher levels of Taxol, APC-deficient cells arrest as efficiently as wild-type cells. Importantly, this dose of Taxol strongly suppresses intestinal tumourigenesis in models of benign (APCMin/+ mouse) and invasive (AhCreER+APCfl/+PTENfl/fl) cancer. In contrast to intestinal enterocytes with a general SAC defect because of Bub1 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazole 1) deletion, APC-deficient enterocytes arrest equivalently to wild type when treated with Vinorelbine. This suggests that the failed arrest in response to Taxol is because of a specific defect in microtubule stabilization following Taxol treatment rather than a general role of the APC protein in the mitotic spindle checkpoint. In summary, this study clarifies the role of APC as a mitotic spindle checkpoint protein in vivo and shows that APC-deficient cells have a compromised response to Taxol."
https://openalex.org/W1970299935,"Background Internet-sourced drugs are often considered suspect. The World Health Organization reports that drugs from websites that conceal their physical address are counterfeit in over 50 percent of cases; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) works with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) to regularly update a list of websites likely to sell drugs that are illegal or of questionable quality. Methods and Findings This study examines drug purchasing over the Internet, by comparing the sales of five popular drugs from a selection of websites stratified by NABP or other ratings. The drugs were assessed for price, conditions of purchase, and basic quality. Prices and conditions of purchase varied widely. Some websites advertised single pills while others only permitted the purchase of large quantities. Not all websites delivered the exact drugs ordered, some delivered no drugs at all; many websites shipped from multiple international locations, and from locations that were different from those advertised on the websites. All drug samples were tested against approved U.S. brand formulations using Raman spectrometry. Many (17) websites substituted drugs, often in different formulations from the brands requested. These drugs, some of which were probably generics or perhaps non-bioequivalent copy versions, could not be assessed accurately. Of those drugs that could be assessed, none failed from “approved”, “legally compliant” or “not recommended” websites (0 out of 86), whereas 8.6% (3 out of 35) failed from “highly not recommended” and unidentifiable websites. Conclusions Of those drugs that could be assessed, all except Viagra® passed spectrometry testing. Of those that failed, few could be identified either by a country of manufacture listed on the packaging, or by the physical location of the website pharmacy. If confirmed by future studies on other drug samples, then U.S. consumers should be able to reduce their risk by relying on credentialing agencies recommended lists and by using common sense when examining packaging and pills."
https://openalex.org/W1980881525,"Proteins fold up by coordinating the different segments of their polypeptide chain through a network of weak cooperative interactions. Such cooperativity results in unfolding curves that are typically sigmoidal. However, we still do not know what factors modulate folding cooperativity or the minimal amount that ensures folding into specific three-dimensional structures. Here, we address these issues on BBL, a small helical protein that folds in microseconds via a marginally cooperative downhill process (Li, P., Oliva, F. Y., Naganathan, A. N., and Muñoz, V. (2009) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 106, 103–108). Particularly, we explore the effects of salt-induced screening of the electrostatic interactions in BBL at neutral pH and in acid-denatured BBL. Our results show that electrostatic screening stabilizes the native state of the neutral and protonated forms, inducing complete refolding of acid-denatured BBL. Furthermore, without net electrostatic interactions, the unfolding process becomes much less cooperative, as judged by the broadness of the equilibrium unfolding curve and the relaxation rate. Our experiments show that the marginally cooperative unfolding of BBL can still be made twice as broad while the protein retains its ability to fold into the native three-dimensional structure in microseconds. This result demonstrates experimentally that efficient folding does not require cooperativity, confirming predictions from theory and computer simulations and challenging the conventional biochemical paradigm. Furthermore, we conclude that electrostatic interactions are an important factor in determining folding cooperativity. Thus, electrostatic modulation by pH-salt and/or mutagenesis of charged residues emerges as an attractive tool for tuning folding cooperativity.

Furthermore, we conclude that electrostatic interactions are an important factor in determining folding cooperativity. Thus, electrostatic modulation by pH-salt and/or mutagenesis of charged residues emerges as an attractive tool for tuning folding cooperativity. In principle, proteins fold into their biologically active three-dimensional structures by relying on two interrelated factors: stability and cooperativity. The stability of the native (folded) state comes from solvent-driven forces and specific weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, electrostatics, and van der Waals interactions (1Dill K.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7133-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar). Contributions from these interactions to protein stability have been investigated thoroughly using mutational analysis (2Fersht A.R. Freeman W.H. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. 1st Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1998Google Scholar). Cooperativity refers to the coupling of the various stabilizing interactions that make proteins (un)fold in a concerted fashion and result in sigmoidal equilibrium unfolding curves (3Poland D.C. Scheraga H.A. Biopolymers. 1965; 3: 401-419Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Statistical mechanical arguments indicate that folding cooperativity cannot be too high because proteins are stabilized by limited numbers of weak interactions (4Kouza M. Li M.S. O'brien Jr., E.P. Hu C.K. Thirumalai D. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2006; 110: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The lower bound is possibly the formation of isolated α-helices, in which the energetic coupling is only local (i,i+3 hydrogen bonds). However, such small cooperativity results in broad ensembles of partly helical conformations rather than a single α-helix (5Poland D.C. Scheraga H.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1965; 43: 2071-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, conventional wisdom states that folding into a specific globular three-dimensional structure must involve an all-or-none process with near-infinite cooperativity (6Aune K.C. Tanford C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4586-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by two major experimental observations. First, all single-domain proteins that fold in milliseconds or longer seem to adhere to a two-state (all-or-none) folding model (7Jackson S.E. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: R81-R91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Second, seminal work during the 1980–1990s has shown that under conditions of low pH and high salt, many proteins form partly structured molten globule states (8Goto Y. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 9Goto Y. Nishikiori S. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Fink A.L.

Such molten globules have a native-like secondary structure and unfold with low cooperativity, but they also lack defined tertiary structure (13Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other front, theory (14Bryngelson J.D. Onuchic J.N. Socci N.D. Wolynes P.G. Prot. Struct. Func. and Gen. 1995; 21: 167-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar) and computer simulations (15Camacho C.J. Thirumalai D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Coarse-grained models show that proteins can fold into defined structures by a completely uncooperative process (15Camacho C.J. Thirumalai D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 6369-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 16Chan H.S. Bromberg S. Dill K.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

In fact, to produce cooperative unfolding transitions, these models require ad hoc contributions from many-body terms in addition to simple pairwise interactions (19Kaya H. Chan H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 911-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Ejtehadi M.R. Avall S.P. Plotkin S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, calibration against experimental data indicates that a fairly small contribution from many-body interactions is sufficient to reproduce the broadness of the experimental unfolding curves. Interestingly, in such simulations, one can observe a direct relationship between cooperativity at the atomic level and the broadness of the macroscopic unfolding curve (22Li M.S. Klimov D.K. Thirumalai D. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2004; 93: 268107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Likewise, the simulations do not produce concerted global unfolding, as expected for an all-or-none process, but a distribution of unfolding behaviors for the various residues in the protein (23Klimov D.K. Thirumalai D. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The critical question, then, is: what is the minimal level of cooperativity that affords folding into a well defined three-dimensional structure? Is it nearly infinite as assumed conventionally or nominal as suggested by theory and simulations? And, as a subsidiary, what are the physical factors that modulate such cooperativity? To date, this question has not been amenable to experimental analysis. The reason is that for a two-state-like process, the unfolding curve is not necessarily proportional to the degree of energetic coupling but to the change in enthalpy upon unfolding. In other words, the actual degree of cooperativity of two-state-like folding is not measurable experimentally. However, recent work on ultra-fast folding offers an opportunity to solve this stalemate. Proteins that fold in a few microseconds cross marginal (<3 RT) free energy barriers and exhibit broader equilibrium unfolding curves (24Muñoz V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, folding occurs in the downhill regime predicted by energy landscape theory (14Bryngelson J.D. Onuchic J.N. Socci N.D. Wolynes P.G. Prot. Struct. Func. and Gen. 1995; 21: 167-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar), where cooperativity is low and thus amenable to experimental analysis (25Muñoz V. Sadqi M. Naganathan A.N. de Sancho D. HFSP J. 2008; 2: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Confirmation of this idea has come from the atom-by-atom NMR analysis of the thermal unfolding of BBL (26Sadqi M. Fushman D. Muñoz V. Nature. 2006; 442: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), a microsecond folding protein that has been identified as a global downhill folder in both equilibrium (27Garcia-Mira M.M. Sadqi M. Fischer N. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Muñoz V. Science. 2002; 298: 2191-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and kinetic experiments (28Li P. Oliva F.Y. Naganathan A.N. Muñoz V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The NMR analysis of BBL has demonstrated the same connection between the broadness of the global unfolding process and the variability of atomic unfolding behaviors observed in simulations. BBL is the peripheral subunit binding domain from the subunit 2 of the Escherichia coli oxo-glutarate reductase complex (29Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). This little domain (40 residues) is involved in the sequential binding to subunits 1 and 3 (29Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) in a coordinated process for which its low folding cooperativity may be critical (30Naganathan A.N. Doshi U. Fung A. Sadqi M. Muñoz V. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8466-8475Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here, we take advantage of the folding properties of BBL to experimentally explore the limits of folding cooperativity. We focus on the role of electrostatic interactions. Interactions between charged residues contribute to protein stability (31Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Makhatadze G.I. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 132-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and, because they act over proportionally long distances, electrostatics also are likely to affect cooperativity (32Halskau Jr., O. Perez-Jimenez R. Ibarra-Molero B. Underhaug J. Muñoz V. Martinez A. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8625-8630Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that acidic pH destabilizes folded BBL, which reaches complete unfolding at pH 3.0 (27Garcia-Mira M.M. Sadqi M. Fischer N. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Muñoz V. Science. 2002; 298: 2191-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The key to this process appears to be the protonation of two buried histidines (His13 and His37 with pKa values of 6.4 and 5.3 (33Arbely E. Rutherford T.J. Sharpe T.D. Ferguson N. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). Therefore, to investigate the electrostatic effects on the folding cooperativity of BBL (i.e. determined from the broadness of the unfolding curve and the changes in folding kinetics), we revisited the combination of acid denaturation plus salt addition. The idea is simple; by varying pH and salt concentration, we should be able to screen the electrostatic interactions of BBL while tuning up its folding stability. Naf-BBL was produced as indicated previously (34Naganathan A.N. Perez-Jimenez R. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Muñoz V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7435-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Protein samples at acidic pH were prepared in citrate buffer and neutral pH samples in phosphate buffer, each at 20 mm. Buffer reagents and salts were of chemical grade, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The concentration of salt in the protein samples was estimated by weight and refractive index measurements. Samples for infrared (IR) spectroscopic measurements were prepared in deuterated buffers, with D2O purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance spectroscopy on a Cary100 Bio spectrophotometer from Varian. Naf-BBL concentrations were estimated as the average from determinations at 266 and 280 nm using molar absorptivities of 3,595 m−1·cm−1 at 266 nm and 5,526 m−1·cm−1 at 280 nm. CD experiments were performed on a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter at a protein concentration of ∼50 μm in 20 mm buffer. Equilibrium thermal unfolding was monitored by collecting CD spectra from 268 to 368 K every 5 K with 1-nm resolution in a cuvette of 1-mm path length. Reversibility was ensured by comparing spectra at 298 K collected before and after each ramp. CD thermal unfolding data were fitted to the sigmoidal unfolding curve,S1/[1+exp⁡(A(1/Tm−1/T))]+S2exp⁡(A(1/Tm−1/T))/[1+exp⁡(A(1/Tm−1/T))](Eq. 1) where A is the sharpness of the curve (smaller A indicates lower cooperativity), Tm is the temperature at which the signal decreases by 50%, and S1 and S2 are the signals of the pre- and post-transition baselines, which were assumed to be salt-independent and linearly dependent on temperature. CD chemical denaturation experiments were fitted to the sigmoidal unfolding curve,S1/[1+exp⁡(A′(C−Cm))]+S2exp⁡(A′(C−Cm))/[1+exp⁡(A′(C−Cm))](Eq. 2) where A′ is the sharpness of the curve, C is the concentration of denaturant, Cm is the concentration of denaturant at which the signal decreases by 50%, and S1 and S2 are the baselines, which are assumed to be linear functions of chemical denaturant.

IR temperature-jump experiments were performed on an improved home-built version of the instrument described by Gai and co-workers (35Huang C.Y. Getahun Z. Zhu Y.J. Klemke J.W. DeGrado W.F. Gai F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2788-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for details). At pH 3, BBL is fully unfolded. However, the addition of a neutral monovalent salt such as LiCl under such acidic conditions leads to a progressive increase in the α-helical content of protonated BBL as probed by CD (Fig. 1A). Above 1 m salt, the helical CD signal of BBL exhibited typical sigmoidal unfolding curves with temperature, which suggested that protonated BBL refolds at low temperatures. Moreover, the apparent temperature denaturation midpoint (Tm) increases as more salt is added. The Tm increase is manifested in Fig. 1A as a right shift of the unfolding curve. Quantitative estimates, obtained from either the maximum in the derivative of the unfolding curve using the method of Naganathan and Muñoz (36Naganathan A.N. Muñoz V. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6752-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or by fitting the unfolding experiments to phenomenological sigmoidal curves (Equation 1), showed that the increase in Tm tapers off at LiCl concentrations above 2 m (Fig. 1B). These experiments suggest that the addition of LiCl stabilizes a folded form of protonated BBL, leading to complete refolding at concentrations above 1 m. Similar refolding was observed upon addition of other salts with larger cationic radii, such as NaCl and CsCl (supplemental Fig. S2). The response of protonated BBL to salt was quite strong, with 0.25 m being sufficient to boost the helical signal to >50% of the native signal at the lowest temperature (Fig. 1C). At ∼1 m salt, the low temperature CD spectrum of protonated BBL was nearly identical to that of native BBL at pH 7 and at the same temperature (Fig. 1C, red line and inset). From this point onward, the α-helix signal at 222 nm increased linearly upon further addition of salt. This increase reports a global increase in α-helix content, as can be assessed by comparison of the CD spectrum at 1 and 5.3 m salt (Fig. 1C, inset). It is thus reasonable to assume that the linear α-helix increase we observed above 1 m salt corresponds to the native baseline of BBL, which has been seen to change proportionally to the degree of destabilization induced by a variety of factors such as temperature (34Naganathan A.N. Perez-Jimenez R. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Muñoz V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7435-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), urea (37Oliva F.Y. Muñoz V. J. Am. Chem Soc. 2004; 126: 8596-8597Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and pH (33Arbely E. Rutherford T.J. Sharpe T.D. Ferguson N. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CD is a very sensitive folding probe for α-helical proteins such as BBL. However, CD monitors only secondary structure, and thus, it is possible that in the presence of high salt, protonated BBL becomes as α-helical as native BBL without folding into a well defined tertiary structure. That is, the addition of salt at low pH could be inducing a molten globule intermediate rather than the folded state, as it has been seen for many other proteins (11Fink A.L. Calciano L.J. Goto Y. Kurotsu T. Palleros D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12504-12511Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 38Fink A.L. Oberg K.A. Seshadri S. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). NMR is the most powerful spectroscopic technique to distinguish between a folded protein and a molten globule. The NMR spectrum of a molten globule lacks signal dispersion, resembles that of an unfolded protein, and does not show long range NOEs (39Alexandrescu A.T. Evans P.A. Pitkeathly M. Baum J. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 summarizes the results from the NMR analysis of BBL. Fig. 2A shows the two-dimensional SOFAST-HMQC spectra recorded in N15 natural abundance of BBL at pH 7 (red), pH 3 with 2 m LiCl (light blue), and pH 3 without salt (dark blue). In the absence of salt, the HMQC of protonated BBL showed the typical fingerprint of an unfolded protein with most amide protons clustered in the 8–8.5 ppm range (dark blue). In turn, upon addition of salt, the spectrum changed quite drastically (light blue), showing much larger dispersion (7.5–9.5 ppm) and a clearly identifiable pattern of highly dispersed proton signals (i.e. the labeled cross-peaks). The HMQC fingerprint of protonated BBL in 2 m LiCl was, in fact, quite similar to that observed for native BBL at pH 7 (red). The small differences of 0.1–0.25 ppm between the two are most likely due to the strong intrinsic effects of pH on NH and 15N chemical shifts. The deviations of the Hα chemical shifts from typical random coil values (conformational shifts), which report on the backbone structure and are less sensitive to pH, were almost identical for pH 7 and 3 plus 2 m salt (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the 1.0–0.0 ppm spectral region that is characteristic of aliphatic protons involved in tertiary contacts had many peaks at pH 3 plus 2 m LiCl, whereas there were no peaks in this region at pH 3 alone (Fig. 2C). Finally, the most definitive evidence of formation of the BBL native tertiary structure was provided by the NOESY spectrum, which showed the same long range NOEs that are expected from the native structure at neutral pH. The top and bottom right panels of Fig. 2 highlight examples of these native tertiary contacts between residues conforming the hydrophobic core of BBL: Leu10, Leu15, Ala17, Ile20, Leu29, Val34, and Leu38 and the two buried histidines (His13 and His37). The results from the NMR analysis demonstrated unambiguously that protonated BBL stabilized by salt and BBL at neutral pH fold into essentially the same three-dimensional structure. At 2 m LiCl, protonated BBL unfolded with an apparent Tm of ∼320 K, which was almost identical to that exhibited by BBL at pH 7 with no salt. The agreement in Tm was manifested by a coincidence in the position of the maximum of the derivative of the equilibrium unfolding curves (Fig. 3A) and confirmed by fitting to Equation 1 (Fig. 1B). However, despite the similarity in apparent Tm, the thermal unfolding process of protonated BBL at 2 m LiCl was much broader than that at pH 7 with no salt. This was again readily apparent in the derivative of the unfolding curve, which showed that for the former, the maximum reached lower values, whereas the tails were higher (Fig. 3A). Quantitative determination of the sharpness of the unfolding curve (i.e. from parameter A obtained by fitting the curves to Equation 1) indicated that the thermal unfolding of protonated BBL at 2 m LiCl was almost 2-fold broader (relative sharpness of ∼0.6; Table 1). Therefore, in conditions of salt that match the apparent Tm to that exhibited by BBL at neutral pH, protonated BBL unfolded by a significantly broader process. It also is important to note that, to a first order approximation, Tm and curve broadness were both independent of the type of salt employed (see Fig. 3). This indicated that the effects on the unfolding of BBL induced by addition of salt were generic and thus mostly independent of salt type.TABLE 1Relative sharpness of BBL unfoldingSalt0 m2.0 m4.0 mpH 71.00.670.71pH 3 + LiCln.f.0.620.75pH 3 + CsCln.f.0.520.82pH 3 + NaCln.f.0.51Values correspond to the parameter A (equation 1) relative to pH 7 and no salt. N.f. indicates that BBL is not folded at the lowest experimental temperature. Open table in a new tab Values correspond to the parameter A (equation 1) relative to pH 7 and no salt. N.f. indicates that BBL is not folded at the lowest experimental temperature. A possible explanation for an apparently broader unfolding curve is that the end states (folded and/or unfolded) have different properties at pH 7 and 3 plus 2 m salt. However, this does not seem to be the case. NMR showed that BBL folds to the same native structure under both conditions (Fig. 2). The high temperature unfolded state also exhibited a similar CD spectrum and thus a similar degree of residual α-helical structure, whether BBL was at neutral pH or protonated plus LiCl, NaCl, or CsCl (Fig. 3B). Therefore, salt-stabilized protonated BBL unfolds by temperature through a process that is intrinsically broader, or less cooperative. Having ruled out a structural change, the decreased cooperativity observed in Fig. 3A could be caused by a combination of three factors: 1) protonation of the buried side-chains of His13 and His37; 2) screening of electrostatic interactions; and 3) solvent-driven forces caused by organization of water molecules around the highly concentrated ions (kosmotropic effect). To elucidate the roles of these three factors, we compared the effect of very high salt concentrations at acidic and neutral pH. We found that in the presence of 4 m LiCl, the thermal unfolding of BBL is virtually identical at both pH values (Fig. 4A). Moreover, these curves differed from that at pH 7 with no salt in that they shifted to the right and had increased α-helical content in the pretransition baseline (Fig. 4A). From the derivative of the unfolding curves, we found that the presence of 4 m LiCl increases the apparent Tm up to ∼332 K and also makes the unfolding process equally broader for neutral and acidic pH (Fig. 4B and Table 1). These results have a straightforward explanation if we assume that the main factor determining the stabilization and decreased cooperativity of BBL by salt is the screening of electrostatic interactions. The agreement between the thermal unfolding curves at the two pH values (Fig. 4A) directly rules out the protonation of buried ionizable groups. This is in stark contrast to the critical role that protonation of buried histidines plays in the formation of a molten-globule intermediate in apomyoglobin (40Barrick D. Hughson F.M. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 588-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A kosmotropic effect should be proportional to salt concentration (41Collins K.D. Washabaugh M.W. Q Rev. Biophys. 1985; 18: 323-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar), whereas electrostatic screening depends exponentially on the ionic strength according to the Debye-Hückel theory. The thermal stabilization that we observed at both pH values produced an abrupt increase in apparent Tm at low ionic strengths, which leveled off above 2 m (Fig. 1B). The trend was exactly as expected from Debye-Huckel. At an ionic strength of 4 m electrostatic screening should be complete, thus explaining why under these conditions BBL exhibits the same properties regardless of its protonation status (Fig. 4). Moreover, the increase in Tm induced by salt at pH 7 indicated that the electrostatic contributions at neutral pH are also mildly destabilizing. The same arguments apply to the changes in the unfolding cooperativity of BBL. It is clear that the protonation of the two buried histidines had no direct effect on the broadness of the unfolding curve (compare orange and blue in Fig. 4), contrary to previous arguments (33Arbely E. Rutherford T.J. Sharpe T.D. Ferguson N. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the unfolding of protonated BBL was similarly broad at 2 m and 4 m LiCl. This was consistent with the expectation of ∼90% electrostatic screening at 2 m ionic strength. In turn, kosmotropic effects should produce significantly broader unfolding at 4 m because the salt concentration is doubled. If anything, the thermal unfolding of protonated BBL at 2 m was slightly broader (see Table 1), which could be due to heat capacity effects on the overall unfolding enthalpy given the ∼12 K lower Tm compared with the experiments at 4 m salt. Further evidence for the role of electrostatic screening arose from chemical denaturation experiments using the ionic chaotrope guanidinium chloride as denaturant. As with temperature, the guanidinium chloride denaturation of BBL at pH 7 and 3 plus 2 m salt produced sigmoidal unfolding curves (supplemental Fig. S3) that had identical denaturation midpoints (i.e. Cm = 2.1 m as determined by fitting to Equation 2). However, the denaturation curve of protonated BBL in the presence of 2 m LiCl was only ∼10% broader because guanidinium chloride should screen electrostatic interactions as it denatures the protein. Thus, near the denaturation midpoint, electrostatic screening was already at ∼90% for pH 7 (∼2.1 ionic strength (I)) and complete for pH 3 plus 2 m salt (I ∼ 4.1 m). In other words, the guanidinium chloride denaturation experiment is equivalent to the thermal denaturation experiment in the presence of 4 m sa"

In our previous study of >10,000 samples from patients with suspected MPNs tested for JAK2 mutations by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with direct sequencing, complete deletion of exon 14 (Deltaexon14) constituted <1% of JAK2 mutations. This appears to be an alternative splicing mutation, not detectable with DNA-based testing.We investigated the possibility that MPN patients may express the JAK2 Deltaexon14 at low levels (<15% of total transcript) not routinely detectable by RT-PCR with direct sequencing. Using a sensitive RT-PCR-based fluorescent fragment analysis method to quantify JAK2 Deltaexon14 mRNA expression relative to wild-type, we tested 61 patients with confirmed MPNs, 183 with suspected MPNs (93 V617F-positive, 90 V617F-negative), and 46 healthy control subjects. The Deltaexon14 variant was detected in 9 of the 61 (15%) confirmed MPN patients, accounting for 3.96% to 33.85% (mean = 12.04%) of total JAK2 transcript. This variant was also detected in 51 of the 183 patients with suspected MPNs (27%), including 20 of the 93 (22%) with V617F (mean [range] expression = 5.41% [2.13%-26.22%]) and 31 of the 90 (34%) without V617F (mean [range] expression = 3.88% [2.08%-12.22%]). Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that patients expressing Deltaexon14 mRNA expressed a corresponding truncated JAK2 protein. The Deltaexon14 variant was not detected in the 46 control subjects.These data suggest that expression of the JAK2 Deltaexon14 splice variant, leading to a truncated JAK2 protein, is common in patients with MPNs. This alternatively spliced transcript appears to be more frequent in MPN patients without V617F mutation, in whom it might contribute to leukemogenesis. This mutation is missed if DNA rather than RNA is used for testing."
https://openalex.org/W1996849977,"Loss and/or degradation of nearshore habitats have led to increased efforts to restore or enhance many of these habitats, particularly those that are deemed essential for marine fishes. Copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) and lingcod (Ophiodon enlongatus) are dominant members of the typical reef fish community that inhabit rocky and high-relief substrates along the Pacific Northwest. We used acoustic telemetry to document their residency and movements in the nearshore waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska in order to assess use of created reef habitat in an individual-based manner. A total of 57 fish were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. Forty-five fish were captured and monitored in three habitats: artificial reef, low-relief natural reef, and patchy high-relief natural reef. Within each habitat, both rockfish and lingcod exhibited long periods of residency with limited movements. Twelve rockfish were captured at the natural reefs and displaced a distance of 4.0 km to the artificial reef. Five of the 12 rockfish returned within 10 d of their release to their initial capture site. Another five of the 12 displaced fish established residency at the artificial reef through the duration of our study. Our results suggest the potential for artificial reefs to provide rockfish habitat in the event of disturbances to natural habitat."

However, tissue tropism and underlying pathogenesis of H5N1 virus infection in humans needs further investigation. The objective of this work was to study viremia, tissue tropism and disease pathogenesis of H5N1 virus infection in the susceptible ferret animal model. To evaluate the relationship of morbidity and mortality with virus loads, we performed studies in ferrets infected with the H5N1 strain A/VN/1203/04 to assess clinical signs after infection and virus load in lung, brain, ileum, nasal turbinate, nasal wash, and blood. We observed that H5N1 infection in ferrets is characterized by high virus load in the brain and and low levels in the ileum using real-time PCR. In addition, viral RNA was frequently detected in blood one or two days before death and associated with symptoms of diarrhea. Our observations further substantiate pathogenicity of H5N1 and further indicate that viremia may be a bio-marker for fatal outcomes in H5N1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2060624978,"Background We recently reported that palmitic acid (PA) is a novel and efficient CD4 fusion inhibitor to HIV-1 entry and infection. In the present report, based on in silico modeling of the novel CD4 pocket that binds PA, we describe discovery of highly potent PA analogs with increased CD4 receptor binding affinities (Kd) and gp120-to-CD4 inhibition constants (Ki). The PA analogs were selected to satisfy Lipinski's rule of drug-likeness, increased solubility, and to avoid potential cytotoxicity. Principal Findings PA analog 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) was most efficacious with Kd ∼74 nM and Ki ∼122 nM, ascorbyl palmitate (6-AP) exhibited slightly higher Kd ∼140 nM and Ki ∼354 nM, and sucrose palmitate (SP) was least efficacious binding to CD4 with Kd ∼364 nM and inhibiting gp120-to-CD4 binding with Ki ∼1486 nM. Importantly, PA and its analogs specifically bound to the CD4 receptor with the one to one stoichiometry. Significance Considering observed differences between Ki and Kd values indicates clear and rational direction for improving inhibition efficacy to HIV-1 entry and infection. Taken together this report introduces a novel class of natural small molecules fusion inhibitors with nanomolar efficacy of CD4 receptor binding and inhibition of HIV-1 entry."
https://openalex.org/W2090488431,"The v-Crk oncogene product consists of two protein interaction modules, a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. Overexpression of CrkI, the cellular homolog of v-Crk, transforms mouse fibroblasts, and elevated CrkI expression is observed in several human cancers. The SH2 and SH3 domains of Crk are required for transformation, but the identity of the critical cellular binding partners is not known. A number of candidate Crk SH3-binding proteins have been identified, including the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases c-Abl and Arg, and the guanine nucleotide exchange proteins C3G, SOS1 and DOCK180. The aim of this study is to determine which of these are required for transformation by CrkI. We found that short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of C3G or SOS1 suppressed anchorage-independent growth of NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing CrkI, whereas knockdown of SOS1 alone was sufficient to suppress tumor formation by these cells in nude mice. Knockdown of C3G was sufficient to revert morphological changes induced by CrkI expression. By contrast, knockdown of Abl family kinases or their inhibition with imatinib enhanced anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis induced by Crk. These results show that SOS1 is essential for CrkI-induced fibroblast transformation, and also reveal a surprising negative role for Abl kinases in Crk transformation."
