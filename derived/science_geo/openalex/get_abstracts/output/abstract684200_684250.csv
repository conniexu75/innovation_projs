https://openalex.org/W3213709307,"Gastrulation is the fundamental process in all multicellular animals through which the basic body plan is first laid down1,2,3,4. It is pivotal in generating cellular diversity coordinated with spatial patterning. In humans, gastrulation occurs in the third week after fertilization. Our understanding of this process in humans is relatively limited and based primarily on historical specimens5,6,7,8, experimental models9,10,11,12 or, more recently, in vitro cultured samples13,14,15,16. Here we characterize in a spatially resolved manner the single-cell transcriptional profile of an entire gastrulating human embryo, staged to be between 16 and 19 days after fertilization. We use these data to analyse the cell types present and to make comparisons with other model systems. In addition to pluripotent epiblast, we identified primordial germ cells, red blood cells and various mesodermal and endodermal cell types. This dataset offers a unique glimpse into a central but inaccessible stage of our development. This characterization provides new context for interpreting experiments in other model systems and represents a valuable resource for guiding directed differentiation of human cells in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3213694110,"The three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin is intrinsically associated with gene regulation and cell function1-3. Methods based on chromatin conformation capture have mapped chromatin structures in neuronal systems such as in vitro differentiated neurons, neurons isolated through fluorescence-activated cell sorting from cortical tissues pooled from different animals and from dissociated whole hippocampi4-6. However, changes in chromatin organization captured by imaging, such as the relocation of Bdnf away from the nuclear periphery after activation7, are invisible with such approaches8. Here we developed immunoGAM, an extension of genome architecture mapping (GAM)2,9, to map 3D chromatin topology genome-wide in specific brain cell types, without tissue disruption, from single animals. GAM is a ligation-free technology that maps genome topology by sequencing the DNA content from thin (about 220 nm) nuclear cryosections. Chromatin interactions are identified from the increased probability of co-segregation of contacting loci across a collection of nuclear slices. ImmunoGAM expands the scope of GAM to enable the selection of specific cell types using low cell numbers (approximately 1,000 cells) within a complex tissue and avoids tissue dissociation2,10. We report cell-type specialized 3D chromatin structures at multiple genomic scales that relate to patterns of gene expression. We discover extensive 'melting' of long genes when they are highly expressed and/or have high chromatin accessibility. The contacts most specific of neuron subtypes contain genes associated with specialized processes, such as addiction and synaptic plasticity, which harbour putative binding sites for neuronal transcription factors within accessible chromatin regions. Moreover, sensory receptor genes are preferentially found in heterochromatic compartments in brain cells, which establish strong contacts across tens of megabases. Our results demonstrate that highly specific chromatin conformations in brain cells are tightly related to gene regulation mechanisms and specialized functions."
https://openalex.org/W3214568570,"Mental health is an important component of public health, especially in times of crisis. However, monitoring public mental health is difficult because data are often patchy and low-frequency1–3. Here we complement established approaches by using data from helplines, which offer a real-time measure of ‘revealed’ distress and mental health concerns across a range of topics4–9. We collected data on 8 million calls from 19 countries, focusing on the COVID-19 crisis. Call volumes peaked six weeks after the initial outbreak, at 35% above pre-pandemic levels. The increase was driven mainly by fear (including fear of infection), loneliness and, later in the pandemic, concerns about physical health. Relationship issues, economic problems, violence and suicidal ideation, however, were less prevalent than before the pandemic. This pattern was apparent both during the first wave and during subsequent COVID-19 waves. Issues linked directly to the pandemic therefore seem to have replaced rather than exacerbated underlying anxieties. Conditional on infection rates, suicide-related calls increased when containment policies became more stringent and decreased when income support was extended. This implies that financial relief can allay the distress triggered by lockdown measures and illustrates the insights that can be gleaned from the statistical analysis of helpline data. Data collected from crisis helplines during the COVID-19 pandemic show that pandemic-related issues replaced rather than exacerbated underlying anxieties, and demonstrate that helpline data are useful indicators of public mental health."

https://openalex.org/W3214465289,"The MRGPRX family of receptors (MRGPRX1–4) is a family of mas-related G-protein-coupled receptors that have evolved relatively recently1. Of these, MRGPRX2 and MRGPRX4 are key physiological and pathological mediators of itch and related mast cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions2–5. MRGPRX2 couples to both Gi and Gq in mast cells6. Here we describe agonist-stabilized structures of MRGPRX2 coupled to Gi1 and Gq in ternary complexes with the endogenous peptide cortistatin-14 and with a synthetic agonist probe, respectively, and the development of potent antagonist probes for MRGPRX2. We also describe a specific MRGPRX4 agonist and the structure of this agonist in a complex with MRGPRX4 and Gq. Together, these findings should accelerate the structure-guided discovery of therapeutic agents for pain, itch and mast cell-mediated hypersensitivity. Structural studies of the itch receptors MRGPRX2 and MRGPRX4 in complex with endogenous and synthetic ligands provide a basis for the development of therapeutic compounds for pain, itch and mast cell-mediated hypersensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W3212207836,"How does the brain maintain fear within an adaptive range? We found that the insular cortex acts as a state-dependent regulator of fear that is necessary to establish an equilibrium between the extinction and maintenance of fear memories in mice. Whereas insular cortex responsiveness to fear-evoking cues increased with their certainty to predict harm, this activity was attenuated through negative bodily feedback that arose from heart rate decelerations during freezing. Perturbation of body-brain communication by vagus nerve stimulation disrupted the balance between fear extinction and maintenance similar to insular cortex inhibition. Our data reveal that the insular cortex integrates predictive sensory and interoceptive signals to provide graded and bidirectional teaching signals that gate fear extinction and illustrate how bodily feedback signals are used to maintain fear within a functional equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W3212651459,"Thermalization is a ubiquitous process of statistical physics, in which a physical system reaches an equilibrium state that is defined by a few global properties such as temperature. Even in isolated quantum many-body systems, limited to reversible dynamics, thermalization typically prevails1. However, in these systems, there is another possibility: many-body localization (MBL) can result in preservation of a non-thermal state2,3. While disorder has long been considered an essential ingredient for this phenomenon, recent theoretical work has suggested that a quantum many-body system with a spatially increasing field-but no disorder-can also exhibit MBL4, resulting in 'Stark MBL'5. Here we realize Stark MBL in a trapped-ion quantum simulator and demonstrate its key properties: halting of thermalization and slow propagation of correlations. Tailoring the interactions between ionic spins in an effective field gradient, we directly observe their microscopic equilibration for a variety of initial states, and we apply single-site control to measure correlations between separate regions of the spin chain. Furthermore, by engineering a varying gradient, we create a disorder-free system with coexisting long-lived thermalized and non-thermal regions. The results demonstrate the unexpected generality of MBL, with implications about the fundamental requirements for thermalization and with potential uses in engineering long-lived non-equilibrium quantum matter."

https://openalex.org/W3213731491,"Abstract Propulsion is a critical subsystem of many spacecraft 1–4 . For efficient propellant usage, electric propulsion systems based on the electrostatic acceleration of ions formed during electron impact ionization of a gas are particularly attractive 5,6 . At present, xenon is used almost exclusively as an ionizable propellant for space propulsion 2–5 . However, xenon is rare, it must be stored under high pressure and commercial production is expensive 7–9 . Here we demonstrate a propulsion system that uses iodine propellant and we present in-orbit results of this new technology. Diatomic iodine is stored as a solid and sublimated at low temperatures. A plasma is then produced with a radio-frequency inductive antenna, and we show that the ionization efficiency is enhanced compared with xenon. Both atomic and molecular iodine ions are accelerated by high-voltage grids to generate thrust, and a highly collimated beam can be produced with substantial iodine dissociation. The propulsion system has been successfully operated in space onboard a small satellite with manoeuvres confirmed using satellite tracking data. We anticipate that these results will accelerate the adoption of alternative propellants within the space industry and demonstrate the potential of iodine for a wide range of space missions. For example, iodine enables substantial system miniaturization and simplification, which provides small satellites and satellite constellations with new capabilities for deployment, collision avoidance, end-of-life disposal and space exploration 10–14 ."
https://openalex.org/W3213264071,"The brain is the seat of body weight homeostasis. However, our inability to control the increasing prevalence of obesity highlights a need to look beyond canonical feeding pathways to broaden our understanding of body weight control1-3. Here we used a reverse-translational approach to identify and anatomically, molecularly and functionally characterize a neural ensemble that promotes satiation. Unbiased, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed marked differences in cerebellar responses to food in people with a genetic disorder characterized by insatiable appetite. Transcriptomic analyses in mice revealed molecularly and topographically -distinct neurons in the anterior deep cerebellar nuclei (aDCN) that are activated by feeding or nutrient infusion in the gut. Selective activation of aDCN neurons substantially decreased food intake by reducing meal size without compensatory changes to metabolic rate. We found that aDCN activity terminates food intake by increasing striatal dopamine levels and attenuating the phasic dopamine response to subsequent food consumption. Our study defines a conserved satiation centre that may represent a novel therapeutic target for the management of excessive eating, and underscores the utility of a 'bedside-to-bench' approach for the identification of neural circuits that influence behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3213852803,"Metal-binding natural products contribute to metal acquisition and bacterial virulence, but their roles in metal stress response are underexplored. We show that a five-enzyme pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesizes a small-molecule copper complex, fluopsin C, in response to elevated copper concentrations. Fluopsin C is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that contains a copper ion chelated by two minimal thiohydroxamates. Biosynthesis of the thiohydroxamate begins with cysteine and requires two lyases, two iron-dependent enzymes, and a methyltransferase. The iron-dependent enzymes remove the carboxyl group and the α carbon from cysteine through decarboxylation, N-hydroxylation, and methylene excision. Conservation of the pathway in P. aeruginosa and other bacteria suggests a common role for fluopsin C in the copper stress response, which involves fusing copper into an antibiotic against other microbes."

In yeast, Ubr1-a single-subunit E3 ligase-is responsible for the Arg/N-degron pathway2. How Ubr1 mediates the initiation of ubiquitination and the elongation of the ubiquitin chain in a linkage-specific manner through a single E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc2) remains unknown. Here we developed chemical strategies to mimic the reaction intermediates of the first and second ubiquitin transfer steps, and determined the cryo-electron microscopy structures of Ubr1 in complex with Ubc2, ubiquitin and two N-degron peptides, representing the initiation and elongation steps of ubiquitination. Key structural elements, including a Ubc2-binding region and an acceptor ubiquitin-binding loop on Ubr1, were identified and characterized. These structures provide mechanistic insights into the initiation and elongation of ubiquitination catalysed by Ubr1."
https://openalex.org/W3214240212,"The breakdown of translational symmetry at heterointerfaces leads to the emergence of new phonon modes localized at the interface1. These modes have an essential role in thermal and electrical transport properties in devices, especially in miniature ones wherein the interface may dominate the entire response of the device2. Although related theoretical work began decades ago1,3–5, experimental research is totally absent owing to challenges in achieving the combined spatial, momentum and spectral resolutions required to probe localized modes. Here, using the four-dimensional electron energy-loss spectroscopy technique, we directly measure both the local vibrational spectra and the interface phonon dispersion relation for an epitaxial cubic boron nitride/diamond heterointerface. In addition to bulk phonon modes, we observe modes localized at the interface and modes isolated from the interface. These features appear only within approximately one nanometre around the interface. The localized modes observed here are predicted to substantially affect the interface thermal conductance and electron mobility. Our findings provide insights into lattice dynamics at heterointerfaces, and the demonstrated experimental technique should be useful in thermal management, electrical engineering and topological phononics. Four-dimensional electron energy-loss spectroscopy measurements of the vibrational spectra and the phonon dispersion at a heterointerface show localized modes that are predicted to affect the thermal conductance and electron mobility."

https://openalex.org/W3213234002,"X chromosome dosage compensation ensures balanced gene dosage between the X chromosome and autosomes and between the sexes, involving divergent mechanisms among mammals. We elucidated a distinct mechanism for X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in cynomolgus monkeys, a model for human development. The trophectoderm and cytotrophoblast acquire XCI around implantation through an active intermediate bearing repressive modifications and compacted structure, whereas the amnion, epiblast, and hypoblast maintain such an intermediate protractedly, attaining XCI by a week after implantation. Males achieve X chromosome up-regulation (XCU) progressively, whereas females show XCU coincidentally with XCI, both establishing the X:autosome dosage compensation by 1 week after implantation. Conversely, primordial germ cells undergo X chromosome reactivation by reversing the XCI pathway early during their development. Our findings establish a foundation for clarifying the dosage compensation mechanisms in primates, including humans."

https://openalex.org/W3214513393,"To successfully navigate the environment, animals depend on their ability to continuously track their heading direction and speed. Neurons that encode angular head velocity (AHV) are fundamental to this process, yet the contribution of various motion signals to AHV coding in the cortex remains elusive. By performing chronic single-unit recordings in the retrosplenial cortex (RSP) of the mouse and tracking the activity of individual AHV cells between freely moving and head-restrained conditions, we find that vestibular inputs dominate AHV signaling. Moreover, the addition of visual inputs onto these neurons increases the gain and signal-to-noise ratio of their tuning during active exploration. Psychophysical experiments and neural decoding further reveal that vestibular-visual integration increases the perceptual accuracy of angular self-motion and the fidelity of its representation by RSP ensembles. We conclude that while cortical AHV coding requires vestibular input, where possible, it also uses vision to optimize heading estimation during navigation."
https://openalex.org/W3212740824,"Infection with one of dengue viruses 1 to 4 (DENV1-4) induces protective antibodies against homotypic infection. However, a notable feature of dengue viruses is the ability to use preexisting heterotypic antibodies to infect Fcγ receptor–bearing immune cells, leading to higher viral load and immunopathological events that augment disease. We tracked the antigenic dynamics of each DENV serotype by using 1944 sequenced isolates from Bangkok, Thailand, between 1994 and 2014 (348 strains), in comparison with regional and global DENV antigenic diversity (64 strains). Over the course of 20 years, the Thailand DENV serotypes gradually evolved away from one another. However, for brief periods, the serotypes increased in similarity, with corresponding changes in epidemic magnitude. Antigenic evolution within a genotype involved a trade-off between two types of antigenic change (within-serotype and between-serotype), whereas genotype replacement resulted in antigenic change away from all serotypes. These findings provide insights into theorized dynamics in antigenic evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3213624992,"Current models to explain how signals emanating from cutaneous mechanoreceptors generate representations of touch are based on comparisons of the tactile responses of mechanoreceptor subtypes and neurons in somatosensory cortex1-8. Here we used mouse genetic manipulations to investigate the contributions of peripheral mechanoreceptor subtypes to cortical responses to touch. Cortical neurons exhibited remarkably homogeneous and transient responses to skin indentation that resembled rapidly adapting (RA) low-threshold mechanoreceptor (LTMR) responses. Concurrent disruption of signals from both Aβ RA-LTMRs and Aβ slowly adapting (SA)-LTMRs eliminated cortical responses to light indentation forces. However, disruption of either LTMR subtype alone caused opposite shifts in cortical sensitivity but otherwise largely unaltered tactile responses, indicating that both subtypes contribute to normal cortical responses. Selective optogenetic activation of single action potentials in Aβ RA-LTMRs or Aβ SA-LTMRs drove low-latency responses in most mechanically sensitive cortical neurons. Similarly, most somatosensory thalamic neurons were also driven by activation of Aβ RA-LTMRs or Aβ SA-LTMRs. These findings support a model in which signals from physiologically distinct mechanoreceptor subtypes are extensively integrated and transformed within the subcortical somatosensory system to generate cortical representations of touch."
https://openalex.org/W3214371786,"Viruses require multifunctional structured RNAs to hijack their host’s biochemistry, but their mechanisms can be obscured by the difficulty of solving conformationally dynamic RNA structures. Using cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we visualized the structure of the mysterious viral transfer RNA (tRNA)–like structure (TLS) from the brome mosaic virus, which affects replication, translation, and genome encapsidation. Structures in isolation and those bound to tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) show that this ~55-kilodalton purported tRNA mimic undergoes large conformational rearrangements to bind TyrRS in a form that differs substantially from that of tRNA. Our study reveals how viral RNAs can use a combination of static and dynamic RNA structures to bind host machinery through highly noncanonical interactions, and we highlight the utility of cryo-EM for visualizing small, conformationally dynamic structured RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W3211362520,"Interference observed in a double-slit experiment most conclusively demonstrates the wave properties of particles. We construct a quantum mechanical double-slit interferometer by rovibrationally exciting molecular deuterium (D2) in a biaxial (v = 2, j = 2) state using Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage, where v and j represent the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, respectively. In D2 (v = 2, j = 2) → D2 (v = 2, j′ = 0) rotational relaxation via a cold collision with ground state helium, the two coherently coupled bond axis orientations in the biaxial state act as two slits that generate two indistinguishable quantum mechanical pathways connecting initial and final states of the colliding system. The interference disappears when we decouple the two orientations of the bond axis by separately constructing the uniaxial states of D2, unequivocally establishing the double-slit action of the biaxial state. This double slit opens new possibilities in the coherent control of molecular collisions."
https://openalex.org/W3212398839,"Neurotropic alphaherpesviruses initiate infection in exposed mucosal tissues and, unlike most viruses, spread rapidly to sensory and autonomic nerves where life-long latency is established1. Recurrent infections arise sporadically from the peripheral nervous system throughout the life of the host, and invasion of the central nervous system may occur, with severe outcomes2. These viruses directly recruit cellular motors for transport along microtubules in nerve axons, but how the motors are manipulated to deliver the virus to neuronal nuclei is not understood. Here, using herpes simplex virus type I and pseudorabies virus as model alphaherpesviruses, we show that a cellular kinesin motor is captured by virions in epithelial cells, carried between cells, and subsequently used in neurons to traffic to nuclei. Viruses assembled in the absence of kinesin are not neuroinvasive. The findings explain a critical component of the alphaherpesvirus neuroinvasive mechanism and demonstrate that these viruses assimilate a cellular protein as an essential proviral structural component. This principle of viral assimilation may prove relevant to other virus families and offers new strategies to combat infection. Herpes simplex virus type I and pseudorabies virus assimilate kinesin from host epithelial cells and repurpose the motor to traffic to the nuclei of neurons in the peripheral nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W3212050565,"Anticipating an initial shortage of vaccines for COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States developed priority vaccine allocations for specific demographic groups in the population. This study evaluates the performance of the CDC vaccine allocation strategy with respect to multiple potentially competing vaccination goals (minimizing mortality, cases, infections, and years of life lost (YLL)), under the same framework as the CDC allocation: four priority vaccination groups and population demographics stratified by age, comorbidities, occupation and living condition (congested or non-congested).We developed a compartmental disease model that incorporates key elements of the current pandemic including age-varying susceptibility to infection, age-varying clinical fraction, an active case-count dependent social distancing level, and time-varying infectivity (accounting for the emergence of more infectious virus strains). The CDC allocation strategy is compared to all other possibly optimal allocations that stagger vaccine roll-out in up to four phases (17.5 million strategies). The CDC allocation strategy performed well in all vaccination goals but never optimally. Under the developed model, the CDC allocation deviated from the optimal allocations by small amounts, with 0.19% more deaths, 4.0% more cases, 4.07% more infections, and 0.97% higher YLL, than the respective optimal strategies. The CDC decision to not prioritize the vaccination of individuals under the age of 16 was optimal, as was the prioritization of health-care workers and other essential workers over non-essential workers. Finally, a higher prioritization of individuals with comorbidities in all age groups improved outcomes compared to the CDC allocation.The developed approach can be used to inform the design of future vaccine allocation strategies in the United States, or adapted for use by other countries seeking to optimize the effectiveness of their vaccine allocation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3214416313,"Californium (Cf) is currently the heaviest element accessible above microgram quantities. Cf isotopes impose severe experimental challenges due to their scarcity and radiological hazards. Consequently, chemical secrets ranging from the accessibility of 5f/6d valence orbitals to engage in bonding, the role of spin–orbit coupling in electronic structure, and reactivity patterns compared to other f elements, remain locked. Organometallic molecules were foundational in elucidating periodicity and bonding trends across the periodic table1–3, with a twenty-first-century renaissance of organometallic thorium (Th) through plutonium (Pu) chemistry4–12, and to a smaller extent americium (Am)13, transforming chemical understanding. Yet, analogous curium (Cm) to Cf chemistry has lain dormant since the 1970s. Here, we revive air-/moisture-sensitive Cf chemistry through the synthesis and characterization of [Cf(C5Me4H)2Cl2K(OEt2)]n from two milligrams of 249Cf. This bent metallocene motif, not previously structurally authenticated beyond uranium (U)14,15, contains the first crystallographically characterized Cf–C bond. Analysis suggests the Cf–C bond is largely ionic with a small covalent contribution. Lowered Cf 5f orbital energy versus dysprosium (Dy) 4f in the colourless, isoelectronic and isostructural [Dy(C5Me4H)2Cl2K(OEt2)]n results in an orange Cf compound, contrasting with the light-green colour typically associated with Cf compounds16–22.

GPR158 has also been implicated in depression, carcinogenesis, and cognition. However, the structural organization and signaling mechanisms of GPR158 are largely unknown. We used single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of human GPR158 alone and bound to an RGS signaling complex. The structures reveal a homodimeric organization stabilized by a pair of phospholipids and the presence of an extracellular Cache domain, an unusual ligand-binding domain in GPCRs. We further demonstrate the structural basis of GPR158 coupling to RGS7-Gβ5. Together, these results provide insights into the unusual biology of orphan receptors and the formation of GPCR-RGS complexes."

We will include all observational study designs, which report on the potential risk of accelerating the COVID-2019 pandemic with school reopening. Electronic databases included were MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS and CNKI. Additional sources will be also retrieved, including Clinical trials.gov-NIH, The British Library, Pro Quest Dissertations Database, Public Health Gray Literature Sources and Health Evidence, Google Scholar, and pre-prints [medRXiv]. No restriction to language or date will be used as search strategy. In an independently manner, two investigators will select studies, perform data extraction, as well as perform a critical appraisal of the risk of bias and overall quality of the selected observational studies, based on their designs. The heterogeneity among the studies will be assessed using the I2 statistic test. According to the results of this test, we will verify whether a meta-analysis is feasible. If feasibility is confirmed, a random-effect model analysis will be carried out. For data analysis, the calculation of the pooled effect estimates will consider a 95% CI and alpha will be set in 0.05 using the R statistical software, v.4.0.4. In addition, we will rate the certainty of evidence based on Cochrane methods and in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide better insights into safety in the return to school in the context of the COVID-2019 pandemic, at a time when vaccination advances unevenly in several countries around the world.

https://openalex.org/W3214694944,"Pauli blocking of spontaneous emission is responsible for the stability of atoms. Electrons cannot decay to lower-lying internal states that are already occupied. Pauli blocking also occurs when free atoms scatter light elastically (Rayleigh scattering) and the final external momentum states are already populated. This was predicted more than 30 years ago but is challenging to realize experimentally. Here, we report on Pauli blocking of light scattering in a dense quantum-degenerate Fermi gas of ultracold lithium atoms. When the Fermi momentum is larger than the photon recoil, most final momentum states are within the Fermi surface. At low temperature, we find that light scattered even at large angles is suppressed by 37% compared with higher temperatures, where atoms scatter at the single-atom Rayleigh scattering rate."
https://openalex.org/W3211608506,"Due to its increasing production, durability and multiple applications, plastic is a material we encounter every day. Small plastic particles from the μm to the mm range are classified as microplastics and produced for cosmetic and medical products, but are also a result of natural erosion and decomposition of macroplastics. Although being omnipresent in our environment and already detected in various organisms, less is known about the effects of microplastics on humans in general, or on vascular biology in particular. Here we investigated the effects of carboxylated polystyrene microplastic particles (PS, 1 μm) on murine endothelial and immune cells, which are both crucially involved in vascular inflammation, using in vitro and in vivo approaches. In vitro, PS induced adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells with subsequent adhesion of leukocytes both under static and flow conditions. In monocytic cells, PS enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and release. Accordingly, administering mice with PS led to enhanced aortic expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules. Furthermore, we identified neutrophils as the PS-clearing blood leukocyte population. The findings from this study for the first time indicate polystyrene microplastic as a new environmental risk factor for endothelial inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3211809539,"A central question in chordate evolution is the origin of sessility in adult ascidians, and whether the appendicularian complete free-living style represents a primitive or derived condition among tunicates1. According to the 'a new heart for a new head' hypothesis, the evolution of the cardiopharyngeal gene regulatory network appears as a pivotal aspect to understand the evolution of the lifestyles of chordates2-4. Here we show that appendicularians experienced massive ancestral losses of cardiopharyngeal genes and subfunctions, leading to the 'deconstruction' of two ancestral modules of the tunicate cardiopharyngeal gene regulatory network. In ascidians, these modules are related to early and late multipotency, which is involved in lineage cell-fate determination towards the first and second heart fields and siphon muscles. Our work shows that the deconstruction of the cardiopharyngeal gene regulatory network involved the regressive loss of the siphon muscle, supporting an evolutionary scenario in which ancestral tunicates had a sessile ascidian-like adult lifestyle. In agreement with this scenario, our findings also suggest that this deconstruction contributed to the acceleration of cardiogenesis and the redesign of the heart into an open-wide laminar structure in appendicularians as evolutionary adaptations during their transition to a complete pelagic free-living style upon the innovation of the food-filtering house5."
https://openalex.org/W3213624725,"The Pauli exclusion principle forbids indistinguishable fermions from occupying the same quantum mechanical state. The implications of this are profound; for example, it accounts for the electronic shell structure of atoms.

For a Fermi gas in the quantum degenerate regime, we observed a marked suppression in scattering compared with a similarly prepared Bose gas. The observed decrease in fluorescence and the corresponding increase in light transmission results from Pauli blocking, where Fermi-Dirac statistics limits the number of accessible states for a scattering atom in a large Fermi sea. Our work confirms a fundamental result on the optical response of quantum gases and may contribute to cooling and thermometry schemes."

The role of CHD5 in metastasis is unknown. We confirm that low expression of CHD5 is associated with stage 4 NB. Forced expression of CHD5 in NB cell lines with 1p loss inhibited key aspects of the metastatic cascade in vitro: anchorage-independent growth, migration, and invasion. In vivo, formation of bone marrow and liver metastases developing from intravenously injected NB cells was delayed and decreased by forced CHD5 expression. Genome-wide mRNA sequencing revealed reduction of genes and gene sets associated with metastasis when CHD5 was overexpressed. Known metastasis-suppressing genes preferentially upregulated in CHD5-overexpressing NB cells included PLCL1 . In patient NB, low expression of PLCL1was associated with metastatic disease and poor survival. Knockdown of PLCL1 and of p53 in IMR5 NB cells overexpressing CHD5 reversed CHD5-induced inhibition of invasion and migration in vitro. In summary, CHD5 is a metastasis suppressor in NB."

The radiative decay of an excited atomic state has been suppressed by reducing the density of electromagnetic vacuum modes near the atomic transition. Likewise, reducing the density of available momentum modes of the atomic motion when it is embedded inside a Fermi sea will suppress spontaneous emission and photon scattering rates. Here we report the experimental demonstration of suppressed light scattering in a quantum degenerate Fermi gas.

Typical approaches to identify T-cell epitopes utilising extensive peptide sets require subjects’ cell numbers that exceed feasible sample volumes. To address this, CD8 T-cells were polyclonally expanded from PBMC from 13 anti-retroviral naïve subjects living with HIV using CD3/CD4 bi-specific antibody. Assessment of recognition of individual peptides within a set of 1408 HIV-1 Gag, Nef, Pol and Env potential T-cell epitope peptides was achieved by sequential IFNγ ELISpot assays using peptides pooled in 3-D matrices followed by confirmation with single peptides. A Renilla reniformis luciferase viral inhibition assay assessed CD8 T-cell-mediated inhibition of replication of a cross-clade panel of 10 HIV-1 isolates, including 9 transmitted-founder isolates. Polyclonal expansion from one frozen PBMC vial provided sufficient CD8 T-cells for both ELISpot steps in 12 of 13 subjects. A median of 33 peptides in 16 epitope regions were recognised including peptides located in previously characterised HIV-1 epitope-rich regions. There was no significant difference between ELISpot magnitudes for in vitro expanded CD8 T-cells and CD8 T-cells directly isolated from PBMCs. CD8 T-cells from all subjects inhibited a median of 7 HIV-1 isolates (range 4 to 10). The breadth of CD8 T-cell mediated HIV-1 inhibition was significantly positively correlated with CD8 T-cell breadth of peptide recognition. Polyclonal CD8 T-cell expansion allowed identification of HIV-1 isolates inhibited and peptides recognised within a large peptide set spanning the major HIV-1 proteins. This approach overcomes limitations associated with obtaining sufficient cell numbers to fully characterise HIV-1-specific CD8 T-cell responses by different functional readouts within the context of extreme HIV-1 diversity. Such an approach will have useful applications in clinical development for HIV-1 and other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4226272146,"Exogenously applied mature naïve B220+ /CD19+ /IgM+ /IgD+ B cells are strongly protective in the context of tissue injury. However, the mechanisms by which B cells detect tissue injury and aid repair remain elusive. Here, we show in distinct models of skin and brain injury that MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling through TLR2/6 and TLR4 is essential for the protective benefit of B cells in vivo, while B cell-specific deletion of MyD88 abrogated this effect. The B cell response to injury was multi-modal with simultaneous production of both regulatory cytokines, such as IL-10, IL-35, and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), and inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), IL-6, and interferon gamma. Cytometry analysis showed that this response was time and environment-dependent in vivo, with 20%-30% of applied B cells adopting an immune modulatory phenotype with high co-expression of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines after 18-48 h at the injury site. B cell treatment reduced the expression of TNFα and increased IL-10 and TGFβ in infiltrating immune cells and fibroblasts at the injury site. Proteomic analysis further showed that B cells have a complex time-dependent homeostatic effect on the injured microenvironment, reducing the expression of inflammation-associated proteins, and increasing proteins associated with proliferation, tissue remodeling, and protection from oxidative stress. These findings chart and validate a first mechanistic understanding of the effects of B cells as an immunomodulatory cell therapy in the context of tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W4226379785,"Preeclampsia is a significant contributor for maternal or fetal morbidity and mortality, which is characterized by reduced invasion capacity of trophoblasts and is regulated by extracellular matrix (ECM). It is still under investigation whether chorionic villus-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CVMSC) could affect the functionality of trophoblasts. In this study, CVMSC-derived exosomes were isolated; their effect on trophoblasts was investigated based on the CCK8 assay, migration assay, and apoptosis detection. And the underlying mechanism of this effect was investigated using mRNA sequencing, western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, luciferase report assay, and ubiquitination assay. The results show that CVMSC-derived exosomes promote migration and proliferation of trophoblasts, and also reduce cell apoptosis. mRNA sequencing confirmed that after treatment of CVMSC-derived exosomes, Tripartite Motif Containing 72 (TRIM72) expression was upregulated and Tumor Protein P53 (P53) expression was downregulated, both significantly in trophoblasts. Subsequent study confirms that TRM72 can directly interact with P53 and promote P53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, reducing apoptosis rate and elevating proliferation and migration in trophoblasts. Our study confirms that CVMSC-derived exosomes promote trophoblast migration and proliferation by upregulating TRIM72 expression, and subsequently advance P53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W3211679955,"Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 (encoded by the Trp53 gene) is relevant for development and growth of different cancers, including osteosarcoma, a primary bone tumor mostly affecting children and young adolescents. We have previously shown that deficiency of the ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (Rsk2) limits osteosarcoma growth in a transgenic mouse model overexpressing the proto-oncogene c-Fos. Our initial aim for the present study was to address the question, if Rsk2 deficiency would also influence osteosarcoma growth in another mouse model. For that purpose, we took advantage of Trp53fl/fl mice, which were crossed with Runx2Cre transgenic mice in order to inactivate p53 specifically in osteoblast lineage cells. However, since we unexpectedly identified Runx2Cre-mediated recombination also in the thymus, the majority of 6-month-old Trp53fl/fl;Runx2-Cre (thereafter termed Trp53Cre) animals displayed thymic lymphomas, similar to what has been described for Trp53-deficient mice. Since we did not detect osteosarcoma formation at that age, we could not follow our initial aim, but we studied the skeletal phenotype of Trp53Cre mice, with or without additional Rsk2 deficiency. Here we unexpectedly observed that Trp53Cre mice display a unique accumulation of trabecular bone in the midshaft region of the femur and the humerus, consistent with its previously established role as a negative regulator of osteoblastogenesis. Since this local bone mass increase in Trp53Cre mice was significantly reduced by Rsk2 deficiency, we isolated bone marrow cells from the different groups of mice and analyzed their behavior ex vivo. Here we observed a remarkable increase of colony formation, osteogenic differentiation and proliferation in Trp53Cre cultures, which was unaffected by Rsk2 deficiency. Our data thereby confirm a critical and tumorigenesis-independent function of p53 as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3211448279,"Understanding the link between seamounts and large pelagic species (LPS) may provide important insights for the conservation of these species in open water ecosystems. The seamounts along the Cocos Ridge in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) ocean are thought to be ecologically important aggregation sites for LPS when moving between Cocos Island (Costa Rica) and Galapagos Islands (Ecuador). However, to date, research efforts to quantify the abundance and distribution patterns of LPS beyond the borders of these two oceanic Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been limited. This study used drifting-pelagic baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) to investigate the distribution and relative abundance of LPS at Cocos Ridge seamounts. Our drifting-pelagic BRUVS recorded a total of 21 species including elasmobranchs, small and large teleosts, dolphins and one sea turtle; of which four species are currently threatened. Depth of seamount summit was the most significant driver for LPS richness and abundance which were significantly higher at shallow seamounts (< 400 m) compared to deeper ones (> 400m). Distance to nearest MPA was also a significant predictor for LPS abundance, which increased at increasing distances from the nearest MPA. Our results suggest that the Cocos Ridge seamounts, specifically Paramount and West Cocos which had the highest LPS richness and abundance, are important aggregation sites for LPS in the ETP. However, further research is still needed to demonstrate a positive association between LPS and Cocos Ridge seamounts. Our findings showed that drifting pelagic BRUVS are an effective tool to survey LPS in fully pelagic ecosystems of the ETP. This study represents the first step towards the standardization of this technique throughout the region."

https://openalex.org/W3212384742,"According to the social cognitive theory, social support and self-efficacy may interact with each other i.e. compete or account jointly for better adaptation. This study examined the nature of the interaction between coping self-efficacy and received social support in daily lives of patient-caregiver dyads after cancer treatment. We tested whether the effect of daily fluctuations in coping self-efficacy and received support on daily affect was synergistic (positive jointed effect), compensatory (positive competing effect), or interference (negative competing effect).A dyadic daily-diary study conducted for 28 days after hospital discharge following hematopoietic cell transplantation.Coping self-efficacy, received support, and positive and negative affect were measured in 200 patient-caregiver dyads. The analysis was based on the actor-partner interdependence moderation model using multilevel structural equation modeling.Statistically significant effect of interaction between daily coping self-efficacy and received support on negative affect was found, although only in the caregivers. In that group, higher daily received support compensated for lower daily coping self-efficacy but had a negative effect when coping self-efficacy was significantly higher than typical. Also, direct beneficial effects of higher daily coping self-efficacy and received support on caregiver positive affect were found. In the patients, higher daily coping self-efficacy was directly associated with better daily affect.Diverse effects of daily coping self-efficacy and received social support were found-the interference effect in the caregivers and the main effect of coping self-efficacy in the patients. Higher daily coping self-efficacy and optimal received social support may provide resilience against affect disturbance after cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3212467958,"This paper proposes a cutting head optimization method based on meshing the spatial position of the picks. According to the expanded shape of the spatial mesh composed of four adjacent picks on the plane, a standard mesh shape analysis method can be established with mesh skewness, mesh symmetry, and mesh area ratio as the indicators. The traversal algorithm is used to calculate the theoretical meshing rate, pick rotation coefficient, and the variation of cutting load for the longitudinal cutting head with 2, 3, and 4 helices. The results show that the 3-helix longitudinal cutting head has better performance. By using the traversal result with maximum theoretical meshing rate as the design parameter, the longitudinal cutting head CH51 with 51 picks was designed and analyzed. The prediction model of pick consumption is established based on cutting speed, direct rock cutting volume of each pick, pick rotation coefficient, uniaxial compressive strength, and CERCHAR abrasivity index. And the rock with normal distribution characteristics of Uniaxial Compressive Strength is used for the specific energy calculating. The artificial rock wall cutting test results show that the reduction in height loss suppresses the increase in pick equivalent loss caused by the increase in mass loss, and the pick consumption in this test is only 0.037-0.054 picks/m3. In addition, the correlation between the actual pick consumption and the prediction model, and the correlation between the actual cutting specific energy and the theoretical calculation value are also analyzed. The research results show that the pick arrangement design method based on meshing pick tip spatial position can effectively reduce pick consumption and improve the rock cutting performance."
https://openalex.org/W3212220550,"Background Early career researchers face a hypercompetitive funding environment. To help identify effective intervention strategies for early career researchers, we examined whether first-time NIH R01 applicants who resubmitted their original, unfunded R01 application were more successful at obtaining any R01 funding within 3 and 5 years than original, unfunded applicants who submitted new NIH applications, and we examined whether underrepresented minority (URM) applicants differentially benefited from resubmission. Our observational study is consistent with an NIH working group’s recommendations to develop interventions to encourage resubmission. Methods and findings First-time applicants with US medical school academic faculty appointments who submitted an unfunded R01 application between 2000–2014 yielded 4,789 discussed and 7,019 not discussed applications. We then created comparable groups of first-time R01 applicants (resubmitted original R01 application or submitted new NIH applications) using optimal full matching that included applicant and application characteristics. Primary and subgroup analyses used generalized mixed models with obtaining any NIH R01 funding within 3 and 5 years as the two outcomes. A gamma sensitivity analysis was performed. URM applicants represented 11% and 12% of discussed and not discussed applications, respectively. First-time R01 applicants resubmitting their original, unfunded R01 application were more successful obtaining R01 funding within 3 and 5 years than applicants submitting new applications—for both discussed and not discussed applications: discussed within 3 years (OR 4.17 [95 CI 3.53, 4.93]) and 5 years (3.33 [2.82–3.92]); and not discussed within 3 years (2.81 [2.52, 3.13]) and 5 years (2.47 [2.22–2.74]). URM applicants additionally benefited within 5 years for not discussed applications. Conclusions Encouraging early career researchers applying as faculty at a school of medicine to resubmit R01 applications is a promising potential modifiable factor and intervention strategy. First-time R01 applicants who resubmitted their original, unfunded R01 application had log-odds of obtaining downstream R01 funding within 3 and 5 years 2–4 times higher than applicants who did not resubmit their original application and submitted new NIH applications instead. Findings held for both discussed and not discussed applications."
https://openalex.org/W3213367078,"In this paper we introduce a system of partial differential equations that is capable of modeling a variety of dynamic processes in soft tissue cellular populations and their microenvironments. The model is designed to be general enough to simulate such processes as tissue regeneration, tumor growth, immune response, and many more. It also has built-in flexibility to include multiple chemical fields and/or sub-populations of cells, interstitial fluid and/or extracellular matrix. The model is derived from the conservation laws for mass and linear momentum and therefore can be classified as a continuum multi-phase model. A careful choice of state variables provides stability in solving the system of discretized equations defining advective flux terms. A concept of deviation from normal allows us to use simplified constitutive relations for stresses. We also present an algorithm for computing numerical approximations to the solutions of the system and discuss properties of these approximations. We demonstrate several examples of applications of the model. Numerical simulations show a significant potential of the model for simulating a variety of processes in soft tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3213657530,"Cymbopogon, commonly known as lemon grass, is one of the most important aromatic grasses having therapeutic and medicinal values. FISH signals on somatic chromosome spreads off Cymbopogon species indicated the localization of 45S rDNA on the terminal region of short arms of a chromosome pair. A considerable interspecific variation in the intensity of 45S rDNA hybridization signals was observed in the cultivars of Cymbopogon winterianus and Cymbopogon flexuosus. Furthermore, in all the varieties of C. winterianus namely Bio-13, Manjari and Medini, a differential distribution of 45S rDNA was observed in a heterologous pair of chromosomes 1. The development of C. winterianus var. Manjari through gamma radiation may be responsible for breakage of fragile rDNA site from one of the chromosomes of this heterologous chromosome pair. While, in other two varieties of C. winterianus (Bio-13 and Medini), this variability may be because of evolutionary speciation due to natural cross among two species of Cymbopogon which was fixed through clonal propagation. However, in both the situations these changes were fixed by vegetative method of propagation which is general mode of reproduction in the case of C. winterianus."

https://openalex.org/W3211914639,"Every year, rabies causes great damage to human health and the economy of countries around the world. This neurotropic and zoonotic viral disease is endemic to Azerbaijan. This study describes cattle and dog rabies cases identified between 2015 and 2016. In addition, a questionnaire was administered to 100 respondents comprised of case owners, and non-case animal owners, to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices within this population. The study demonstrates a general lack of knowledge of rabies in the participating communities. The majority of respondents were familiar with rabies and understood that animal bites are a source of transmission. However, many respondents did not know that rabies is preventable and admitted not knowing additional routes of transmission. In addition, there was less perceived risk with contact with animal saliva. Despite free vaccinations in Azerbaijan, only 27 out of 45 dogs in this study were vaccinated. Although educational programming and preventive vaccination of dogs has been implemented, and significant progress has been made in the sphere of epidemiological surveillance and prevention, rabies cases remain problematic in the Sheki-Zagatala region. Regular educational programs for communities, strengthening of the existing vaccination programs, and a comprehensive epidemiological case-control study to identify the disease risk factors could help reduce the burden of rabies in Azerbaijan."
