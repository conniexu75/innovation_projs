Their analysis supports the use of the pineapple as a reference genome for monocot comparative genomics and provides insight into the evolution of crassulacean acid metabolism photosynthesis. Pineapple (Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.) is the most economically valuable crop possessing crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), a photosynthetic carbon assimilation pathway with high water-use efficiency, and the second most important tropical fruit. We sequenced the genomes of pineapple varieties F153 and MD2 and a wild pineapple relative, Ananas bracteatus accession CB5. The pineapple genome has one fewer ancient whole-genome duplication event than sequenced grass genomes and a conserved karyotype with seven chromosomes from before the ρ duplication event. The pineapple lineage has transitioned from C3 photosynthesis to CAM, with CAM-related genes exhibiting a diel expression pattern in photosynthetic tissues. CAM pathway genes were enriched with cis-regulatory elements associated with the regulation of circadian clock genes, providing the first cis-regulatory link between CAM and circadian clock regulation. Pineapple CAM photosynthesis evolved by the reconfiguration of pathways in C3 plants, through the regulatory neofunctionalization of preexisting genes and not through the acquisition of neofunctionalized genes via whole-genome or tandem gene duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2168354474,"Heritability analyses of genome-wide association study (GWAS) cohorts have yielded important insights into complex disease architecture, and increasing sample sizes hold the promise of further discoveries. Here we analyze the genetic architectures of schizophrenia in 49,806 samples from the PGC and nine complex diseases in 54,734 samples from the GERA cohort. For schizophrenia, we infer an overwhelmingly polygenic disease architecture in which ≥71% of 1-Mb genomic regions harbor ≥1 variant influencing schizophrenia risk. We also observe significant enrichment of heritability in GC-rich regions and in higher-frequency SNPs for both schizophrenia and GERA diseases. In bivariate analyses, we observe significant genetic correlations (ranging from 0.18 to 0.85) for several pairs of GERA diseases; genetic correlations were on average 1.3 tunes stronger than the correlations of overall disease liabilities. To accomplish these analyses, we developed a fast algorithm for multicomponent, multi-trait variance-components analysis that overcomes prior computational barriers that made such analyses intractable at this scale."

https://openalex.org/W1838684492,"ESCRT-III is required for lipid membrane remodeling in many cellular processes, from abscission to viral budding and multi-vesicular body biogenesis. However, how ESCRT-III polymerization generates membrane curvature remains debated. Here, we show that Snf7, the main component of ESCRT-III, polymerizes into spirals at the surface of lipid bilayers. When covering the entire membrane surface, these spirals stopped growing when densely packed: they had a polygonal shape, suggesting that lateral compression could deform them. We reasoned that Snf7 spirals could function as spiral springs. By measuring the polymerization energy and the rigidity of Snf7 filaments, we showed that they were deformed while growing in a confined area. Furthermore, we observed that the elastic expansion of compressed Snf7 spirals generated an area difference between the two sides of the membrane and thus curvature. This spring-like activity underlies the driving force by which ESCRT-III could mediate membrane deformation and fission."
https://openalex.org/W2188169307,"The ability of cells to adhere and sense differences in tissue stiffness is crucial for organ development and function. The central mechanisms by which adherent cells detect extracellular matrix compliance, however, are still unknown. Using two single-molecule-calibrated biosensors that allow the analysis of a previously inaccessible but physiologically highly relevant force regime in cells, we demonstrate that the integrin activator talin establishes mechanical linkages following cell adhesion, which are indispensable for cells to probe tissue stiffness. Talin linkages are exposed to a range of piconewton forces and bear, on average, 7–10 pN during cell adhesion depending on their association with F-actin and vinculin. Disruption of talin’s mechanical engagement does not impair integrin activation and initial cell adhesion but prevents focal adhesion reinforcement and thus extracellular rigidity sensing. Intriguingly, talin mechanics are isoform specific so that expression of either talin-1 or talin-2 modulates extracellular rigidity sensing. Austen et al. generated talin biosensors to study integrin-based force transduction. They report that extracellular rigidity sensing requires talin’s mechanical engagement and find talin isoform-dependent effects in integrin-mediated mechanosensing."
https://openalex.org/W2128157485,"CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems protect bacteria and archaea against foreign genetic elements. In Escherichia coli, Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) is an RNA-guided surveillance complex that binds foreign DNA and recruits Cas3, a trans-acting nuclease helicase for target degradation. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to visualize Cascade and Cas3 binding to foreign DNA targets. Our analysis reveals two distinct pathways dictated by the presence or absence of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Binding to a protospacer flanked by a PAM recruits a nuclease-active Cas3 for degradation of short single-stranded regions of target DNA, whereas PAM mutations elicit an alternative pathway that recruits a nuclease-inactive Cas3 through a mechanism that is dependent on the Cas1 and Cas2 proteins. These findings explain how target recognition by Cascade can elicit distinct outcomes and support a model for acquisition of new spacer sequences through a mechanism involving processive, ATP-dependent Cas3 translocation along foreign DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2221923578,"The antitumor agent lonidamine (LND; 1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxylic acid) is known to interfere with energy-yielding processes in cancer cells. However, the effect of LND on central energy metabolism has never been fully characterized. In this study, we report that a significant amount of succinate is accumulated in LND-treated cells. LND inhibits the formation of fumarate and malate and suppresses succinate-induced respiration of isolated mitochondria. Utilizing biochemical assays, we determined that LND inhibits the succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity of respiratory complex II without fully blocking succinate dehydrogenase activity. LND also induces cellular reactive oxygen species through complex II, which reduced the viability of the DB-1 melanoma cell line. The ability of LND to promote cell death was potentiated by its suppression of the pentose phosphate pathway, which resulted in inhibition of NADPH and glutathione generation. Using stable isotope tracers in combination with isotopologue analysis, we showed that LND increased glutaminolysis but decreased reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate. Our findings on the previously uncharacterized effects of LND may provide potential combinational therapeutic approaches for targeting cancer metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1919877068,"A long-standing question concerns how stem cells maintain their identity through multiple divisions. Previously, we reported that pre-existing and newly synthesized histone H3 are asymmetrically distributed during Drosophila male germline stem cell (GSC) asymmetric division. Here, we show that phosphorylation at threonine 3 of H3 (H3T3P) distinguishes pre-existing versus newly synthesized H3. Converting T3 to the unphosphorylatable residue alanine (H3T3A) or to the phosphomimetic aspartate (H3T3D) disrupts asymmetric H3 inheritance. Expression of H3T3A or H3T3D specifically in early-stage germline also leads to cellular defects, including GSC loss and germline tumors. Finally, compromising the activity of the H3T3 kinase Haspin enhances the H3T3A but suppresses the H3T3D phenotypes. These studies demonstrate that H3T3P distinguishes sister chromatids enriched with distinct pools of H3 in order to coordinate asymmetric segregation of ""old"" H3 into GSCs and that tight regulation of H3T3 phosphorylation is required for male germline activity."
https://openalex.org/W2156108633,"The Broad-Complex gene (BR-C) encodes transcription factors that dictate larval-pupal metamorphosis in insects. The expression of BR-C is induced by molting hormone (20-hydroxyecdysone (20E)), and this induction is repressed by juvenile hormone (JH), which exists during the premature larval stage. Kruppel homolog 1 gene (Kr-h1) has been known as a JH-early inducible gene responsible for repression of metamorphosis; however, the functional relationship between Kr-h1 and repression of BR-C has remained unclear. To elucidate this relationship, we analyzed cis- and trans elements involved in the repression of BR-C using a Bombyx mori cell line. In the cells, as observed in larvae, JH induced the expression of Kr-h1 and concurrently suppressed 20E-induced expression of BR-C. Forced expression of Kr-h1 repressed the 20E-dependent activation of the BR-C promoter in the absence of JH, and Kr-h1 RNAi inhibited the JH-mediated repression, suggesting that Kr-h1 controlled the repression of BR-C. A survey of the upstream sequence of BR-C gene revealed a Kr-h1 binding site (KBS) in the BR-C promoter. When KBS was deleted from the promoter, the repression of BR-C was abolished. Electrophoresis mobility shift demonstrated that two Kr-h1 molecules bound to KBS in the BR-C promoter. Based on these results, we conclude that Kr-h1 protein molecules directly bind to the KBS sequence in the BR-C promoter and thereby repress 20E-dependent activation of the pupal specifier, BR-C. This study has revealed a considerable portion of the picture of JH signaling pathways from the reception of JH to the repression of metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W2177591550,"Information about external stimuli is thought to be stored in cortical circuits through experience-dependent modifications of synaptic connectivity. These modifications of network connectivity should lead to changes in neuronal activity as a particular stimulus is repeatedly encountered. Here we ask what plasticity rules are consistent with the differences in the statistics of the visual response to novel and familiar stimuli in inferior temporal cortex, an area underlying visual object recognition. We introduce a method that allows one to infer the dependence of the presumptive learning rule on postsynaptic firing rate, and we show that the inferred learning rule exhibits depression for low postsynaptic rates and potentiation for high rates. The threshold separating depression from potentiation is strongly correlated with both mean and s.d. of the firing rate distribution. Finally, we show that network models implementing a rule extracted from data show stable learning dynamics and lead to sparser representations of stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1946878013,"Resistance towards the drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a key challenge in the adjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer (CRC), and novel targeted approaches are required to improve the therapeutic outcome. Necroptosis is a recently discovered form of programmed cell death, which depends on receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and particularly occurs under caspase-deficient conditions. The targeted induction of necroptosis represents a promising strategy to overcome apoptosis resistance in cancer. The aim of this study was to systematically explore the usage of pan-caspase inhibitors to sensitize resistant CRC cells for 5-FU. We found that pan-caspase inhibitors facilitated 5-FU-induced necroptosis, which was mediated by autocrine secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). TNF-α production was driven by nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and required RIP1 kinase. In vivo xenograft experiments showed that the novel pan-caspase inhibitor IDN-7314 in combination with 5-FU synergistically blocked tumor growth. Ex vivo experiments with fresh human CRC tissue specimens further indicated that a subgroup of patients could benefit from combinatory treatment. Thereby, elevated levels of secreted TNF-α and expression of components of the necroptotic pathway might help to predict the sensitivity to pro-necroptotic therapies. Together, our results shed new light on the molecular regulation of necroptosis by NF-κB and RIP1. Moreover, we identify necroptotic cell death as an important effector mechanism of 5-FU-mediated anti-tumoral activity. On the basis of this study, we propose pan-caspase inhibitors as a novel approach in the adjuvant chemotherapy of CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2285745027,"Regulation of hyaluronan (HA) synthesis and degradation is essential to maintenance of extracellular matrix homeostasis. We recently reported that HYBID (HYaluronan-Binding protein Involved in hyaluronan Depolymerization), also called KIAA1199, plays a key role in HA depolymerization in skin and arthritic synovial fibroblasts. However, regulation of HA metabolism mediated by HYBID and HA synthases (HASs) under stimulation with growth factors remains obscure. Here we report that TGF-β1, basic FGF, EGF, and PDGF-BB commonly enhance total amount of HA in skin fibroblasts through up-regulation of HAS expression, but molecular size of newly produced HA is dependent on HYBID expression levels. Stimulation of HAS1/2 expression and suppression of HYBID expression by TGF-β1 were abrogated by blockade of the MAPK and/or Smad signaling and the PI3K-Akt signaling, respectively. In normal human skin, expression of the TGF-β1 receptors correlated positively with HAS2 expression and inversely with HYBID expression. On the other hand, TGF-β1 up-regulated HAS1/2 expression but exerted only a slight suppressive effect on HYBID expression in synovial fibroblasts from the patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, resulting in the production of lower molecular weight HA compared with normal skin and synovial fibroblasts. These data demonstrate that although TGF-β1, basic FGF, EGF, and PDGF-BB enhance HA production in skin fibroblasts, TGF-β1 most efficiently contributes to production of high molecular weight HA by HAS up-regulation and HYBID down-regulation and suggests that inefficient down-regulation of HYBID by TGF-β1 in arthritic synovial fibroblasts may be linked to accumulation of depolymerized HA in synovial fluids in arthritis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2151103925,"Mutations of human telomerase RNA component (TERC) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) are associated with a subset of lung aging diseases, but the mechanisms by which TERC and TERT participate in lung diseases remain unclear. In this report, we show that knock-out (KO) of the mouse gene Terc or Tert causes pulmonary alveolar stem cell replicative senescence, epithelial impairment, formation of alveolar sacs, and characteristic inflammatory phenotype. Deficiency in TERC or TERT causes a remarkable elevation in various proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, CXCL15 (human IL-8 homolog), IL-10, TNF-α, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)); decrease in TGF-β1 and TGFβRI receptor in the lungs; and spillover of IL-6 and CXCL15 into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. In addition to increased gene expressions of α-smooth muscle actin and collagen 1α1, suggesting myofibroblast differentiation, TERC deficiency also leads to marked cellular infiltrations of a mononuclear cell population positive for the leukocyte common antigen CD45, low-affinity Fc receptor CD16/CD32, and pattern recognition receptor CD11b in the lungs. Our data demonstrate for the first time that telomerase deficiency triggers alveolar stem cell replicative senescence-associated low-grade inflammation, thereby driving pulmonary premature aging, alveolar sac formation, and fibrotic lesion."
https://openalex.org/W2234248432,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Approximately 75% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor-α (ERα) positive, underscoring the dependence of cancer cells on estrogen for growth and survival. Patients treated with endocrine therapy often develop resistance, either de novo or acquired, which in some cases is caused by aberrations within the growth factor signaling pathways. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has emerged as a critical node in estrogenic signaling. We have previously shown that mTORC1 can phosphorylate and activate ERα on S167 via its effector—the 40S ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). Presently, we have uncovered a direct link between mTORC1 and ERα. We found that ERα binds to regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) and causes it to translocate to the nucleus upon estrogen stimulation. In addition, we identified mTOR as the kinase that phosphorylates ERα on S104/106 and activates transcription of ER target genes. Our findings show a direct link between mTORC1 and ERα, which further implicates mTORC1 signaling in the pathogenesis of ER-positive breast cancer and provides rationale for FDA-approved use of mTORC1 inhibitors in combination with endocrine agents for treatment of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2137135650,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, and AGO2 is essential for miRNA activity. In this study, we focused on the regulation of AGO2 by miR-346 and the consequences in cervical cancer cells. miR-346 enhanced the expression of AGO2, resulting in the increased activity of other miRNAs and contributing to the malignancy of HeLa cells. GRSF1 participated in the regulation of AGO2 by miR-346, and the middle sequence of miR-346 was vital for the synergy effect of miR-346 and GRSF1. We determined that miR-346 promoted the migration and invasion of HeLa cells. In summary, we are the first to report that AGO2 is regulated positively by miRNA and that GRSF1 participates in the miRNA pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2263583031,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare, but highly malignant primary hepatobiliary cancer with a very poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Our recent studies reported that conjugated bile acids (CBAs) promote the invasive growth of CCA via activation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the most abundant prostaglandin in various human malignancies including CCA. Previous studies have indicated that COX-2 was highly expressed in CCA tissues, and the survival rate of CCA patients was negatively associated with high COX-2 expression levels. It has also been reported that CBAs induce COX-2 expression, whereas free bile acids inhibit COX-2 expression in CCA mouse models. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms and connection between S1PR2 and COX-2 expression in CCA cells have still not been fully elucidated. In the current study, we examined the role of S1PR2 in conjugated bile acid (taurocholate, (TCA))-induced COX-2 expression in a human HuCCT1 CCA cell line and further identified the potential underlying cellular mechanisms. The results indicated that TCA-induced invasive growth of human CCA cells was correlated with S1PR2-medated up-regulation of COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. Inhibition of S1PR2 activation with chemical antagonist (JTE-013) or down-regulation of S1PR2 expression with gene-specific shRNA not only reduced COX-2 expression, but also inhibited TCA-induced activation of EGFR and the ERK1/2/Akt-NF-κB signaling cascade. In conclusion, S1PR2 plays a critical role in TCA-induced COX-2 expression and CCA growth and may represent a novel therapeutic target for CCA.

For the cell invasion assay, drugs were added into medium in the upper chamber of the Matrigel pre-coated transwell. The stem loop sequences of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specifically targeting human S1PR2 and the scrambled control shRNA plasmid were gifts from Dr. Murthy Karnam (Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). HuCCT1 cells were transiently transfected with the control shRNA or S1PR2 shRNA plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000, as described previously (20Studer E. Zhou X. Zhao R. Wang Y. Takabe K. Nagahashi M.

PGE2 levels in the supernatant were determined using a high sensitivity ELISA kit (Enzo Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Safire2 microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland) was used to detect the absorbance at 405 nm. HuCCT1 cells and HuCCT1 cells transfected with control shRNA or S1PR2 shRNA were seeded in the upper chamber of the BD Biocoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber (BD Bioscience) and cultured in complete medium with 1% FBS. Cells were pretreated with JTE-013 (10 μm), Celecoxib (40 μm), or DMSO (vehicle control) for 1 h, then treated with TCA (100 μm), S1P (100 nm), or DMSO and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. At the end of treatment, noninvasive cells were removed from the top surface of the upper chamber membrane. Invasive cells that migrated to lower surface were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution. Invasive cells were counted and the invasion index was analyzed as previously described (18Liu R. Zhao R. Zhou X. Liang X. Campbell D.J. Zhang X. Zhang L. Shi R. Wang G. Pandak W.M. Sirica A.E.

HuCCT1 cells were seeded into 96-well plates with glass bottoms (Matrical Bioscience, USA) and cultured overnight in serum-free medium. After treatment with TCA or S1P with or without JTE-013, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 45 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min, and blocked with 3% BSA for 45 min. Cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-NF-κB p65 antibody (1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, staining of the intracellular and nuclear NF-κB p65 was visualized under an Olympus IX81 motorized inverted fluorescence microscope with a ×60 oil objective (Olympus, Japan). HEK293 cells were plated into 6-well plates with coverslips. Cells were cultured overnight to 60% confluence and transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA (pcDNA3.1–3xHA-tagged S1PR2) using PolyJetTM DNA In Vitro Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 24 h of transfection, cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight, then stimulated with TCA (100 μm), S1P (100 nm), or vehicle control for 10 min. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. The expression and localization of S1PR2 were monitored using immunofluorescence staining with anti-HA antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. The images were recorded using Zeiss Axio Imager A1 fluorescence microscope with a ×100 oil objective (Jenamed, Carl Zeiss, Germany). All data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. One-way ANOVA analysis of variance and Student's t test were employed to analyze the differences between sets of data.

Our recent studies showed that CBA (TCA) promoted invasive cell growth via activation of S1PR2 in both rat and human CCA cell lines (18Liu R. Zhao R. Zhou X. Liang X. Campbell D.J. Zhang X. Zhang L.

However, whether activation of S1PR2 also contributes to CBA-mediated expression of COX-2 and PG synthesis remained unknown. Therefore, we first examined the effect of TCA on COX-2 expression in human HuCCT1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, TCA significantly increased COX-2 protein levels in a time-dependent manner, peaking at 8 h. TCA-induced COX-2 expression was also dose-dependent (Fig. 1, C and D). To define the role of S1PR2 in TCA-induced COX-2 expression, a chemical antagonist of S1PR2, JTE-013, was used. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, both S1P- and TCA-induced COX-2 expression was markedly inhibited by JTE-013. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 2, C–E, down-regulation of S1PR2 using a S1PR2 shRNA significantly blocked TCA-induced COX-2 expression.FIGURE 2The role of S1PR2 in TCA-induced COX-2 expression in HuCCT1 cells. Cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight and then treated with S1P (100 nm) or TCA (100 μm) with or without JTE-013 (10 μm) for 8 h. At the end of treatment, total protein was isolated to determine COX-2 protein levels using Western blot analysis. A, representative images of the immunoblots for COX-2 and actin are shown.

Previous study from the laboratory of Dr. Wu reported that COX-2-derived PGE2 regulates human CCA cell growth (9Wu T. Cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin signaling in cholangiocarcinoma.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 135-150PubMed Google Scholar). Our study also showed that TCA significantly increased PGE2 production in HuCCT1 cells (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, TCA-induced PGE2 production was significantly inhibited by JTE-013. However, both S1P and TCA had no effect on COX-1 protein expression in HuCCT1 cells at the protein level (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, we examined the effect of S1P and TCA on the mRNA expression of two inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, both S1P and TCA significantly induced mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF-α, which was attenuated by JTE-013. These results suggest that S1PR2 may be a key regulator in TCA-mediated COX-2 expression, PGE2 production, and chronic inflammation. Although several studies have reported that CBAs promote CCA cell growth and invasion, the contribution of TCA-induced S1PR2 activation and COX-2 expression on CCA cell invasion has not been examined (15Dai J.

In recent years both P-waves and the BSPM have been used to identify the mechanisms underlying AF, such as localizing ectopic foci or high-frequency rotors. However, the relationship between the activation of the different areas of the atria and the characteristics of the BSPM and P-wave signals are still far from being completely understood. In this work we developed a multi-scale framework, which combines a highly-detailed 3D atrial model and a torso model to study the relationship between atrial activation and surface signals in sinus rhythm. Using this multi scale model, it was revealed that the best places for recording P-waves are the frontal upper right and the frontal and rear left quadrants of the torso. Our results also suggest that only nine regions (of the twenty-one structures in which the atrial surface was divided) make a significant contribution to the BSPM and determine the main P-wave characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1957511454,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have important roles in tumorigenesis. Although IGF2BP3, an evolutionally conserved RBP, has been reported as a useful diagnostic marker for various cancers and has been considered a regulator of tumorigenesis, little is known of the function of IGF2BP3 because of lack of information regarding IGF2BP3 target mRNAs. Here, we report the identification of IGF2BP3 target mRNAs and IGF2BP3 function in cancer proliferation. We identified mRNAs with altered expression in IGF2BP3-depleted cells by massive sequencing analysis and IGF2BP3-binding RNAs by immunoprecipitation of IGF2BP3 followed by massive sequencing analysis, resulting in the identification of 110 candidates that are negatively regulated by IGF2BP3. We found that IGF2BP3 destabilized EIF4E-BP2 and MEIS3 mRNAs. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the interaction between IGF2BP3 and ribonucleases such as XRN2 and exosome component. The retarded proliferation of IGF2BP3-depleted cells was partially rescued by the depletion of EIF4E-BP2, which negatively regulates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), an activator of translation and a well-known proto-oncogene. Consistent with this observation, IGF2BP3 depletion reduced phosphorylated eIF4E, the active form, and translational efficiency of eIF4E target transcripts. Reduction of phosphorylated eIF4E by IGF2BP3 depletion was rescued by EIF4E-BP2 depletion. At last, we found an inverse correlation between the expression level of IGF2BP3 and EIF4E-BP2 in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Together, these results suggest that IGF2BP3 promotes eIF4E-mediated translational activation through the reduction of EIF4E-BP2 via mRNA degradation, leading to enhanced cell proliferation. This is the first report demonstrating that IGF2BP3 is an RNA-destabilizing factor. Notably, here we provide the first evidence for the functional linkage between two previously well-known cancer biomarkers, IGF2BP3 and eIF4E."
https://openalex.org/W2132159440,"Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread protozoan parasite infecting nearly all warm-blooded organisms. Asexual reproduction of the parasite within its host cells is achieved by consecutive lytic cycles, which necessitates biogenesis of significant energy and biomass. Here we show that glucose and glutamine are the two major physiologically important nutrients used for the synthesis of macromolecules (ATP, nucleic acid, proteins, and lipids) in T. gondii, and either of them is sufficient to ensure the parasite survival. The parasite can counteract genetic ablation of its glucose transporter by increasing the flux of glutamine-derived carbon through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and by concurrently activating gluconeogenesis, which guarantee a continued biogenesis of ATP and biomass for host-cell invasion and parasite replication, respectively. In accord, a pharmacological inhibition of glutaminolysis or oxidative phosphorylation arrests the lytic cycle of the glycolysis-deficient mutant, which is primarily a consequence of impaired invasion due to depletion of ATP. Unexpectedly, however, intracellular parasites continue to proliferate, albeit slower, notwithstanding a simultaneous deprivation of glucose and glutamine. A growth defect in the glycolysis-impaired mutant is caused by a compromised synthesis of lipids, which cannot be counterbalanced by glutamine but can be restored by acetate. Consistently, supplementation of parasite cultures with exogenous acetate can amend the lytic cycle of the glucose transport mutant. Such plasticity in the parasite's carbon flux enables a growth-and-survival trade-off in assorted nutrient milieus, which may underlie the promiscuous survival of T. gondii tachyzoites in diverse host cells.

Our results also indicate a convergence of parasite metabolism with cancer cells. Toxoplasma gondii is an opportunistic intracellular pathogen of the phylum Apicomplexa that inflicts life-threatening acute and chronic infections in humans and animals (1Dubey J.P. Lindsay D.S. Speer C.A. Structures of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites, bradyzoites, and sporozoites and biology and development of tissue cysts.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 267-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The parasite causes ocular and cerebral toxoplasmosis and sporadic abortion/stillbirth as a consequence of severe tissue necrosis in individuals with a poor or weakened immunity, e.g. neonates, AIDS, and organ-transplantation patients. The lytic cycle of T. gondii starts with the active energy-dependent invasion of host cells by the tachyzoite stage that is followed by rapid intracellular replication, egress by host-cell lysis, and reinvasion of adjacent cells. Upon infection of host cells in vitro, one tachyzoite can usually produce 32–64 daughter cells within a nonfusogenic vacuole, which provides a safe niche for the parasite replication and an interface for acquisition of host resources (1Dubey J.P. Lindsay D.S. Speer C.A. Structures of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites, bradyzoites, and sporozoites and biology and development of tissue cysts.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 267-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such an efficient asexual reproduction and concomitant expansion of the parasite vacuole requires a significant nutritional import and biomass synthesis within the parasite. Moreover, tachyzoites likely need to adjust metabolism according to variable bioenergetic demands of extracellular and intracellular states as well as to the nutritional cues in distinct host cells encountered by the parasite during its natural life cycle. Tachyzoites encode all major pathways of central carbon metabolism including glycolysis, TCA cycle, pentose phosphate shunt and gluconeogenesis (2Kissinger J.C. Gajria B. Li L. Paulsen I.T. Roos D.S.

It has also been shown that T. gondii has repurposed a branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase for connecting glycolysis to the TCA cycle (8Oppenheim R.D. Creek D.J. Macrae J.I. Modrzynska K.K.

BCKDH: the missing link in apicomplexan mitochondrial metabolism is required for full virulence of Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium berghei.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1004263Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase converts glucose-derived pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and seems to substitute for pyruvate dehydrogenase, located in the parasite apicoplast (a non-photosynthetic plastid relict) instead of being in the mitochondrion (3Fleige T. Fischer K. Ferguson D.J. Gross U. Bohne W.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase produces the precursor acetyl-CoA for de novo synthesis of acyl chains via fatty acid synthase 2 pathway (FAS2) in the apicoplast of T. gondii (10Mazumdar J. H Wilson E. Masek K. A Hunter C. Striepen B. Apicoplast fatty acid synthesis is essential for organelle biogenesis and parasite survival in Toxoplasma gondii.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13192-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In free-living organisms the aforementioned four routes of carbon metabolism constitute a metabolic hub to ensure the biomass, energy, and redox demands during cell proliferation as well as differentiation. The scope and extent to which these pathways satisfy the bioenergetic obligations during the intracellular and extracellular stages of T. gondii, is poorly understood, however. In particular, the following queries remain to be resolved: (a) does the Δtggt1 mutant indeed lack a glycolytic flux, especially when intracellular with access to host-derived metabolites; (b) what underlies such a modest growth defect in the mutant given the extensive and diverse metabolic usage of glucose; (c) how important is glutamine-derived carbon for parasite growth and survival; (d) how is metabolism of the two nutrients balanced to accommodate the biogenesis of macromolecules; (e) what are the actual mechanisms that ensure parasite survival in different milieus? Here, we show the mutual cooperation and importance of glucose, glutamine, and acetate metabolism in T. gondii while emphasizing the impact of parasite's metabolic potential on its pathogenesis and adaptation.

The plasmid for tagging and knock-out (pTKO) was provided by John Boothroyd (Stanford School of Medicine). Tachyzoites of the specified strains were maintained by periodic passage in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF). Host cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), glucose (4.5 g/liter), glutamine (2 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm) non-essential amino acids (required for minimum essential medium), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). Freshly egressed tachyzoites were used to infect confluent monolayers of HFF at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and cultured every second day unless stated otherwise. To prepare extracellular parasites for biochemical assays, infected host cells were grown in standard culture medium (multiplicity of infection 3; 40–44 h infection). Parasitized cultures were scraped in ice-cold PBS and extruded through 23G (1×) and 27G (2×) syringes, followed by filtering (5 μm) and centrifugation (400 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Parasites were suspended in a defined medium (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μm CaCl2, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, MEM vitamins, MEM amino acids, nonessential amino acids, pH 7.4 (17Gupta N.

Chem. 2005; 280: 16345-16353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) for metabolic labeling assays. To test the viability, extracellular tachyzoites were mixed with 0.6% fluorescein diacetate and ethidium bromide solution and incubated for 5 min. Cells were visualized for green (viable) and/or red (dead) fluorescence signal. Our isolation procedure typically yielded viable extracellular parasites free of host-cell debris; a minor contribution of host metabolites cannot be entirely excluded, however. The deletion of TgGT1 gene was performed in the RHΔku80-TaTi strain, essentially as shown before for the RH hxgprt− strain of T. gondii (5Blume M. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Landfear S. Fleige T.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12998-13003Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, the knock-out construct contained 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR of the TgGT1 gene (2.7 kb each) flanking the chloramphenicol resistance cassette in the pTUB8CAT vector. Tachyzoites (107) were transfected with the plasmid (10 μg) and selected with chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) (18Kim K. Soldati D. Boothroyd J.C. Gene replacement in Toxoplasma gondii with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as selectable marker.Science. 1993; 262: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Individual clones lacking TgGT1 expression (Δtggt1) were isolated by recombination-specific PCR screening of genomic DNA (5Blume M. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Landfear S. Fleige T. Soldati-Favre D.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12998-13003Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The newly generated Δtggt1 strain differs from the former mutant with respect to the parental genotype (RHΔku80-TaTi instead of RH-hxgprt−). The RHΔku80-TaTi strain (13Sheiner L. Demerly J.L. Poulsen N. Beatty W.L. Lucas O. Behnke M.S. White M.W. Striepen B. A systematic screen to discover and analyze apicoplast proteins identifies a conserved and essential protein import factor.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002392Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) offers two specific advantages; (a) first, the strain is deficient in non-homologous end-joining DNA repair (Δku80) (11Fox B.A. Ristuccia J.G. Gigley J.P. Bzik D.J. Efficient gene replacements in Toxoplasma gondii strains deficient for nonhomologous end joining.Eukaryotic cell. 2009; 8: 520-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 12Huynh M.H. Carruthers V.B. Tagging of endogenous genes in a Toxoplasma gondii strain lacking Ku80.Eukaryotic cell. 2009; 8: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and thus more amenable to homologous recombination-mediated genetic manipulation; (b) second, the TaTi (trans-activator trap identified) genotype permits conditional knockouts using the tetracycline-repressible transactivator system (19Meissner M. Schlüter D. Soldati D. Role of Toxoplasma gondii myosin A in powering parasite gliding and host cell invasion.Science. 2002; 298: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). These features together enable a comprehensive dissection of carbon metabolism in T. gondii that has not been so feasible otherwise. A complemented (Δtggt1-TgGT1) strain expressing the open reading frame of TgGT1 under the control of the NTP3-5′-UTR and 3′-UTR was produced by pyrimethamine (1 μm) selection (20Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Stable molecular transformation of Toxoplasma gondii: a selectable dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase marker based on drug-resistance mutations in malaria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). A single putative ACS, TGGT1_266640, was identified in the parasite genome (ToxoDB) by similarity with ACS sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YAL054C and YLR153C; Saccharomyces Genome Database). The open reading frame of TgACS was cloned, sequenced, and deposited to the NCBI GenBankTM database (accession number, KR013277). For C-terminal HA tagging of the endogenous TgACS protein, we amplified the 3′-end of the gene using CTCATCCCACCGGTCACCTGGAGTGGAAATGAAATCGAAGGG (the underline indicates the XcmI restriction site) and CTCATCGAATTCCTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAAGCTTTCGCAAGAGAGCCC (the underline indicates the in-frame HA tag and EcoRI restriction site) as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The amplicon was cloned into pTKO-HXGPRT vector using XcmI and EcoRI enzymes. Tachyzoites (107) of the RHΔku80-hxgprt− strain were transfected with PstI-linearized construct (10 μg), and parasites expressing TgACS-HA under the regulation of native promoter and TgGRA2–3′-UTR were drug-selected with mycophenolic acid (25 μg/ml) and xanthine (50 μg/ml), as described elsewhere (21Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). HFF host cells grown on glass coverslips were infected with the parasite strain expressing TgACS-HA. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min), followed by neutralization with 0.1% glycine in PBS (5 min). Samples were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (20 min), blocked with 2% BSA solution in 0.2% Triton X-100 and then stained with mouse αHA (1:1000) and rabbit αTgHsp90 (1:3000) antibodies. They were washed 3 times with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa488- and anti-rabbit Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000), followed by 3× washing with PBS and mounting in DAPI-fluoromount G solution. Images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope equipped with AxioVision software (ApoTome, Zeiss, Germany). For immunoblot analysis, extracellular tachyzoites (∼2 × 107) were washed once with PBS (400 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Samples were first probed with rabbit anti-HA (1:3000, 2 h) and mouse anti-TgSag1 (1:1500, 2 h) as the primary antibodies and then with IRDye® 680RD and IRDye® 800CW as the secondary antibodies (1:15,000, 1 h). Comparative growths of the indicated parasite strains were determined by plaque assays, which represent successive rounds of lytic cycles. Fresh extracellular tachyzoites (250) were used to infect PBS-washed confluent HFF monolayers in 6-well plates. Infected cells were cultured unperturbed for 7 days (37 °C, 5% CO2) in standard medium supplemented with normal FCS (10%) or with dialyzed FCS (10%) and additives as indicated. Samples were fixed with cold methanol (−80 °C) and stained with crystal violet for 10 min. Plaques were imaged and analyzed using the ImageJ program (National Institutes of Health). The parasite replication was examined by infecting HFF with 105 tachyzoites on glass coverslips placed in 24-well plates. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 24 h post-infection and stained with rabbit αTgGap45 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa594 antibodies, as described above. Immunostained images were used to count the parasites replicating in vacuoles. To assess invasion rates, fresh extracellular tachyzoites were suspended in standard culture medium with dialyzed serum (10%) and additives as indicated in figure legends. Subsequently, HFF cells seeded on glass coverslips were infected with fresh tachyzoites (4 × 105, 1 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Parasitized cells were stained with mouse αTgSag1 antibody (1:1500) before permeabilization and incubated with rabbit αTgGap45 antibody (1:3000) after treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Samples were then treated with goat anti-mouse Alexa488 and anti-rabbit Alexa594 antibodies (1:3000) before mounting in DAPI-fluoromount G solution. Immunofluorescence imaging was performed using the ApoTome microscope equipped with AxioVision software (Zeiss, Germany). Intracellular and extracellular parasites were identified by differential staining with TgGap45 only or with TgSag1 and TgGap45 antibodies, respectively. We also performed synchronized invasion assays following Kafsack et al. (22Kafsack B.F. Beckers C. Carruthers V.B. Synchronous invasion of host cells by Toxoplasma gondii.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, HFF cells grown on glass coverslips were infected with fresh syringe-released parasites (4 × 105) either in standard culture medium (control) or high potassium buffer (44.7 mm K2SO4, 10 mm MgSO4, 106 mm sucrose, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm Tris, 3.5 mg BSA/ml, pH 8.2). Parasites were allowed to settle for 30 min before medium was carefully replaced by standard culture medium (0.005 mm potassium) with or without 2 mm glutamine. Invasion assay was performed for 1 h, and samples were immunostained, as described above. Tachyzoites of the indicated strains were labeled either during extracellular or intracellular stages. Extracellular parasites were prepared by syringe extrusion and filtering and washed 2× with ice-cold PBS. Purified parasites (108) were suspended in a defined labeling medium (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μm CaCl2, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, MEM vitamins, MEM amino acids, nonessential amino acids, pH 7.4 (17Gupta N. Zahn M.M. Coppens I. Joiner K.A. Voelker D.R. Selective disruption of phosphatidylcholine metabolism of the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii arrests its growth.J. Biol.

The reactions were performed in a humidified incubator (4 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2). Metabolism was quenched by rapid cooling on ice, followed by centrifugation (400 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and 2× washing of the parasite samples with ice-cold PBS. The parasite pellet was subjected to metabolite extraction, as described below. For intracellular labeling, parasites replicating in host cells (multiplicity of infection 3; 40 h infection) were incubated in standard culture medium containing either 5 mm [U-13C]glucose and 2 mm glutamine or 5 mm glucose and 2 mm [U-13C]glutamine (4 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2). Parasites were then purified for metabolite extraction by syringe extrusion and filtering, as stated above. Parasites (108) were suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold mixture of chloroform:methanol:water (1:3:1 v/v), and metabolites were extracted for 20 min at 60 °C, as described previously (7MacRae J.I. Sheiner L. Nahid A. Tonkin C. Striepen B. McConville M.J.

After induction of phase separation with 0.4 ml of water, the polar phase was dried under vacuum, and the dry residue was derivatized in two steps, first with 2 μl of 4% solution of methoxyamine in pyridine (90 min, 30 °C), followed by the addition of 18 μl of MSTFA (N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide; 30 min, 37 °C).3 μl of the derivatized solution were injected onto the column for GC-MS analysis using Pegasus IV instrument (Leco Corp.), as reported elsewhere (23Lisec J. Schauer N. Kopka J. Willmitzer L. Fernie A.R. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling in plants.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Data extraction was performed using Leco ChromaTOF software. Metabolites were identified by fragmentation pattern using reference standards from the Golm metabolome database and by matching the retention index to the standard library of metaSysX GmbH. Inclusion of stable isotopes was calculated essentially as reported elsewhere (24Jung J.-Y. Oh M.-K. Isotope labeling pattern study of central carbon metabolites using GC/MS.J. Chromatogr. B. 2015; 974: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We identified an m/z peak corresponding to the intact or poorly fragmented derivatized analyte (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Centroid intensity of the unlabeled peak (M) or intensities of the labeled peaks with isotope inclusion from M+1 to M+n (where n corresponds to the number of carbons in underivatized metabolite) were used to quantify the incorporation of [13C]glucose and [13C]glutamine. The correction for the natural abundance of the stable isotopes present in the unlabeled precursors and in the trimethylsilyl derivatization group was performed assuming that M+1 analyte includes input from the natural isotopes in M (13C with a rate of natural occurrence equal to 1.1% or from 29Si with a rate of natural occurrence equal to 4.7%). Likewise, M+2 analyte includes input from M (30Si with a rate of natural occurrence equal to 3.02%) or from M+1, and M+3 analyte includes input from M+1 or from M+2, and so forth. Inclusion of isotopes was determined as the percentage of the sum of intensities of the labeled peaks to the total intensity of all detected isotopomers for a given metabolite (supplemental Table S1). Fractional abundance of 13C atoms as well as of individual isotopomers is shown for all those metabol"
https://openalex.org/W1922891700,"The endothelin-1 (ET-1)/ET A receptor (ETAR) signalling pathway is a well-established driver of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) progression. One key process promoted by ET-1 is tumor cell invasion, which requires the scaffolding functions of β-arrestin-1 (β-arr1) downstream of the receptor; however, the potential role of ET-1 in inducing invadopodia, which are crucial for cellular invasion and tumor metastasis, is completely unknown. We describe here that ET-1/ETAR, through β-arr1, activates RhoA and RhoC GTPase and downstream ROCK (Rho-associated coiled coil-forming kinase) kinase activity, promoting actin-based dynamic remodelling and enhanced cell invasion. This is accomplished by the direct interaction of β-arr1 with PDZ-RhoGEF (postsynaptic density protein 95/disc-large/zonula occludens-RhoGEF). Interestingly, ETAR-mediated invasive properties are related to the regulation of invadopodia, as evaluated by colocalization of actin with cortactin, as well as with TKS5 and MT1-MMP (membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase) with areas of matrix degradation, and activation of cofilin pathway, which is crucial for regulating invadopodia activity. Depletion of PDZ-RhoGEF, or β-arr1, or RhoC, as well as the treatment with the dual ET-1 receptor antagonist macitentan, significantly impairs invadopodia function, MMP activity and invasion, demonstrating that β-arr1/PDZ-RhoGEF interaction mediates ETAR-driven ROCK-LIMK-cofilin pathway through the control of RhoC activity. In vivo, macitentan is able to inhibit metastatic dissemination and cofilin phosphorylation. Collectively, our data unveil a noncanonical activation of the RhoC/ROCK pathway through the β-arr1/PDZ-RhoGEF complex as a regulator of ETAR-induced motility and metastasis, establishing ET-1 axis as a novel regulator of invadopodia protrusions through the RhoC/ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway during the initial steps of EOC invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2209556632,"Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced in the gut by bacterial fermentation of poorly digested carbohydrates. A key mediator of their actions is the G protein-coupled free fatty acid 2 (FFA2) receptor, and this has been suggested as a therapeutic target for the treatment of both metabolic and inflammatory diseases. However, a lack of understanding of the molecular determinants dictating how ligands bind to this receptor has hindered development. We have developed a novel radiolabeled FFA2 antagonist to probe ligand binding to FFA2, and in combination with mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies, we define how agonist and antagonist ligands interact with the receptor. Although both agonist and antagonist ligands contain negatively charged carboxylates that interact with two key positively charged arginine residues in transmembrane domains V and VII of FFA2, there are clear differences in how these interactions occur. Specifically, although agonists require interaction with both arginine residues to bind the receptor, antagonists require an interaction with only one of the two. Moreover, different chemical series of antagonist interact preferentially with different arginine residues. A homology model capable of rationalizing these observations was developed and provides a tool that will be invaluable for identifying improved FFA2 agonists and antagonists to further define function and therapeutic opportunities of this receptor.

Mapping of key residues that contribute to the function of the SCFAs at both FFA2 and FFA3 demonstrated that mutation of either of a pair of arginine residues, one in transmembrane domain (TMD) V at position 1805.39 (Ballesteros and Weinstein (8Ballesteros J.A.

Moreover, a pair of histidine residues in TMDs IV and VI, at positions 1404.56 and 2426.55, also played important roles in defining the binding pocket for the SCFAs or their function (9Stoddart L.A.

There is a degree of selectivity in rank-order of potency for the SCFAs between FFA2 and FFA3 with FFA2 preferentially activated by the shorter SCFAs (4Stoddart L.A. Smith N.J. Milligan G.

However, the selectivity is modest, and C3 is the most potent SCFA on both receptors, limiting the ability to use SCFAs to define the specific roles of FFA2 and FFA3 (12Tolhurst G. Heffron H. Lam Y.S. Parker H.E. Habib A.M. Diakogiannaki E. Cameron J. Grosse J. Reimann F. Gribble F.M.

This is compounded because the absolute potency of the SCFAs also varies between human and rodent orthologs of the receptors (13Hudson B.D. Tikhonova I.G. Pandey S.K. Ulven T. Milligan G.

As such, the availability of higher potency and selective synthetic agonists and antagonists would greatly assist efforts to explore the specific function of FFA2 over FFA3. However, few such ligands have been described to date (14Ulven T. Short-chain free fatty acid receptors FFA2/GPR43 and FFA3/GPR41 as new potential therapeutic targets.Front.

The first reported synthetic FFA2-selective agonists were a group of phenylacetamides exemplified by 4-chloro-α-(1-methylethyl)-N-2-thiazolylbenzeneacetamide (16Smith N.J. Ward R.J. Stoddart L.A.

However, these clearly did not share the same binding site as the SCFAs as they were fully active at forms of FFA2 in which either Arg-1805.39 or Arg-2557.35 was altered to alanine (16Smith N.J.

In efforts to identify FFA2-selective agonists that share the same binding site as the SCFAs and are therefore orthosteric in action, we showed that (R)-3-benzyl-4-(cyclopropyl-(4-(2,5-dichlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)amino)-4-oxobutanoic acid (Cmp 1) is a relatively potent and highly selective agonist of both hFFA2 and murine (m)FFA2 (10Hudson B.D.

Chem. 2013; 288: 17296-17312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Like the SCFAs, this ligand contains a carboxylate function, and therefore, on this basis, it was not unexpected when the activity of Cmp 1 was also shown to be lacking in either the R180A5.39 or R255A7.35 mutants of hFFA2 (10Hudson B.D. Due-Hansen M.E. Christiansen E. Hansen A.M. Mackenzie A.E. Murdoch H. Pandey S.K. Ward R.J. Marquez R. Tikhonova I.G. Ulven T. Milligan G.

Chem. 2013; 288: 17296-17312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The lack of function for Cmp 1 and the SCFAs at mutants R180A5.39 or R255A7.35 has generally been taken to suggest that the carboxylate of these ligands form ionic interactions with these arginine residues, and therefore the lack of function results from a lack of binding. However, as binding assays for FFA2 have not been available, it has not been possible to directly test this hypothesis. Therefore, in this study we have developed a radioligand binding assay for FFA2 based on a recently reported FFA2-selective antagonist, 4-[[(R)-1-(benzo[b]thiophene-3-carbonyl)-2-methyl-azetidine-2-carbonyl]-(3-chlorobenzyl)amino]-butyric acid (GLPG0974) (19Pizzonero M.

Chem. 2014; 57: 10044-10057Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and we used this in combination with receptor mutation studies and molecular modeling to define how agonist and antagonist ligands interact with this receptor. Through this we demonstrate that although both Arg-1805.39 and Arg-2557.35 are required for agonist binding, only one of these residues is required for high affinity antagonist binding. FFA2 ligands Cmp 1 and CATPB ((S)-3-(2-(3-chlorophenyl)acetamido)-4-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) butanoic acid) were synthesized as described previously (10Hudson B.D. Due-Hansen M.E. Christiansen E.

We studied how oral immunotherapy (OIT) with milk proteins controlled allergy in sensitized mice (cholera toxin plus milk proteins) upon exposure to the allergen. Symptoms were alleviated, skin test was negativized, serum specific IgE and IgG1 were abrogated, a substantial reduction in the secretion of IL-5 and IL-13 by antigen-stimulated spleen cells was observed, while IL-13 gene expression in jejunum was down-regulated, and IL-10 and TGF-β were increased. In addition, we observed an induction of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells and IL-10- and TGF-β-producing regulatory T cells in the lamina propria. Finally, transfer experiments confirmed the central role of these cells in tolerance induction. We demonstrated that the oral administration of milk proteins pre- or post-sensitization controlled the Th2-immune response through the elicitation of mucosal IL-10- and TGF-β-producing Tregs that inhibited hypersensitivity symptoms and the allergic response."
https://openalex.org/W2415496715,"Tumor-specific alternative splicing is implicated in the progression of cancer, including clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Using ccRCC RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we found that epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 (ESRP2), one of the key regulators of alternative splicing in epithelial cells, is expressed in ccRCC. ESRP2 mRNA expression did not correlate with the overall survival rate of ccRCC patients, but the expression of some ESRP-target exons correlated with the good prognosis and with the expression of Arkadia (also known as RNF111) in ccRCC. Arkadia physically interacted with ESRP2, induced polyubiquitination and modulated its splicing function. Arkadia and ESRP2 suppressed ccRCC tumor growth in a coordinated manner. Lower expression of Arkadia correlated with advanced tumor stages and poor outcomes in ccRCC patients. This study thus reveals a novel tumor-suppressive role of the Arkadia-ESRP2 axis in ccRCC."

https://openalex.org/W1949751878,"Along with the well-established effects on fertility and fecundity, perinatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, and notably to xeno-estrogens, is strongly suspected of modulating general metabolism. The metabolism of a perinatally exposed individual may be durably altered leading to a higher susceptibility of developing metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes; however, experimental designs involving the long term study of these dynamic changes in the metabolome raise novel challenges. 1H-NMR-based metabolomics was applied to study the effects of bisphenol-A (BPA, 0; 0.25; 2.5, 25 and 250 μg/kg BW/day) in rats exposed perinatally. Serum and liver samples of exposed animals were analyzed on days 21, 50, 90, 140 and 200 in order to explore whether maternal exposure to BPA alters metabolism. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was independently applied to each time point, demonstrating a significant pair-wise discrimination for liver as well as serum samples at all time-points, and highlighting unequivocal metabolic shifts in rats perinatally exposed to BPA, including those exposed to lower doses. In BPA exposed animals, metabolism of glucose, lactate and fatty acids was modified over time. To further explore dynamic variation, ANOVA-Simultaneous Component Analysis (A-SCA) was used to separate data into blocks corresponding to the different sources of variation (Time, Dose and Time*Dose interaction). A-SCA enabled the demonstration of a dynamic, time/age dependent shift of serum metabolome throughout the rats' lifetimes. Variables responsible for the discrimination between groups clearly indicate that BPA modulates energy metabolism, and suggest alterations of neurotransmitter signaling, the latter finding being compatible with the neurodevelopmental effect of this xenoestrogen. In conclusion, long lasting metabolic effects of BPA could be characterized over 200 days, despite physiological (and thus metabolic) changes connected with sexual maturation and aging."
https://openalex.org/W2272180382,"Vitamin D is postulated to decrease the risk of breast cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation via the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VDR gene, rs1544410 (BsmI) and rs2228570 (FokI), are inconsistently associated with breast cancer risk in Caucasian populations, while data for Asians are scarce. Here, we investigated the possible contribution of these SNPs to breast cancer risk in Pakistani breast cancer patients and in controls participating in a hospital-based breast cancer case-control study (PAK-BCCC).Genotyping of the BsmI and FokI SNPs was performed by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of 463 genetically enriched female breast cancer cases with known BRCA1/2 status and in 1,012 controls from Pakistan. The association between SNP genotypes and breast cancer risk was investigated by logistic regression adjusted for potential breast cancer risk factors and stratified by BRCA1/2 status and family history. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.The b allele of the BsmI was associated with an increased breast cancer risk (per b allele OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.49, P = 0.003). Subgroup analysis revealed that this effect was restricted to BRCA1/2 non-carriers (per b allele OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11-1.59, P = 0.002) and was stronger in those who reported a positive family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer (per b allele OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.20-2.22, P = 0.002). No association with breast cancer risk was detected for the FokI SNP.The BsmI polymorphism in the VDR gene may be associated with an increased breast cancer risk in Pakistani women negative for BRCA1/2 germline mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1903553665,"The REL gene, encoding the NF-κB subunit c-Rel, is frequently amplified in B-cell lymphoma and functions as a tumour-promoting transcription factor. Here we report the surprising result that c-rel-/- mice display significantly earlier lymphomagenesis in the c-Myc driven, Eμ-Myc model of B-cell lymphoma. c-Rel loss also led to earlier onset of disease in a separate TCL1-Tg-driven lymphoma model. Tumour reimplantation experiments indicated that this is an effect intrinsic to the Eμ-Myc lymphoma cells but, counterintuitively, c-rel-/- Eμ-Myc lymphoma cells were more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli. To learn more about why loss of c-Rel led to earlier onset of disease, microarray gene expression analysis was performed on B cells from 4-week-old, wild-type and c-rel-/- Eμ-Myc mice. Extensive changes in gene expression were not seen at this age, but among those transcripts significantly downregulated by the loss of c-Rel was the B-cell tumour suppressor BTB and CNC homology 2 (Bach2). Quantitative PCR and western blot analysis confirmed loss of Bach2 in c-Rel mutant Eμ-Myc tumours at both 4 weeks and the terminal stages of disease. Moreover, Bach2 expression was also downregulated in c-rel-/- TCL1-Tg mice and RelA Thr505Ala mutant Eμ-Myc mice. Analysis of wild-type Eμ-Myc mice demonstrated that the population expressing low levels of Bach2 exhibited the earlier onset of lymphoma seen in c-rel-/- mice. Confirming the relevance of these findings to human disease, analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data revealed that Bach2 is a c-Rel and NF-κB target gene in transformed human B cells, whereas treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma cells with inhibitors of the NF-κB/IκB kinase pathway or deletion of c-Rel or RelA resulted in loss of Bach2 expression. These data reveal a surprising tumour suppressor role for c-Rel in lymphoma development explained by regulation of Bach2 expression, underlining the context-dependent complexity of NF-κB signalling in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1927748519,"The MYC family of oncogenes encodes a set of three related transcription factors that are overexpressed in many human tumors and contribute to the cancer-related deaths of more than 70,000 Americans every year. MYC proteins drive tumorigenesis by interacting with co-factors that enable them to regulate the expression of thousands of genes linked to cell growth, proliferation, metabolism and genome stability. One effective way to identify critical co-factors required for MYC function has been to focus on sequence motifs within MYC that are conserved throughout evolution, on the assumption that their conservation is driven by protein-protein interactions that are vital for MYC activity. In addition to their DNA-binding domains, MYC proteins carry five regions of high sequence conservation known as Myc boxes (Mb). To date, four of the Mb motifs (MbI, MbII, MbIIIa and MbIIIb) have had a molecular function assigned to them, but the precise role of the remaining Mb, MbIV, and the reason for its preservation in vertebrate Myc proteins, is unknown. Here, we show that MbIV is required for the association of MYC with the abundant transcriptional coregulator host cell factor-1 (HCF-1). We show that the invariant core of MbIV resembles the tetrapeptide HCF-binding motif (HBM) found in many HCF-interaction partners, and demonstrate that MYC interacts with HCF-1 in a manner indistinguishable from the prototypical HBM-containing protein VP16. Finally, we show that rationalized point mutations in MYC that disrupt interaction with HCF-1 attenuate the ability of MYC to drive tumorigenesis in mice. Together, these data expose a molecular function for MbIV and indicate that HCF-1 is an important co-factor for MYC."
https://openalex.org/W1954135284,"ZFP521 was previously identified as a putative gene involved in induction of B-cell lymphomagenesis. However, the contribution of ZFP521 to lymphomagenesis has not been confirmed. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of ZFP521 in B-cell lymphomagenesis. To this end, we used a retroviral insertion method to show that ZFP521 was a target of mutagenesis in pre-B-lymphoblastic lymphoma cells. The pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling molecules BLNK, BTK and BANK1 were positively regulated by the ZFP521 gene, leading to enhancement of the pre-BCR signaling pathway. In addition, c-myc and c-jun were upregulated following activation of ZFP521. Stimulation of pre-BCR signaling using anti-Vpreb antibodies caused aberrant upregulation of c-myc and c-jun and of Ccnd3, which encodes cyclin D3, thereby inducing the growth of pre-B cells. Stimulation with Vpreb affected the growth of pre-B cells, and addition of interleukin (IL)-7 receptor exerted competitive effects on pre-B-cell growth. Knockdown of BTK and BANK1, targets of ZFP521, suppressed the effects of Vpreb stimulation on cell growth. Furthermore, in human lymphoblastic lymphoma, analogous to pre-B-cell lymphoma in mice, the expression of ZNF521, the homolog of ZFP521 in humans, was upregulated. In conclusion, our data showed that the ZFP521 gene comprehensively induced pre-B-cell lymphomagenesis by modulating the pre-B-cell receptor signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2212195257,"Often described as a mediator of cell cycle arrest or as a pro-apoptotic factor in stressful conditions, the MAP3K ZAK (Sterile alpha motif and leucine zipper-containing kinase) has also been proven to positively regulate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and WNT signaling pathways, cancer cell proliferation and cellular neoplastic transformation. Here, we show that both isoforms of ZAK, ZAK-α and ZAK-β are key factors in cancer cell migration. While ZAK depletion reduced cell motility of HeLa and HCT116 cells, its overexpression triggered the activation of all three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, as well as an increase in cell motion. On the contrary, the kinase-dead mutants, ZAK-α K45M and ZAK-β K45M, were not able to provoke such events, and instead exerted a dominant-negative effect on MAPK activation and cell migration. Pharmacological inhibition of ZAK by nilotinib, preventing ZAK-autophosphorylation and thereby auto-activation, led to the same results. Activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), we further showed that ZAK constitutes an essential element of the EGF/ERK-dependent cell migration pathway. Using public transcriptomic databases and tissue microarrays, we finally established that, as strong factors of the EGFR signaling pathway, ZAK-α and/or ZAK-β transcripts and protein(s) are frequently upregulated in colorectal adenoma and carcinoma patients. Notably, gene set enrichment analysis disclosed a significant correlation between ZAK+ colorectal premalignant lesions and gene sets belonging to the MAPK/ERK and motility-related signaling pathways of the reactome database, strongly suggesting that ZAK induces such pro-tumoral reaction cascades in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1897965600,"Epidermal homeostasis depends on the coordinated control of keratinocyte cell cycle. Differentiation and the alteration of this balance can result in neoplastic development. Here we report on a novel DLX3-dependent network that constrains epidermal hyperplasia and squamous tumorigenesis. By integrating genetic and transcriptomic approaches, we demonstrate that DLX3 operates through a p53-regulated network. DLX3 and p53 physically interact on the p21 promoter to enhance p21 expression. Elevating DLX3 in keratinocytes produces a G1-S blockade associated with p53 signature transcriptional profiles. In contrast, DLX3 loss promotes a mitogenic phenotype associated with constitutive activation of ERK. DLX3 expression is lost in human skin cancers and is extinguished during progression of experimentally induced mouse squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Reinstatement of DLX3 function is sufficient to attenuate the migration of SCC cells, leading to decreased wound closure. Our data establish the DLX3-p53 interplay as a major regulatory axis in epidermal differentiation and suggest that DLX3 is a modulator of skin carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1927312046,"A renewed interest in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains was sparked due to the appearance of an outbreak in 2011, causing 3,816 diarrheal cases and some deaths in Europe. The causative strain was classified as enteroaggregative E. coli of serotype O104:H4 that had acquired Shiga toxin genes. The ability of STEC O104:H4 to cause disease relies greatly on the bacteria’s capacity to colonize, persist, and produce Shiga toxin. However, not much is known about the colonization factors of this strain. Because long polar fimbriae (lpf) lpf1 and lpf2 operons encode important colonization factors in other STEC isolates and E. coli O104:H4 possesses both loci, we hypothesized that Lpf is required for adhesion and colonization. In this study, isogenic lpfA1 and lpfA2 major fimbrial subunit mutants were constructed. To determine their role in O104:H4’s virulence, we assessed their ability to adhere to non-polarized and polarized intestinal epithelial cells. The ΔlpfA1 showed decreased adherence in both cell systems, while the ΔlpfA2 only showed a decrease in adherence to polarized Caco-2 cells. We also tested the O104:H4 mutants’ ability to form biofilm and found that the ΔlpfA1 was unable to form a stable biofilm. In an in vivo murine model of intestinal colonization, the ΔlpfA1 had a reduced ability to colonize the cecum and large intestine, consistent with the in vitro data. Further, we tested the lpfA1 mutants’ ability to compete against the wild type. We found that in the in vitro and in vivo models, the presence of the wild type O104:H4 facilitates increased adherence of the ΔlpfA1 to levels exceeding that of the wild type. Overall, our data demonstrated that Lpf1 is one of the factors responsible for O104:H4 intestinal adhesion and colonization."
https://openalex.org/W2261355487,"The HAT-B enzyme complex is responsible for acetylating newly synthesized histone H4 on lysines K5 and K12. HAT-B is a multisubunit complex composed of the histone acetyltransferase 1 (Hat1) catalytic subunit and the Hat2 (rbap46) histone chaperone. Hat1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus as a member of a trimeric NuB4 complex containing Hat1, Hat2, and a histone H3-H4 specific histone chaperone called Hif1 (NASP). In addition to Hif1 and Hat2, Hat1 interacts with Asf1 (anti-silencing function 1), a histone chaperone that has been reported to be involved in both replication-dependent and -independent chromatin assembly. To elucidate the molecular roles of the Hif1 and Asf1 histone chaperones in HAT-B histone binding and acetyltransferase activity, we have characterized the stoichiometry and binding mode of Hif1 and Asf1 to HAT-B and the effect of this binding on the enzymatic activity of HAT-B. We find that Hif1 and Asf1 bind through different modes and independently to HAT-B, whereby Hif1 binds directly to Hat2, and Asf1 is only capable of interactions with HAT-B through contacts with histones H3-H4. We also demonstrate that HAT-B is significantly more active against an intact H3-H4 heterodimer over a histone H4 peptide, independent of either Hif1 or Asf1 binding. Mutational studies further demonstrate that HAT-B binding to the histone tail regions is not sufficient for this enhanced activity. Based on these data, we propose a model for HAT-B/histone chaperone assembly and acetylation of H3-H4 complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1955744226,"At large attitudes are built on earlier experience with the attitude object. If earlier experiences are not available, as is the case for unfamiliar attitude objects such as new technologies, no stored evaluations exist. Yet, people are still somehow able to construct attitudes on the spot. Depending on the familiarity of the attitude object, attitudes may find their basis more in affect or cognition. The current paper investigates differences in reliance on affect or cognition in attitude formation toward familiar and unfamiliar realistic attitude objects. In addition, individual differences in reliance on affect (high faith in intuition) or cognition (high need for cognition) are taken into account. In an experimental survey among Dutch consumers (N = 1870), we show that, for unfamiliar realistic attitude objects, people rely more on affect than cognition. For familiar attitude objects where both affective and cognitive evaluations are available, high need for cognition leads to more reliance on cognition, and high faith in intuition leads to more reliance on affect, reflecting the influence of individually preferred thinking style. For people with high need for cognition, cognition has a higher influence on overall attitude for both familiar and unfamiliar realistic attitude objects. On the other hand, affect is important for people with high faith in intuition for both familiar and unfamiliar attitude objects and for people with low faith in intuition for unfamiliar attitude objects; this shows that preferred thinking style is less influential for unfamiliar objects. By comparing attitude formation for familiar and unfamiliar realistic attitude objects, this research contributes to understanding situations in which affect or cognition is the better predictor of overall attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W1918610557,"Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are considered as candidates for regenerative therapy and a useful model for studying neuronal differentiation. The role of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in neuronal differentiation has been previously studied; however, the signaling pathway involved in this process remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the signaling pathway in the bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation of canine BMSCs. bFGF induced the mRNA expression of the neuron marker, microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP2) and the neuron-like morphological change in canine BMSCs. In the presence of inhibitors of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt, i.e., SU5402, LY294002, and MK2206, respectively, bFGF failed to induce the MAP2 mRNA expression and the neuron-like morphological change. bFGF induced Akt phosphorylation, but it was attenuated by the FGFR inhibitor SU5402 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. In canine BMSCs, expression of FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 was confirmed, but only FGFR-2 activation was detected by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation analysis. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of FGFR-2 in canine BMSCs resulted in the attenuation of bFGF-induced Akt phosphorylation. These results suggest that the FGFR-2/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation of canine BMSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2428066900,"Steroid sex hormones can induce prostate carcinogenesis, and are thought to contribute to the development of prostate cancer during aging. However, the mechanism for hormone-induced prostate carcinogenesis remains elusive. Here, we report that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3)—a broad stress sensor—suppressed hormone-induced prostate carcinogenesis in mice. Although implantation of testosterone and estradiol (T+E2) pellets for 2 months in wild-type mice rarely induced prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in dorsal prostates (one out of eight mice), the loss of ATF3 led to the appearance of not only PIN but also invasive lesions in almost all examined animals. The enhanced carcinogenic effects of hormones on ATF3-deficient prostates did not appear to be caused by a change in estrogen signaling, but were more likely a consequence of elevated androgen signaling that stimulated differentiation of prostatic basal cells into transformation-preferable luminal cells. Indeed, we found that hormone-induced lesions in ATF3-knockout mice often contained cells with both basal and luminal characteristics, such as p63+ cells (a basal-cell marker) showing luminal-like morphology, or cells double-stained with basal (CK5+) and luminal (CK8+) markers. Consistent with these findings, low ATF3 expression was found to be a poor prognostic marker for prostate cancer in a cohort of 245 patients. Our results thus support that ATF3 is a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer."

In this study we identified short splice variants of KV10.1 resulting from exon-skipping events (E65 and E70) in human brain and cancer cell lines. The presence of the variants was confirmed by Northern blot and RNase protection assays. Both variants completely lacked the transmembrane domains of the channel and produced cytoplasmic proteins without channel function. In a reconstituted system, both variants co-precipitated with the full-length channel and induced a robust down-regulation of KV10.1 current when co-expressed with the full-length form, but their effect was mechanistically different. E65 required a tetramerization domain and induced a reduction in the overall expression of full-length KV10.1, whereas E70 mainly affected its glycosylation pattern. E65 triggered the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases in Xenopus laevis oocytes, suggesting a role in cell cycle control.

https://openalex.org/W1960389822,"The moth orchid (Phalaenopsis species) is an ornamental crop that is highly commercialized worldwide. Over 30,000 cultivars of moth orchids have been registered at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). These cultivars were obtained by artificial pollination of interspecific hybridization. Therefore, the identification of different cultivars is highly important in the worldwide market.We used Illumina sequencing technology to analyze an important species for breeding, Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana and develop the expressed sequence tag (EST)-simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. After de novo assembly, the obtained sequence covered 29.1 Mb, approximately 2.2% of the P. aphrodite subsp. formosana genome (1,300 Mb), and a total of 1,439 EST-SSR loci were detected. SSR occurs in the exon region, including the 5' untranslated region (UTR), coding region (CDS), and 3'UTR, on average every 20.22 kb. The di- and tri-nucleotide motifs (51.49% and 35.23%, respectively) were the two most frequent motifs in the P. aphrodite subsp. formosana. To validate the developed EST-SSR loci and to evaluate the transferability to the genus Phalaenopsis, thirty tri-nucleotide motifs of the EST-SSR loci were randomly selected to design EST-SSR primers and to evaluate the polymorphism and transferability across 22 native Phalaenopsis species that are usually used as parents for moth orchid breeding. Of the 30 EST-SSR loci, ten polymorphic and transferable SSR loci across the 22 native taxa can be obtained. The validated EST-SSR markers were further proven to discriminate 12 closely related Phalaenopsis cultivars. The results show that it is not difficult to obtain universal SSR markers by transcriptome deep sequencing in Phalaenopsis species.This study supported that transcriptome analysis based on deep sequencing is a powerful tool to develop SSR loci in non-model species. A large number of EST-SSR loci can be isolated, and about 33.33% EST-SSR loci are universal markers across the Phalaenopsis breeding germplasm after preliminary validation. The potential universal EST-SSR markers are highly valuable for identifying all of Phalaenopsis cultivars."

Both younger and older children rated themselves as less likely than a specific other (Experiment 1) or an average child (Experiment 2) to commit various biases. These self-other differences were also more extreme for biased behaviors than for other behaviors. At times, older children demonstrated stronger self-other differences than younger children, which seemed primarily driven by older children's judgments about bias in others. These findings suggest that, although the bias blind spot exists as soon as children recognize other-committed biases, what changes over development is how skeptical children are towards others."
https://openalex.org/W1935581596,"Background This study investigated the relationships between background intestinal uptake on 18F–FDG PET and cardio-metabolic risk (CMR) factors. Methods A total of 326 female patients that underwent 18F–FDG PET to determine the initial stage of breast cancer were enrolled. None of the patients had history of diabetes or hypertension. The background intestinal uptake on PET was visually graded (low vs. high uptake group) and quantitatively measured using the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax). SUVmax of 7 bowel segments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, splenic flexure, and descending colon-sigmoid junction) were averaged for the total bowel (TB SUVmax). Age, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose level (BST), triglyceride (TG), cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were the considered CMR factors. The relationships between background intestinal 18F–FDG uptake on PET and diverse CMR factors were analyzed. Results The visual grades based on background intestinal 18F–FDG uptake classified 100 (30.7%) patients into the low uptake group, while 226 (69.3%) were classified into the high uptake group. Among CMR factors, age (p = 0.004), BMI (p<0.001), and TG (p<0.001) were significantly different according to visual grade of background intestinal 18F–FDG uptake. Quantitative TB SUVmax showed significant positive correlation with age (r = 0.203, p<0.001), BMI (r = 0.373, p<0.001), TG (r = 0.338, p<0.001), cholesterol (r = 0.148, p = 0.008), and LDL (r = 0.143, p = 0.024) and significant negative correlation with HDL (r = -0.147, p = 0.022). Multivariate analysis indicated that BMI and TG were independent factors in both visually graded background intestinal 18F–FDG uptake (p = 0.027 and p = 0.023, respectively) and quantitatively measured TB SUVmax (p = 0.006 and p = 0.004, respectively). Conclusion Increased background intestinal 18F–FDG uptake on PET may suggest alteration of lipid metabolism and risk of cardio-metabolic disease in non-diabetic and non-hypertensive breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W1957970791,"In North America, notodontid caterpillars feed almost exclusively on hardwood trees. One notable exception, Theroa zethus feeds instead on herbaceous plants in the Euphorbiaceae protected by laticifers. These elongate canals follow leaf veins and contain latex under pressure; rupture causes the immediate release of sticky poisonous exudate. T. zethus larvae deactivate the latex defense of poinsettia and other euphorbs by applying acid from their ventral eversible gland, thereby creating furrows in the veins. The acid secretion softens the veins allowing larvae to compress even large veins with their mandibles and to disrupt laticifers internally often without contacting latex. Acid secretion collected from caterpillars and applied to the vein surface sufficed to create a furrow and to reduce latex exudation distal to the furrow where T. zethus larvae invariably feed. Larvae with their ventral eversible gland blocked were unable to create furrows and suffered reduced growth on poinsettia. The ventral eversible gland in T. zethus and other notodontids ordinarily serves to deter predators; when threatened, larvae spray acid from the gland orifice located between the mouthparts and first pair of legs. To my knowledge, T. zethus is the first caterpillar found to use an antipredator gland for disabling plant defenses. The novel combination of acid application and vein constriction allows T. zethus to exploit its unusual latex-bearing hosts."
https://openalex.org/W1958437655,"The inflammatory cytokine TNF-α is a central mediator in many immune-mediated diseases, such as Crohn's disease (CD), spondyloarthritis (SpA) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Epidemiologic studies have shown that cigarette smoking (CS) is a prominent common risk factor in these TNF-dependent diseases. We exposed TNFΔARE mice; in which a systemic TNF-α overexpression leads to the development of inflammation; to 2 or 4 weeks of air or CS. We investigated the effect of deregulated TNF expression on CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and the effect of CS exposure on the initiation and progression of gut and joint inflammation. Upon 2 weeks of CS exposure, inflammation in lungs of TNFΔARE mice was significantly aggravated. However, upon 4 weeks of CS-exposure, this aggravation was no longer observed. TNFΔARE mice have no increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and a diminished neutrophil response in the lungs after 4 weeks of CS exposure. In the gut and joints of TNFΔARE mice, 2 or 4 weeks of CS exposure did not modulate the development of inflammation. In conclusion, CS exposure does not modulate gut and joint inflammation in TNFΔARE mice. The lung responses towards CS in TNFΔARE mice however depend on the duration of CS exposure."

Brazil, cataloged as a pharmemerging market, has implemented restrictive measures for the consumption of antibiotics. The objective of this study was to investigate the quality of antimicrobial prescriptions and user knowledge of their treatment with these drugs.A two-stage cross-sectional, combined and stratified survey of pharmacy users holding an antimicrobial prescription was conducted in the community between May and November 2014. A pharmacist analyzed each prescription for legibility and completeness, and applied a structured questionnaire to the users or their caregivers on their knowledge regarding treatment and user sociodemographic data. An estimated 29.3% of prescriptions had one or more illegible items, 91.3% had one or more missing items, and 29.0% had both illegible and missing items. Dosing schedule and patient identification were the most commonly unreadable items in prescriptions, 18.81% and 12.14%, respectively. The lack of complete patient identification occurred in 90.53% of the prescriptions. It is estimated that 40.3% of users have used antimicrobials without prescription and that 46.49% did not receive any guidance on the administration of the drug.Despite the measures taken by health authorities to restrict the misuse of antimicrobials, it was observed that prescribers still do not follow the criteria of current legislation, particularly relating to items needed for completion of the prescription. Moreover, users receive little information about their antimicrobial treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1956115810,"Waveblock formation is the main cause of reentry. We have performed a comprehensive numerical modeling study of block formation due to anisotropy in Ten Tusscher and Panfilov (2006) ionic model for human ventricular tissue. We have examined the border between different areas of myocardial fiber alignment and have shown that blockage can occur for a wave traveling from a transverse fiber area to a longitudinal one. Such blockage occurs for reasonable values of the anisotropy ratio (AR): from 2.4 to 6.2 with respect to propagation velocities. This critical AR decreases by the suppression of INa and ICa, slightly decreases by the suppression of IKr and IKs, and substantially increases by the suppression of IK1. Hyperkalemia affects the block formation in a complex, biphasic way. We provide examples of reentry formation due to the studied effects and have concluded that the suppression of IK1 should be the most effective way to prevent waveblock at the areas of abrupt change in anisotropy."
