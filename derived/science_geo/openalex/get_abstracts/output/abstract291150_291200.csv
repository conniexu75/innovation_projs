https://openalex.org/W2061295058,"It has long been postulated that gas-surface chemical reactions can occur by means of two distinct mechanisms: direct reaction on a single gas-surface encounter or reaction between two adsorbed species. It is shown here that these mechanisms have distinct dynamical signatures, as illustrated by the reaction of hydrogen with chlorine on gold(111). The direct reaction product leaves the surface with a high kinetic energy in a narrow angular distribution that displays a ""memory"" of the direction and energy of the incident hydrogen atom. The indirect reaction product has a near-thermal energy distribution and an angular distribution that is close to that of a cosine function."
https://openalex.org/W2078252241,"X-ray diffraction study of solid CO(2) at room temperature has shown that the powder pattern of the high-pressure phase, which supersedes the low-pressure cubic Pa3 phase at about 10 gigapascals, is consistently interpreted in terms of an orthorhombic Cmca structure. The orthorhombic cell at 11.8 gigapascals has dimensions of 4.330 +/- 0.015, 4.657 +/- 0.005, 5.963 +/- 0.009 angstroms for its a, b, and c faces, respectively, and a volume of 120.3 +/- 0.5 cubic angstroms. Four molecules contained in the unit cell are located at the base-centered positions with their molecular axes inclined at about 52 degrees with respect to the crystallographic c axis. The volume change associated with the Pa3-Cmca transition is close to zero. The structural dimensions obtained for the high-pressure crystalline phase of CO(2) are of great importance for a theoretical understanding of the role of intermolecular interactions, including quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, in molecular condensation."

https://openalex.org/W1998152827,"Photorefractive materials can form ""instant"" holograms without time-consuming development steps. Their potential applications include image processing, optical data storage, and correction of image distortion, but the cost of crystal growth and preparation has been a primary impediment to commercial application. Polymers, on the other hand, are low in cost and readily fabricated in a variety of forms. Photorefractive polymers were constructed with performance that matched or exceeded the performance of available photorefractive crystals. The largest observed two-beam energy coupling gain coefficient for the polymers was 56 per centimeter."
https://openalex.org/W2095392771,"Projected changes in the Earth's climate can be driven from a combined set of forcing factors consisting of regionally heterogeneous anthropogenic and natural aerosols and land use changes, as well as global-scale influences from solar variability and transient increases in human-produced greenhouse gases. Thus, validation of climate model projections that are driven only by increases in greenhouse gases can be inconsistent when one attempts the validation by looking for a regional or time-evolving ""fingerprint"" of such projected changes in real climatic data. Until climate models are driven by time-evolving, combined, multiple, and heterogeneous forcing factors, the best global climatic change ""fingerprint"" will probably remain a many-decades average of hemi-spheric- to global-scale trends in surface air temperatures. Century-long global warming (or cooling) trends of 0.5 degrees C appear to have occurred infrequently over the past several thousand years-perhaps only once or twice a millennium, as proxy records suggest. This implies an 80 to 90 percent heuristic likelihood that the 20th-century 0.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C warming trend is not a wholly natural climatic fluctuation."

https://openalex.org/W1984177902,"The record of carbon-13 (delta(13)C) variations in DH-11 vein calcite core from Devils Hole, Nevada, shows four prominent minima near glacial terminations (glacial-interglacial transitions) V to II. The delta(13)C time series is inversely correlated with the DH-11 oxygen isotope ratio time series and leads it by as much as 7000 years. The delta(13)C variations likely record fluctuations in the delta(13)C of dissolved inorganic carbon of water recharging the aquifer. How such variations are transported 80 kilometers to Devils Hole without obliteration by water-rock reaction remains an enigma. The record may reflect (i) global variations in the delta(13)C of atmospheric CO(2) and, hence, the delta(13)C of continental biomass or (ii) variations in extent and density of vegetation in the southern Great Basin. In the latter case, delta(13)C minima at 414, 334, 246, and 133 thousand years ago mark times of maximum vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W2020391415,High-speed movies have been taken of the formation of the sub-surface cavity and of the Rayleigh jet formed during the splash of a drop on a shallow liquid. They show that the initial increase and subsequent decrease in the rate of rise of the jet and the maximum jet height with decreasing depth of liquid are the result of the interaction of the subsurface cavity with the solid boundary beneath the liquid. This interaction modifies considerably the pressure gradients in the liquid during the formation and collapse of the cavity.
https://openalex.org/W2006428112,"A unique mode of asexual reproduction in recently collected specimens of Goniopora (Scleractinia) is reported. Skeleton is absent from new polyps; the skelton develops independently of the parent colony as the new polyps themselves increase. The young colonies eventually become detached. The cycle seems to be a response to a sandy habitat, a conclusion reached by analogy With Fungia and Manicina."

Hormone sprays eliminate the need for light induction of the enzyme. The concentration of gibberellic acid required for optimal induction varies according to the concentration of kinetin supplied.
https://openalex.org/W2035143565,"The thermal energy emitted by Mars was measured in the 8- to 12- and 18- to 25-micrometer bands. The minimum temperature derived for the southern polar cap is 150Â°K, an indication that the cap is formed by frozen carbon dioxide. No significant temperature fluctuations were detected with a 100-kilometer scale."
https://openalex.org/W1974145408,"On 1 August between 10:15 and 12:50 Universal Time, with the Lick Observatory 120-inch (304-cm) telescope and a laser operating at 6943 angstroms, return signals from an optical retro-reflector array placed on the moon by the Apollo 11 astronauts were successfully detected. After the return signal was first detected it continued to appear with the expected time delay for the remainder of the night. The observed range is in excellent agreement with the predicted ephemeris. Transmitting between 7 and 8 joules per pulse, we found that each return signal averaged more than one photoelectron. This is in good agreement with calculations of the expected signal strength."

https://openalex.org/W2018208655,"Paleomagnetic data and marine magnetic surveys suggest that the Bay of Biscay was created by rifting due to an anticlockwise rotation of the Iberian peninsula. The period during which movement occurred is not known precisely, but a rotation, amounting to 22 degrees, appears to have taken place in post-Eocene time. To provide independent evidence on the age of the rift, bottom samples from the Biscay abyssal plain have been related to the distribution of seismic reflectors within the sediments. The investigation shows that a large part of the Bay of Biscay was in existence in late Cretaceous times and that the data can be interpreted in terms of some early Tertiary rotation. However, the amount of possible Tertiary opening is appreciably less than the paleomagnetic results suggest. In view of the fact that reflectors of Middle-Upper Miocene age can be traced as undisturbed horizons across the bay, all tectonic movements must have ceased by the early Miocene."
https://openalex.org/W1977712925,"Magellan images reveal surface features on Venus attributed to wind processes. Sand dunes, wind-sculpted hills, and more than 5830 wind streaks have been identified. The streaks serve as local ""wind vanes,"" representing wind direction at the time of streak formation and allowing the first global mapping of near-surface wind patterns on Venus. Wind streaks are oriented both toward the equator and toward the west. When streaks associated with local transient events, such as impact cratering, are deleted, the westward component is mostly lost but the equatorward component remains. This pattern is consistent with a Hadley circulation of the lower atmosphere."
