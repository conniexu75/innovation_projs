https://openalex.org/W2022689242,"Brain development and function depend on the precise regulation of gene expression. However, our understanding of the complexity and dynamics of the transcriptome of the human brain is incomplete. Here we report the generation and analysis of exon-level transcriptome and associated genotyping data, representing males and females of different ethnicities, from multiple brain regions and neocortical areas of developing and adult post-mortem human brains. We found that 86 per cent of the genes analysed were expressed, and that 90 per cent of these were differentially regulated at the whole-transcript or exon level across brain regions and/or time. The majority of these spatio-temporal differences were detected before birth, with subsequent increases in the similarity among regional transcriptomes. The transcriptome is organized into distinct co-expression networks, and shows sex-biased gene expression and exon usage. We also profiled trajectories of genes associated with neurobiological categories and diseases, and identified associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression. This study provides a comprehensive data set on the human brain transcriptome and insights into the transcriptional foundations of human neurodevelopment."

https://openalex.org/W2019780808,"Pericytes are uniquely positioned within the neurovascular unit to serve as vital integrators, coordinators and effectors of many neurovascular functions, including angiogenesis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation and maintenance, vascular stability and angioarchitecture, regulation of capillary blood flow and clearance of toxic cellular byproducts necessary for proper CNS homeostasis and neuronal function. New studies have revealed that pericyte deficiency in the CNS leads to BBB breakdown and brain hypoperfusion resulting in secondary neurodegenerative changes. Here we review recent progress in understanding the biology of CNS pericytes and their role in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2117970703,"Previous investigations have combined transcriptional and genetic analyses in human cell lines, but few have applied these techniques to human neural tissue. To gain a global molecular perspective on the role of the human genome in cortical development, function and ageing, we explore the temporal dynamics and genetic control of transcription in human prefrontal cortex in an extensive series of post-mortem brains from fetal development through ageing. We discover a wave of gene expression changes occurring during fetal development which are reversed in early postnatal life. One half-century later in life, this pattern of reversals is mirrored in ageing and in neurodegeneration. Although we identify thousands of robust associations of individual genetic polymorphisms with gene expression, we also demonstrate that there is no association between the total extent of genetic differences between subjects and the global similarity of their transcriptional profiles. Hence, the human genome produces a consistent molecular architecture in the prefrontal cortex, despite millions of genetic differences across individuals and races. To enable further discovery, this entire data set is freely available (from Gene Expression Omnibus: accession GSE30272; and dbGaP: accession phs000417.v1.p1) and can also be interrogated via a biologist-friendly stand-alone application (http://www.libd.org/braincloud)."

https://openalex.org/W2021715667,"Ischemic stroke remains a vexing public health problem. Although progress has been made in prevention and supportive care, efforts to protect the brain from ischemic cell death have failed. Thus, no new treatment has made it from bench to bedside since tissue plasminogen activator was introduced in 1996. The brain has a remarkable capacity for self-preservation, illustrated by the protective responses induced by ischemia, preconditioning and exercise. Here we describe the mechanisms underlying brain self-protection, with the goal of identifying features that could provide insight into stroke therapy. Unlike traditional therapeutic approaches based on counteracting selected pathways of the ischemic cascade, endogenous neuroprotection relies on coordinated neurovascular programs that support cerebral perfusion, mitigate the harmful effects of cerebral ischemia and promote tissue restoration. Learning how the brain triggers and implements these protective measures may advance our quest to treat stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2047601015,"The iron–oxygen species iron(III)-peroxo, iron(III)-hydroperoxo and iron(IV)-oxo are key intermediates often detected in the catalytic cycles of dioxygen activation by haem and non-haem iron enzymes. The high-resolution crystal structure of a mononuclear non-haem side-on iron(III)-peroxo complex has now been determined, and a series of chemical reactions in which the iron(III)-peroxo complex is cleanly converted to an iron(III)-hydroperoxo complex is described. All three of these iron species have been spectroscopically characterized, and relative reactivity studies demonstrate that iron(III)-hydroperoxo species are viable oxidants in both nucleophilic and electrophilic reactions by iron-containing enzymes. This work shows how a series of biologically important iron–oxygen intermediates make use of a synthetic iron complex bearing a simple but versatile macrocyclic ligand. Oxygen-containing mononuclear iron species—iron(iii)–peroxo, iron(iii)–hydroperoxo and iron(iv)–oxo—are key intermediates in the catalytic activation of dioxygen by iron-containing metalloenzymes1,2,3,4,5,6,7. It has been difficult to generate synthetic analogues of these three active iron–oxygen species in identical host complexes, which is necessary to elucidate changes to the structure of the iron centre during catalysis and the factors that control their chemical reactivities with substrates. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of a mononuclear non-haem side-on iron(iii)–peroxo complex, [Fe(iii)(TMC)(OO)]+. We also report a series of chemical reactions in which this iron(iii)–peroxo complex is cleanly converted to the iron(iii)–hydroperoxo complex, [Fe(iii)(TMC)(OOH)]2+, via a short-lived intermediate on protonation. This iron(iii)–hydroperoxo complex then cleanly converts to the ferryl complex, [Fe(iv)(TMC)(O)]2+, via homolytic O–O bond cleavage of the iron(iii)–hydroperoxo species. All three of these iron species—the three most biologically relevant iron–oxygen intermediates—have been spectroscopically characterized; we note that they have been obtained using a simple macrocyclic ligand. We have performed relative reactivity studies on these three iron species which reveal that the iron(iii)–hydroperoxo complex is the most reactive of the three in the deformylation of aldehydes and that it has a similar reactivity to the iron(iv)–oxo complex in C–H bond activation of alkylaromatics. These reactivity results demonstrate that iron(iii)–hydroperoxo species are viable oxidants in both nucleophilic and electrophilic reactions by iron-containing enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1964887411,"The genome of the common roundworm Ascaris suum, a major parasite in many parts of the world, has now been sequenced. Analyses reveal many genes that encode peptidases linked to the penetration and degradation of host tissues, as well as molecules likely to modulate or evade host immune responses. The availability of this genome sequence should contribute towards the development of new therapeutic interventions against ascariasis and other nematode infections. Parasitic diseases have a devastating, long-term impact on human health, welfare and food production worldwide. More than two billion people are infected with geohelminths, including the roundworms Ascaris (common roundworm), Necator and Ancylostoma (hookworms), and Trichuris (whipworm), mainly in developing or impoverished nations of Asia, Africa and Latin America1. In humans, the diseases caused by these parasites result in about 135,000 deaths annually, with a global burden comparable with that of malaria or tuberculosis in disability-adjusted life years1. Ascaris alone infects around 1.2 billion people and, in children, causes nutritional deficiency, impaired physical and cognitive development and, in severe cases, death2. Ascaris also causes major production losses in pigs owing to reduced growth, failure to thrive and mortality2. The Ascaris–swine model makes it possible to study the parasite, its relationship with the host, and ascariasis at the molecular level. To enable such molecular studies, we report the 273 megabase draft genome of Ascaris suum and compare it with other nematode genomes. This genome has low repeat content (4.4%) and encodes about 18,500 protein-coding genes. Notably, the A. suum secretome (about 750 molecules) is rich in peptidases linked to the penetration and degradation of host tissues, and an assemblage of molecules likely to modulate or evade host immune responses. This genome provides a comprehensive resource to the scientific community and underpins the development of new and urgently needed interventions (drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tests) against ascariasis and other nematodiases."

https://openalex.org/W1981465641,"Endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs) and inflammatory cytokines contribute to the age-associated loss of bone mass and strength, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for their deleterious effects on the aging skeleton are unclear. Based on evidence that oxidative stress is a causal mechanism of the insulin resistance produced by either one of these two agents, we tested the hypothesis that their adverse skeletal effects also result from increased oxidative stress. We report that administration of prednisolone to mice increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the phosphorylation of p66shc (an amplifier of H2O2 generation in mitochondria) in bone. Dexamethasone (Dex) and TNFα had a similar effect on osteoblastic cells in vitro. The generation of ROS by Dex and TNFα required PKCβ/p66shc signaling and was responsible for the activation of JNK and induction of apoptosis by both agents. The activity of Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors was also increased in response to ROS; however, FoxO activation opposed apoptosis induced by Dex and TNFα. In addition, both agents suppressed Akt phosphorylation as well as Wnt-induced proliferation and osteoblast differentiation. However, the inhibitory actions on Wnt signaling were independent of PKCβ/p66shc. Instead, they were mediated by inhibition of Akt and stimulation of FoxOs. These results demonstrate that ROS-induced activation of a PKCβ/p66shc/JNK signaling cascade is responsible for the pro-apoptotic effects of Dex and TNFα on osteoblastic cells. Moreover, modulation of Akt and FoxOs by GCs and TNFα are cell-autonomous mechanisms of Wnt/β-catenin antagonism contributing to the adverse effects of GC excess and inflammatory cytokines on bone alike. Endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs) and inflammatory cytokines contribute to the age-associated loss of bone mass and strength, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for their deleterious effects on the aging skeleton are unclear.

Endogenous or exogenous GC excess, as well as TNFα, increase the number of osteoclasts and decrease the number of osteoblast due to reduced production of osteoblast precursors as well as premature apoptosis of mature osteoblasts (1Weinstein R.S.

The progressive loss of bone with aging is characterized by an increase in osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis as well as by a decrease in osteoblast number and bone formation rate (14Manolagas S.C. Endocr. Rev. 2010; 31: 266-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the age-dependent loss of bone mass is associated with a progressive increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the phosphorylation of the adapter protein p66shc in bone (15Almeida M. Han L. Martin-Millan M. Plotkin L.I. Stewart S.A. Roberson P.K. Kousteni S. O'Brien C.A. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27285-27297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). p66shc is a crucial component of a signaling pathway that is activated by increased intracellular ROS, via PKCβ phosphorylation at Ser36, and converts oxidative signals into apoptosis. Phosphorylated p66shc translocates to the mitochondria and acts as a redox enzyme to amplify ROS by generating H2O2 (16Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P.

Ambrogini E. Bartell S.M. Manolagas S.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 2030-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This along with evidence that administration of antioxidants abrogates the age-related increase in osteoblast apoptosis (20Jilka R.L. Almeida M. Ambrogini E. Han L. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Manolagas S.C. Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) strongly supports the notion that oxidative stress is causally related to involutional osteoporosis. Genetic studies by our group and others have elucidated that a balance between ROS production and defense against ROS by the Forkhead box O (FoxO) family of transcription factors is indispensable for bone homeostasis at any age (21Ambrogini E. Almeida M. Martin-Millan M. Paik J.H. Depinho R.A. Han L. Goellner J. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. O'Brien C.A. Manolagas S.C.

In mammals, the FoxO family comprises four members, of which FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 are ubiquitously expressed and relatively abundant in bone cells. FoxOs are negatively regulated by insulin and growth factors via the serine/threonine kinase Akt (23Calnan D.R. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Akt directly phosphorylates FoxOs on three conserved residues which lead to cytoplasmic retention and inhibition of FoxO-mediated transcription. In contrast to growth factors, ROS cause the retention of FoxOs in the nucleus and activation of transcription. In turn, FoxOs counteract ROS production by activating the transcription of genes involved in free radical scavenging. In several cell types including osteoblastic cells, oxidative stress also induces the association of FoxOs with β-catenin (24Almeida M. Han L. Martin-Millan M. O'Brien C.A. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27298-27305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 25Essers M.A. de Vries-Smits L.M. Barker N. Polderman P.E. Burgering B.M. Korswagen H.C. Science. 2005; 308: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), which is a critical component of the Wnt signaling pathway and indispensable for osteoblastogenesis (26Rodda S.J. McMahon A.P. Development. 2006; 133: 3231-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Activation of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6-frizzled receptor complex by Wnt proteins inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3β, which prevents the proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. Upon its translocation into the nucleus, β-catenin associates with the T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor family of transcription factors and regulates the expression of Wnt target genes (27Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4491) Google Scholar). Importantly, oxidative stress induced by H2O2 promotes FoxO-mediated transcription at the expense of Wnt/TCF-mediated transcription and osteoblast differentiation (24Almeida M. Han L. Martin-Millan M. O'Brien C.A. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27298-27305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 28Hoogeboom D. Essers M.A. Polderman P.E.

Indeed, oxidative stress is the main cause of the development of insulin resistance by these agents (29Houstis N. Rosen E.D. Lander E.S. Nature. 2006; 440: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). Gene expression analysis in human osteoblasts exposed to dexamethasone (Dex) revealed that a significant number of transcripts related to oxidative stress are altered (30Hurson C.J. Butler J.S. Keating D.T. Murray D.W. Sadlier D.M. O'Byrne J.M. Doran P.P. BMC Musculoskelet. Disord. 2007; 8: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, the generation of ROS has been implicated in the mechanisms by which TNFα increases osteoblast apoptosis (31Byun C.H. Koh J.M. Kim D.K. Park S.I. Lee K.U. Kim G.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1125-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These agents also decrease Wnt signaling in osteoblastic cells although the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated (32Diarra D. Stolina M. Polzer K. Zwerina J. Ominsky M.S. Dwyer D. Korb A. Smolen J. Hoffmann M. Scheinecker C. van der Heide D. Landewe R. Lacey D. Richards W.G. Schett G. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 33Smith E. Frenkel B. J.

Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Prompted by this evidence, we tested the hypothesis that the potent suppressive effects of GC and TNFα on bone formation may be caused by increased oxidative stress and antagonism of the beneficial effects of Wnt signaling on osteoblast generation secondary to FoxO activation.

C57BL/6 mice, aged 5, 8, 24, or 31 months, were obtained from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Twenty-four-month-old female mice were injected daily with 200 μg g−1 pegylated catalase (Sigma-Aldrich), or vehicle (PBS), or fed a diet containing 100 mg of NAC per kg of chow (Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ), for 28 days (20Jilka R.L. Almeida M. Ambrogini E. Han L. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Manolagas S.C. Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Vehicle-injected 6-month-old mice served as controls. For the studies examining the effects of GCs, 5-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were implanted with 60-day slow release pellets containing 7.5 mg of placebo or prednisolone. After 28 days, animals were killed, and the tissues were dissected for further analyses. ROS were quantified as described above in bone marrow cells flushed from femurs and washed with PBS. All data are reported as the mean ± S.D. ANOVA was used to detect effects of various in vivo and in vitro treatments, after establishing that the data were normally distributed and exhibited equivalence of variances. Bonferroni's method was used to perform appropriate pairwise comparisons of treatment groups. In cases when one or both of the requirements for performing ANOVA were not met, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on Ranks test was used followed by Dunn's method to perform pairwise comparisons of treatment groups. Experiments shown were repeated at least once and had low interexperimental variability. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Based on previous findings that GCs increase ROS in a variety of cell models and that endogenous GC levels as well as oxidative stress increase in murine bone with age (6Weinstein R.S. Wan C. Liu Q.

Chem. 2007; 282: 27285-27297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), we investigated whether GCs increase ROS levels in bone. Administration of prednisolone to 5-month-old C57BL/6 males for 28 days increased ROS levels in the bone marrow as well as phosphorylation of p66shc in vertebral lysates (Fig. 1, A and B). Similar to GCs, TNFα levels increase with age in several tissues (42Helenius M. Hänninen M. Lehtinen S.K. Salminen A. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 43Phillips T. Leeuwenburgh C. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We examined whether the same was true in bone. As show in Fig. 1C, TNFα mRNA expression levels were increased in calvaria of 31- compared to 8-month-old mice. Similar results were obtained in a separate experiment comparing vertebrae of 25-month-old to 6-month-old mice (Fig. 1D). The increase in TNFα with age was abrogated by administration of the antioxidants NAC or catalase for 1 month. Taken together, these results suggest that GCs increase oxidative stress in bone and that the rise in TNF levels in the bone of aged mice is due to oxidative stress. To dissect the mechanism by which GCs and TNFα increase ROS in osteoblastic cells, we used the uncommitted osteoblast precursor C2C12 and the bone marrow-derived osteoblastic UAMS-32 cell lines. Dex and TNFα promoted an increase in ROS levels as early as 15 min in C2C12 cells, and this increase was sustained for up to 1 h as determined by oxidation of the redox-sensitive dye dichlorodihydrofluorescein (Fig. 2A). A similar increase in ROS was observed in UAMS-32 cells when exposed to the test agents for 30 min (Fig. 2D). We next examined whether the PKCβ/p66shc signaling pathway was altered in response to Dex or TNFα. As shown in Fig. 2B, Dex or TNFα stimulated the phosphorylation of p66shc in C2C12 cells starting at 15 min, and this effect was maintained up to 1 h. To determine whether the phosphorylation of p66shc by Dex or TNFα was dependent on ROS and PKCβ activity we used the antioxidant NAC and the specific inhibitor of PKCβ hispidin, respectively. Both NAC and hispidin prevented the phosphorylation of p66shc induced by Dex or TNFα (Fig. 2C). Hispidin also prevented the increase in ROS caused by the two agents (Fig. 2D). A similar result was obtained with another PKCβ inhibitor, LY333531. We next tested directly whether p66shc was functionally involved in the generation of ROS by Dex or TNFα, using primary cultures of osteoblastic cells from p66shc KO mice. Whereas Dex, TNFα, and H2O2 (used as a positive control) increased ROS levels in calvaria cells derived from WT mice, deletion of p66shc prevented the increase in ROS caused by the three compounds (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrate that Dex and TNFα increase ROS and p66shc phosphorylation in osteoblastic cells and that PKCβ and p66shc are required for the pro-oxidant actions of Dex and TNFα alike. JNK is a well established target of GCs and TNFα in several cell models. JNK is also a mediator of ROS-induced FoxO activation (44Essers M.A. Weijzen S. de Vries-Smits A.M. Saarloos I. de Ruiter N.D.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4494-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence and the findings that Dex and TNFα exert pro-oxidant actions in osteoblasts described above, we investigated whether the two agents activated FoxOs via a ROS/JNK signaling cascade. To this end, we first examined the phosphorylation status of JNK in response to Dex and TNFα. The two agents increased JNK phosphorylation, as determined by Western blotting, and this effect was attenuated by NAC (Fig. 3A). Because ROS generation by Dex or TNFα required PKCβ and p66shc, we examined whether the latter proteins were required for the stimulation of JNK phosphorylation. Preincubation of UAMS-32 cells with hispidin attenuated the phosphorylation of JNK by Dex and TNFα. Moreover, the phosphorylation of JNK that occurred in osteoblastic cells from WT mice was abrogated in cells from p66shc KO mice (Fig. 3B). We next determined the effect of Dex and TNFα on the transcriptional activity of FoxO using a FoxO reporter construct that contains six canonical FoxO-binding sites (FoxO-luc). As shown in Fig. 3, C and E, Dex and TNFα increased FoxO activity in C2C12 or UAMS-32 cells, and NAC prevented this effect. In line with these results hispidin or LY333531 abrogated FoxO activation by Dex and TNFα (Fig. 3D). Finally, the stimulatory effects of Dex and TNFα on FoxO activity were prevented by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 3E); and were abrogated in embryonic fibroblasts from mice lacking JNK1 and JNK2 (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these results indicate that Dex and TNFα activate JNK via a ROS/PKCβ/p66shc-dependent mechanism and that JNK is required for the activation of FoxOs by the two agents. Prompted by the evidence that GCs and TNFα promote osteoblast apoptosis, we sought to test directly whether the pro-apoptotic actions of the two agents are mediated by ROS. To this end C2C12 cells were incubated with these agents or with the pro-apoptotic topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, in the presence of the antioxidants NAC or ebselen. Apoptosis was quantified by caspase-3 activity. Both NAC and ebselen prevented the pro-apoptotic actions of Dex or TNFα but had no effect on etoposide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4A). Similar findings were obtained using the osteoblastic OB-6 cell line (data not shown). The involvement of the p66shc/JNK/FoxO signaling cascade in the pro-apoptotic actions of Dex or TNFα was tested in UAMS-32 cells in which p66shc levels were reduced by short hairpin (sh)RNA (19Almeida M. Han L. Ambrogini E. Bartell S.M. Manolagas S.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 2030-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and in primary calvaria cells from p66shc KO mice. Silencing of p66shc abrogated the pro-apoptotic actions of Dex and greatly attenuated the pro-apoptotic action of TNFα (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained with the cells from p66shc KO mice (Fig. 4C). Moreover, inhibition of JNK using SP600125 or embryonic fibroblasts from JNK1/2 dKO mice also attenuated the pro-apoptotic effect of Dex or TNFα (Fig. 4, D and E). In contrast, the pro-apoptotic actions of the two agents, as well as H2O2, were prevented in bone marrow-derived osteoblastic cells from transgenic mice overexpressing FoxO3 (Fig. 4F). These results demonstrate that the pro-apoptotic effect of Dex or TNFα in osteoblastic cells is mediated by a ROS/p66shc/JNK signaling cascade and is antagonized by FoxOs. Besides promoting apoptosis, GCs and TNFα inhibit osteoblastogenesis. Moreover, oxidative stress stimulates FoxOs and simultaneously suppresses Wnt/TCF-mediated transcription. Based on this and the findings that Dex and TNFα increase ROS, we examined whether these agents attenuated the pro-osteoblastogenic Wnt signaling by stimulating FoxOs. Similar to earlier results from us and others, the two agents attenuated Wnt3a-induced activity of a TCF-reporter construct in C2C12 cells (Fig. 5A). In line with these findings, both Dex and TNFα greatly attenuated the basal rate of C2C12 proliferation as well as Wnt3a-stimulated proliferation (Fig. 5B). In addition, alkaline phosphatase activity induced by Wnt3a was suppressed by Dex and TNFα (Fig. 5C). However, the inhibitory actions of the two agents were not dependent on ROS/PKCβ activity, as neither hispidin"
https://openalex.org/W2007504429,"Four trans-Neptunian objects are currently recognized as dwarf planets: Eris, Haumea, Makemake and Pluto. Of these, the 'demoted' planet Pluto has been studied for many years and has a detected atmosphere. The others are difficult to observe because of their extreme distance from the Sun, but a stellar occultation event on 6 November 2010 provided an opportunity for a closer look at Eris. The data obtained reveal Eris as a 'twin' for Pluto in terms of size, and previous work showed the two to have similar surface compositions. Eris, however, has no detectable atmosphere and its surface is bright, possibly a result of atmospheric collapse in an extremely cold environment. The dwarf planet Eris is a trans-Neptunian object with an orbital eccentricity of 0.44, an inclination of 44 degrees and a surface composition very similar to that of Pluto1. It resides at present at 95.7 astronomical units (1 au is the Earth-Sun distance) from Earth, near its aphelion and more than three times farther than Pluto. Owing to this great distance, measuring its size or detecting a putative atmosphere is difficult. Here we report the observation of a multi-chord stellar occultation by Eris on 6 November 2010 ut. The event is consistent with a spherical shape for Eris, with radius 1,163 ± 6 kilometres, density 2.52 ± 0.05 grams per cm3 and a high visible geometric albedo, . No nitrogen, argon or methane atmospheres are detected with surface pressure larger than ∼1 nanobar, about 10,000 times more tenuous than Pluto's present atmosphere2,3,4,5. As Pluto's radius is estimated3,4,5,6,7,8 to be between 1,150 and 1,200 kilometres, Eris appears as a Pluto twin, with a bright surface possibly caused by a collapsed atmosphere, owing to its cold environment. We anticipate that this atmosphere may periodically sublimate as Eris approaches its perihelion, at 37.8 astronomical units from the Sun."

https://openalex.org/W2012229822,"The secreted protein lipocalin-2 (LCN2) has been implicated in diverse cellular processes, including cell morphology and migration. Little is known, however, about the role of LCN2 in the CNS. Here, we show that LCN2 promotes cell migration through up-regulation of chemokines in brain. Studies using cultured glial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, and neuronal cells suggest that LCN2 may act as a chemokine inducer on the multiple cell types in the CNS. In particular, up-regulation of CXCL10 by JAK2/STAT3 and IKK/NF-κB pathways in astrocytes played a pivotal role in LCN2-induced cell migration. The cell migration-promoting activity of LCN2 in the CNS was verified in vivo using mouse models. The expression of LCN2 was notably increased in brain following LPS injection or focal injury. Mice lacking LCN2 showed the impaired migration of astrocytes to injury sites with a reduced CXCL10 expression in the neuroinflammation or injury models. Thus, the LCN2 proteins, secreted under inflammatory conditions, may amplify neuroinflammation by inducing CNS cells to secrete chemokines such as CXCL10, which recruit additional inflammatory cells."

https://openalex.org/W2113338297,"Kindlins are a subclass of FERM-containing proteins that have recently emerged as key regulators of integrin receptor activation and signaling. As compared with the conventional FERM domain, the kindlin FERM domain contains an inserted pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that recognizes membrane phosphoinositides, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that PIP3 site-specifically binds to kindlin-2 PH with substantial chemical shift changes that are much larger than PIP2. This suggests an enhanced association of kindlin-2 with membrane as mediated by PIP3 upon its conversion from PIP2 by phosphoinositide-3 kinase, a known regulator of integrin activation. We determined the NMR structure of the kindlin-2 PH domain bound to the head group of PIP3, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate (IP4). The structure reveals a canonical PH domain fold, yet with a distinct IP4 binding pocket that appears highly conserved for the kindlin family members. Functional experiments demonstrate that although wild type kindlin-2 is capable of cooperating with integrin activator talin to induce synergistic integrin α(IIb)β(3) activation, this ability is significantly impaired for a phosphoinositide binding-defective kindlin-2 mutant. These results define a specific PIP3 recognition mode for the kindlin PH domain. Moreover, they shed light upon a mechanism as to how the PH domain mediates membrane engagement of kindlin-2 to promote its binding to integrin and cooperation with talin for regulation of integrin activation."

Deregulation of miRNA functions affects a variety of biological processes also involved in the etiology of several human mendelian and complex diseases. Recently, aberrant miRNA expression has been observed in Cystic Fibrosis (CF), an autosomal-recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, in which a genotype-phenotype correlation is not always found. In order to determine miRNA role in CFTR post-transcriptional regulation, we searched for miR-responsive elements in the CFTR 3′-UTR. In silico analysis, performed using different computational on-line programs, identified some putative miRNAs. Both miR-101 and miR-494 synthetic mimics significantly inhibited the expression of a reporter construct containing the 3′-UTR of CFTR in luciferase assays. Interestingly, miR-101/miR-494 combination was able to markedly suppress CFTR activity by approximately 80% (p<0.001). This is one of the first in vitro studies implicating microRNAs as negative regulators of the CFTR gene expression. miRNA aberrant expression and function might explain the wide phenotypic variability observed among CF patients."

Induction of terpenoid-based oleoresin has long been considered important in conifer defense against bark beetles, but it has been difficult to demonstrate a direct correlation between terpene levels and resistance to bark beetle colonization.To test for inhibitory effects of induced terpenes on colonization by the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) we inoculated 20 mature Norway spruce Picea abies (L.) Karsten trees with a virulent fungus associated with the beetle, Ceratocystis polonica (Siem.) C. Moreau, and investigated induced terpene levels and beetle colonization in the bark.Fungal inoculation induced very strong and highly variable terpene accumulation 35 days after inoculation. Trees with high induced terpene levels (n = 7) had only 4.9% as many beetle attacks (5.1 vs. 103.5 attacks m(-2)) and 2.6% as much gallery length (0.029 m m(-2) vs. 1.11 m m(-2)) as trees with low terpene levels (n = 6). There was a highly significant rank correlation between terpene levels at day 35 and beetle colonization in individual trees. The relationship between induced terpene levels and beetle colonization was not linear but thresholded: above a low threshold concentration of ∼100 mg terpene g(-1) dry phloem trees suffered only moderate beetle colonization, and above a high threshold of ∼200 mg terpene g(-1) dry phloem trees were virtually unattacked.This is the first study demonstrating a dose-dependent relationship between induced terpenes and tree resistance to bark beetle colonization under field conditions, indicating that terpene induction may be instrumental in tree resistance. This knowledge could be useful for developing management strategies that decrease the impact of tree-killing bark beetles."
https://openalex.org/W2053462745,"Background The widespread popularity of genomic applications is threatened by the “bioinformatics bottleneck” resulting from uncertainty about the cost and infrastructure needed to meet increasing demands for next-generation sequence analysis. Cloud computing services have been discussed as potential new bioinformatics support systems but have not been evaluated thoroughly. Results We present benchmark costs and runtimes for common microbial genomics applications, including 16S rRNA analysis, microbial whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequence assembly and annotation, WGS metagenomics and large-scale BLAST. Sequence dataset types and sizes were selected to correspond to outputs typically generated by small- to midsize facilities equipped with 454 and Illumina platforms, except for WGS metagenomics where sampling of Illumina data was used. Automated analysis pipelines, as implemented in the CloVR virtual machine, were used in order to guarantee transparency, reproducibility and portability across different operating systems, including the commercial Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which was used to attach real dollar costs to each analysis type. We found considerable differences in computational requirements, runtimes and costs associated with different microbial genomics applications. While all 16S analyses completed on a single-CPU desktop in under three hours, microbial genome and metagenome analyses utilized multi-CPU support of up to 120 CPUs on Amazon EC2, where each analysis completed in under 24 hours for less than $60. Representative datasets were used to estimate maximum data throughput on different cluster sizes and to compare costs between EC2 and comparable local grid servers. Conclusions Although bioinformatics requirements for microbial genomics depend on dataset characteristics and the analysis protocols applied, our results suggests that smaller sequencing facilities (up to three Roche/454 or one Illumina GAIIx sequencer) invested in 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, microbial single-genome and metagenomics WGS projects can achieve cost-efficient bioinformatics support using CloVR in combination with Amazon EC2 as an alternative to local computing centers."
https://openalex.org/W2053849492,"Arachidonic acid is metabolized through three major metabolic pathways, the cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and CYP450 enzyme systems. Unlike cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases, the role of CYP450 epoxygenases in monocyte/macrophage-mediated responses is not known.When transfected in vitro, CYP2J2 is an efficient activator of anti-inflammatory pathways through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α. Human monocytes and macrophages contain PPARα and here we show they express the epoxygenases CYP2J2 and CYP2C8. Inhibition of constitutive monocyte epoxygenases using the epoxygenase inhibitor SKF525A induces cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and activity, and the release of TNFα, and can be reversed by either add back of the endogenous epoxygenase products and PPARα ligand 11,12- epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) or the addition of the selective synthetic PPARα ligand GW7647. In alternatively activated (IL-4-treated) monocytes, in contrast to classically activated cells, epoxygenase inhibition decreased TNFα release. Epoxygenases can be pro-inflammatory via superoxide anion production. The suppression of TNFα by SKF525A in the presence of IL-4 was associated with a reduction in superoxide anion generation and reproduced by the superoxide dismutase MnCl(2). Similar to these acute activation studies, in monocyte derived macrophages, epoxygenase inhibition elevates M1 macrophage TNFα mRNA and further decreases M2 macrophage TNFα.In conclusion, epoxygenase activity represents an important endogenous pathway which limits monocyte activation. Moreover endogenous epoxygenases are immuno-modulators regulating monocyte/macrophage activation depending on the underlying activation state."
https://openalex.org/W2161629629,"Background DNA barcoding will revolutionize our understanding of fern ecology, most especially because the accurate identification of the independent but cryptic gametophyte phase of the fern's life history—an endeavor previously impossible—will finally be feasible. In this study, we assess the discriminatory power of the core plant DNA barcode (rbcL and matK), as well as alternatively proposed fern barcodes (trnH-psbA and trnL-F), across all major fern lineages. We also present plastid barcode data for two genera in the hyperdiverse polypod clade—Deparia (Woodsiaceae) and the Cheilanthes marginata group (currently being segregated as a new genus of Pteridaceae)—to further evaluate the resolving power of these loci. Principal Findings Our results clearly demonstrate the value of matK data, previously unavailable in ferns because of difficulties in amplification due to a major rearrangement of the plastid genome. With its high sequence variation, matK complements rbcL to provide a two-locus barcode with strong resolving power. With sequence variation comparable to matK, trnL-F appears to be a suitable alternative barcode region in ferns, and perhaps should be added to the core barcode region if universal primer development for matK fails. In contrast, trnH-psbA shows dramatically reduced sequence variation for the majority of ferns. This is likely due to the translocation of this segment of the plastid genome into the inverted repeat regions, which are known to have a highly constrained substitution rate. Conclusions Our study provides the first endorsement of the two-locus barcode (rbcL+matK) in ferns, and favors trnL-F over trnH-psbA as a potential back-up locus. Future work should focus on gathering more fern matK sequence data to facilitate universal primer development."
https://openalex.org/W2054288026,"Microhemorrhages are common in the aging brain, and their incidence is correlated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disease. Past work has shown that occlusion of individual cortical microvessels as well as large-scale hemorrhages can lead to degeneration of neurons and increased inflammation. Using two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy in anesthetized mice, we characterized the acute and chronic dynamics of vessel bleeding, tissue compression, blood flow change, neural degeneration, and inflammation following a microhemorrhage caused by rupturing a single penetrating arteriole with tightly-focused femtosecond laser pulses. We quantified the extravasation of red blood cells (RBCs) and blood plasma into the brain and determined that the bleeding was limited by clotting. The vascular bleeding formed a RBC-filled core that compressed the surrounding parenchymal tissue, but this compression was not sufficient to crush nearby brain capillaries, although blood flow speeds in these vessels was reduced by 20%. Imaging of cortical dendrites revealed no degeneration of the large-scale structure of the dendritic arbor up to 14 days after the microhemorrhage. Dendrites close to the RBC core were displaced by extravasating RBCs but began to relax back one day after the lesion. Finally, we observed a rapid inflammatory response characterized by morphology changes in microglia/macrophages up to 200 µm from the microhemorrhage as well as extension of cellular processes into the RBC core. This inflammation persisted over seven days. Taken together, our data suggest that a cortical microhemorrhage does not directly cause significant neural pathology but does trigger a sustained, local inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2063082418,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on the basis of indirect evidence, such as its presence in affected joint tissues, antigenic cross reactions between EBV and human proteins, and elevated humoral and cellular anti-EBV immune responses in patients. Here we report development of erosive arthritis closely resembling RA in humanized mice inoculated with EBV. Human immune system components were reconstituted in mice of the NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rγnull (NOG) strain by transplantation with CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells isolated from cord blood. These humanized mice were then inoculated with EBV and examined pathologically for the signs of arthritis. Erosive arthritis accompanied by synovial membrane proliferation, pannus formation, and bone marrow edema developed in fifteen of twenty-three NOG mice transplanted with human HSC and inoculated with EBV, but not in the nine NOG mice that were transplanted with HSC but not inoculated with EBV. This is the first report of an animal model of EBV-induced arthritis and strongly suggest a causative role of the virus in RA."
https://openalex.org/W2114562437,"Tight junctions are cell-cell contacts that regulate the paracellular flux of solutes and prevent pathogen entry across cell layers. The assembly and permeability of this barrier are dependent on the zonula occludens (ZO) membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins ZO-1, -2, and -3. MAGUK proteins are characterized by a core motif of protein-binding domains that include a PDZ domain, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a region of homology to guanylate kinase (GUK); the structure of this core motif has never been determined for any MAGUK. To better understand how ZO proteins organize the assembly of protein complexes we have crystallized the entire PDZ3-SH3-GUK core motif of ZO-1. We have also crystallized this core motif in complex with the cytoplasmic tail of the ZO-1 PDZ3 ligand, junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) to determine how the activity of different domains is coordinated. Our study shows a new feature for PDZ class II ligand binding that implicates the two highly conserved Phe(-2) and Ser(-3) residues of JAM. Our x-ray structures and NMR experiments also show for the first time a role for adjacent domains in the binding of ligands to PDZ domains in the MAGUK proteins family."
https://openalex.org/W2034043366,"We examined the contribution of serotype on Streptococcus pneumoniae adhesion and virulence during respiratory tract infection using a panel of isogenic TIGR4 (serotype 4) mutants expressing the capsule types 6A (+6A), 7F (+7F) and 23F (+23F) as well as a deleted and restored serotype 4 (+4) control strain. Immunoblots, bacterial capture assays with immobilized antibody, and measurement of mean fluorescent intensity by flow cytometry following incubation of bacteria with antibody, all determined that the surface accessibility, but not total protein levels, of the virulence determinants Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), Choline binding protein A (CbpA), and Pneumococcal serine-rich repeat protein (PsrP) changed with serotype. In vitro, bacterial adhesion to Detroit 562 pharyngeal or A549 lung epithelial cells was modestly but significantly altered for +6A, +7F and +23F. In a mouse model of nasopharyngeal colonization, the number of +6A, +7F, and +23F pneumococci in the nasopharynx was reduced 10 to 100-fold versus +4; notably, only mice challenged with +4 developed bacteremia. Intratracheal challenge of mice confirmed that capsule switch strains were highly attenuated for virulence. Compared to +4, the +6A, +7F, and +23F strains were rapidly cleared from the lungs and were not detected in the blood. In mice challenged intraperitoneally, a marked reduction in bacterial blood titers was observed for those challenged with +6A and +7F versus +4 and +23F was undetectable. These findings show that serotype impacts the accessibility of surface adhesins and, in particular, affects virulence within the respiratory tract. They highlight the complex interplay between capsule and protein virulence determinants."
https://openalex.org/W2126322003,"WT1 is a zinc finger transcription factor expressed at high levels in many types of solid tumors, and high WT1 expression is an adverse prognostic factor. How WT1 contributes to tumor growth and influences prognosis remains unclear. We investigated the hypothesis that WT1 up-regulates VEGF in solid tumors, augmenting the response to hypoxia. We found a correlation between levels of WT1 expression and VEGF expression in Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Transfecting WT1-null SK-ES-1 cells with WT1 up-regulated VEGF mRNA expression and resulted in increased angiogenic activity in vitro. Conversely, diminishing WT1 expression in WT1-positive cell lines using WT1-specific shRNA down-regulated VEGF mRNA expression and decreased angiogenic activity in vitro. Transient transfection assays demonstrated that WT1 can regulate the activity of the VEGF promoter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that WT1 can bind directly to the VEGF promoter in intact cells. WT1 expression in Ewing sarcoma cells is up-regulated by hypoxia. Importantly, using shRNA to inhibit this up-regulation blunted the hypoxia-mediated increase in VEGF expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that VEGF is a direct, bona fide WT1 target gene in sarcoma and that WT1 plays a key role in optimizing the response of tumor cells to hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2030791683,"Background Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in the mechanism of antidepressant action, and neurotrophic factors can mediate the neurogenic changes underlying these effects. The neurotrophic factor neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is involved in many aspects of brain development, from cell fate determination to neuronal maturation. However, nothing is known about the influence of NRG1 on neurodevelopmental processes occurring in the mature hippocampus. Methods Adult male mice were given subcutaneous NRG1 or saline to assess dentate gyrus proliferation and neurogenesis, as well as cell fate determination. Mice also underwent behavioral testing. Expression of ErbB3 and ErbB4 NRG1 receptors in newborn dentate gyrus cells was assessed at various time points between birth and maturity. The phenotype of ErbB-expressing progenitor cells was also characterized with cell type-specific markers. Results The current study shows that subchronic peripheral NRG1β administration selectively increased cell proliferation (by 71%) and neurogenesis (by 50%) in the caudal dentate gyrus within the ventral hippocampus. This pro-proliferative effect did not alter neuronal fate, and may have been mediated by ErbB3 receptors, which were expressed by newborn dentate gyrus cells from cell division to maturity and colocalized with SOX2 in the subgranular zone. Furthermore, four weeks after cessation of subchronic treatment, animals displayed robust antidepressant-like behavior in the absence of changes in locomotor activity, whereas acute treatment did not produce antidepressant effects. Conclusions These results show that neuregulin-1β has pro-proliferative, neurogenic and antidepressant properties, further highlight the importance of peripheral neurotrophic factors in neurogenesis and mood, and support the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in mediating antidepressant effects."

Due to inherent difficulties in the laboratory-propagation of P. vivax, the biology of this parasite has not been adequately explored. While the proteome of P. falciparum, the causative agent of cerebral malaria, has been extensively explored from several sources, there is limited information on the proteome of P. vivax. We have, for the first time, examined the proteome of P. vivax isolated directly from patients without adaptation to laboratory conditions. We have identified 153 proteins from clinical P. vivax, majority of which do not show homology to any previously known gene products. We also report 29 new proteins that were found to be expressed in P. vivax for the first time. In addition, several proteins previously implicated as anti-malarial targets, were also found in our analysis. Most importantly, we found several unique proteins expressed by P. vivax.This study is an important step in providing insight into physiology of the parasite under clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W1970616348,"The planktonic foraminiferal morpho-species Globoconella inflata is widely used as a stratigraphic and paleoceanographic index. While G. inflata was until now regarded as a single species, we show that it rather constitutes a complex of two pseudo-cryptic species. Our study is based on SSU and ITS rDNA sequence analyses and genotyping of 497 individuals collected at 49 oceanic stations covering the worldwide range of the morpho-species. Phylogenetic analyses unveil the presence of two divergent genotypes. Type I inhabits transitional and subtropical waters of both hemispheres, while Type II is restricted to the Antarctic subpolar waters. The two genetic species exhibit a strictly allopatric distribution on each side of the Antarctic Subpolar Front. On the other hand, sediment data show that G. inflata was restricted to transitional and subtropical environments since the early Pliocene, and expanded its geographic range to southern subpolar waters ∼700 kyrs ago, during marine isotopic stage 17. This datum may correspond to a peripatric speciation event that led to the partition of an ancestral genotype into two distinct evolutionary units. Biometric measurements performed on individual G. inflata from plankton tows north and south of the Antarctic Subpolar Front indicate that Types I and II display slight but significant differences in shell morphology. These morphological differences may allow recognition of the G. inflata pseudo-cryptic species back into the fossil record, which in turn may contribute to monitor past movements of the Antarctic Subpolar Front during the middle and late Pleistocene."

https://openalex.org/W2102721845,"Background LZAP was isolated as a binding protein of the Cdk5 activator p35. LZAP has been highly conserved during evolution and has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor in various cancers. This study aimed to investigate LZAP expression and its prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Meanwhile, the function of LZAP in hepatocarcinogenesis was further investigated in cell culture models and mouse models. Methods Real-time quantitative PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to explore LZAP expression in HCC cell lines and primary HCC clinical specimens. The functions of LZAP in the proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, migration, invasion and apoptosis of HCC cell lines were also analyzed by infecting cells with an adenovirus containing full-length LZAP. The effect of LZAP on tumorigenicity in nude mice was also investigated. Results LZAP expression was significantly decreased in the tumor tissues and HCC cell lines. Clinicopathological analysis showed that LZAP expression was significantly correlated with tumor size, histopathological classification and serum α-fetoprotein (AFP). The Kaplan–Meier survival curves revealed that decreasing LZAP expression was associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. LZAP expression was an independent prognostic marker of overall HCC patient survival in a multivariate analysis. The re-introduction of LZAP expression in the HepG2 and sk-Hep1 HCC cell lines significantly inhibited proliferation and colony formation in the HCC cells and induced G1 phase arrest and apoptosis of the HCC cells in vitro. Restoring LZAP expression in the HCC cell lines also inhibited migration and invasion. In addition, experiments with a mouse model revealed that LZAP overexpression could suppress HCC tumorigenicity in vivo. Conclusions Our data suggest that LZAP may play an important role in HCC progression and could be a potential molecular therapy target for HCC."
https://openalex.org/W1995803125,"Exploring topological properties of human brain network has become an exciting topic in neuroscience research. Large-scale structural and functional brain networks both exhibit a small-world topology, which is evidence for global and local parallel information processing. Meanwhile, resting state networks (RSNs) underlying specific biological functions have provided insights into how intrinsic functional architecture influences cognitive and perceptual information processing. However, topological properties of single RSNs remain poorly understood. Here, we have two hypotheses: i) each RSN also has optimized small-world architecture; ii) topological properties of RSNs related to perceptual and higher cognitive processes are different. To test these hypotheses, we investigated the topological properties of the default-mode, dorsal attention, central-executive, somato-motor, visual and auditory networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found small-world topology in each RSN. Furthermore, small-world properties of cognitive networks were higher than those of perceptual networks. Our findings are the first to demonstrate a topological fractionation between perceptual and higher cognitive networks. Our approach may be useful for clinical research, especially for diseases that show selective abnormal connectivity in specific brain networks."

https://openalex.org/W2007475146,"Abiotic stress, such as drought and high salinity, activates a network of signaling cascades that lead to the expression of many stress-responsive genes in plants. The Arabidopsis FIERY1 (FRY1) protein is a negative regulator of stress and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and exhibits both an inositol polyphosphatase and a 3′,5′-bisphosphate nucleotidase activity in vitro. The FRY1 nucleotidase degrades the sulfation byproduct 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate (PAP), yet its in vivo functions and particularly its roles in stress gene regulation remain unclear. Here we developed a LC-MS/MS method to quantitatively measure PAP levels in plants and investigated the roles of this nucleotidase activity in stress response and plant development. It was found that PAP level was tightly controlled in plants and did not accumulate to any significant level either under normal conditions or under NaCl, LiCl, cold, or ABA treatments. In contrast, high levels of PAP were detected in multiple mutant alleles of FRY1 but not in mutants of other FRY1 family members, indicating that FRY1 is the major enzyme that hydrolyzes PAP in vivo. By genetically reducing PAP levels in fry1 mutants either through overexpression of a yeast PAP nucleotidase or by generating a triple mutant of fry1 apk1 apk2 that is defective in the biosynthesis of the PAP precursor 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), we demonstrated that the developmental defects and superinduction of stress-responsive genes in fry1 mutants correlate with PAP accumulation in planta. We also found that the hypersensitive stress gene regulation in fry1 requires ABH1 but not ABI1, two other negative regulators in ABA signaling pathways. Unlike in yeast, however, FRY1 overexpression in Arabidopsis could not enhance salt tolerance. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PAP is critical for stress gene regulation and plant development, yet the FRY1 nucleotidase that catabolizes PAP may not be an in vivo salt toxicity target in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2155837256,"FK506-binding protein 38 (FKBP38), a membrane-anchored, tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing immunophilin, associates with nascent plasma membrane ion channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It promotes the maturation of the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel and maintains the steady state level of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using a combination of steady state and pulse-chase analyses, we show that FKBP38 knockdown increases protein synthesis but inhibits the post-translational folding of CFTR, leading to reduced steady state levels of CFTR in the ER, decreased processing, and impaired cell surface functional expression in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. The membrane anchorage of FKBP38 is necessary for the inhibition of protein synthesis but not for CFTR post-translational folding. In contrast, the peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase active site is utilized to promote CFTR post-translational folding but is not important for regulation of protein synthesis. Uncoupling FKBP38 from Hsp90 by substituting a conserved lysine in the TPR domain modestly enhances CFTR maturation and further reduces its synthesis. Removing the N-terminal glutamate-rich domain (ERD) slightly enhances CFTR synthesis but reduces its maturation, suggesting that the ERD contributes to FKBP38 biological activities. Our data support a dual role for FKBP38 in regulating CFTR synthesis and post-translational folding. In contrast to earlier prediction but consistent with in vitro enzymological studies, FKBP38 peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase plays an important role in membrane protein biogenesis on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane, whose activity is negatively regulated by Hsp90 through the TPR domain."
https://openalex.org/W1989144074,"Rice stripe virus (RSV) is the type member of the genus Tenuivirus, which relies on the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus Fallén) for its transmission in a persistent, circulative-propagative manner. To be transmitted, virus must cross the midgut and salivary glands epithelial barriers in a transcytosis mechanism where vector receptors interact with virions, and as propagative virus, RSV need utilize host components to complete viral propagation in vector cells. At present, these mechanisms remain unknown. In this paper, we screened L. striatellus proteins, separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), as potential RSV binding molecules using a virus overlay assay of protein blots. The results, five L. striatellus proteins that bound to purified RSV particles in vitro were resolved and identified using mass spectrometry. The virus-binding capacities of five proteins were further elucidated in yeast two-hybrid screen (YTHS) and virus-binding experiments of expressed proteins. Among five proteins, the receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH3) did not interact with RSV nucleocapsid protein (NCP) in YTHS and in far-Western blot, and three ribosomal proteins (RPL5, RPL7a and RPL8) had specific interactions with RSV. In dot immunobinding assay (DIBA), all five proteins were able to bind to RSV particles. The five proteins' potential contributions to the interactions between RSV and L. striatellus were discussed. We proposed that RACK and GAPDH3 might be involved in the epithelial transcytosis of virus particles, and three ribosomal proteins probably played potential crucial roles in the infection and propagation of RSV in vector cells."
https://openalex.org/W2164033249,"The field of evolutionary medicine examines the possibility that some diseases are the result of trade-offs made in human evolution. Spinal fractures are the most common osteoporosis-related fracture in humans, but are not observed in apes, even in cases of severe osteopenia. In humans, the development of osteoporosis is influenced by peak bone mass and strength in early adulthood as well as age-related bone loss. Here, we examine the structural differences in the vertebral bodies (the portion of the vertebra most commonly involved in osteoporosis-related fractures) between humans and apes before age-related bone loss occurs. Vertebrae from young adult humans and chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons (T8 vertebrae, n = 8–14 per species, male and female, humans: 20–40 years of age) were examined to determine bone strength (using finite element models), bone morphology (external shape), and trabecular microarchitecture (micro-computed tomography). The vertebrae of young adult humans are not as strong as those from apes after accounting for body mass (p<0.01). Human vertebrae are larger in size (volume, cross-sectional area, height) than in apes with a similar body mass. Young adult human vertebrae have significantly lower trabecular bone volume fraction (0.26±0.04 in humans and 0.37±0.07 in apes, mean ± SD, p<0.01) and thinner vertebral shells than apes (after accounting for body mass, p<0.01). Since human vertebrae are more porous and weaker than those in apes in young adulthood (after accounting for bone mass), even modest amounts of age-related bone loss may lead to vertebral fracture in humans, while in apes, larger amounts of bone loss would be required before a vertebral fracture becomes likely. We present arguments that differences in vertebral bone size and shape associated with reduced bone strength in humans is linked to evolutionary adaptations associated with bipedalism."

Recently, the BCG Tokyo 172 substrain was reported to consist of two subpopulations with different colony morphologies, smooth and rough. Smooth colonies had a characteristic 22-bp deletion in Rv3405c of the region of difference (RD) 16 (type I), and rough colonies were complete in this region (type II). We hypothesized that the morphological difference is related to lipid phenotype and affects their antigenicity. We determined the lipid compositions and biosynthesis of types I and II. Scanning electron microscopy showed that type I was 1.5 times longer than type II. Phenolic glycolipid (PGL) and phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) were found only in type I. Although it has been reported that the RD16 is involved in the expression of PGL, type II did not possess PGL/PDIM. We examined the ppsA-E gene responsible for PGL/PDIM biosynthesis and found that the existence of PGL/PDIM in types I and II is caused by a ppsA gene mutation not regulated by the RD16. PGL suppressed the host recognition of total lipids via Toll-like receptor 2, and this suggests that PGL is antigenic and involved in host responses, acting as a cell wall component. This is the first report to show the difference between lipid phenotypes of types I and II. It is important to clarify the heterogeneity of BCG vaccine substrains to discuss and evaluate the quality, safety, and efficacy of the BCG vaccine."

The cross-linking of γ chains is known to involve the reciprocal linkages between Gln(398) and Lys(406). In α chains, however, the respective lysine and glutamine partners remain largely unknown. Traditional biochemical approaches have only identified the possible lysine donor and glutamine acceptor sites but have failed to define the respective relationships between them. Here, a differential mass spectrometry method was implemented to characterize cross-linked α chain peptides originating from native fibrin. Tryptic digests of fibrin that underwent differential cross-linking conditions were analyzed by high resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry. Differential intensities associated with monoisotopic masses of cross-linked peptides were selected for further characterization. A fit-for-purpose algorithm was developed to assign cross-linked peptide pairs of fibrin α chains to the monoisotopic masses relying on accurate mass measurement as the primary criterion for identification. Equipped with hypothesized sequences, tandem mass spectrometry was then used to confirm the identities of the cross-linked peptides. In addition to the reciprocal cross-links between Gln(398) and Lys(406) on the γ chains of fibrin (the positive control of the study), nine specific cross-links (Gln(223)-Lys(508), Gln(223)-Lys(539), Gln(237)-Lys(418), Gln(237)-Lys(508), Gln(237)-Lys(539), Gln(237)-Lys(556), Gln(366)-Lys(539), Gln(563)-Lys(539), and Gln(563)-Lys(601)) on the α chains of fibrin were newly identified.

https://openalex.org/W2150247131,"We have analyzed the structure and function of the integrin α(1)I domain harboring a gain-of-function mutation E317A. To promote protein crystallization, a double variant with an additional C139S mutation was used. In cell adhesion assays, the E317A mutation promoted binding to collagen. Similarly, the double mutation C139S/E317A increased adhesion compared with C139S alone. Furthermore, soluble α(1)I C139S/E317A was a higher avidity collagen binder than α(1)I C139S, indicating that the double variant represents an activated form. The crystal structure of the activated variant of α(1)I was solved at 1.9 Å resolution. The E317A mutation results in the unwinding of the αC helix, but the metal ion has moved toward loop 1, instead of loop 2 in the open α(2)I. Furthermore, unlike in the closed αI domains, the metal ion is pentacoordinated and, thus, prepared for ligand binding. Helix 7, which has moved downward in the open α(2)I structure, has not changed its position in the activated α(1)I variant. During the integrin activation, Glu(335) on helix 7 binds to the metal ion at the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) of the β(1) subunit. Interestingly, in our cell adhesion assays E317A could activate collagen binding even after mutating Glu(335). This indicates that the stabilization of helix 7 into its downward position is not required if the α(1) MIDAS is already open. To conclude, the activated α(1)I domain represents a novel conformation of the αI domain, mimicking the structural state where the Arg(287)-Glu(317) ion pair has just broken during the integrin activation."

Here, we used social network analysis to examine the patterns of leader-follower interactions in relation to individual characteristics in foraging groups of free-living rock sparrows (Petronia petronia). We found that yellow feather ornamentation, a carotenoid-based trait, was the best predictor of leadership: birds with bigger ornaments exerted greater influence in the foraging groups and were followed by more group-mates than less elaborate individuals. An individual's tendency for eliciting followings was not influenced by sex, condition or the level of parental investment. None of the above individual characteristics had significant effect on the tendency of individuals to follow others. Our results indicate that a sexually selected trait can also play a significant role in group coordination and social organization of a species."

Shoulder height has been used to accurately assign age to free-ranging African savanna elephants. However, back length may provide an analog measurable in aerial-based surveys. We assessed the relationship between back length and age for known-age elephants in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, and Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa. We also compared age- and sex-specific back lengths between these populations and compared adult female back lengths across 11 widely dispersed populations in five African countries. Sex-specific Von Bertalanffy growth curves provided a good fit to the back length data of known-age individuals. Based on back length, accurate ages could be assigned relatively precisely for females up to 23 years of age and males up to 17. The female back length curve allowed more precise age assignment to older females than the curve for shoulder height does, probably because of divergence between the respective growth curves. However, this did not appear to be the case for males, but the sample of known-age males was limited to ≤27 years. Age- and sex-specific back lengths were similar in Amboseli National Park and Addo Elephant National Park. Furthermore, while adult female back lengths in the three Zambian populations were generally shorter than in other populations, back lengths in the remaining eight populations did not differ significantly, in support of claims that growth patterns of African savanna elephants are similar over wide geographic regions. Thus, the growth curves presented here should allow researchers to use aerial-based surveys to assign ages to elephants with greater precision than previously possible and, therefore, to estimate population variables."

Sample size for clinical trials based on this new outcome measure were estimated by a bootstrap resampling technique.The zero-inflated Poisson model gave the best fit, according to the Akaike criterion to the observed distribution of new CLs developed over 12 and 24 months both in each treatment group and in the whole RRMS patients group adjusting for treatment effect.The sample size calculations based on the zero-inflated Poisson model indicate that randomized clinical trials using this new MRI marker as an outcome are feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2071288322,"Pyrene-containing compounds are commonly used in a number of fluorescence-based applications because they can form excited-state dimers (excimers) by stacking interaction between excited-state and ground-state monomers. Their usefulness arises from the facts that excimer formation requires close proximity between the pyrenes and that the excimer emission spectrum is very different from that of the monomers. One of many applications is to assess proximity between specific sites of macromolecules labeled with pyrenes. This has been done using pyrene maleimide, a reagent that reacts with reduced thiols of cysteines, but its use for structural studies of proteins has been rather limited. This is because the introduction of two cysteines at sufficiently close distance from each other to obtain excimer fluorescence upon labeling with pyrene maleimide requires detailed knowledge of the protein structure or extensive site-directed mutagenesis trials. We synthesized and tested a new compound with a 4-carbon methylene linker placed between the maleimide and the pyrene (pyrene-4-maleimide), with the aim of increasing the sampling distance for excimer formation and making the use of excimer fluorescence simpler and more widespread. We tested the new compound on thiol-modified oligonucleotides and showed that it can detect proximity between thiols beyond the reach of pyrene maleimide. Based on its spectroscopic and chemical properties, we suggest that pyrene-4-maleimide is an excellent probe to assess proximities between cysteines in proteins and thiols in other macromolecules, as well as to follow conformational changes."

The frequency of the variant genotype CC was significantly higher in familial (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.08-2.56, P = 0.019) and unselected patients (OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.18-1.97, P = 0.001) and the overall risk was increased (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.20-1.98, P = 0.0007). Additional analysis with clinicopathological data revealed an association with an aggressive disease (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.05-∞, P = 0.02). The CC genotype of the Cys148Arg variant was also contributing to the lowered ARLTS1 expression status in lymphoblastoid cells from familial patients. In addition significantly lowered ARLTS1 expression was observed in clinical tumor samples compared to BPH samples (P = 0.01). The ARLTS1 co-expression signature based on previously published microarray data was generated from 1587 cancer samples confirming the low expression of ARLTS1 in PCa and showed that ARLTS1 expression was strongly associated with immune processes. This study provides strong confirmation of the important role of ARLTS1 Cys148Arg variant as a contributor in PCa predisposition and a potential marker for aggressive disease outcome."

In this study, we characterized the cellular mechanisms underlying Ca(2+) mobilization induced by (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG; a specific group I mGluR agonist) in the somata of acutely dissociated rat hippocampal neurons using microfluorometry. We found that DHPG activates mGluR5 to mobilize intracellular Ca(2+) from ryanodine-sensitive stores via cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR), while the PLC/IP(3) signaling pathway was not involved in Ca(2+) mobilization. The application of glutamate, which depolarized the membrane potential by 28.5±4.9 mV (n = 4), led to transient Ca(2+) mobilization by mGluR5 and Ca(2+) influx through L-type Ca(2+) channels. We found no evidence that mGluR5-mediated Ca(2+) release and Ca(2+) influx through L-type Ca(2+) channels interact to generate supralinear Ca(2+) transients. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization by mGluR5 in the somata of hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2007387085,"Prion diseases are a family of unique fatal transmissible neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and many animals. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is the most common prion disease in humans, accounting for 85-90% of all human prion cases, and exhibits a high degree of diversity in phenotypes. The etiology of sCJD remains to be elucidated. The human prion protein gene has an octapeptide repeat region (octarepeats) that normally contains 5 repeats of 24-27 bp (1 nonapeptide and 4 octapeptide coding sequences). An increase of the octarepeat numbers to six or more or a decrease of the octarepeat number to three is linked to genetic prion diseases with heterogeneous phenotypes in humans. Here we report that the human octarepeat region is prone to either contraction or expansion when subjected to PCR amplification in vitro using Taq or Pwo polymerase and when replicated in wild type E. coli cells. Octarepeat insertion mutants were even less stable, and the mutation rate for the wild type octarepeats was much higher when replicated in DNA mismatch repair-deficient E. coli cells. All observed octarepeat mutants resulting from DNA replication in E. coli were contained in head-to-head plasmid dimers and DNA mfold analysis (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/DNA-Folding-Form) indicates that both DNA strands of the octarepeat region would likely form multiple stable hairpin structures, suggesting that the octarepeat sequence may form stable hairpin structures during DNA replication or repair to cause octarepeat instability. These results provide the first evidence supporting a somatic octarepeat mutation-based model for human sCJD etiology: 1) the instability of the octarepeat region leads to accumulation of somatic octarepeat mutations in brain cells during development and aging, 2) this instability is augmented by compromised DNA mismatch repair in aged cells, and 3) eventually some of the octarepeat mutation-containing brain cells start spontaneous de novo prion formation and replication to initiate sCJD."
