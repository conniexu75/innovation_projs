https://openalex.org/W2026482820,"Conflict monitoring by the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been posited to signal a need for greater cognitive control, producing neural and behavioral adjustments. However, the very occurrence of behavioral adjustments after conflict has been questioned, along with suggestions that there is no direct evidence of ACC conflict-related activity predicting subsequent neural or behavioral adjustments in control. Using the Stroop color-naming task and controlling for repetition effects, we demonstrate that ACC conflict-related activity predicts both greater prefrontal cortex activity and adjustments in behavior, supporting a role of ACC conflict monitoring in the engagement of cognitive control."
https://openalex.org/W1616121322,"The tumor suppressor p53 exerts its anti-neoplastic activity primarily through the induction of apoptosis. We found that cytosolic localization of endogenous wild-type or trans-activation-deficient p53 was necessary and sufficient for apoptosis. p53 directly activated the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax in the absence of other proteins to permeabilize mitochondria and engage the apoptotic program. p53 also released both proapoptotic multidomain proteins and BH3-only proteins [Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins that share only the third Bcl-2 homology domain (BH3)] that were sequestered by Bcl-xL. The transcription-independent activation of Bax by p53 occurred with similar kinetics and concentrations to those produced by activated Bid. We propose that when p53 accumulates in the cytosol, it can function analogously to the BH3-only subset of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins to activate Bax and trigger apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2080648518,"Cell-to-cell communication is a crucial prerequisite for the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms. To date, diverse mechanisms of intercellular exchange of information have been documented, including chemical synapses, gap junctions, and plasmodesmata. Here, we describe highly sensitive nanotubular structures formed de novo between cells that create complex networks. These structures facilitate the selective transfer of membrane vesicles and organelles but seem to impede the flow of small molecules. Accordingly, we propose a novel biological principle of cell-to-cell interaction based on membrane continuity and intercellular transfer of organelles."
https://openalex.org/W2017126312,"Many plants flower in response to seasonal fluctuations in day length. The CONSTANS (CO) gene of Arabidopsis promotes flowering in long days. Flowering is induced when CO messenger RNA expression coincides with the exposure of plants to light. However, how this promotes CO activity is unknown. We show that light stabilizes nuclear CO protein in the evening, whereas in the morning or in darkness the protein is degraded by the proteasome. Photoreceptors regulate CO stability and act antagonistically to generate daily rhythms in CO abundance. This layer of regulation refines the circadian rhythm in CO messenger RNA and is central to the mechanism by which day length controls flowering."
https://openalex.org/W2086806466,"Packing problems, such as how densely objects can fill a volume, are among the most ancient and persistent problems in mathematics and science. For equal spheres, it has only recently been proved that the face-centered cubic lattice has the highest possible packing fraction \batchmode \documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]{article} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amsmath} \pagestyle{empty} \begin{document} \({\varphi}={\pi}{/}\sqrt{18}{\approx}0.74\) \end{document} . It is also well known that certain random (amorphous) jammed packings have φ ≈ 0.64. Here, we show experimentally and with a new simulation algorithm that ellipsoids can randomly pack more densely—up to φ= 0.68 to 0.71for spheroids with an aspect ratio close to that of M&amp;M's Candies—and even approach φ ≈ 0.74 for ellipsoids with other aspect ratios. We suggest that the higher density is directly related to the higher number of degrees of freedom per particle and thus the larger number of particle contacts required to mechanically stabilize the packing. We measured the number of contacts per particle Z ≈ 10 for our spheroids, as compared to Z ≈ 6 for spheres. Our results have implications for a broad range of scientific disciplines, including the properties of granular media and ceramics, glass formation, and discrete geometry."

Rapid vaporization and mixing with air with an automotive fuel injector were performed at temperatures sufficiently low and times sufficiently fast that homogeneous reactions producing carbon, acetaldehyde, ethylene, and total combustion products can be minimized. This process has great potential for low-cost H2 generation in fuel cells for small portable applications where liquid fuel storage is essential and where systems must be small, simple, and robust."
https://openalex.org/W2146365367,"The ecology of Bornean rainforests is driven by El Niño-induced droughts that trigger synchronous fruiting among trees and bursts of faunal reproduction that sustain vertebrate populations. However, many of these species- and carbon-rich ecosystems have been destroyed by logging and conversion, which increasingly threaten protected areas. Our satellite, Geographic Information System, and field-based analyses show that from 1985 to 2001, Kalimantan's protected lowland forests declined by more than 56% (>29,000 square kilometers). Even uninhabited frontier parks are logged to supply international markets. ""Protected"" forests have become increasingly isolated and deforested and their buffer zones degraded. Preserving the ecological integrity of Kalimantan's rainforests requires immediate transnational management."
https://openalex.org/W2166795661,"Legumes can enter into symbiotic relationships with both nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) and mycorrhizal fungi. Nodulation by rhizobia results from a signal transduction pathway induced in legume roots by rhizobial Nod factors. DMI3, a Medicago truncatula gene that acts immediately downstream of calcium spiking in this signaling pathway and is required for both nodulation and mycorrhizal infection, has high sequence similarity to genes encoding calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CCaMKs). This indicates that calcium spiking is likely an essential component of the signaling cascade leading to nodule development and mycorrhizal infection, and sheds light on the biological role of plant CCaMKs."

https://openalex.org/W2102897805,"Legumes form symbiotic associations with both mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria called rhizobia. Several of the plant genes required for transduction of rhizobial signals, the Nod factors, are also necessary for mycorrhizal symbiosis. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of one such gene from the legume Medicago truncatula. The DMI1 (does not make infections) gene encodes a novel protein with low global similarity to a ligand-gated cation channel domain of archaea. The protein is highly conserved in angiosperms and ancestral to land plants. We suggest that DMI1 represents an ancient plant-specific innovation, potentially enabling mycorrhizal associations."

https://openalex.org/W2019414150,"Atomic layer deposition and magnetron sputter deposition were used to synthesize thin-film multilayers of W/Al 2 O 3 . With individual layers only a few nanometers thick, the high interface density produced a strong impediment to heat transfer, giving rise to a thermal conductivity of ∼0.6 watts per meter per kelvin. This result suggests that high densities of interfaces between dissimilar materials may provide a route for the production of thermal barriers with ultra-low thermal conductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2013235095,"The structure of the general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in a complex with RNA polymerase II reveals three features crucial for transcription initiation: an N-terminal zinc ribbon domain of TFIIB that contacts the ""dock"" domain of the polymerase, near the path of RNA exit from a transcribing enzyme; a ""finger"" domain of TFIIB that is inserted into the polymerase active center; and a C-terminal domain, whose interaction with both the polymerase and with a TATA box-binding protein (TBP)-promoter DNA complex orients the DNA for unwinding and transcription. TFIIB stabilizes an early initiation complex, containing an incomplete RNA-DNA hybrid region. It may interact with the template strand, which sets the location of the transcription start site, and may interfere with RNA exit, which leads to abortive initiation or promoter escape. The trajectory of promoter DNA determined by the C-terminal domain of TFIIB traverses sites of interaction with TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH, serving to define their roles in the transcription initiation process."

https://openalex.org/W1989815049,"Angiogenic factors are critical to the initiation of angiogenesis and maintenance of the vascular network. Here we use human genetics as an approach to identify an angiogenic factor, VG5Q, and further define two genetic defects of VG5Q in patients with the vascular disease Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS). One mutation is chromosomal translocation t(5;11), which increases VG5Q transcription. The second is mutation E133K identified in five KTS patients, but not in 200 matched controls. VG5Q protein acts as a potent angiogenic factor in promoting angiogenesis, and suppression of VG5Q expression inhibits vessel formation. E133K is a functional mutation that substantially enhances the angiogenic effect of VG5Q. VG5Q shows strong expression in blood vessels and is secreted as vessel formation is initiated. VG5Q can bind to endothelial cells and promote cell proliferation, suggesting that it may act in an autocrine fashion. We also demonstrate a direct interaction of VG5Q with another secreted angiogenic factor, TWEAK (also known as TNFSF12). These results define VG5Q as an angiogenic factor, establish VG5Q as a susceptibility gene for KTS, and show that increased angiogenesis is a molecular pathogenic mechanism of KTS."
https://openalex.org/W2118707281,"Based on the observation that the Na+/K+-ATPase α subunit contains two conserved caveolin-binding motifs, we hypothesized that clustering of the Na+/K+-ATPase and its partners in caveolae facilitates ouabain-activated signal transduction. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay showed that the Na+/K+-ATPase bound to the N terminus of caveolin-1. Significantly, ouabain regulated the interaction in a time- and dose-dependent manner and stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in LLC-PK1 cells. When added to the isolated membrane fractions, ouabain increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins from the isolated caveolae but not other membrane fractions. Consistently, ouabain induced the formation of a Na+/K+-ATPase-Src-caveolin complex in the isolated caveolae preparations as it did in live cells. Finally, depletion of either cholesterol by methyl β-cyclodextrin or caveolin-1 by siRNA significantly reduced the caveolar Na+/K+-ATPase and Src. Concomitantly, cholesterol depletion abolished ouabain-induced recruitment of Src to the Na+/K+-ATPase signaling complex. Like depletion of caveolin-1, it also blocked the effect of ouabain on ERKs, which was restored after cholesterol repletion.

Clearly, the caveolar Na+/K+-ATPase represents the signaling pool of the pump that interacts with Src and transmits the ouabain signals. Na+/K+-ATPase, or the sodium pump, is a ubiquitous transmembrane pump that transports Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane by hydrolyzing ATP (1Skou J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 23: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 2Lingrel J.B. Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). The pump also functions as a signal-transducing receptor for ouabain and other cardiotonic steroids (4Xie Z. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of ouabain to the pump activates multiple signal transduction pathways and regulates transcription and translation of many genes in cardiac myocytes and other cell types (5Kometiani P. Li J.

Pharmacol. 1998; 151: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Significantly, some of these ouabain effects were independent of changes in intracellular ion concentrations (8Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 9Liu J. Tian J. Haas M. Shapiro J.I. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol.

More recently, we have demonstrated that Na+/K+-ATPase interacts with neighboring membrane proteins and organized cytosolic cascades of signaling complexes to transmit the ouabain signal to different intracellular compartments (11Haas M. Wang H. Tian J. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18694-18702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the activated Na+/K+-ATPase-Src complex recruits/phosphorylates multiple proteins. This eventually results in the assembly of different signaling cascades. One of the activated cascades involves Src-mediated trans-activation of EGFR 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Mβ-CD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; siRNA, small interference RNA; MBS, Mes-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Mβ-CD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; siRNA, small interference RNA; MBS, Mes-buffered saline. and subsequent recruitment and assembly of the Shc/Ras/Raf/ERKs in several different cell lines (11Haas M. Wang H. Tian J. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18694-18702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Realization that Na+/K+-ATPase has to interact with Src, EGFR, and other proteins to transmit the ouabain signal has prompted us to propose that the signaling pump is pre-assembled with its partners in membrane microdomains such as caveolae. Caveolae were first identified as flask-shaped vesicular invagination of plasma membrane and are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and sphingomyelin (12Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 13Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Caveolins are structural proteins of caveolae. The mammalian cells express three different genes (namely cavolin-1, -2, and -3) that encode five different isoforms. The primary sequence of caveolin-1 contains a central hydrophobic domain (residues 102–134) that anchors to membranes, an oligomerization domain (residues 61–101), and a scaffolding domain (residues 82–101) (13Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interaction between the oligomerization domains and the C-terminal domains results in formation of high molecular oligomers containing about 14–16 caveolins, which is important for the scaffolding function of caveolins. Interaction of caveolin scaffolding domain with putative caveolin-binding motifs in a large number of signaling proteins such as Src, EGFR, and Ras concentrates these proteins in caveolae (13Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This makes caveolae an ideal microdomain for the Na+/K+-ATPase to interact with Src and other signaling proteins. However, early studies failed to demonstrate that caveolae contain Na+/K+-ATPase (14Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Thorsen E. Immerdal L. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5136-5142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 15Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Because these studies used Triton X-100 to prepare caveolae, we have recently re-examined this issue using a well-established detergent-free method, because it is well established that Na+/K+-ATPase is readily soluble in Triton X-100. The data indicate that the Na+/K+-ATPase is concentrated in caveolae isolated from the heart, the kidney, and cultured cells (16Liu L. Mohammadi K. Aynafshar B. Wang H. Li D. Liu J. Ivanov A.V. Xie Z. Askari A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1550-C1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Significantly, we found that ouabain activated the caveolar ERKs in the isolated heart preparation, suggesting that the caveolar Na+/K+-ATPase may be involved in ouabain-mediated signal transduction (16Liu L. Mohammadi K. Aynafshar B. Wang H. Li D. Liu J. Ivanov A.V. Xie Z. Askari A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1550-C1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this study aims to determine whether Na+/K+-ATPase directly interacts with caveolin-1 and if caveolae are actually involved in formation of a signaling module for components of the ouabain-activated Na+/K+-ATPase signaling complex. Materials—Chemicals of the highest purity were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The antibodies used and their sources are as follows: The anti-phospho ERK monoclonal antibody, anti-ERK polyclonal antibody, anti-Src monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The Optitran nitrocellulose membranes used for Western blotting were obtained from Schleicher and Schuell (Keene, NH). Anti-caveolin monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The monoclonal anti-Src (clone GD11), polyclonal anti-α1 antibody, and Protein G-agarose were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). All secondary antibodies were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase; therefore, the immunoreactive bands were developed using chemiluminescence kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Cell Preparation and Culture—Pig LLC-PK1 cells, human 293 cells, and SYF and SYF+Src cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). When cell cultures reached about 80% confluence, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and used for the experiments. Measurement of ERK Activity—Immunoblotting was performed to identify the activation of ERK using the antibodies described under “Experimental Procedures” (8Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Dilutions of these antibodies were done as recommended by the manufacturer. Following the indicated treatment, the incubation medium was rapidly replaced with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. The washed cells were then lysed in 200 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 1% Nonidet P40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16, 000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were used for Western blot analysis. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (60 μg/lane) and transferred to an Optitran membrane as we previously described (8Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The membranes were then probed with an anti-phospho-ERK monoclonal antibody. The antiphospho-ERK monoclonal antibody was then stripped, and the membrane was reprobed with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the total amount of ERK to account for equal loading as we previously reported (8Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were scanned with a Bio-Rad densitometer to quantitate ERK signals as previously described (8Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Purification of Caveolin-rich Membrane Fractions—Caveolin-rich membrane fractions were obtained according to the method of Song et al. (17Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped in 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0, and collected to a 50-ml Falcon centrifuge tube. The cell lysate was then homogenized using a Polytron tissue grinder (three 6-s bursts) and sonicated with three 40-s bursts. The homogenate was then adjusted to 45% sucrose by addition of 2 ml of 90% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mm Mes, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6.5) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. The ultracentrifuge tubes were then loaded with 4 ml of 35% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose (both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light-scattering band at the interface between the 5 and 35% sucrose gradients was observed. Eleven gradient fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top to the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Among the 11 fractions, fractions 4 and 5 were combined and diluted with 4 ml of MBS, then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm with a Beckman type 65 rotor for 1 h. The pellets were resuspended in 250 μl of MBS and are termed as caveolae fraction. Samples of 10-μl caveolae fraction and 40 μl each of other fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Assay for Caveolin-1 and Src Association—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer as described above. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16, 000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunit antibody or a polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody as previously described (11Haas M. Wang H. Tian J. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18694-18702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were dissolved in sample buffer, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted on to membrane, and probed with the monoclonal anti-Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunit antibody and polyclonal anti-pY14 caveolin-1 antibody. To determine if caveolin-1 and Src bind to the Na+/K+-ATPase, the same blots were stripped and reprobed with monoclonal anti-Src antibody and monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody, respectively. In the immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunit antibody, caveolin-1 and Src signals are normalized against Western blot signal for α1, whereas Western blot signals are normalized against caveolin-1 in the immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-caveolin-1 antibody. Depletion of Caveolin-1 by siRNA—Caveolin-1-specific siRNA was designed based on the strategy developed by Elbashir et al. (18Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar, 19Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). To construct human caveolin-1-specific siRNA expression vector, we first annealed the following two oligonucleotides: sense, TCG AGC CAG AAG GGA CAC ACA GTT TTC AAG AGA AAC TGT GTG TCC CTT CTG GTT TTT; antisense, CTA GAA AAA CCA GAA GGG ACA CAC AGT TTC TCT TGA AAA CTG TGT GTC CCT TCT GGC. The annealed insert was then cloned into pSuppressor™-U6 vector (BioCarta) that was digested with SalI and XbaI. The positive clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfection assay in 293 cells showed that expression of the above human caveolin-1-specific siRNA (C2) caused 50% decrease in caveolin-1 after 48 h post transfection. To generate a stable cell line, 293 cells were co-transfected with either 7 μg of C2 or empty pSuppressor (used as a control), together with 1 μg of pBabe-Puro that expresses puromycin resistant gene using 20 μl of LipofectAMINE™ 2000. After 24 h, the cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin, and puromycin-resistant colonies were cloned and expanded. Assay of Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Isolated Membrane Fractions— This assay was performed according to the protocol described by Liu et al. (20Liu P. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For each phosphorylation reaction, 500 μl of phosphorylation buffer (2× minimal essential medium (pH 7.4)/160 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V)/2 mm NaF/400 μm Na3VO4/leupeptin (20 μg/ml)/soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 μg/ml)/2 mm MgCl2/200 μm ATP) was added to a 1-ml Eppendorf tube. After an aliquot of caveolae membrane preparations were transferred into each tube, ouabain was added to start the reaction. The samples were then incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min. To terminate the reactions, the samples were placed on ice, and 100 μl of 72% trichloroacetic acid was added to each sample immediately to precipitate proteins. Samples were then dissolved in SDS-sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Blots were probed for tyrosine phosphorylation with a monoclonal antibody (4G10) as we previously described (8Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate caveolin-1 from isolated caveolae, caveolae were first treated as described above except that 100 μg of caveolae membrane preparations were used in a total of 2-ml reaction solutions. After ouabain treatment, caveolae were collected by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm with a SW65 rotor for 30 min. The pallets were dissolved in RIPA buffer and used for immunoprecipitation with the polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody as described above. In Vitro Binding Assay—For the GST pull-down assay, the purified pig kidney Na+/K+-ATPase was solubilized in RIPA, and pre-cleaned with glutathione-agarose beads. The specific activities of the purified Na+/K+-ATPase preparations used in this work were between 1200 and 1400 μmol of Pi/mg/h. The GST-fused N terminus of caveolin-1 (residues 1–101) was constructed and purified on glutathione-agarose as described previously (21Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H.

Five micrograms of purified GST-fused N terminus of caveolin-1 and different amounts of RIPA buffer-solubilized Na+/K+-ATPase were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in a total volume of 1 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The beads were washed five times with the binding buffer, and the bound Na+/K+-ATPase was dissolved in the SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis using the Na+/K+-ATPase-specific antibodies (22Jordan C. Puschel B. Koob R. Drenckhahn D. J. Biol.

After the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, they were used for the experiments. Cholesterol repletion was done as previously reported (23Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol.

Briefly, 400 μl of a cholesterol/Mβ-CD stock solution was added to 10 ml of DMEM, and cholesterol-depleted cells were incubated in this medium for 1 h at 37 °C.

Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Each presented immunoblot is representative of the similar results of at least three separate experiments. Ouabain Regulates the Interaction of Na+/K+-ATPase with Caveolin-1—We have shown previously that ouabain activates multiple signaling cascades in LLC-PK1 cells. To begin addressing the role of the caveolar Na+/K+-ATPase in ouabain-induced signal transduction, we first determined how the Na+/K+-ATPase is distributed in these cells. Caveolae were isolated from LLC-PK1 cells by a well-established density gradient fractionation procedure, and the distribution of proteins in each fraction is consistent with our previous findings in 293 cells (16Liu L. Mohammadi K. Aynafshar B. Wang H. Li D. Liu J. Ivanov A.V. Xie Z. Askari A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1550-C1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). When the fractions were assayed by Western blot for caveolar residents, we found that about 80% of caveolin-1 was in light fractions (fractions 4 and 5) together with about 50% of the Na+/K+-ATPase and 30% of Src. To see if LLC-PK1 cells express other caveolin proteins, the same blots were stripped and re-probed for caveolin-2 and -3. As expected (12Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 13Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we could not detect the expression of caveolin-3 in these cells. Surprisingly, in contrast to some other epithelial cells (12Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), we found that LLC-PK1 cells only expressed very low levels of caveolin-2 (data not shown). Accordingly, the following experiments focused on the role of caveolin-1 in ouabain signaling, with a particular emphasis on its direct interaction with the Na+/K+-ATPase. Caveolin-1 interacts with many signaling proteins via the scaffolding domain, and this interaction plays an important role in concentrating the signaling proteins in caveolae (13Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Data base search revealed that the α1 subunit of mammalian Na+/K+-ATPase contains two highly conserved caveolin-binding motifs (Fig. 1A), indicating that these domains may be important for the functions of the Na+/K+-ATPase and are most likely to mediate a direct interaction with caveolin-1. To test this hypothesis, we performed in vitro GST pull-down assay. Na+/K+-ATPase was purified from pig kidney and solubilized in RIPA buffer. Different amounts of the solubilized pump were incubated with either 5 μg of GST or GST-fused N terminus (residues 1–101) of caveolin-1 (GST-N-cav). The bound Na+/K+-ATPase was purified on glutathione-agarose beads and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1B, the Na+/K+-ATPase interacted with GST-N-cav, but not GST. Because the Na+/K+-ATPase resides in caveolae and can interact with caveolin-1 directly, we next determined if ouabain regulates the interaction between the pump and caveolin-1. LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to 1 μm ouabain for different times, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, ouabain caused a time-dependent increase in the amount of coprecipitated α1. The effects were rapid, and the maximal stimulation was observed after 2–5 min of ouabain exposure (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these findings, ouabain also increased co-precipitated caveolin-1 in a time-dependent manner when cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-a1 antibody (Fig. 2C). When the dose-dependent effects of ouabain were determined in Fig. 2 (D and E), we found that 25 nm ouabain was sufficient to stimulate the association of caveolin-1 to the Na+/K+-ATPase in these cells. At this concentration, less than 15% of Na+/K+-ATPase is inhibited by ouabain (11Haas M. Wang H. Tian J. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18694-18702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although our previous work showed that the whole Na+/K+-ATPase (i.e. both α and β subunits) is enriched in caveolae (16Liu L. Mohammadi K. Aynafshar B. Wang H. Li D. Liu J. Ivanov A.V. Xie Z. Askari A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1550-C1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), to ensure that the above ouabain-regulated interaction involves the whole enzyme, we repeated the experiments of Fig. 2A. As shown in Fig. 2F, exposure of LLC-PK1 cells to 1 μm ouabain for 5 min not only increased co-precipitated α1, but also the β1 subunit. These findings clearly demonstrate that the Na+/K+-ATPase interacts with caveolin-1 and that ouabain regulates this interaction in LLC-PK1 cells. Binding of Ouabain to the Caveolar Na+/K+-ATPase Assembles Active Signaling Modules—Because the above data indicate that the caveolar Na+/K+-ATPase can respond to ouabain stimulation, we tested whether binding of ouabain to the caveolar pump is able to assemble active signaling modules. We showed previously that ouabain stimulated Src in LLC-PK1 cells (11Haas M. Wang H. Tian J. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18694-18702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). According to prior studies (29Li S. Seitz R. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3863-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 30Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), if ouabain can activate the caveolar Na+/K+-ATPase-Src complex, it will stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. The first logical experiment was therefore to determine whether caveolin-1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to ouabain. In the experiments illustrated in Fig. 3A, cells were treated with ouabain for different times and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-Src antibody. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates clearly showed that ouabain stimulated caveolin-1 Tyr-14 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. These findings were confirmed when the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-caveolin-1 antibody, then probed for Tyr-14-phosphorylated caveolin-1 (Fig. 3B). To ensure that Src is involved in the ouabain-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1, we pretreated the cells with PP2, an Src inhibitor, and then repeated the above experiments. As depicted in Fig. 3C, PP2 abolished ouabain-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. These findings indicate that ouabain can stimulate the formation of an active Na+/K+-ATPase-Src-caveolin-1 module in the caveolae. To further confirm that the signaling module of Na+/K+-ATPase-Src-caveolin-1 is formed in caveolae, but not other membrane fractions, we isolated caveolae from either control or ouabain-treated LLC-PK1 cells. The isolated caveolae were then solubilized in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated using anti-caveolin-1 antibody as in Fig. 3B. In comparison to caveolae isolated from control cells, there was a significant increase in the formation of the Na+/K+-ATPase-Src-caveolin-1 complex in the caveolae prepared from ouabain-treated cells (Fig. 3D). Because ouabain stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins in various cell lines, including LLC-PK1 cells, the above findings led us to propose that binding of ouabain to the caveolar Na+/K+-ATPase is sufficient to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins other than caveolin-1 within the caveolae structure. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig. 4B, ouabain caused a dose-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in the isolated"

CagA is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases, binds the SH2 domain-containing SHP-2 phosphatase in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner, and deregulates its enzymatic activity. We established AGS human gastric epithelial cells that inducibly express wild-type or a phosphorylation-resistant CagA, in which tyrosine residues constituting the EPIYA motifs were substituted with alanines. Upon induction, wild-type CagA, but not the mutant CagA, elicited strong elongation of cell shape, termed the “hummingbird” phenotype. Time-lapse video microscopic analysis revealed that the CagA-expressing cells exhibited a marked increase in cell motility with successive rounds of elongation-contraction processes. Inhibition of CagA phosphorylation by an Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, or knockdown of SHP-2 expression by small interference RNA (siRNA) abolished the CagA-mediated hummingbird phenotype. The morphogenetic activity of CagA also required Erk MAPK but was independent of Ras or Grb2. In AGS cells, CagA prolonged duration of Erk activation in response to serum stimulation. Conversely, inhibition of SHP-2 expression by siRNA abolished the sustained Erk activation. Thus, SHP-2 acts as a positive regulator of Erk activity in AGS cells. These results indicate that SHP-2 is involved in the Ras-independent modification of Erk signals that is necessary for the morphogenetic activity of CagA.

The injected CagA then associates with the plasma membrane and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (20Selbach M. Moese S. Hauck C.R. Meyer T.F. Backert S. J.

To elucidate the mechanism by which CagA exerts pathogenic effects, we investigated cellular proteins that bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated but not non-phosphorylated CagA, and identified a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar).

The CagA-SHP-2 complex formation involves phosphorylated tyrosine in the EPIYA motif of CagA and the SH2 domains of SHP-2 (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M.

Also, SHP-2 plays an important role in the regulation of cell morphology and motility (33Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T.

Recently, Grb2 and c-Met have been reported to form physical complexes with CagA, although their interactions are independent of CagA phosphorylation (37Mimuro H. Suzuki T. Tanaka J. Asahi M. Haas R.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These observations collectively suggest that the bacterial protein functions as a docking/scaffolding protein that recruits and deregulates multiple signaling molecules in the injected host cells (39Hatakeyama M. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We established human gastric epithelial cells in which wild-type or a phosphorylation-resistant CagA was inducibly expressed under the control of a tetracycline-regulated (tet-on) system. Using the CagA-inducible cells, we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA is an essential prerequisite for induction of the hummingbird phenotype as well as the cell-scattering phenotype. The morphogenetic activity of CagA is dependent on the activity of Erk MAPK but not on that of Ras or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We obtained evidence that SHP-2 is involved in the regulation of Erk MAPK activity by CagA. Antibodies—Hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope-specific monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was used for immunoprecipitation. Anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Y-11), anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10), anti-SHP-2 polyclonal antibody (C-18), anti-ERK1 polyclonal antibody (C-16), antiphospho-ERK polyclonal antibody (E-4), anti-Raf1 polyclonal antibody (C-12), anti-H-Ras polyclonal antibody (C-20), and normal rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-Akt and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-CagA antibody (HPP-5003–9) was purchased from AUSTRAL Biologicals. Expression Vectors—Mammalian expression vectors for HA-tagged wild-type CagA and its phosphorylation-resistant (PR) mutant have been described previously (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). PR CagA-YF was generated from HA-tagged wild-type CagA by substituting tyrosine residues that constitute 5× EPIYA motifs with phenylalanine residues using a Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the DNA fragment encoding the mutant was cloned into a pSP65SRα mammalian expression vector. Myc-tagged SHP-2 and its constitutively active mutant, myr-SHP-2ΔSH2, have been described previously (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). To generate siRNA-insensitive SHP-2, SHP-2RR-Myc, from Myc-tagged SHP-2, a nucleotide stretch corresponding to the SHP-2 siRNA was replaced with the nucleotides 5′-GGAGTATGGT-3′ in the cDNA, and the resulting cDNA was cloned into pSP65SRα. Myc-tagged WT Grb2 was cloned into pSP65SRα. To generate SH3 domain-inactivated Grb2 mutant, Grb2 SH3mut-Myc, Trp-36 (W36) and Trp-193 (W193) were replaced by lysine residues. The mutant cDNA was cloned into the pSP65SRα. H-Ras expression vectors were constructed by inserting cDNA encoding a dominant-negative H-RasAsn17 or a constitutively active H-RasVal12 into pSP65SRα. To construct SHP-2-specific siRNA expression vector, two oligonucleotides, which, respectively, contained SHP-2-specific targeting sequence (5′-GAT CTC CGA ATA TGG CGT CAT GCG TGT TCA AGA GAC ACG CAT GAC GCC ATA TTC-3′) and reverse complementary sequence of the former oligonucleotide (5′-GAA TAT GGC GTC ATG CGT GTC TCT TGA ACA CGC ATG ACG CCA TAT TCG GAG ATC-3′), were synthesized. After an annealing step, the oligonucleotide was inserted into pSUPER vector (40Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar), and the cloned vector was used in the following experiments as pSUPER-SHP-2. Establishment of Stable Transfectants—Human AGS gastric epithelial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640/10% fetal calf serum (FCS). To establish the tet-on system, AGS cells (1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were first transfected with 20 μg of pTet-On (Clontech), which expresses reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator (rtTA) regulator protein, by using the calcium phosphate method. At 12 h after transfection, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640/10% FCS supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (Clontech). Cells resistant to G418 were selected and single-cellcloned by limiting dilution. Clone T71-2 showing the highest rtTA activity was subjected to a second round of transfection with 20 μg of the expression plasmid, in which the gene encoding HA-tagged wild-type CagA or HA-tagged phosphorylation-resistant CagA were driven by the tetracycline-responsive elements (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were selected by 150 μg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma). Drug-resistant colonies were then picked up and were examined for induction of CagA. Positive cells were single-cell cloned by limiting dilution. To induce CagA, cells were incubated with RPMI 1640/10% FCS containing doxycycline (Dox) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. In experiments using kinase inhibitors, cells were incubated with 5 μm PP2 for 2 h or 20 μm U0126 for 5 h before harvest. Time-dependent change of cell morphology was monitored by time-lapse video microscopy (Olympus IX71 Bioimaging system). After 48-h induction with Dox, cells were subjected to live cell time-lapse video microscopic analysis. To isolate stable SHP-2-knockdown cells, AGS cells were co-transfected with pSUPER-SHP-2 and pBabePuro. At 12-h post-transfection, transfected cells were primarily selected in RPMI 1640/10% FCS containing 0.4 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). The cloned cells were then examined for their SHP-2 expression by anti-SHP-2 immunoblotting. One of the clones, G11, in which expression of SHP-2 was strongly repressed, was used for experiment as a stable SHP-2-knockdown cell. Cell Scatter Assay—Cells were seeded at 1 × 103 cells in 60-mm dishes and were incubated in RPMI 1640/10% FCS for 48 h in the absence of Dox. After the additional incubation with or without 5 μg/ml Dox for 60 h, colonies were observed by microscopy. Transient Transfection and Infection—AGS cells and monkey COS-7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% FCS. For transient transfection, 30 μg of plasmids was transfected into AGS cells (1.8 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) by using 30 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. COS-7 cells (1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with 20 μg of plasmids by using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Morphology of the AGS cells was examined at 17 h after transfection. Cells showing the hummingbird phenotype were counted in five different fields in three dishes (the area of one field = 0.25 mm2). In experiments using U0126 or U0124, cells were incubated with the reagent at various concentrations for 1 h before microscopic analysis. In experiments using other kinase inhibitors, cells were incubated with 5 μm PP2 for 2 h, 20 μm SB203580 for 1 h, 20 μm SP600125 for 1 h, or 40 μm LY294002 for 2 h before analysis. For H. pylori infection with AGS cells, standard strain NCTC11637 or its isogenic strain lacking cagA gene was passaged on 5% sheep blood agar (Nippon BD Biosciences) by incubation in an atmosphere consisting of 5% O2, 15% CO2, and 80% N2 for 2–4 days at 37 °C. Bacteria were then cultured in Brucella broth (Difco) supplemented with 5% FCS under the same conditions for 12–24 h at 37 °C with agitation. AGS cells (2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) cultured at 12 h post seeding were infected with H. pylori at a multiplicity of infection of 50 for 5 h. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—AGS cells and COS-7 cells were harvested at 36 h after transfection and lysed in lysis buffer as described previously (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were treated with the appropriate antibody, and immune complexes were trapped on protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads. Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-8% PAGE except experiments to detect Erk1 (12.5% PAGE), Grb2 (13.5% PAGE), and Ras mutants (13.5% PAGE). Proteins transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Millipore) were soaked in solutions of primary antibodies and then visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis of Erk Phosphorylation—AGS or G11 cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 60-mm dishes and were incubated in the medium containing 10% FCS for 24 h. In experiments using W1804 cells, the cells were seeded under the same condition as described above and were incubated in the medium with or without 5 μg/ml Dox. The cells were subsequently serum-starved for 48 h and then released from serum starvation by adding medium with 10% FCS. The cells were lysed with SDS sample buffer at the indicated times. The samples were subjected to Western blotting analysis with anti-ERK1 and anti-phospho-ERK antibodies. Intensities of chemiluminescence on the immunoblotted filter were quantitated using a luminescent image analyzer LAS1000 (Fujifilm). RNA Interference—Synthetic small interference RNA (siRNA) probes of SHP-2 (5′-GAAUAUGGCGUCAUGCGUGTT-3′ and 5′-CACGCAUGACGCCAUAUUCTT-3′) were purchased from Greiner bio-one. Twenty picomoles of SHP-2 siRNA and/or 4 μg of SHP-2 expression vector were transfected into AGS cells (1.2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) by using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. After 36 h of treatment of cells with siRNA, the cells were transfected again with CagA or control empty vector (8 μg) by using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. The morphology of the AGS cells was examined at 17 h after transfection. The clone W1804 cells were transfected with 20 pmol of SHP-2 siRNA by using LipofectAMINE 2000 at 12 h post seeding. At 12 h after transfection, Dox was added to the culture and the cells were incubated for additional 48 h. Establishment of Gastric Epithelial Cells That Inducibly Express CagA—Infection of cagA-positive H. pylori in human AGS gastric epithelial cells induces elongation of cell shape, referred to as the hummingbird phenotype (15Segal E.D. Cha J. Lo J. Falkow S. Tompkins L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14559-14564Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that transient expression of the cagA gene in AGS human gastric epithelial cells also elicits the hummingbird phenotype (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism by which CagA induces morphological change, we generated a series of AGS-derived, stable transfectant clones that express HA-tagged, wild-type CagA, derived from H. pylori strain NCTC11637, or HA-tagged, phosphorylation-resistant CagA (PR CagA), in which the tyrosine residues constituting the five EPIYA motifs were substituted with alanines, under the control of a tetracycline-inducible (tet-on) gene expression system (Fig. 1A). Among these clones, wild-type cagA clone W1804 and PR cagA clone C065 were arbitrarily chosen for further experiments. In this tet-on system, wild-type and PR CagA proteins were detectable by Western blotting as early as 6 h after induction with a tetracycline derivative, doxycycline (Dox). In W1804 cells, the level of wild-type CagA oscillated after induction, showing peaks at 36 and 60 h. We reproducibly obtained the same results in three independent experiments. In the case of C065 cells expressing PR CagA, the protein level peaked at ∼36 h after induction and was maintained at the peak level thereafter (Fig. 1B). Hence, a specific decrease in wild-type CagA level at 48 h after induction may be a phenomenon related to tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA. The induced wild-type CagA underwent tyrosine phosphorylation and formed a physical complex with SHP-2 in AGS cells (Fig. 1, A–C). In contrast, no tyrosine phosphorylation of PR CagA was detectable in the clone C065 (Fig. 1, A and B). As a control experiment, AGS cells were infected with H. pylori strain NCTC11637. At 5 h after infection, cells were harvested and lysates prepared were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CagA. As was the case with transfected CagA, CagA injected by the bacteria formed a physical complex with SHP-2 in AGS cells, excluding the possibility that SHP-2 binds transfected CagA but not injected CagA (Fig. 1D). CagA Provokes Morphological Change—Induction of wild-type CagA but not PR CagA was followed by a change in cell morphology that was indistinguishable from the hummingbird phenotype induced by transient CagA expression in AGS cells (Fig. 1E). Here we designate “hummingbird cells” as those having one or more protrusions, the length of the protrusion being more than 2-fold of cell diameter. Hummingbird cells were observed as early as 24 h after induction of wild-type CagA. At 48 h of wild-type CagA induction, ∼7–8% of the cells exhibited the hummingbird phenotype. Further incubation of cells with Dox, however, did not increase the number of hummingbird cells. The weak phenotype may be primarily due to the level of CagA induced in the AGS stable transfectant, which was significantly lower than that expressed in AGS cells by transient transfection of cagA gene or cagA-positive H. pylori infection. 2H. Higashi, R. Tsutsumi, and M. Hatakeyama, unpublished observation. Establishment of AGS cells that conditionally express CagA enabled us to study time-dependent changes in cell morphology following CagA induction. Using live cell time-lapse microscopy, we found that induction of CagA caused a marked increase in cell migration: a fraction of cells initiated to move from one place to another while showing successive elongation (i.e. the hummingbird phenotype) and contraction of cell sha"

At the opposite end of the hybrid helix, the RNA separates from the template DNA. This separation of nucleic acid strands is brought about by interaction with a set of proteins loops in a strand/loop network. Formation of the network must occur in the transition from abortive initiation to promoter escape."
https://openalex.org/W1970326476,"We have investigated the consequences of permeability transition pore (PTP) opening on the rate of production of reactive oxygen species in isolated rat liver mitochondria. We found that PTP opening fully inhibited H(2)O(2) production when mitochondria were energized both with complex I or II substrates. Because PTP opening led to mitochondrial pyridine nucleotide depletion, H(2)O(2) production was measured again in the presence of various amounts of NADH. PTP opening-induced H(2)O(2) production began when NADH concentration was higher than 50 microm and reached a maximum at over 300 microm. At such concentrations of NADH, the maximal H(2)O(2) production was 4-fold higher than that observed when mitochondria were permeabilized with the channel-forming antibiotic alamethicin, indicating that the PTP opening-induced H(2)O(2) production was not due to antioxidant depletion. Moreover, PTP opening decreased rotenone-sensitive NADH ubiquinone reductase activity, whereas it did not affect the NADH FeCN reductase activity. We conclude that PTP opening induces a specific conformational change of complex I that (i) dramatically increases H(2)O(2) production so long as electrons are provided to complex I, and (ii) inhibits the physiological pathway of electrons inside complex I. These data allowed the identification of a novel consequence of permeability transition that may partly account for the mechanism by which PTP opening induces cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2016809324,"Antimicrobial peptides, such as LL-37, are found both in nonvertebrates and vertebrates, where they represent important components of innate immunity. Bacterial infections at epithelial surfaces are associated with substantial induction of LL-37 expression, which allows efficient lysis of the invading microbes. Peptide-mediated lysis results in the release of bacterial nucleic acids with potential pathobiological activity in the host. Here, we demonstrate that LL-37 targets extracellular DNA plasmid to the nuclear compartment of mammalian cells, where it is expressed. DNA transfer occurred at physiological LL-37 concentrations that killed bacterial cells, whereas virtually no cytotoxic or growth-inhibitory effects were observed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, LL-37 protected DNA from serum nuclease degradation. LL-37·DNA complex uptake was a saturable time- and temperature-dependent process and was sensitive to cholesterol-depleting agents that are known to disrupt lipid rafts and caveolae, as shown by flow cytometry. Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies showed localization of internalized DNA to compartments stained by cholera toxin B, a marker of lipid rafts, but failed to demonstrate any co-localization of internalized DNA with caveolin-positive endocytotic vesicles. Moreover, LL-37-mediated plasmid uptake and reporter gene expression were strictly dependent on cell surface proteoglycans.

Several in vitro and in vivo studies have provided compelling evidence for the importance of antimicrobial peptides in the innate host defense of multicellular organisms against microbial intruders (1Boman H.G.

A common characteristic among antimicrobial peptides (>700 described so far) is the ability to adopt an amphipathic conformation where clusters of hydrophobic and cationic amino acids are spatially organized in discrete sections of the molecule. The relative sensitivity of bacterial cells to peptide cytotoxicity has generally been attributed to the high content of negatively charged phospholipids in the outer membrane leaflet as opposed to that of animal and plant cells, which principally consist of electroneutral lipids (8Ganz T. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).The defensins and the cathelicidins are the two major families of antimicrobial peptides in mammals. Cathelicidins consist of a highly conserved N-terminal cathelin domain and a more diverse antimicrobial C terminus (9Zanetti M. Del Sal G. Storici P. Schneider C. Romeo D. J. Biol.

LL-37, a 37-amino acid peptide with two N-terminal leucines, is the only known human cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptide. The precursor of LL-37, hCAP-18, and its mouse homolog, CRAMP, are primarily expressed in bone marrow cells but are also broadly expressed in nonmyeloid tissues, including epididymis, spermatids, and epithelial cells of a number of organs, emphasizing their role in primary host defense (11Agerberth B.

A wide range of Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive bacteria is sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of LL-37 at substantially lower peptide concentrations (19Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The antibacterial activity is regulated by environmental changes in osmolarity or pH, which relates to the fact that LL-37 adopts an α-helical oligomeric conformation in its active state (20Johansson J.

Accordingly, LL-37 activity was reduced in the respiratory epithelia of mice suffering from cystic fibrosis, a condition associated with increased extracellular osmolarity, and virus-mediated over-expression of LL-37 restored bacterial killing to normal levels in cystic fibrosis xenografts (21Bals R.

Gudmundsson H.G. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), it was shown that in bacterial infections with Shigella, expression of LL-37 and β-defensin-1 is reduced or turned off, which could partly explain the chronic inflammatory response associated with Shigella infections. Interestingly, the study further demonstrated that plasmid DNA, released from lysed bacteria by the action of LL-37, was a major mediator of antimicrobial peptide down-regulation. Treatment of bacterial lysates with DNase blocked down-regulation of LL-37, whereas pure bacterial plasmid mediated the effect.This study investigates the ability of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 to interact with extracellular DNA and to mediate uptake and nuclear transfer of functional plasmids in mammalian cells.

The peptide sequence was confirmed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. pGL3 control vector (luciferase reporter gene plasmid) was provided by Dr. Oldberg (Lund University, Sweden), and the luciferase assay system was purchased from Promega. DNA was labeled with YOYO-1 fluorophore (Molecular Probes) according to the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer. Rabbit anti-caveolin-1 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody labeled with Texas Red fluorophore and cholera toxin subunit B (CTxB)-Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate were from Molecular Probes. Heparan sulfate (HS) preparations were the same as described previously (27Belting M. Petersson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rhodamine green (Molecular Probes)-labeled HS was prepared as described by Cheng et al. (28Cheng F. Petersson P. Arroyo-Yanguas Y. Westergren-Thorsson G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). LipofectAMINE reagent was from Invitrogen. PD-10 and Microspin S-200 HR columns were from Amersham Biosciences AB. All fine chemicals were from Sigma.Cell Culture—Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1), pgsA-745 (PG-deficient CHO mutant), pgsB-618 (PG-deficient CHO mutant), COS-7, and human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). CHO cells were routinely cultured in F12K nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (growth medium) in a humidified 5% CO2 (37 °C) incubator. HFL-1 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium with the same supplements as described above.Nuclease Protection Assay—pGL3 DNA plasmid (20 μg/ml) was incubated in minimal essential medium supplemented with 50% fetal calf serum either in the absence or in the presence of LL-37 (100 μg/ml). After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, the incubation was terminated by the addition of sodium chloride (final concentration, 1 m), followed by repeated phenol/chloroform extraction and sodium acetate precipitation to recover the DNA. The samples were finally analyzed by gel electrophoresis (0.8% agarose, supplemented with ethidium bromide) and visualized using a trans-illuminator system from Techtum Laboratory.Cell Growth Assays—To assess mammalian cell (CHO-K1, pgsA-745, and COS-7) proliferation, the same procedure was used as described previously (29Belting M. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were seeded in 96-well microplates at 3 × 103 cells/well and allowed to adhere for 4 h in growth medium, followed by a starvation period of 24 h in serum-free medium. The medium was aspirated and cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in growth medium with or without LL-37 at the indicated concentrations. Cell growth was determined from the amount of crystal violet adsorbed to the cells as measured in a Multiscan 351 photometer (Labsystems) at 595 nm. For bacterial cytotoxicity assays, Escherichia coli cells (Top 10, provided by Dr. Oldberg, Lund University, Sweden) in log growth phase were incubated in minimal essential medium with or without various concentrations of LL-37 for 4 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were then pelleted and redissolved in 2-YT broth and seeded on agar plates. Following another growth period of ∼14 h, colony-forming units were determined.Flow Cytometry (FCM)—Fluorophore-labeled DNA plasmid or labeled HS were preincubated with LL-37 at different concentrations in F12K for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was then added to prerinsed subconfluent cell layers in 24-well plates, and the incubations were allowed to proceed for various periods of time at 37 °C or, in some cases, at 4 °C. After removal of the incubation medium and rinsing with PBS, the cells were detached with trypsin followed by extensive washing with ice-cold PBS, 1% (w/v) BSA to remove unspecific extracellular fluorophore. Finally, the cells were suspended in PBS, 1% BSA and analyzed for fluorescence in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter instrument (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) operated by Cell-Quest software.Luciferase Gene Expression Assay—Cells were plated on 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well in 0.5 ml of growth medium for 24 h before peptide-DNA incubation. To prepare LL-37·DNA complexes, pGL3-luciferase plasmid DNA (10 μg/ml) and LL-37 (5-100 μg/ml) were mixed by inversion and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA-peptide mixture was then added to subconfluent cell layers. At the end of the 4-h incubation at 37 °Cin5%CO2, the medium was aspirated and replaced with 0.5 ml of growth medium. After an additional period of incubation for ∼36 h, the cells were washed with PBS and solubilized in 200 μl of cell lysis reagent containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm CDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. Luciferase expression was quantified in 25 μl of the cell lysate supernatant using a luciferase assay kit. Light emission was measured by integration over 15 s at 25 °C using BMG Fluostar Optima equipment (Labvision). To investigate the involvement of cholesterol-rich membrane domains in LL-37·DNA complex uptake, cells were pretreated with either nystatin (50 μg/ml), filipin (5 μg/ml), 1 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD), or 1-5 mm MCD-cholesterol for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with DNA or HS and LL-37 in the presence of the respective drug at the indicated concentrations, after which FCM and luciferase experiments were conducted as described above. Under these conditions, no cytotoxicity or changes in cell morphology as a result of drug treatment were observed.Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded at low density in 4-well chamber slides and allowed to adhere overnight and were then incubated with YOYO-1-DNA and LL-37 according to the figure legends. When used, fluorophore-conjugated CTxB (10 μg/ml) was co-incubated with YOYO-1-DNA and LL-37 for 1 h. The cells were then cleared from unspecific extracellular fluorophore by brief rinsing with 1 m NaCl in PBS followed by extensive rinsing with PBS. The cells were then fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After fixation, the slides were washed with PBS and distilled water and then air-dried.For caveolin-1 immunostaining, cells were permeabilized using PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 20 min or 1 mm saponin in PBS for 5 min and then blocked with 1% goat serum (v/v) in PBS, 1% BSA. The cells were then rinsed (three times for 5 min with PBS, 1% BSA), incubated for 3 h with 1:500 rabbit anti-caveolin-1 antibody in PBS, 1% BSA, rinsed again, and finally incubated for 2 h with 1:500 Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody in PBS, 1% BSA. The slides were then washed with PBS and distilled water and air-dried. The fixed cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope and a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal laser scanning microscopy system. The collected data were analyzed using PC-compatible Laser-Sharp software.Statistical Analyses—Each data point in the dose activity and time course experiments is the mean ± S.E. (n = 5-8) from at least two separate experiments. In some cases the error bars were smaller than the drawn symbols.RESULTSLL-37 Peptide Targets Intact DNA Plasmid to the Nuclear Compartment of Mammalian Cells—In the absence of LL-37, DNA plasmid was degraded by serum nucleases, whereas the presence of LL-37 efficiently protected plasmid DNA against serum nuclease activity (Fig. 1). The data suggest significant complex formation between polyanionic DNA and the polybasic peptide LL-37 in 50% serum. LL-37·DNA complex formation may enable efficient internalization of DNA to mammalian cells, as has been shown previously for other polybasic peptides, e.g. polylysine and HIV-Tat (30Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 31Sandgren S. Belting M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38877-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of LL-37 on the uptake of plasmid DNA in COS-7 cells was studied (Fig. 2A, filled squares). Under the conditions used, LL-37 increased DNA plasmid uptake up to 6-fold. The same results were obtained with CHO cells, human embryonic fibroblasts, and bladder carcinoma cells (results not shown). The effect of LL-37 was not specific for DNA, as cellular uptake of HS (a major extracellular polyanion) was also substantially increased by LL-37 (up to ∼20-fold; Fig. 2A, filled triangles). The data indicate that LL-37 binds to DNA via nonspecific electrostatic interactions that result in the protection of DNA from serum nuclease cleavage and transfer of DNA over the plasma membrane. To test the possibility that increased DNA uptake in the presence of LL-37 was simply a result of membrane rupture and cytotoxicity, cell proliferation studies, with several of the cell lines included in this study, were performed. None of the cell lines was affected at relevant LL-37 concentrations (up to 10 μm), whereas E. coli bacteria, as expected, were efficiently killed by the LL-37 preparation used in this study (Table I).Fig. 2LL-37 mediates uptake and efficient expression of exogenous plasmid DNA in mammalian cells. A, fluorophore-labeled DNA (▪) or HS (▴) at 10 μg/ml was premixed with LL-37 (0, 2, 4, and 8 μm) and then incubated with confluent COS-7 cells for 4 h at 37 °C. After removal of the incubation medium, the cells were detached with trypsin followed by extensive washing with ice-cold PBS, 1% BSA to remove unspecific extracellular fluorophore. The cells were then suspended in PBS, 1% BSA, and intracellular DNA and HS were determined by FCM. Results are presented as means ± S.E. (error bars, n = 5). a.u., arbitrary units. B, pGL3-luciferase plasmid (10 μg/ml) and the indicated concentrations of LL-37 were premixed for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA-peptide mixture was then added to subconfluent cell layers for 4 h at 37 °C. After an additional period of incubation for ∼36 h in growth medium, luciferase activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are presented as means ± S.E. (error bars, n = 8).

As shown in Fig. 2B, LL-37 peptide substantially increased the expression of luciferase reporter plasmid in CHO cells (up to ∼1600-fold). The data indicate that LL-37 mediates significant nuclear transfer of intact DNA plasmid in cultured mammalian cells with no concomitant cytotoxic effects. This notion was supported by confocal fluorescence microscopy studies that demonstrated rapid nuclear accumulation of internalized DNA in the presence of LL-37 (Fig. 3B). At 4 h of incubation, fluorescence was restricted to well defined vesicular structures at the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B, left panel). At 24 h, internalized DNA displayed a more diffuse staining pattern in the cytosol, consistent with release from endocytotic vesicles, and could also be observed to be largely redistributed to the nuclear compartment (Fig. 3B, right panel). In the absence of peptide, a much weaker DNA signal was observed in relatively few and small vesicular structures (results not shown). LL-37-mediated DNA uptake was time-dependent (Fig. 3A), saturable, and temperature-dependent (no DNA uptake at 4 °C, results not shown), which is consistent with an endocytotic uptake mechanism.Fig. 3LL-37 targets exogenous plasmid DNA to the nuclear compartment. A, CHO-K1 cells grown to confluence were incubated with YOYO-1-DNA (10 μg/ml) and LL-37 (8 μm) for 0, 2, 4, and 8 h. The cells were then analyzed for intracellular DNA by FCM as described in Fig. 2A. Results are presented as means ± S.E. (error bars, n = 6). a.u., arbitrary units. B, CHO-K1 cells were sparsely seeded on chamber slides and allowed to adhere for a period of 24 h followed by incubation with YOYO-1-DNA (10 μg/ml, green) and LL-37 (8 μm) for 4 h (left panel) and 24 h (right panel). The cells were then processed for confocal fluorescence microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars indicate 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LL-37-mediated Gene Transfer Occurs via Membrane Rafts and Cell Surface PGs—We next sought to determine the molecular mechanism of LL-37·DNA complex uptake. For this purpose, cells were treated with either MCD or nystatin, both of which represent well established cholesterol-depleting agents employed for studying the involvement of rafts/caveolae in cellular transport (32Kilsdonk E.P. Yancey P. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 33Ono A.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains may exist either as small phase-separated “rafts” or, when associated with caveolin, may form flask-shaped invaginations called caveolae, which are involved in special forms of nonclathrin-dependent endocytosis (26Nichols B.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, cholesterol depletion resulted in an ∼65% reduction of LL-37-mediated internalization of both DNA and HS. Next, the effect of cholesterol depletion on the expression of internalized reporter gene plasmid was studied (Fig. 4B). Both MCD and nystatin dramatically reduced reporter gene activity after incubations in the presence of LL-37 (∼90 and 99% inhibition with MCD and nystatin, respectively). Notably, both treatments enhanced reporter gene expression following incubation of naked DNA plasmid (an ∼4.5- and 11-fold increase with MCD and nystatin, respectively). Overall, the data indicate that disruption of raft/caveolar structures by cholesterol depletion inhibits LL-37·DNA complex uptake and, accordingly, expression of internalized DNA plasmid. Similar results were obtained with filipin (results not shown), another known inhibitor of raft/caveolar endocytosis. The fact that drug treatment enhanced the expression of naked DNA plasmid makes it highly unlikely that drug effects were simply a result of cellular toxicity. We next used the method described by Roepstorff et al. (35Roepstorff K. Thomsen P. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18954-18960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) to investigate the possible enhancing effect of cholesterol loading on LL-37-mediated DNA uptake. With the concentrations of MCD-cholesterol used in this study (1-5 mm), no further enhancement was observed (results not shown).Fig. 4LL-37-mediated gene transfer involves membrane rafts. A, subconfluent CHO-K1 cells were either untreated (Control) or pretreated with MCD (1 mm) or nystatin (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by incubation with LL-37 (8 μm) and YOYO-1-DNA (10 μg/ml) or rhodamine green-HS (10 μg/ml), respectively, for 4 h. Cholesterol-depleting agents were present during the whole course of the experiments. The cells were then analyzed for intracellular DNA or HS by FCM. B, subconfluent CHO-K1 cells were pretreated with nystatin (50 μg/ml) or MCD (1 mm) for 30 min, as indicated by the table below panel B, followed by another incubation period of 4 h with pGL3-luciferase plasmid (8 μg/ml) and LL-37 (5 μm), as indicated, in the continued presence of the respective cholesterol-depleting drugs. The media were then replaced with growth medium, and the cells were incubated in the absence of cholesterol-depleting drugs for 36 h and then finally analyzed for luciferase activity. Results are presented as means ± S.E. (error bars, n = 8). RLU, relative light units. C, sparsely seeded CHO-K1 cells were incubated with YOYO-1-DNA (10 μg/ml, green) and LL-37 (8 μm) for 4 h. The cells were stained for caveolin-1 (red) and processed for confocal fluorescence microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” D, sparsely seeded CHO-K1 cells were incubated with YOYO-1-DNA (10 μg/ml, green) and LL-37 (8 μm) for 1 h in the presence of CTxB (10 μg/ml, red) and then processed for confocal fluorescence microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars indicate 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Confocal fluorescence studies were then performed to examine possible co-localization of internalized DNA with caveolin, a well established marker of caveolae (26Nichols B.J.

Although these diseases often are sporadic, the tau gene can harbor mutations that lead to diverse clinical phenotypes collectively grouped under the designation frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (2Hutton M.

Considerable evidence supports the view that hyperphosphorylated tau represents the pathologic entity in the tauopathies, including the observation that increased hyperphosphorylated tau can cause neuronal cell death (3Geschwind D.H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 457-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation releases tau from microtubules and because tau in the PHF is highly phosphorylated, kinases have been viewed suspiciously as having a possible role in pathogenesis. In vivo evidence for an interaction with tau exists for cyclin-dependent kinase-5 and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Previous work has shown that tau hyperphosphorylation by GSK-3β in the fly (4Jackson G.R. Wiedau-Pazos M. Sang T.K. Wagle N. Brown C.A. Massachi S. Geschwind D.H.

Moreover, endogenous tau was hyperphosphorylated, aggregated tau accumulated, and neurofibrillary pathology developed progressively in these animals. The importance of dephosphorylation in neurofibrillary disease is highlighted by the ability of the phosphorylation-dependent prolyl isomerase, Pin1, to provide relative protection from age-dependent neurodegeneration (7Liou Y.C.

Pin1 recognizes specific phosphorylated serine or threonine residues in tau that are followed by a proline and catalyzes a critical conformational change that allows dephosphorylation at these residues. PP2A and PP1A are major phosphatases for phosphorylated tau (8Tian Q. Wang J. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).

Protoc. 2001; 6: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that the PP2A inhibition by okadaic acid resulted in increased phosphorylated tau in the axons in metabolically active rat brain slices. Therefore, the cellular mechanisms that decrease the amount of hyperphosphorylated tau or inhibit the cell death signals conveyed by hyperphosphorylated tau may slow AD progression. Here we show that Hsp27, one of the small heat shock proteins, directly associated with hyperphosphorylated recombinant tau and PHF tau from the AD brain and can rescue cell death caused by pathological hyperphosphorylated tau.

PHF Tau Purification—PHF tau was purified by the method of Greenberg and Davies (16Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5827-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). PHF preparations were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Proteins were resuspended in 1% SDS, 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline, and the buffer was exchanged to 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline for further experiments. Hsp27 Purification—Temporal cortex specimens (100 g) from a normal human brain were homogenized using lysis buffer (50 mm MES, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EGTA, pH 6.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 20 mm NaF in the presence of EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and sedimented at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were passed over a phosphorylated His-tau (200 μg) column followed by a wash in phosphate-buffered saline. The supernatants then were fractionated and eluted with 1 m NaCl. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). CBB-stained gels were sliced and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Protein Delivery—PHF tau, Hsp27, pHsp27, Hsp27 antibody, pHsp27 antibody, and control IgG were delivered into HCN2A cells using the BioPORTER protein delivery reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. We used 1 mg of PHF tau, 2 mg of Hsp27, 2 mg of pHsp27, and 20 mg of Hsp27 or pHsp27 antibody per 6-well plate. In Vitro Phosphorylation, Dephosphorylation, and Proteasomal Degradation—Active recombinant MAPKAP kinase 2, protein kinase A, or GSK-3β was incubated in a reaction mixture containing 2 mm ATP, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2 either with Hsp27, histone H3, or tau. Active recombinant PP2A was incubated in a reaction mixture containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with either PHF tau or histone H3 for 10 min at 22 °C. 1 mg of PHF tau from AD brain or 1 mg of recombinant tau in 100 ml containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01% Tween 20, and 10 mg of human erythrocyte was incubated with 26 S proteasome for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells—HCN2A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 environment. Immunopurification and Immunoblotting—Temporal cortex specimens (2 g) from human brain and HCN2A cells were homogenized using lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and sedimented at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with protein A (Pierce) bound to polyclonal tau antibodies or polyclonal Hsp27 antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. 4× SDS in a sample buffer was added to the lysates and immunoprecipitated. PAGE and immunoblots were performed as described (17Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Pulldown Assay—His-tau or phosphorylated His-tau-coupled nickel beads or PHF tau or dephosphorylated PHF tau cross-linked to polyclonal tau antibody bound to protein A beads were added to either human brain homogenates, Hsp27, or pHsp27 and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with shaking. We added 0.2 m glycine buffer, pH 2.8, to release precipitated proteins from the beads. The eluted fraction was transferred to a new tube after centrifugation and 0.1 n Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, was added. Other Methods—Dead and live cells were distinguished by the LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Stained cells were analyzed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope system. Data are shown as dead cell counts from six randomly selected microscopic fields in each of three replicate cultures (n = 18), and statistical significance was assessed using a one-way analysis of variance with Student-Neuman-Kuells post hoc tests between each group (*, p < 0.05). For detection of caspase-3 activity, cells were scraped off the dish, collected by centrifugation, distributed in aliquots of 106 cells, and assayed using a colorimetric kit (Clontech, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. We sought to identify the molecular complexes associated with tau when it is phosphorylated at sites (Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-396, Ser-404) that are phosphorylated in AD. Human brain homogenates were passed over an affinity column with nickel beads coupled to recombinant four-repeat His-tau phosphorylated by GSK-3β, and associated proteins were eluted with 1 m NaCl. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and several bands were stained with CBB. A 27-kDa CBB band was identified by mass spectrometry to contain the sequence VSLDVNHFAPDELTVK, which exactly matched the sequence of Hsp27 (Fig. 1A). This 27-kDa molecule was immunoreactive for anti-Hsp27 antibody. To determine the specificity of the interaction between phosphorylated tau and Hsp27 or pHsp27, we incubated nickel beads coupled to recombinant His-tau that was either GSK-3β-phosphorylated or a control that was non-phosphorylated with human brain homogenates, purified recombinant Hsp27, or pHsp27 solution, which was phosphorylated by constitutively active MAPKAP kinase 2. The precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with Hsp27 and pHsp27 antibodies (Fig. 1B, left). Considerably larger amounts of Hsp27 and pHsp27 were precipitated by phosphorylated tau compared with dephosphorylated tau. No Hsp27 was present in precipitants with nickel beads alone. This result indicates that Hsp27 binds directly to phosphorylated tau. Next we examined whether Hsp27 can bind to AD-type pathological hyperphosphorylated tau known as PHF tau. PHF tau was purified from AD brain, and some of it was dephosphorylated by PP2A for use as a negative control. PHF tau or dephosphorylated PHF tau was coupled to anti-tau antibodies conjugated to protein A beads. Human brain homogenates and Hsp27 or pHsp27 solution was added to the beads, and the precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with Hsp27 and pHsp27 antibodies. The amount of Hsp27 and pHsp27 in the precipitates of PHF tau was more than that of dephosphorylated PHF tau, indicating that phosphorylation of PHF tau is a recognition signal for both Hsp27 and pHsp27 (Fig. 1B, right). To examine the interaction between Hsp27 and phosphorylated tau in human brain tissue, we carried out co-immunoprecipitations on homogenates of frozen temporal cortex from three AD brains and three normal brains. We used polyclonal tau or Hsp27 antibodies for immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with AT8 (15Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Schroter C. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Steiner B. Berling B. Meyer H.

Multiple tau bands at 30-60 kDa were recognized by 5E2 in all cases, whereas pathological hyperphosphorylated tau bands were recognized by AT8 (Fig. 1C) and PHF1 (data not shown) only in AD cases. Hsp27 co-precipitated with anti-tau antibody from homogenates of AD brain but not from normal brain. In all cases, Hsp27 was specifically precipitated with anti-Hsp27 antibody, whereas pre-absorbed Hsp27 antibody failed to do so (data not shown). Pathological hyperphosphorylated tau co-precipitated with Hsp27 from the homogenates of AD brain but not normal brain. These co-immunoprecipitations and reverse co-immunoprecipitations strongly suggest that Hsp27 preferentially binds to pathological hyperphosphorylated tau in human brain tissue. To determine the role of Hsp27 in a complex with pathological hyperphosphorylated tau, the human cortical neuronal cell line HCN2A was used to create conditions that reproduced the formation of this complex. We delivered soluble PHF tau from AD brain, Hsp27, pHsp27, anti-Hsp27 antibody (goat IgG), anti-pHsp27 antibody (mouse IgG), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-IgG or TRITC-IgG as a positive control for delivery into HCN2A cells with the BioPORTER reagent (18Rane M.J.

We conjugated TRITC to various proteins and used them to confirm successful delivery by confocal microscopy and then used either TRITC-conjugated or non-TRITC-conjugated proteins for further studies. After 24 h, cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with Hsp27 or tau antibodies and immunoblotted (Fig. 2A). In the absence of calyculin A and okadaic acid, only a small amount of AT8-positive pathological hyperphosphorylated tau was present, and therefore HCN2A cells were incubated with 5 mm calyculin A and 3 mm okadaic acid, PP1 and PP2A inhibitors, respectively, to inhibit dephosphorylation of pathologically phosphorylated tau after delivery to the intracellular compartment. As shown previously in rat brain, PHF tau was rapidly dephosphorylated (19Hall G.F. J. Alzheimers Dis. 1999; 1: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As expected, the amount of tau, Hsp27, or pHsp27 increased in those cell lysates to which the protein was delivered (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the dephosphorylation of the PHF tau, TRITC-PHF tau distributed in a typical microtubule pattern, whereas calyculin A and okadaic acid treatment was distributed more diffusely (Fig. 2, B and C). Interestingly, delivery of Hsp27 and pHsp27 reduced the amount of pathological hyperphosphorylated tau and increased dephosphorylated tau (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, Hsp27 and pHsp27 antibody increased the amount of hyperphosphorylated tau. This suggests that Hsp27 and pHsp27 facilitated the degradation and/or dephosphorylation of pathological hyperphosphorylated tau. To address these hypotheses, we delivered various combinations of pathological phosphorylated tau, Hsp27, and Hsp27 antibody into HCN2A cells and treated the cells with calyculin A, okadaic acid, and 5 μm of the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, or Me2SO control. Pathological hyperphosphorylated tau was increased in the lactacystin-treated cells compared with Me2SO-treated cells (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that pathological phosphorylated tau may be degraded by the proteasome in HCN2A cells. To examine whether Hsp27 facilitates the degradation of PHF tau, we performed in vitro assays using a 26 S proteasome fraction. We incubated PHF tau or dephosphorylated tau with the 26 S proteasome fraction in the presence or absence of Hsp27 or lactacystin. In the presence of a proteasomal fraction, PHF tau was further reduced by Hsp27, indicating that Hsp27 facilitates the degradation of pathological hyperphosphorylated tau. On the other hand, Hsp27 facilitates the degradation of only a small amount of dephosphorylated tau (Fig. 2E). As expected, lactacystin inhibited the degradation of both PHF tau and dephosphorylated tau. Hsp27 also facilitated the dephosphorylation of PHF tau in addition to its degradation. To demonstrate this result, we incubated PHF tau or protein kinase A-phosphorylated histone H3 with PP2A in the presence or absence of Hsp27. Hsp27 increased the dephosphorylation of PHF tau but had no effect on the phosphorylation state of histone H3 (Fig. 2F). Therefore, Hsp27 facilitated the dephosphorylation specifically of PHF tau without causing a general increase in PP2A activity. Hsp27 appeared to facilitate the degradation and dephosphorylation of PHF tau by altering the conformation of tau. To show conformational effects, PHF tau was incubated with Hsp27 and subsequently immunoprecipitated with Alz50, which recognizes a conformational epitope specific for PHF tau (20Jicha G.A. Lane E. Vincent I. Otvos Jr., L. Hoffmann R. Davies P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 21Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Hsp27 treatment decreased the amount of Alz50-precipitated PHF tau (Fig. 2G), suggesting that PHF tau undergoes a change in its conformation when associated with Hsp27. Finally, we sought to determine the effects of Hsp27 on PHF tau-induced cell death. Various combinations of PHF tau, Hsp27, or anti-Hsp27 antibody were delivered to HCN2A cells, some of which also were treated with lactacystin or calyculin A and okadaic acid. The cell lysates were prepared, and the amount of pathological hyperphosphorylated tau and Hsp27 was analyzed with AT8 and anti-Hsp27 antibody (Fig. 3A). Dead cells were counted using a LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Fig. 3B). The amount of pathological hyperphosphorylated tau paralleled the cell death as indicated by calyculin A-, okadaic acid-, and lactacystin-induced increases in the amount of hyperphosphorylated tau along with a corresponding increase in cell death (p < 0.05) when [1 - 10] was compared with [2 - 11] or [3 - 12] (Fig. 3B). This observation suggested that pathological hyperphosphorylated tau enhances cell death. Interestingly, Hsp27 decreased cell death and the amount of hyperphosphorylated tau (p < 0.05) when [2 - 11] was compared with [5 - 14], whereas anti-Hsp27 antibody increased both (p < 0.05) when [2 - 11] was compared with [8 - 17]. Taken together, pathological hyperphosphorylated tau caused cell death, and Hsp27 attenuated the cell toxicity of pathological hyperphosphorylated tau. Several studies have shown that hyperphosphorylated tau can cause apoptosis, and apoptotic cell death has been observed in postmortem AD brain and AD animal models (22Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 2003; 208: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Fath T. Eidenmuller J. Brandt R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9733-9741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether pathological hyperphosphorylated tau causes apoptosis, activation of an effector caspase (caspase-3) was analyzed in a colorimetric assay. The delivery of pathological phosphorylated tau significantly increased caspase-3 activity compared with TRITC-IgG-delivered cells (Fig. 3B). Calyculin A and okadaic acid or lactacystin treatment also increased caspase-3 activity; however, the presence of PHF tau produced a further increase (p < 0.05) when [1 - 10] was compared with [2 - 11] or [3 - 12] (Fig. 3B). Delivery of Hsp27 decreased the caspase-3 activity, which was up-regulated by pathological hyperphosphorylated tau (compare [2 - 11] to [5 - 14]). Delivery of anti-Hsp27 antibody increased the activity (compare [2 - 11] to [8 - 17]). Thus, one of the mechanisms of PHF tau-induced cell death is apoptosis, and Hsp27 prevents it. Using a cellular model of tauopathy and AD postmortem brain tissue, we found that Hsp27 directly bound to pathological hyperphosphorylated tau but not dephosphorylated tau. Hsp27 also protected against cell death induced by pathological hyperphosphorylated tau. Among the likely mechanisms to explain this effect is the ability of Hsp27 to facilitate the degradation and/or dephosphorylation of pathological hyperphosphorylated tau by altering its conformation. We also observed that pathological hyperphosphorylated tau induced apoptosis, and Hsp27 prevented it. The mechanism by which Hsp27 prevents apoptosis may be caused not only by the interaction between Hsp27 and pathological hyperphosphorylated tau but also by Hsp27-mediated inhibition of pro-caspase-9 and caspase-3 (25Concannon C.G. Gorman A.M. Samali A. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Hsp27 facilitated the degradation of hyperphosphorylated tau without ubiquitination. Notably, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin did not induce the accumulation of ubiquitinated tau in the presence of Hsp27. Ubiquitin-independent degradation of hyperphosphorylated tau may be another of the many parallels with α-synuclein (26Tofaris G.K. Layfield R. Spillantini M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Both proteins are natively unfolded and therefore could bypass the need for ubiquitination and unfolding to enter the 20 S proteasome. Denatured, non-ubiquitinated proteins can be degraded by the proteasome (27Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Other proteins such as p21WAF1/CIP1 (28Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and ornithine decarboxylase (29Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) can be degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. Phosphorylated tau may have at least two mechanisms leading to its degradation: a ubiquitin-independent pathway that can be facilitated by Hsp27 and a ubiquitin-dependent pathway mediated by the carboxyl terminus of the Hsc70 interacting protein-Hsc70 complex (30Shimura H. Schwartz D. Gygi S.P. Kosik K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4869-4876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The known cytoprotective effects of Hsp27 include its role as a molecular chaperone, the inhibition of caspase activation, the prevention of stress-induced disruption of the cytoskeleton, and the modulation of the intracellular redox potential (25Concannon C.G. Gorman A.M. Samali A. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The induction and expression of Hsp27 have been studied widely in the mammalian central nervous system (31Krueger-Naug A.M. Plumier J.C. Hopkins D.A. Currie R.W. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2002; 28: 235-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Hsp27 is highly inducible in cortical astrocytes after seizure activity (32Plumier J.C. Armstrong J.N. Landry J. Babity J.M. Robertson H.A. Currie R.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 75: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and ischemic injury (33Plumier J.C. Armstrong J.N. Wood N.I. Babity J.M. Hamilton T.C. Hunter A.J. Robertson H.A. Currie R.W. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hsp27 also is present normally in many neurons of the rat and mouse brainstem and spinal cord (34Armstrong C.L. Krueger-Naug A.M. Currie R.W. Hawkes R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 434: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hsp27 is induced and expressed at very high levels for extended periods of time in vagal trans-section (35Hopkins D.A. Plumier J.C. Currie R.W. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 153: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Hsp27 plays a critical role in neuronal metabolism and neuronal survival. Hsp27 also prevents neuronal cell death in simulated ischemia (36Wagstaff M.J. Collaco-Moraes Y.

In our study, Hsp27 facilitated the degradation of pathological hyperphosphorylated tau, which is otherwise not efficiently degraded by the proteasome in the absence of Hsp27. Therefore, Hsp27 activation may serve as the basis for a new therapeutic approach to AD and other tauopathies. We thank Daniel Schwartz and Steven P. Gygi for mass spectrometric analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2047870994,"The replicative life span of human fibroblasts is heterogeneous, with a fraction of cells senescing at every population doubling. To find out whether this heterogeneity is due to premature senescence, i.e. driven by a nontelomeric mechanism, fibroblasts with a senescent phenotype were isolated from growing cultures and clones by flow cytometry. These senescent cells had shorter telomeres than their cycling counterparts at all population doubling levels and both in mass cultures and in individual subclones, indicating heterogeneity in the rate of telomere shortening. Ectopic expression of telomerase stabilized telomere length in the majority of cells and rescued them from early senescence, suggesting a causal role of telomere shortening. Under standard cell culture conditions, there was a minor fraction of cells that showed a senescent phenotype and short telomeres despite active telomerase. This fraction increased under chronic mild oxidative stress, which is known to accelerate telomere shortening. It is possible that even high telomerase activity cannot fully compensate for telomere shortening in all cells. The data show that heterogeneity of the human fibroblast replicative life span can be caused by significant stochastic cell-to-cell variation in telomere shortening."
https://openalex.org/W2083523447,"Forkhead transcription factors play key roles in the regulation of immune responses. Here, we identify a role for one member of this family, Foxj1, in the regulation of T cell activation and autoreactivity. Foxj1 deficiency resulted in multiorgan systemic inflammation, exaggerated Th1 cytokine production, and T cell proliferation in autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions. Foxj1 suppressed NF-kappaB transcription activity in vitro, and Foxj1-deficient T cells possessed increased NF-kappaB activity in vivo, correlating with the ability of Foxj1 to regulate IkappaB proteins, particularly IkappaBbeta. Thus, Foxj1 likely modulates inflammatory reactions and prevents autoimmunity by antagonizing proinflammatory transcriptional activities. These results suggest a potentially general role for forkhead genes in the enforcement of lymphocyte quiescence."
https://openalex.org/W2054703612,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the major inhibitor of plasminogen activation and likely plays important roles in coronary thrombosis and arteriosclerosis. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is one of many recognized physiological regulators of PAI-1 expression and may contribute to elevated plasma PAI-1 levels in sepsis and obesity. Although TNFα is a potent inducer of PAI-1 expression in vitro and in vivo, the precise location of the TNFα response site in the PAI-1 promoter has yet to be determined. Transient transfection studies using luciferase reporter constructs containing PAI-1 promoter sequence up to 6.4 kb failed to detect a response to TNFα. Moreover, TNFα failed to induce expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein under the control of a 2.9-kb human PAI-1 promoter in transgenic mice, although endogenous murine PAI-1 was strongly induced. These data suggested that the TNFα response element in the PAI-1 gene is remote from the proximal promoter region. In this study, seven candidate regulatory regions were identified using cross-species sequence homology analysis as well as DNase I-hypersensitive site analysis. We identified a 5′ distal TNFα-responsive enhancer of the PAI-1 gene located 15 kb upstream of the transcription start site containing a conserved NFκB-binding site that mediates the response to TNFα.

Subsequently, it has been shown that PAI-1 is involved in many other physiological functions, including ovulation, embryogenesis, angiogenesis, metastasis, and arteriosclerosis through its interactions with PAs, the urokinase-type PA receptor, and vitronectin (3Eriksson P.

Under normal conditions, PAI-1 is present in plasma at low concentrations. High levels of PAI-1 are observed in a variety of clinical settings, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (9Alessi M.C. Bastelica D. Morange P. Berthet B. Leduc I. Verdier M. Geel O. Juhan-Vague I. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1374-1380Google Scholar), obesity (3Eriksson P. Nilsson L. Karpe F. Hamsten A. Arterioscler. Thromb.

In addition, increased PAI-1 levels are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (15Festa A. D'Agostino Jr., R. Tracy R.P. Haffner S.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1131-1137Google Scholar), myocardial infarction (16Nordt T.K. Peter K. Ruef J. Kubler W. Bode C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 14-18Google Scholar), and stroke (17Lane D.A. Grant P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1517-1532Google Scholar). In severe sepsis, increased plasma PAI-1 levels are associated with poor prognosis (18Hermans P.W. Hibberd M.L. Booy R. Daramola O. Hazelzet J.A. de Groot R. Levin M. Lancet. 1999; 354: 556-560Google Scholar) and appear to predict the development of septic shock in meningococcemia (19Westendorp R.G. Hottenga J.J. Slagboom P.E. Lancet. 1999; 354: 561-563Google Scholar). Active PAI-1 is conformationally unstable and has a short half-life in circulation (20Lindahl T.L. Sigurdardottir O. Wiman B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1989; 62: 748-751Google Scholar). Furthermore, except in platelets, which contain large quantity of predominately latent PAI-1, there is no storage pool of PAI-1 in cells (21Booth N.A. Simpson A.J. Croll A. Bennett B. MacGregor I.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 70: 327-333Google Scholar). As a result, transcriptional control of PAI-1 is a pivotal mechanism in determining tissue and plasma PAI-1 content. Accordingly, the molecular regulation of PAI-1 expression has been extensively studied. Regulatory elements that have been localized in the human PAI-1 promoter include two Sp1 elements (–73 and –42 bp) that mediate glucose responsiveness (22Chen Y.Q. Su M. Walia R.R. Hao Q. Covington J.W. Vaughan D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8225-8231Google Scholar), a hypoxia-responsive element (–194 bp) (23Fink T. Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Ebbesen P. Zachar V. Blood. 2002; 99: 2077-2083Google Scholar), a very low density lipoprotein-responsive site (–672/–657 bp) (3Eriksson P. Nilsson L. Karpe F. Hamsten A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 20-26Google Scholar), and SMAD 3 and 4 protein-binding sites that mediate TGF-β responsiveness (–730, –580, and –280 bp) (24Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Google Scholar). TNFα is a strong agonist for PAI-1 expression and has been found to play an important role in PAI-1 regulation in a variety of diseases. In a mouse endoxemia model, TNFα has been found to contribute to the lipopolysaccharide-induced PAI-1 expression (25Sawdey M.S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1346-1353Google Scholar, 26Yamashita M. Thromb. Res. 1997; 87: 165-170Google Scholar). In the obesity-linked elevation of PAI-1, evidence also points to TNFα as an important regulator of PAI-1 expression in adipose tissue (27Alessi M.C. Morange P. Juhan-Vague I. Horm. Metab. Res. 2000; 32: 504-508Google Scholar, 28Loskutoff D.J. Fujisawa K. Samad F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902: 272-281Google Scholar). Although the potent effects of TNFα on PAI-1 expression are well appreciated, the cis-elements that mediate the TNFα response in PAI-1 gene remain elusive (29Chen Y.Q. Sloan-Lancaster J. Berg D.T. Richardson M.A. Grinnell B. Tseng-Crank J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 1563-1572Google Scholar, 30Gruber F. Hufnagl P. Hofer-Warbinek R. Schmid J.A. Breuss J.M. Huber-Beckmann R. Lucerna M. Papac N. Harant H. Lindley I. de Martin R. Binder B.R. Blood. 2003; 101: 3042-3048Google Scholar). This may be explained by the fact that the reporter constructs historically used to identify transcription-responsive element in the PAI-1 promoter typically focus on the proximal PAI-1 promoter within 3.0 kb of the transcription start site. In contrast, distal TNFα-responsive elements have been found in the regulatory regions of several TNFα regulated genes, including mouse monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (31Wagner K. Dendorfer U. Chilla S. Schlondorff D. Luckow B. Genomics. 2001; 78: 113-123Google Scholar), and the serine proteinase inhibitor α1-antichymotrypsin (32Kordula T. Bugno M. Rydel R.E. Travis J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7510-7516Google Scholar), suggesting that the TNFα-responsive element in PAI-1 might also be in a distal regulatory region. The recent completion of sequencing efforts to characterize the human genome and the corresponding genomic sequencing of several other species have catalyzed the application of new methods for identifying regulatory regions located in gene sequences remote from coding regions. In this study, using a multifaceted strategy that included systematic genomic sequence comparison, we identified a remote enhancer in the upstream region of the human PAI-1 gene that contains a fully functional NFκB site and that mediates TNFα-induced PAI-1 expression in endothelial cells. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were prepared in primary culture and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and fetal calf serum (10%). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were propagated from pooled primary cultures of human umbilical veins as described previously (19Westendorp R.G. Hottenga J.J. Slagboom P.E. Lancet. 1999; 354: 561-563Google Scholar, 33Venkov C.D. Rankin A.B. Vaughan D.E. Circulation. 1996; 94: 727-733Google Scholar). HUVECs were grown on gelatin-coated plates in M199 medium containing 25 mmol/liter HEPES buffer and 2.0 mmol/liter glutamine supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml endothelial mitogen, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells subcultured fewer than three times were used in these experiments. The cells were grown at 37 °Cin a humidified incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Animal Treatment and Tissue Preparation—The generation of transgenic mouse strains that harbor human PAI-1 promoter reporter construct in C57BL/6 background have been described previously (34Eren M. Painter C.A. Gleaves L.A. Schoenhard J.A. Atkinson J.B. Vaughan D.E. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 2389-2396Google Scholar). Two groups (four animals in each group) of age- and sex-matched hemizygous transgenic mice were intraperitoneally injected with TNFα (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (4 μg/mouse). The mice were sacrificed 4 h later, at which time the organs were harvested, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in –80 °C freezer for total RNA extraction. RNA Purification and Real Time RT-QPCR—Extraction and RT-QPCR of total tissue RNA was performed as described previously (34Eren M. Painter C.A. Gleaves L.A. Schoenhard J.A. Atkinson J.B. Vaughan D.E. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 2389-2396Google Scholar). Total RNA of cultured cells was extracted and purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Briefly, 0.5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamers with Universal reverse transcription reagents (ABI, Foster City, CA) for 10 min at room temperature, then 30 min at 42 °C, followed by 5 min at 99 °C, and lastly 5 min at 55 °C. The cDNAs of human PAI-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were amplified using SYBR Green PCR Master mix (ABI) on an i-Cycler instrument (Bio-Rad). The sensitivity of PCR assays was tested with amplification of target cDNAs in serially diluted total RNA samples. We optimized the primer concentration and annealing temperature for highly specific and reproducible detection of hPAI-1 and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA by RT-QPCR using serially diluted total RNA samples. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR assays was ensured when the amplicon signal for each target cDNA strongly correlated with serial dilutions of each RNA sample and yielded only single amplicon with the expected Tm peak in the melting curve. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. The data analysis and calculations were done following the 2–ΔΔCT method (35Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis of Human and Mouse PAI-1 Genes—The genomic sequences of human PAI-1 gene (hCG17353) and mouse PAI-1 gene (mCG18018) and their surrounding sequences were acquired from the Celera genome data base (cds.celera.com/biolib). The alignment of human and mouse PAI-1 genes was visualized using the AVID-based mVISTA (36Bray N. Dubchak I. Pachter L. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 97-102Google Scholar, 37Mayor C. Brudno M. Schwartz J.R.

Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1304-1306Google Scholar) (www-gsd.lbl.gov/vista) with a window size of 100 bp and a homology threshold of 0.75. The result was analyzed for potential transcription factor-binding sites by using rVISTA, which uses the Match™ program based on the TRANSFAC Professional 5.3 library for both human and mouse sequences. The search for potential transcription factor-binding sites in other sequences was performed using the MatInspector version 2.2 (39Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Google Scholar) (transfac.gbf.de/cgi-bin/matSearch/matsearch.pl), which is also based on TRANSFAC matrices library; the parameters for the core similarity and matrix similarity were set to 0.75. Mapping DNase I-hypersensitive Sites—Confluent culture of HUVECs grown in 100-mm dishes were treated with 10 ng/ml of TNFα or vehicle in complete medium for 4 h before washing with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with increasing concentrations of DNase I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) (8–40 units/ml) in 5 ml of cell permeabilization buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 300 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15% Nonidet P-40) (40Stewart A.F. Reik A. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 193157Google Scholar). The digestion solution was aspirated after 3.5 min, and the cells were lysed for 4 min with 1.6 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 200 μg/ml proteinase K). The lysate was incubated overnight at 37 °C before genomic DNA was extracted by one phenol:chloroform extraction and two ethanol precipitations with sodium acetate. 20 μg of DNA samples were digested completely with one of the following restriction enzymes: AflII, BglII, NsiI, or XbaI, run on 0.7% agarose (Seakem LE, BMA, Rockland, ME) in 1× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris-borate, 1 mm EDTA) overnight at 2 V/cm. The DNA was blotted to Zeta-Probe GT membrane (Bio-Rad) by capillary transfer. The hybridization was carried out in ExpressHyb Hybridization solution (Clontech, Polo Alto, CA) using the provided protocol. Wash conditions include three times wash with buffer containing 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.5× SDS for a total of 30 min at room temperature, followed by three times wash with buffer containing 0.1× SSC, 0.1× SDS for 30 min at 55 °C. All of the probes were labeled with of [α-32P]dCTP using a Prime-It II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified with QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). The probes were named from P1 to P3 according to their 5′ to 3′ order. Probe P1 and P2 were obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA. The primer pairs used were 5′-AGA ACG GCT TCT GCT AGC TCT A-3′ and 5′-AGC AGA CAA GGA AGG GTC CAG T-3′ for P1 and 5′-GGT CCC ATA ACA ACC ACC CCA G-3′ and 5′-GCC TGG CTT GGA CAC AGA CGT T-3′ for P2. P3 was a 540-bp AflII/SspI fragment gel-isolated from the long PCR product. Plasmid Construction—High molecular weight DNA for long PCR amplification was extracted from pooled human peripheral white blood cells using standard protocols (41Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 6.8-6.9Google Scholar). A 146-bp (from –92 to +54 bp relative to the transcription start site) PAI-1 promoter fragment was obtained by PCR amplification using primers 5′-GTT AGA TCT CAG AGC CAG TGA GTG GGT GGG G-3′ and 5′-GAT GAA GCT TGG GGC GTG TGG GTC TTC TTG AC-3′. The PCR product was digested by BglII and HindIII, gel-extracted, and inserted into the multiple cloning site of pGL3Basic to create the minimal PAI-1 promoter reporter plasmid, designated pPAImini. Long PCR amplifications of the PAI-1 gene were performed using Expand long template PCR system (Roche Applied Science). Amplification conditions were: 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 68 °C for 12 min. Twenty additional cycles were performed in which the extension cycle was increased by 10 s/cycle. All of the amplicons were single bands when run on agarose gel. These fragments were ligated into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and identified by restriction enzyme digestion and partial sequencing. These fragments were then excised by restriction enzymes and inserted into the corresponding sites in plasmid pPAImini. The resulting clones are named by the start and end position relative to PAI-1 transcription start site, with U and D indicating upstream and downstream, respectively. The names of the cis-inserted clones, the enzymes used for the cloning, and sequences of the primer pairs are shown in Table I. For subcloning of pU15.7-13.2, the amplicons from PCR were digested directly with restriction enzymes that recognized the sequences at the 5′ ends of the primers and were inserted into the corresponding sites in pPAImini. The names of the cis-inserted clones, the enzymes used for the cloning, and sequences of the primer pairs are also shown in Table I. To make the 0.4-kb inner deletion on pU18.8-11.4, the plasmid was double-digested with SfiI and EcoRI at –15012 and –14536 bp, and both ends were filled with T4 polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and ligated with T4 ligase (New England Biolabs).Table IPrimer sequences used to amplify and subclone various regions of PAI-1 geneRegion amplified†Primers (5′ to 3′)-33.1 to -26.2ATACGCGTTACAGGCAAGAACTGGAAACTGTTCGGCaSense.TAACGCGTGGAGGCAACATAGATACGGCTGTTTCCAAGbAntisense.-27.0 to -18.0AGCTAGCGATCTGAGATGCTGCCCCGTGCTAATAAACaSense.AGCTAGCCAGAAGCCGTTCTGCTTTGGGTGGATCAAbAntisense.-18.8 to -11.4AGGTACCAGAGGCACTGGGTTTGTTGGGAAACaSense.AGGTACCGGGATTCACCAATGAGGCTCTAAGGbAntisense.-18.8 to -13.2AGGTACCAGAGGCACTGGGTTTGTTGGGAAACaSense.ATTACTCGAGGGTGGAGTTGACGGGGTTTTACbAntisense.-18.8 to -15.6TGTCACGCGTAGAGGCACTGGGTTTGTTGGGAAaSense.TGTACTCGAGTCCTGCCCGCCTTAGTCTGGATTbAntisense.-15.7 to -13.2ACTCACGCGTAGCAACCACAAATCCAGACTAAGaSense.ATTACTCGAGGGTGGAGTTGACGGGGTTTTACbAntisense.-14.2 to -11.4AGGTACCAGGGCCTAGCAAACAAACAGCAaSense.GTTAGATCTCCAGACAGTCAGCAGGTCGTGCbAntisense.-11.1 to -4.5AACGCGTCACCAGCCACGATGCCCAGCCAAATAATTaSense.TACGCGTGGGCTGTGGATTTCAGGGGAAAGTTCTGAbAntisense.+0.1 to +8.4AGCTAGCAATCGCAAGGCACCTCTGAGAACaSense.AGCTAGCCATGTCGGTCATTCCCAGGTTCTbAntisense.+8.4 to +12.5TGGTACCTAGAGAACCTGGGAATGACCGACAaSense.AGGTACCCATGAGGTCTATGGACCAACAGGAbAntisense.+12.5 to +15.2TGGTACCCAAAATCCTGTTGGTCCATAGACCaSense.TGGTACCGTCTCAGTTTTCCTGAGTGCTTGbAntisense.-15.8 to -14.8GTAGAACGCGTAAAGAAAGGCAAGTAGACCCTGAGAaSense.CATTACTCGAGCACAGCATCTAGCGTCTTCCAGGCAbAntisense.-14.9 to -14.2CATCTACGCGTCCTTGATCCCCTGACTTTGGCAGTGaSense.CATTACTCGAGCTTGCTGTTTGTTTGCTAGGCCCTGbAntisense.-14.2 to -13.2CATCAACGCGTGCCTAGCAAACAAACAGCAAGTaSense.CATTACTCGAGGGTGGAGTTGACGGGGTTTTACbAntisense.a Sense.b Antisense. Open table in a new tab The cloning of luciferase reporter vectors pGLuc1.3k, pGLuc3.0k, and pGLuc6.4k, which contain human PAI-1 promoter fragments starting from –1.3, –3.0, and –6.4 kb, has been described previously (22Chen Y.Q. Su M. Walia R.R. Hao Q. Covington J.W. Vaughan D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8225-8231Google Scholar). The expression plasmid pCMVIκB was kindly provided by Dr. Robert S. Carter (Vanderbilt, TN). Transient Transfection Luciferase Assays—BAECs were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in 12-well plate format. Typically, the cells (70% confluence) were transfected with 0.2 μg of PAI-1 reporter plasmids or pNFκB-Luc (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), along with 20 ng of pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase reporter (Promega) as described previously (42Schoenhard J.A. Smith L.H. Painter C.A. Eren M. Johnson C.H. Vaughan D.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 473-481Google Scholar). In each experiment, equal amounts of DNA were used; the cells were treated with or without 20 ng/ml of TNFα in starvation Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no serum 36–48 h after transfection. The cell extracts were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity 18 h later using the Dual-luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega) with luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The relative expression level was expressed as the ratio of the normalized luciferase activities between the plasmids containing human PAI-1 gene fragments and the minimal PAI-1 promoter construct. In each experiment, at least four replicates were performed for each group. Pharmacological Analysis of the TNFα Signaling Pathway—Confluent HUVECs cultured in 6-well plates were pretreated with vehicle or inhibitors, namely SP600125 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), SB202190 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), its inactive control compound SB202474 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), or BAY11–7082 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), in complete medium, and then the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of TNFα for 6 h in the presence of either vehicle or an inhibitor before total RNA were extracted as describe above. The PAI-1 mRNA levels were determined by RT-QPCR, and the induction levels of PAI-1 were expressed as the ratio of the PAI-1 mRNA levels of TNFα-treated and vehicle-treated cells. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations on pU15.7-13.2 were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutation sites and the oligonucleotides used are as follows with the NFκB sites underlined and the mutated nucleotides in bold: MutA, 5′-GCC TCA GCC ACA GTT TGA CGT CCT TAG CTG G-3′ and 5′-CCA GCT AAG GAC GTC AAA CTG TGG CTG AGG C-3′; MutB, 5′-CAC TTG GGG CAG TCC GGC CGT GTC CCT TCC CTT G-3′ and 5′-CAA GGG AAG GGA CAC GGC CGG ACT GCC CCA AGT G-3′; MutC, 5′-GTT TCC CTT CCG CTG GAA TTG AGG TTC TTG AGG AC-3′ and 5′-GTC CTC AAG AAC CTC AAT TCC AGC GGA AGG GAA AC-3′; MutD, 5′-CTC GAA CTC CCA GGC TCA AGT TAT CCT CCT GCC TTG GCC TC-3′ and 5′-GAG GCC AAG GCA GGA GGA TAA CTT GAG CCT GGG AGT TCG AG-3′. All of the mutations were verified by direct sequencing. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Confluent HUVECs were incubated in complete medium with 10 ng/ml of TNFα or vehicle for 1 h. After washing two times with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were scraped and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed again with cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture. Nuclear extracts from HUVECs were prepared as described previously (22Chen Y.Q. Su M. Walia R.R. Hao Q. Covington J.W. Vaughan D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8225-8231Google Scholar). Six μg of nuclear extract was used for the DNA binding reaction in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 4% Ficoll, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.0 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 6% glycerol and labeled oligonucleotides (∼10,000 counts/reaction). Oligonucleotides containing either an intact NFκB-binding site or a mutant site were annealed and end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]dATP. The sequence of the PAI-1 NFκB oligonucleotide was 5′-CCT TCC GCT GGA ATT TCT GTT CTT GAG GAC TTC ATG-3′, and the mutant oligonucleotide was 5′-GTT TCC CTT CCG CTT TAA TGG G TTC TTG AGG-3′, where the NFκB sites are underlined and the mutated nucleotides are highlighted in bold. In supershift assays, 1.0 μg of specific antibodies to p65, p50, or p52 (Santa Cruz, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the binding reactions. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 2% Ficoll in 0.25× TBE buffer and analyzed by autoradiography. TNFα Induces PAI-1 Expression via NFκB but Not through Proximal PAI-1 Promoter—We searched for a TNFα-responsive element and initially focused on the proximal promoter region of the PAI-1 gene. Endothelial cells were chosen for transient transfection assays in this study because they are known to express PAI-1 and are an important source of PAI-1 secreted into blood stream. Our efforts to use HepG2 cells proved unsuccessful because the internal control genes used for transient transfection assays were also induced in this cell line (data not shown). Luciferase reporter constructs driven by segments of the human PAI-1 proximal promoter up to 6.4 kb from the transcription start site were transfected into BAECs and tested for their responsiveness to TNFα (Fig. 1A). We found that none of these constructs could be induced by TNFα, suggesting that this region does not harbor the requisite sequence to mediate TNFα transactivation in the absence of other cooperative sites. Because transfected plasmids may not reflect the state of the endogenous gene, the responsiveness of the proximal promoter was also tested in a line of transgenic mice that overexpress enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene under the control of a –2.9-kb fragment of human PAI-1 promoter. We have previously shown that this human PAI-1 promoter is responsive to selective agonists, including angiotensin II, although qualitative and quantitative expression patterns are not always consistent with the induction of endogenous mouse PAI-1 expression (34Eren M. Painter C.A. Gleaves L.A. Schoenhard J.A. Atkinson J.B. Vaughan D.E. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 2389-2396Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4 μg of TNFα or normal saline. Endogenous murine PAI-1 expression was significantly induced in multiple organs, including lung (45.3 ± 21.6-fold), liver (70.6 ± 42.1-fold), and kidney (163.5 ± 43.8-fold), as previously reported (25Sawdey M.S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1346-1353Google Scholar). However, except for a mild induction in the lung (2.5 ± 0.5-fold), the 2.9-kb human PAI-1 promoter was not inducible in any of the organs tested in this study (Fig. 1B). TNFα activates gene expression mainly through two signaling pathways, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (mainly c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38), which activates the AP-1 transcription factor, and the IκB kinase pathway, which activates the NFκB transcription factor (43Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar). To determine which signaling pathway mediates the TNFα induction of endogenous murine PAI-1 expression, specific inhibitors of both pathways were tested in TNFα-stimulated HUVECs. These inhibitors included the specific c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor, SP600125, the selective p38 inhibitor, SB202190 together with its inactive control compound SB202474, and BAY11–7082, which selectively and irreversibly inhibits the TNFα-induced phosphorylation of IκB-α without affecting the constitutive IκB-α phosphorylation (44Pierce J.W.

These neurons contain two vanilloid receptor pools, one in the plasma membrane and the other in the endoplasmic reticulum. The present experiments characterize these two pools and their functional significance using calcium imaging and 45Ca uptake in stably transfected cells or dorsal root ganglion neurons. The plasma membrane localized receptor is directly activated by vanilloids. The endoplasmic reticulum pool was demonstrated to be independently activated with 20 μm capsaicin or 1.6 μm resiniferatoxin using a bathing solution containing 10 μm Ruthenium Red (to selectively block plasma membrane-localized receptors) and 100 μm EGTA. We also demonstrate an overlap between the endoplasmic reticulum-localized vanilloid receptor regulated stores and thapsigargin-sensitive stores. Direct depletion of calcium via activation of endoplasmic reticulum-localized vanilloid receptor 1 triggered store operated calcium entry. Furthermore, we found that, in the presence of low extracellular calcium (10-5m), either 2 μm capsaicin or 0.1 nm-1.6 μm resiniferatoxin caused a pronounced calcium-induced calcium release in either vanilloid receptor-expressing neurons or heterologous expression systems.

It is known that overactivation of TRPV1 (e.g. by intradermal administration of the vanilloid ligands capsaicin (CAP) or resiniferatoxin (RTX)) can damage neurons or nerve terminals through a calcium-dependent process, producing desensitization to painful stimuli (2LaMotte R.H.

However, in most naturally occurring painful conditions such as inflammation or cancer-related pain, the nociceptive nerve ending maintains its sensitivity for prolonged periods (7Amaya F.

These observations suggest that nociceptive neurons have sophisticated mechanisms for intraneuronal Ca2+ regulation to maintain both sensory transduction/transmission and structural integrity. Similar to other excitable and non-excitable cells, nociceptive neurons have elaborated a multitude of mechanisms to maintain a low resting concentration of free calcium in the cytosol ([Ca2+]i) (9Choi D.W.

In addition to calcium elevation due to nociceptive stimuli, in tumor-associated pain or inflammatory conditions, TRPV1 can be sensitized by PKC or PKA phosphorylation (17Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P.

Evidence from experimental models of arthritis and tumor-induced pain indicate that nerve fibers remain functional and even hypertrophy and proliferate in the vicinity of the neoplasm in conjunction with the development of hyperalgesia (8Cain D.M.

Recently, we identified two pools of TRPV1, one in the plasma membrane (TRPV1PM) and the other in the ER (TRPV1ER), and showed that activation of either population was capable of elevating intracellular calcium (5Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Subsequently, other groups explored the possibility of vanilloid-sensitive intracellular calcium stores or used TRPV1 as a probe for intracellular Ca2+ release in heterologous expression systems (26Turner H. Fleig A. Stokes A. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Liu M. Liu M.C. Magoulas C. Priestley J.V. Willmott N.J. J. Biol.

In this paper, we investigate 1) the role of TRPV1ER in regulation of intracellular calcium and 2) the interaction between TRPV1PM and the ER calcium stores in the context of a possible role in peripheral signaling mechanisms such as sensitization and neurogenic inflammation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that vanilloids or endovanilloids may use calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) to amplify Ca2+ signals entering through TRPV1PM or calcium increases, generated within the nerve ending through activation of TRV1ER. The ability of the nociceptive neuron to access multiple calcium pools may be used to modulate sensitivity and possibly maintain the integrity of primary afferent endings and thereby nociceptive signaling in prolonged pain states. Determination of [Ca2+]i—DRG cultures were prepared from E16 embryonic rats as described previously (5Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The culture conditions (poly-d-lysine/collagen-coated slides) yield neurons with both axons and dendrites (29Lein P.J. Higgins D. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 330-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The dendrites are large processes branching from the cell body that taper in diameter further from the cell body. The axons are a constant diameter and project over long distances from the cell body. Before [Ca2+]i determination, cells were washed three times in imaging medium (IM) composed of HEPES-buffered (pH 7.4) Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ascorbic acid, and 1 mm pyruvate and then loaded with 5 μm Fluo-4 AM dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 20 °C. To remove excess dye, cells were washed three times in IM and kept in the dark for at least 20 min before being imaged in a closed chamber (PH-2, Warner Instrument Corp.) perfused with a pump (Miniplus 3, Gilson, Middleton, WI). In case of “zero” calcium experiments if not otherwise specified, before the addition of drugs, cells were washed for 1 min in IM containing 10 μm Ruthenium Red (RR) and 100 μm EGTA without the addition of any Ca2+. For determination of [Ca2+]i, an upright microscope (Olympus BX60) illuminated with an arc lamp and equipped with a ×20 Uapo/340 water immersion objective was used. A shutter (Uniblitz, Rochester, NY), an excitation filter (495 nm), appropriate dichroic mirrors, and a long pass filter (515 nm) were positioned in the light path. The fluorescent signal was intensified (Model KS-1380, Videoscope International, Washington, D. C.) before capture by a CCD camera (Pulnix, Sunnyvale, CA). Images were digitized and integrated (2 frames/image) on a Macintosh computer running Synapse 3.7, an image acquisition and analysis program (Synergy Research, Silver Spring, MD). Neurons were outlined, and fluorescent intensities were analyzed. Fluorescence intensity values in the non-zero pixels within each slice were averaged (F) and plotted as normalized fluorescence intensities (ΔF/F0) against time. Analysis of the traces and area measurements was performed by the Kaleidograph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Determination of Ca2+Release—TRPV1ϵ-NIH3T3 cells (105), permanently expressing a C-terminally ϵ-epitope-tagged TRPV1 (5Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), were seeded in 24-well plates and then, on the next day, loaded with 10 μm45Ca2+ for 2 h. Ca2+ release was determined during a 10-min incubation with RTX, CAP, and drugs as indicated in either 10-5m or zero [Ca2+]o. To stop release, after incubation, cells were washed three times (∼2 min each) in 10-5m Ca2+-containing medium and the intracellularly retained 45Ca2+ was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Top-Count, Packard/PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after lysis for 30 min as described previously (5Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Lower than normal extracellular (10-5m)Ca2+ was necessary for washing, because 1.25 mm Ca2+ causes passive calcium exchange by itself (data not shown). Fluorescent Confocal Microscopy—COS7 cells or E15 rat primary dorsal root ganglion neurons were seeded on 25-mm coverslips and transfected with 1 mg of the TRPV1eGFP plasmid (5Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Transfection of the COS7 cells was performed by SuperFect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and DRG neurons were transfected with the Nupherin reagent (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) cultured for 24 h post-transfection at 35 °C and then mounted in a 1-ml open chamber. To label the ER fluorescently, the ER-Tracker Blue-White® probe was employed (Molecular Probes) and loading of the cells was performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The TRPV1eGFP/ER-Tracker-labeled cells were imaged with an MRC-1024 Bio-Rad confocal system with the appropriate GFP and UV excitation and emission filters. Immunohistochemistry—Rat dorsal root ganglia were fixed in S.T.F. (Streck Laboratories, Inc., Omaha, NE) and paraffin-processed. Sections (5-μm thick) were immunostained by a rat TRPV1-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Golden, CO). Following deparaffinization, sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (S-1000, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Epitope unmasking was performed with Target Retrieval Solution (S1700, Dako, Carpinteria, CA) at 95 °C for 20 min. Visualization of the immunocomplexes was done by the Vectastain Elite rabbit IgG and the peroxidase substrate kits (PK-6101 and SK-4100, Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Control sections for assessment of nonspecific binding were processed in an identical way with the exception of the omission of the primary or secondary antibodies. The stained sections were visualized with an Olympus BX 60 microscope equipped with a CCD camera (RT Slider, Diagnostic Instruments Inc. Burroughs, MI). Morphological Evidence for ER Localization of TRPV1—The localization of TRPV1 to the ER membranes is an intriguing observation; however, most of the morphological evidence was obtained in fixed specimens. To better define the intracellular location of TRPV1 in vivo, live cell dual-label confocal imaging was employed. TRPV1eGFP, a previously constructed and functionally active green fluoroprotein-tagged chimera (5Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) was transiently transfected in COS7 cells and primary dorsal root ganglion cultures. Confocal microscopy of TRPV1eGFP fluorescence in live cells revealed the typical ER network. Simultaneous labeling with ER-Tracker Blue-White, a vital ER-labeling fluorescent dye, confirmed co-localization of TRPV1 to the ER (Fig. 1, a and b). Likewise, the ER lattice was also readily apparent when TRPV1eGFP was transiently transfected into DRG neurons, although the size and spherical geometry in sensory neurons makes it difficult to achieve resolution similar to the COS7 cells (Fig. 1, a–c). These results are consistent with the dense neuronal intracellular staining seen in sections of trigeminal ganglion after fixation and immunohistological staining of tissue sections for TRPV1 (Fig. 1d). Functional Characterization of TRPV1ER—Calcium-imaging experiments were performed on native non-transfected rat DRG neurons. Because the DRG culture is a heterogeneous population of neurons, a scouting or screening pulse of capsaicin (1 μm CAP in 1.25 mm Ca2+ for 15 s) was administered to identify TRPV1-positive neurons and the short application time allowed us to minimize any desensitizing effects of CAP (Fig. 1e). Resiniferatoxin produced a remarkably prolonged response when applied for the same time even in 1000-fold lower concentration (Fig. 1f). To functionally characterize the ER-dependent elevations of [Ca2+]i in isolation, experiments on TRPV1ER were carried out in a closed flow-through chamber using buffer containing 10 μm RR, a PM-impermeable TRPV1 channel blocker, and 100 μm EGTA to ensure extracellular Ca2+ levels of ≤10-7m (zero [Ca2+]o). RR effectively blocks Ca2+ entry through TRPV1 in radioactive calcium transport experiments (Fig. 1g). Once the CAP-sensitive neurons were identified, the perfusion medium was changed to zero [Ca2+]o containing 10 μm RR. In the absence of extracellular calcium and with the TRPV1PM channel blocker, 1 μm CAP for 1 min did not evoke any change in [Ca2+]i (data not shown). However, further elevation of the CAP concentration to 20 μm induced a transient [Ca2+]i increase and, upon repetition of the same CAP dose, the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i increase was reduced to ∼50% of the initial elevation (Fig. 2a). Only neurons positive to the screening pulse of CAP responded to 20 μm CAP in zero [Ca2+]o conditions. This demonstrates that the [Ca2+]i transients are specific for neurons with TRPV1PM and those neurons contain TRPV1ER. The decrease in the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transients observed after the second CAP application is consistent with the idea that CAP depletes an intracellular store of Ca2+ of finite capacity, which is gated by TRPV1ER. The increase in Fluo-4 AM fluorescence, indicative of increased [Ca2+]i, was not confined to the cell body but also was observed along all of the visible neuronal processes (Fig. 2, b and c), thus revealing vanilloid-inducible TRPV1ER-operated Ca2+ store throughout the entire extent of the neuronal dendritic and axonal specializations. After a 3-min re-perfusion with 1.25 mm Ca2+, 1 μm CAP induced a [Ca2+]i transient comparable to control levels. To demonstrate that the CAP-gated store can be reversibly depleted and replenished, the cells were cycled between zero [Ca2+]o perfusion medium supplemented with RR and medium containing a physiological calcium concentration (without RR) with periodic CAP challenges (Fig. 2, d–f). The first CAP challenge in zero [Ca2+]o (Fig. 2d) was followed by a wash in normal calcium medium for 15 min after which cells were switched back to zero [Ca2+]o. A second capsaicin application yielded a response of similar amplitude as the first one, and the response decreased when it was repeated without a preceding wash in normal calcium (Fig. 2e). Reperfusion of the cells with normal calcium-containing solution was sufficient to replenish the CAP-gated store and return the response obtained in zero [Ca2+]o to control levels (Fig. 2f). These data indicate that the CAP-sensitive store can be depleted and replenished in a reversible fashion. To obtain total store depletion in these neurons and to characterize the relationship of the vanilloid-depletable pool with other known intracellular stores, we used the more potent vanilloid, RTX. Resiniferatoxin is approximately 1000–10,000-fold more potent than CAP (30Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Neuroscience. 1989; 30: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and we also found that its off-rate from TRPV1 is much slower compared with CAP (Fig. 1f) (see below) (31Acs G. Lee J. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 35: 173-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resiniferatoxin (1.6 μm) produces almost complete depletion of the TRPV1-sensitive pool (Fig. 3a) because no release from the ER pool is evoked by a second RTX application. This observation suggests that RTX extends the open state of the TRPV1 channel to the point where, in zero [Ca2+]o, equilibrium may be reached among [Ca2+] in the ER, the cytoplasmic compartment, and the extracellular fluid because RTX also keeps TRPV1PM in the open state. In this condition, the fluorescent response in zero [Ca2+]o does return to the basal state (Fig. 3a), supporting the idea that calcium either leaves the cell or is sequestered in intracellular stores such as the mitochondria. Vanilloid-induced Capacitative Ca2+Entry—One consequence of ER Ca2+ depletion is activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry at the PM (32Bird G.S. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To test whether the RTX-induced increase in [Ca2+]i comes from depletion of ER stores, we first completely depleted the TRPV1ER Ca2+ pool with RTX in EGTA and RR-containing extracellular fluid and then cells were switched back to normal calcium concentration in the presence of RR (Fig. 3b) to block TRPV1PM. This resulted in a slowly rising but long duration elevation of [Ca2+]i. The observed slow increase in [Ca2+]i shows similar characteristics to classical store-operated Ca2+ entry. The process was restricted to the vanilloid-sensitive subpopulation of neurons because cells in the same field of view that were negative to initial CAP or RTX stimulation did not show any change after the extracellular medium was returned to the normal Ca2+ concentration (data not shown). These data are consistent with the idea that TRPV1-induced store depletion stimulates store-operated Ca2+ entry. Parenthetically, it is important to note that without RR blocking when switching back to normal calcium concentrations, there is a massive calcium entry via TRPV1PM because RTX maintains TRPV1 in the open state for prolonged period (data not shown). TRPV1ER Overlaps with a Thapsigargin-Sensitive Pool—We further characterized whether the TRPV1ER compartment overlapped with the thapsigargin (TG)-sensitive Ca2+ pool. After identifying TRPV1-positive neurons with the CAP-screening pulse, 1.6 μm RTX was applied two times in zero extracellular Ca2+ to completely deplete TRPV1ER. Neurons were then perfused with 2 μm TG for an additional 10 min. Two main neuronal populations were distinguished by their characteristic responses. The first group and the main one studied in this paper is composed of CAP-inducible TRPV1-positive neurons in which RTX elicits a strong [Ca2+]i transient. In these neurons, subsequent TG exposure minimally or did not provoke further Ca2+ release (Fig. 3c). Measurement of the areas below the traces (n = 39) showed that in vanilloid-sensitive neurons, TG application produced a small calcium transient, which was 10–14% on average compared with the RTX response. A second group of neurons did not respond to either CAP or RTX but only to TG (Fig. 3d) and was apparently TRPV1-negative. These findings indicate that vanilloids via TRPV1ER can deplete an intracellular Ca2+ store, which is replenished by SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 3, c versus d). Vanilloid-insensitive neurons and glia responded only to TG, indicating that RTX specifically affects a subpopulation of neurons, which are presumed to be nociceptors (Fig. 3, e versus f). To further confirm that thapsigargin and TRPV1ER agonists act on the same ER compartment, the order of store depletion was reversed. After the short (15 s) CAP-screening pulse, cultures were perfused first with 2 μm TG, which induced a prolonged [Ca2+]i transient (Fig. 4a). When [Ca2+]i returned to base line, a second 15-s pulse of CAP was applied, which doubled the response compared with the first pulse (area under curve from the average trace of 24 neurons is 53.43 and 102.14, respectively). This increase suggests that normally the ER attenuates CAP-elicited Ca2+ responses. Switching to zero [Ca2+]o resulted in a drop of [Ca2+]i, and subsequent addition of 1.6 μm RTX elicited a small increase in [Ca2+]i. Comparison of the areas under the TG and RTX transients revealed that the latter was 7.4% of the former. These findings imply that prior ER store depletion by TG in normal calcium conditions greatly diminishes the [Ca2+]i transient inducible by RTX in zero extracellular calcium (EGTA+RR), suggesting that TRPV1ER shares a Ca2+ pool that largely overlaps with SERCA. The ∼2-fold increase in CAP-induced [Ca2+]i after SERCA inhibition by TG also demonstrates the critical Ca2+-buffering role of the ER in CAP-sensitive neurons. Activation of CICR in DRG Neurons—Activation of TRPV1 in 1.25 mm Ca2+ leads to a rapid rise of [Ca2+]i through TRPV1PM. In zero [Ca2+]o, RTX induces an elevation of [Ca2+]i but with a delay of ∼20 s, which we attribute to the time needed for drug distribution to TRPV1ER (Fig. 4b). To visualize activation of both populations of TRPV1, RTX was applied in buffer containing low (10-5m) extracellular Ca2+. The low extracellular Ca2+ resulted in a biphasic elevation of [Ca2+]i, an initial rapid onset (within 1–2 s indicated by the asterisk) with an amplitude substantially smaller than in 1.25 mm extracellular Ca2+ followed by a larger second peak (Fig. 4c). The first increase is attributed to opening of TRPV1PM, whereas the second elevation represents Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Subsequently, the intracellular calcium level subsides to base line. Upon re-introduction of normal calcium concentration and without the addition of RTX, an abrupt long-lasting rise of [Ca2+]i occurs. This large increase in [Ca2+]i upon switching to 1.25 mm [Ca2+]o is consistent with the idea that RTX remains bound and maintains TRPV1PM in the open state. To calculate the potential contribution of TRPV1ER to the elevation of [Ca2+]i, the areas under the average curves recorded in 10-5m and zero [Ca2+]o were compared (269 versus 86.7, n = 18 and 19 neurons, respectively). This ∼3-fold elevation in [Ca2+]i in 10-5m extracellular calcium is consistent with Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from internal stores, and ∼33% of the elevated [Ca2+]i transient appears to be contributed by TRPV1ER. To determine whether CICR can be eliminated by blocking TRPV1PM, 10 μm RR was added to the 10 μm Ca2+-containing imaging medium (Fig. 4d). The resultant increase in intracellular calcium was comparable in amplitude and area with the activation of TRPV1ER only, and it exhibited the same 20-s lag period (Fig. 4, b versus d). We attribute the delay to the time necessary to open TRPV1ER, whereas no lag time is present in case of the CICR response. We next examined the ability of RR to block CICR in normal calcium conditions (Fig. 4e). The increase in intracellular calcium began with an initial sudden rise (no lag period) of [Ca2+]i followed by a slower higher peak. This f"

Here, we examined whether PKD overexpression in Swiss 3T3 cells regulates the activation/inactivation kinetics of the extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK) in response to the mitogenic GPCR agonists bombesin and vasopressin. Addition of bombesin or vasopressin to Swiss 3T3 cells overexpressing PKD induced a striking increase in the duration of MEK/ERK/RSK activation as compared with cultures of either control Swiss 3T3 cells or Swiss 3T3 cells expressing a kinase-inactive PKD mutant. In contrast, the duration of ERK activation in response to epidermal growth factor, which acts via protein kinase C/PKD-independent pathways, was not increased. Furthermore, bombesin or vasopressin promoted a striking increase in phosphorylation (at Ser-374) and accumulation of c-Fos (the c-fos proto-oncogene product) in Swiss 3T3 cells overexpressing wild-type (but not kinase-inactive) PKD. Inhibition of the sustained phase of ERK/RSK activation abrogated the increase in c-Fos accumulation and DNA synthesis induced by bombesin or vasopressin in PKD-overexpressing cells.

The mechanism(s) linking the early signaling pathways to the subsequent stimulation of cell proliferation remains incompletely understood. PKD (also initially known as PKCμ) is a serine/threonine protein kinase with structural, enzymology, and regulatory properties different from the PKC family members (20Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKD most distinct characteristics are the presence of a catalytic domain distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases, a pleckstrin homology (PH) region that regulates enzyme activity and a highly hydrophobic stretch of amino acids in its N-terminal region (22Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Zugaza J.L. Bochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

This N-terminal region also contains a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich, zinc finger-like motifs, which confers high affinity for phorbol esters and plays a negative role in the regulation of catalytic kinase activity (25Matthews S.

In all these cases, rapid PKD activation is mediated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-744 and Ser-748 within the activation loop of the catalytic domain of PKD (33Yuan J.Z. Slice L. Walsh J.H.

Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggesting that it functions in mitogenic signaling. Indeed, we reported that PKD overexpression markedly potentiates DNA synthesis induced by the GPCR agonists bombesin and vasopressin in Swiss 3T3 cells (53Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40298-40305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a cell line that has been used extensively as a model system to elucidate signal transduction pathways in the mitogenic action of GPCR agonists (1Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 54Rozengurt E. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 21: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 55Rozengurt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PKD plays an important role in mediating cellular DNA synthesis in response to GPCR agonists, but the mechanism(s) involved has not been elucidated. One of the major signaling pathways involved in the mitogenic response induced by both receptor tyrosine kinases and GPCRs is the ERK cascade (56Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 57Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The ERKs (ERK-1 and ERK-2) are directly activated by phosphorylation on specific tyrosine and threonine residues by the dual-specificity ERK kinase (or MEK). Studies on the mechanisms by which mitogenic GPCRs activate ERK revealed considerable heterogeneity, depending on receptor and cell context (58Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). It is increasingly recognized that the duration and intensity of ERK pathway activation is of critical importance for determining specific biological outcomes, including proliferation, differentiation, and transformation (59Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4243) Google Scholar, 60Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). For example, sustained activation of ERK for several hours is associated with re-initiation of DNA replication in fibroblasts whereas transient ERK activation (20-30 min) is not sufficient to promote mitogenesis in these cells (60Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 61Pouyssegur J. Lenormand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3291-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The protein products of immediate early genes (e.g. c-Fos) have been proposed to function as molecular sensors of ERK1/2 signal duration (62Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). As a first step to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which PKD facilitates GPCR-induced mitogenesis, we examined whether PKD overexpression influences the duration or intensity of ERK signaling in response to mitogenic GPCR agonists. The results presented here demonstrate that overexpression of wild-type (but not kinase-inactive) PKD dramatically increases the duration of MEK/ERK/RSK activation and the accumulation of c-Fos (the c-fos proto-oncogene product) induced by either bombesin or vasopressin in Swiss 3T3 cells. Inhibition of the sustained phase of ERK activation by treatment with either U0126 or PD98059 abrogated the accumulation of c-Fos protein and the potentiation of DNA synthesis induced by bombesin or vasopressin in Swiss 3T3 cells overexpressing PKD. Our results indicate that an increase in the duration of the ERK signal is one of the mechanisms by which PKD facilitates GPCR-induced mitogenesis. Cell Culture—Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells, which overexpress PKD, Swiss 3T3-PKDK618N.GFP cells, which overexpress the kinase-inactive PKD mutant PKDK618N, and control Swiss 3T3-GFP cells generated as previously described (53Zhukova E.

For experimental purposes, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish or 35-mm dishes at 1 × 105 cells/dish and grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 7-9 days until cells became confluent and quiescent (63Seufferlein T. Withers D.J. Mann D. Rozengurt E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phoenix packaging cells (kindly provided by Dr. G.

Production of Retrovirus—To generate Swiss 3T3 cells stably overexpressing PKD, cultures of these cells were transduced with retrovirus encoding either wild-type or kinase-inactive murine PKD, in which PKD and GFP were translated from the same bicistronic mRNA and expressed as two separate proteins. After transduction, cells expressing higher levels of GFP were sorted by FACS, collected and propagated for further studies. Specifically, construction of the retroviral plasmid expressing wild-type PKD (MSCV-PKDiresGFP) has been previously described (53Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40298-40305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To generate retroviral plasmid containing cDNA of the kinase-inactive PKD (MSCV-PKDK618NiresGFP), the fragment of the wild-type PKD cDNA spanning from +1660 to +2910 of the published sequence and containing the K618N mutation was amplified by PCR from the previously described kinase-inactive construct (40Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The 5′-PCR primer contained the endogenous HpaI restriction site. The 3′-PCR primer was designed to introduce an additional HpaI site at the 3′-end of the amplified fragment. The HpaI digest of the MSCV-PKDiresGFP construct released the +1660/+2910 fragment of the wild-type PKD. The PCR-amplified fragment of the kinase-inactive PKD (+1660 to +2910) was introduced into HpaI sites of the MSCV-PKDiresGFP by ligation, thus producing MSCV-PKDK618NiresGFP. The nucleotide sequence of the MSCV-PKDK618NiresGFP was validated by sequencing. For retrovirus production, logarithmically growing Phoenix ecotropic cells were transfected with MSCV-PKDiresGFP, MSCV-PKDK618-NiresGFP or MSCV-iresGFP using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as per protocol of the manufacturer. Virus-containing supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and used immediately. Logarithmically growing Swiss 3T3 cells were incubated with the virus-containing supernatants in the presence of 5 μg/ml polybrene for 5 h. Cells were collected 48-72 h later and GFP-positive fractions were FACS-sorted using a Becton Dickinson FACStar PLUS machine. GFP-positive cells were propagated, and multiple aliquots were frozen. A fresh batch of transduced cells was generated every 2 month. Following sorting, GFP-positive cells were maintained as described earlier in this section. Immunoblotting and Detection of MEK, ERK, Ribosomal S6 Kinases (RSK), FAK, PKD, and c-Fos—Confluent, quiescent Swiss 3T3-GFP, Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP and Swiss 3T3-PKDK618N.GFP cells were lysed in 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and boiled for 10 min. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The transfer was carried out at 100 V,0.4 A at 4 °C for 4 h using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus. The transfer buffer consisted of 200 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, 0.01% SDS, and 20% CH3OH. For detection of proteins, membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and then incubated for at least 2 h with the desired antibodies diluted in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 3% nonfat dried milk. Bound primary antibodies to immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit. The phosphospecific antibodies used were as follows; the phospho-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibody recognizes the ERK-1/2 only when they are phosphorylated on Thr-202 and Tyr-204 (pERK1/ERK2); the phospho MEK1/2 polyclonal antibody recognizes MEK1/2 only when they are phosphorylated on Ser-217 and Ser-221 (pMEK1/2); the phospho-p90RSK polyclonal antibody is specific to p90RSK only when it is phosphorylated on Thr-574; the phospho-MARCKS polyclonal antibody is specific to the phosphorylated state of MARCKS only when it is phosphorylated on Ser-152 and Ser-156 (pMARCKS); the phospho-FAK910 polyclonal antibody recognizes FAK only when it is phosphorylated on Ser-910; the phospho-FAK397 polyclonal antibody recognizes FAK only when it is phosphorylated on Tyr-397, the major autophosphorylation site of FAK; the phospho FAK577 polyclonal antibody recognizes FAK only when it is phosphorylated on Tyr-577; the phospho-PKD polyclonal antibody PKDS916 recognizes PKD only when it is autophosphorylated on Ser-916. The phospho c-Fos polyclonal antibody recognizes c-Fos only when it is phosphorylated on Ser-374. Autoluminograms were scanned using a GS-710 scanner (Bio-Rad), and the bands were quantified using the Quantity One software program (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation of FAK and c-Fos—Cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells, treated as described in the individual experiments, were washed and lysed in 50 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and 1% Triton X-100 (lysis buffer A). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C for 2-4 h using a FAK C-20 polyclonal antibody for FAK and a c-Fos polyclonal antibody for c-Fos. The immune complexes were recovered using protein-A coupled to agarose and solubilized with 2× sample buffer. Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay of ERK1/2—Cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells, treated as described in the individual experiments, were washed and lysed in 50 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and 1% Triton X-100 (lysis buffer A). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. ERK1/2 was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2-4 h with the ERK1/2 antiserum. The immune complexes were recovered using protein A coupled to agarose. Exogenous substrate phosphorylation by immunoprecipitated ERK1/2 was determined as previously described (20Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunocomplexes were washed twice with lysis buffer A and twice with kinase buffer (30 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Then, 20 μl of the washed ERK immunocomplexes were mixed with 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 μm final concentration of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 400-600 cpm/pmol) and 20 μg of MBP. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 75 mm H3PO4 and spotting 75 μl of the supernatant on P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Free [γ-32P]ATP was separated from the labeled substrate by washing the P-81 paper four times for 5 min, in 75 mm H3PO4. The papers were dried, and the radioactivity incorporated into the MBP substrate was determined by Cerenkov counting. Assay of DNA Synthesis—Confluent and quiescent cultures of transfected Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with DMEM/Waymouth's medium (1:1, v/v) containing [3H]thymidine (0.2 μCi/ml, 1 μm) and various agonists as described in the figure legends. After 40 h of incubation at 37 °C, cultures were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 20 min to remove acid-soluble radioactivity, washed with ethanol, and solubilized in 1 ml of 2% Na2CO3, 0.1 m NaOH. The acid-insoluble radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in 6 ml of Beckman Readysafe Materials—pMSCVneo retroviral vector was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and protein-A agarose were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Polybrene was from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). U0126 was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). EGF, vasopressin and bombesin were obtained from Sigma. [3H]thymidine and [γ-32P]ATP (370 MBq/ml) were from Amersham Biosciences. The following antibodies were purchased from Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), phospho-p44mapk/p42mapk (pERK1/2), phospho-MEK1/2, phospho-p90RSK, and phospho-MARCKS. The phosphospecific polyclonal antibodies to Ser-910, Tyr-397, and Tyr-577 of FAK were obtained from BioSource International (Camarillo, CA). Anti-c-Fos polyclonal and the ERK1/2 kinase assay were from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-ERK-2 and anti-FAK C-20 polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). The phosphospecific monoclonal antibody to Ser-374 of c-Fos was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Phospho-PKD916 (53Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

All other materials were of the highest grade available. Protein Kinase D Overexpression Selectively Increases the Duration of ERK Signaling Induced by Bombesin in Swiss 3T3 Cells—In an effort to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which PKD overexpression potentiates the mitogenic activity of GPCR agonists, we examined the intensity and duration of ERK activation in bombesin-stimulated Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells, which overexpress PKD, and control Swiss 3T3-GFP cells, generated as previously described (53Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40298-40305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that PKD overexpressed in Swiss 3T3 cells retains tight, signal-dependent, regulation of multisite phosphorylation and kinase catalytic activity (53Zhukova E.

https://openalex.org/W2121106253,"Activation of the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors proceeds through a catalytic complex containing IκB kinase (IKK)-1 and IKK2. Targeted disruption of each of the IKK genes suggests that these two kinases may mediate distinct functions in the activation pathway. In our studies of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax oncoprotein, we have uncovered a new function of IKK1 required for complete activation of the NF-κB transcriptional program. In IKK1–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), Tax normally induced early NF-κB activation events. However, NF-κB induced by Tax in these IKK1–/– cells was functionally impaired. In IKK1–/– (but not wild-type) MEFs, Tax failed to activate several different κB reporter constructs or to induce the endogenous IκBα gene. In contrast, Tax normally activated the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein/activating transcription factor pathway, leading to full stimulation of an HTLV-1 long terminal repeat reporter construct in IKK1–/– cells. Furthermore, reconstitution of IKK1–/– cells with kinase-proficient (but not kinase-deficient) forms of IKK1 restored the Tax induction of full NF-κB transactivation. We further found that the defect in NF-κB action in IKK1–/– cells correlated with a failure of Tax to induce phosphorylation of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB at Ser529 and Ser536. Such phosphorylation of RelA/p65 was readily detected in wild-type MEFs. Phosphorylation of Ser536 was required for a complete response to Tax expression, whereas phosphorylation of Ser529 appeared to be less critical. Together, these findings highlight distinct roles for the IKK1 and IKK2 kinases in the activation of NF-κB in response to HTLV-1 Tax. IKK2 plays a dominant role in signaling for IκBα degradation, whereas IKK1 appears to play an important role in enhancing the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by promoting RelA/p65 phosphorylation.

IKK2 plays a dominant role in signaling for IκBα degradation, whereas IKK1 appears to play an important role in enhancing the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by promoting RelA/p65 phosphorylation. Over the past 2 decades, an ever increasing body of work has indicated that the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors lies at the crux of such diverse cellular processes as proliferation, differentiation, and death (1Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Google Scholar, 2Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar). Initially identified as pivotal regulators of immune and inflammatory responses, the actions of this family of transcription factors have now expanded to encompass many physiological and pathological conditions, such as fetal development, neuronal function and degeneration, angiogenesis, ischemia, and tumorigenesis (4Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar, 5Denk A. Wirth T. Baumann B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 303-320Google Scholar). Principally found in the cytoplasm under basal conditions, latent NF-κB·IκB complexes are poised to rapidly respond to a variety of external and internal signals, including TNF-α 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; HTLV-1, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; MSK1, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1; IFN, interferon; MEFs, murine embryo fibroblasts; WT, wild-type; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; LTR, long terminal repeat. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; HTLV-1, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; MSK1, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1; IFN, interferon; MEFs, murine embryo fibroblasts; WT, wild-type; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; LTR, long terminal repeat. and interleukin-1, and bacterially and virally derived products, such as lipopolysaccharide, HTLV-1 Tax, and UV light (6Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Google Scholar, 7Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Science's STKE.http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;1999/5/re1Date: 1999Google Scholar).The activation of this NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors, all of whom share an N-terminal Rel homology domain, is rapid and occurs in the absence of protein synthesis (3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar). As such, NF-κB must be tightly regulated at multiple levels within the cell, including its release from the inhibitor protein, its mobilization from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, and its engagement of cognate κB enhancers, leading to changes in target gene expression. The activation of NF-κB can be viewed as occurring in two discrete phases. The first phase comprises the proximal events that lead to the degradation of the IκBα inhibitor and the translocation of the NF-κB complex into the nuclear compartment. This initial phase of NF-κB activation proceeds through a kinase cascade culminating in the site-specific phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and subsequent degradation of the IκBα inhibitor by the 26 S proteasome. Although the panel of kinases that are recruited after the detection of a particular stimulus includes NIK, TAK-1 (Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase), and MEKK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase-1), they all appear to converge at a common point in the pathway, viz. the activation of a large catalytic complex termed the signalsome (8Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Google Scholar, 9Senftleben U. Karin M. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S18-S26Google Scholar). In turn, the signalsome catalyzes the phosphorylation of the inhibitor protein at two specific N-terminal serines (Ser32 and Ser36 in IκBα and Ser19 and Ser23 in IκBβ) (10Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L.

Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1058-1065Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event is mediated by two specific kinases termed IKK1 and IKK2 that reside in the signalsome in conjunction with a third non-catalytic component termed NEMO/IKKγ (14DiDonato J.A.

Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Google Scholar). These two highly related kinases appear to act in concert to transmit the activation signal in a directional manner, leading to the phosphorylation of IκBα (20O'Mahony A. Lin X. Geleziunas R.

The second phase in the activation of NF-κB involves the post-translational modification of the NF-κB subunits themselves by both phosphorylation and acetylation (22Okazaki T. Sakon S. Sasazuki T.

Although the former phosphorylation events on IκBα are required for release of NF-κB, the latter modifications on RelA/p65 appear to enhance its transcriptional activity and the duration of the response (32Chen L.-F. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Google Scholar). In contrast to the phosphorylation of IκBα, the events that culminate in the modification of RelA/p65 are less well defined. Moreover, the end result appears to vary with respect to cell type, the stimulus evoked, the kinase recruited, and the target residue modified. However, irrespective of these differences, it is clear that the phosphorylation of RelA/p65 augments the transactivation potential of the NF-κB transcription factor complex. Kinases and their target residues that have been implicated in RelA/p65 modification include protein kinase A (on Ser276) (22Okazaki T. Sakon S. Sasazuki T. Sakurai H. Doi T. Yagita H. Okumura K.

Commun. 2003; 301: 583-590Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrate that IKK1 plays a key role in the activation of NF-κB by the HTLV-1 protein Tax (35Geleziunas R. Ferrell S. Lin X. Mu Y.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 207-217Google Scholar). In addition to Tax activation of the IKK1·IKK2·NEMO signalsome complex, which leads to IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, Tax also activates IKK1-mediated phosphorylation of RelA/p65, which enhances the transcriptional activity of the NF-κB complex. Thus, Tax appears to regulate NF-κB in both the proximal and distal phases of the activation pathway. Unlike the transient release of cytokines, Tax is continually expressed in HTLV-1-infected cells, leading to constitutive NF-κB action (37Chu Z.L. DiDonato J.A. Hawiger J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15891-15894Google Scholar). The ability of Tax to promote increased transcriptional activity of NF-κB through the phosphorylation of the C-terminal transactivation domain in RelA/p65 likely plays a role in sustaining the NF-κB transcription response and contributes to leukemogenesis induced by HTLV-1 infection.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Vectors and Biological Reagents—Plasmids pCMV4Tax and pCMV4TaxM22 have also been reported elsewhere (20O'Mahony A.

Cell lysates from these lines were prepared and probed with anti-IKK1 or anti-1KK2 antibodies to confirm the phenotype.Luciferase Reporter Assays—IKK1–/– MEFs, IKK2–/– MEFs, WT MEFs, 293 cells, HeLa cells, and reconstituted p65–/– MEFs were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 with either Tax or NIK expression plasmids (0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 μg/well) or empty vector and the reporter construct indicated in the figure legends. After 12 h, TNF-α was added to select cultures, and the cells were incubated for an additional 6–8 h. Cells were lysed with diluted 5× passive lysis buffer (Promega), and the resulting lysates were assessed for luciferase activity using a luciferase detection kit (Promega) and a multiwell luminometer (Wallac). Cells were also cotransfected with an expression plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase that is not regulated by NF-κB as a control to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. For experiments involving siRNA, oligonucleotides (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) corresponding to a portion of the coding region of the IKK1 open reading frame or nonspecific scrambled oligonucleotides were transfected into cells with OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) 12 h prior to transfection with the expression plasmids listed above. Results are expressed as relative luciferase units adjusted for transfection efficiency and represent the means of triplicate wells from six independent experiments.In Vitro Kinase Assays—Cells were transfected with either Tax or NIK expression vectors as described above. At 24 h post-transfection, the indicated cells were stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 7–10 min. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet-P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm Na3VO4 (added fresh before used). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-NEMO antibodies alone or with anti-IKK1 antibodies conjugated to protein A beads. The immunoprecipitates were then incubated with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of various recombinant p65 protein substrates, including His-tagged full-length RelA/p65 and GST-tagged RelA/p65 N- and C-terminal regions at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and exposure to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Lysates were probed with anti-Tax antibodies to confirm the expression of Tax.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Cells were transfected with a Tax expression vector and incubated for 24 h or were stimulated with TNF-α for 20 min as described above. Cells were lysed in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 12% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein-matched samples were incubated with a κB enhancer construct labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Nucleoprotein·κB complexes were separated on nondenaturing gels and visualized by autoradiography.RESULTSTax Fails to Induce NF-κB-mediated Transactivation in IKK1-deficient Cells—To date, many studies have employed NF-κB translocation into the nucleus or the induced appearance of κB-specific DNA binding activity as a signature of NF-κB activation (8Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Google Scholar). In actuality, complete activation of this transcription factor culminates in its ability to regulate the expression of various target genes. One experimental approach to detect this functional end point is to assess the expression of a reporter gene placed under the control of a κB enhancer element. Accordingly, we first tested the ability of a transiently expressed HTLV-1 Tax protein to induce NF-κB transactivation of the IFN-κB-Luc reporter gene in IKK1–/– MEFs versus WT MEFs. Although Tax induced robust luciferase reporter activity in WT MEFs, we observed only minimal luciferase activity in IKK1–/– MEFs over a range of transfected Tax expression vector DNAs (Fig. 1, A and B). To rule out the possibility that these results reflect a selective failure to activate the IFN-κB enhancer, we tested a second reporter plasmid containing the κB enhancer from the E-selectin gene promoter. A similar defect in Tax induction of luciferase activity was observed with this E-selectin-κB-Luc construct in IKK1-deficient cells expressing Tax (Fig. 1, A and B). Comparable expression of Tax in these IKK1–/– and WT MEFs was confirmed by Western blotting of the lysates with anti-Tax antibodies (Fig. 1E). In contrast to the defect observed with Tax as the agonist, the expression of NIK induced a dose-dependent activation of both κB-Luc reporters. Similarly, stimulation with TNF-α induced luciferase activity with both reporter constructs, although the response observed with IFN-κB was moderately impaired. This functional defect in the Tax response is not attributable to the embryonic stage of development of these IKK1–/– cells because Tax normally activated both of these κB reporters in similarly derived WT MEFs.Next, we examined the effects of Tax activation of κB-Luc reporters in MEFs lacking IKK2 and in 293 fibroblasts. Loss of IKK2 leads to a reduced, but demonstrable induction of NF-κB-mediated transactivation in response to Tax expression. Although the response to Tax was attenuated in IKK2–/– MEFs, we observed greater κB reporter activity in IKK2–/– MEFs than in IKK1–/– cells over a range of Tax expression levels. This induction of NF-κB activity by Tax in IKK2-deficient cells likely involves IKK1-mediated kinase activity, resulting in IκBα phosphorylation, degradation, DNA binding, and transactivation by the NF-κB complex (Fig. 1C). In addition, strong Tax responses were observed in 293 fibroblasts (Fig. 1D). The expression of Tax in these cells was confirmed by Western blotting of the lysates with anti-Tax antibodies (Fig. 1E).To further explore the role of IKK1 in Tax activation of NF-κB, we employed siRNAs to “knock down” the expression of IKK1 in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1 (F and G), transfection of HeLa cells with siRNA specific for IKK1 both inhibited IKK1 protein expression and impaired the induction of κB-Luc activity by Tax, but not by TNF-α. Conversely, transfection of these cells with scrambled siRNA with the same nucleotide composition did not inhibit IKK1 expression or the Tax response.In addition to the induction of NF-κB, Tax expression also leads to the activation of the CREB/activating transcription factor pathway, which mediates transactivation of the HTLV-1 LTR (39Li X.H. Gaynor R.B. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 233-245Google Scholar). To determine whether the lack of IKK1 impacts on this Tax signaling pathway, we tested the ability of Tax to induce a CREB-regulated HTLV-1-LTR-Luc reporter in IKK1–/– cells. In contrast to the functional defect observed in the NF-κB pathway, Tax normally activated the CREB/activating transcription factor pathway, leading to full stimulation of the HTLV-1 LTR reporter gene in IKK1–/– cells (Fig. 2). Comparable induction of HTLV-1 LTR reporter gene expression was observed in IKK1–/– and WT MEFs. As expected, the coexpression of NIK or stimulation with TNF-α failed to activate the CREB-regulated reporter construct while inducing a robust κB enhancer-dependent response. Together, these functional studies highlight a key role for IKK1 in Tax-mediated induction of κB-dependent gene expression.Fig. 2Tax induces HTLV-1 LTR transcription through the CREB pathway, but fails to induce NF-κB-mediated transcription in IKK1–/– MEFs. IKK1–/–, IKK2–/–, and WT MEFs and 293 fibroblasts were transfected with either a 5x-κB-Luc plasmid or an HTLV-1-LTR-Luc reporter plasmid. Cells were also transfected with Tax or NIK or were stimulated with TNF-α as indicated. Differences in transfection efficiency were normalized by cotransfection with Renilla luciferase. Note that Tax effectively activated the HTLV-1 LTR (but not the κB enhancer) in IKK1–/– cells. Error bars indicate S.E. RLU, relative luciferase units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Initial NF-κB Induction Events Are Intact in IKK1–/– Cells Expressing Tax—To further define this essential role of IKK1 in Tax signaling, we investigated various steps in the NF-κB signaling axis in IKK1–/– versus WT MEFs and various IKK1-expressing cell lines (Fig. 3A). Of note, Tax functioned normally during the initial stages of NF-κB activation, promoting the activation of IKK (Fig. 3B), degradation of IκBα (Fig. 3C), and nuclear translocation of RelA/p65 (Fig. 3D). These findings underscore the notion that homodimeric IKK2 complexes are fully competent to mediate the phosphorylation events associated with the initial phase of NF-κB activation (Fig. 3B). Tax expression did not induce detectable in vitro phosphorylation of IκBα with NEMO-immunoprecipitated signalsomes from IKK2–/– MEFs; however, we did observe IκBα degradation in IKK2–/– MEFs, albeit with slower kinetics than seen in either WT or IKK1–/– MEFs (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the levels of NF-κB p65 remained unchanged over the same time course in IKK2–/– MEFs. This decrease in IκBα levels likely results from IKK1-mediated phosphorylation targeting IκBα for proteasome-mediated degradation.Fig. 3Tax normally activates early events in the NF-κB signaling cascade in IKK1–/– cells. A, whole-cell lysates of the various cell lines indicated were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-IKK1 or anti-IKK2 antibodies to confirm the phenotype of the cells. B, shown are the results from the analysis of Tax-induced, signalsome-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα in IKK2–/–, IKK1–/–, and WT MEFs and 293 fibroblasts. Cells were transfected with a Tax expression plasmid, and lysates were harvested 24 h post-transfection. IKK1- and IKK2-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-NEMO antibodies and protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitated complexes were subjected to and in vitro kinase assay in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Reaction products were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, followed by autoradiography. C, shown are the results from the analysis of the proteasome-mediated degradation of the phosphorylated IκBα species in the various cell lines. Tax and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged IκBα expression plasmids were transfected into WT and IKK1–/– MEFs. Tax alone was transfected into IKK2–/– MEFs. After 24 h, cells were exposed to cycloheximide (CHX) to block new protein synthesis for the various times indicated. The levels of both transfected and endogenous IκBα were assessed by immunoblotting. Note that Tax induced the degradation of IκBα in WT and IKK1–/– MEFs and, albeit with slower kinetics, in IKK2–/– MEFs. IKK1 and p65 levels were unaffected by cycloheximide. D, shown are the results from the analysis of Tax-induced RelA/p65 nuclear translocation. Cells were transfected with either empty vector or Tax or were stimulated with TNF-α for 30 min and fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. The nuclear lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted with both anti-RelA/p65 and anti-Tax antibodies to confirm that both proteins were present. E, nuclear lysates from either unstimulated Tax-expressing or TNF-α-stimulated cells were incubated with a radiolabeled κB DNA probe. Protein·DNA complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and exposed to autoradiography film. (IKK1–/– (a) and (b) are from different sources).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Finally, we did not observe any defect in the binding of NF-κB to a κB DNA probe using nuclear extracts from IKK1-deficient cells expressing Tax (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, in IKK2–/– MEFs, NF-κB DNA binding was induced in response to Tax expression; however, loss of IKK2 resulted in significantly diminished NF-κB DNA binding in response to TNF-α (Fig. 3E). Together, these results demonstrate that the proximal events in the NF-κB signaling pathway occur normally in IKK1–/– cells stimulated with HTLV-1 Tax. Nonetheless, NF-κB induced by Tax in these IKK1–/– cells is functionally impaired as evidenced by its failure to activate several different κB reporter constructs (Fig. 1, A and C).Reconstitution with Kinase-proficient (but Not Kinase-deficient) IKK1 Restores Tax Induction of Biologically Active NF-κB—To determine whether the defect in NF-κB transcriptional activity in IKK1–/– MEFs induced with Tax was due solely to the absence of IKK1, we reconstituted IKK1–/– cells with WT IKK1 or kinase-deficient IKK1-K44M vector DNA (Fig. 4A). In WT IKK1-reconstituted cells, the defect in Tax signaling was repaired in the κB reporter assay as well as in the resynthesis of the NF-κB target gene IκBα (Fig. 4B). In contrast, when IKK1–/– cells were reconstituted with kinase-deficient IKK1, no increase in κB-Luc activity or IκBα resynthesis was observed. Thus, the failure of NF-κB to mediate transcription in response to Tax in IKK1–/– cells relates specifically to the loss of IKK1 catalytic activity. In addition, reconstitution of IKK1–/– MEFs with WT (but not kinase-deficient) IKK1 enhanced the binding of NF-κB to its cognate enhancer probe in a gel shift experiment (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Reconstitution with kinase-proficient (but not kinase-deficient) IKK1 restores Tax-induced activation of biologically active NF-κB. A, IKK1–/– MEFs were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding either kinase-proficient IKK1 or kinase-deficient IKK1 alone or in combination with Tax. Cells were also transfected with both a κB-Luc reporter construct and a control Renilla luciferase plasmid. After 24 h, cells were lysed, and the relative amount of luciferase activity was detected using a 96-well luminometer. The results represent four replicate wells in six independent experiments. Error bars indicate S.E. B, WT and IKK1–/– MEFs were transfected with a kinase-proficient IKK1 expression plasmid alone or with Tax or were stimulated with TNF-α as indicated. After 24 h, cells were lysed, and the amount of IκBα protein resynthesized was quantified by immunoblotting. Ce"

Sixteen mammalian START domain-containing proteins have been identified to date. StAR, a protein targeted to mitochondria, stimulates the movement of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membranes, where it is metabolized into pregnenolone in steroidogenic cells. MLN64, the START domain protein most closely related to StAR, is localized to late endosomes along with other proteins involved in sterol trafficking, including NPC1 and NPC2, where it has been postulated to participate in sterol distribution to intracellular membranes. To investigate the role of MLN64 in sterol metabolism, we created mice with a targeted mutation in the Mln64 START domain, expecting to find a phenotype similar to that in humans and mice lacking NPC1 or NPC2 (progressive neurodegenerative symptoms, free cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes). Unexpectedly, mice homozygous for the Mln64 mutant allele were viable, neurologically intact, and fertile. No significant alterations in plasma lipid levels, liver lipid content and distribution, and expression of genes involved in sterol metabolism were observed, except for an increase in sterol ester storage in mutant mice fed a high fat diet. Embryonic fibroblast cells transfected with the cholesterol side-chain cleavage system and primary cultures of granulosa cells from Mln64 mutant mice showed defects in sterol trafficking as reflected in reduced conversion of endogenous cholesterol to steroid hormones.

Sixteen mammalian START domain proteins have been identified to date (2Soccio R.E. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22183-22186Google Scholar). Of these, StAR (StarD1) and MLN64 (StarD3) consist of one subfamily. MLN64 was originally discovered as a gene amplified in breast and ovarian cancers. It contains a C-terminal domain with 37% amino acid identity and 60% amino acid similarity to the C-terminal domain of StAR (13Moog-Lutz C. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Lutz Y. Muller D.

The N terminus of MLN64 contains a leader sequence and four putative transmembrane domains, distinguishing it from StAR and suggesting that MLN64 functions in a different subcellular compartment. The MLN64 START domain was subsequently found to have StAR-like activity in that it could promote steroidogenesis in a model cell system (14Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C.

Like the StAR START domain, the MLN64 START domain binds cholesterol, stimulates the movement of free cholesterol from sterol-rich donor vesicles to acceptor membranes, and augments steroid synthesis when added to isolated mitochondria (10Tsujishita Y.

The predicted topology of MLN64 in this compartment has the START domain facing the cytoplasm, being anchored to the vesicle wall by the four transmembrane domains, which positions the START domain to interact with apposing organelles or possibly other START domain proteins in the cytoplasm (16Alpy F.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4168-4175Google Scholar). The presence of a START domain protein in a subcellular compartment known to be involved in vesicular sterol trafficking by virtue of the presence of NPC1 and NPC2, raised the possibility that MLN64 participates in the intracellular distribution of sterols. This notion was supported by the finding that expression of a truncated MLN64 protein lacking the START domain coupled to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in COS-1 and Chinese hamster ovary cells caused accumulation of free cholesterol in lysosomes, mimicking the cellular sterol trafficking defect of Niemann-Pick type C disease (15Zhang M. Liu P. Dwyer N.K. Christenson L.K. Fujimoto T. Martinez F. Comly M. Hanover J.A. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33300-33310Google Scholar). It was proposed that the sterol trafficking abnormality was the result of a dominant negative action of the truncated MLN64-GFP fusion protein. The present studies were conducted to probe the function of the MLN64 START domain using a gene targeting strategy with the goal of identifying the physiological role of Mln64 in sterol dynamics in the mouse. Based on observations summarized above, it was anticipated that disruption of the Mln64 START domain would result in a phenotype similar to that of spontaneous mutations in the Npc1 gene in mice, including a progressive neurodegenerative disorder (ataxia, progressive motor deficits, and later death) and, at a cellular level, accumulation of free cholesterol in lysosomes (26Xie C. Turley S.D. Pentchev P.G. Dietschy J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E336-E344Google Scholar, 27Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F. Ohno K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Incardona J.P. Strauss III, J.F. Vanier M.T. Patterson M.C. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9627-9635Google Scholar). Humans lacking functional NPC1 or NPC2 have a similar phenotype. Here we show that, unexpectedly, mice lacking the Mln64 START domain are healthy and display only minimal disturbances in sterol dynamics, indicating that the Mln64 START domain is largely dispensable for intracellular cholesterol trafficking. We determined that the murine Mln64 protein is encoded by a gene containing 14 exons and spanning ∼9 kb (Fig. 1). We disrupted the START domain in the Mln64 gene in murine embryonic stem cells by replacing exons 10-13 (GenBank™ accession number AL591390) with the fusion gene βgeo, which consists of an internal ribosome entry site-lacZ-Neor fusion gene (28Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Google Scholar). This targeting construct removes the majority of the Mln64 START domain (from amino acid residues 267-380). Embryonic stem cells derived from 129/Sv mice were transfected with the linearized βgeo targeting vector, selected in medium supplemented with G-418, and analyzed by Southern blotting to identify correctly targeted clones. For Southern blotting, genomic DNA was digested with EcoRV, and the blots were probed with a 0.87-kb cDNA containing genomic sequence downstream from the targeted genomic sequence. Three correctly targeted embryonic stem cell clones were used to generate chimeric mice, which were crossed with C57BL/6J females to obtain heterozygous mutants. Mice used in these studies were the offspring of crosses between the F1 and/or F2 generations (129/SvJ/C57BL/6J genetic background). Mice were genotyped by PCR. Three set of primers were used in the PCR. One set of primers corresponded to a sequence in the Neo gene (5′-CACATCTGTAGAGGTTTTACTTGC-3′) and a sequence in exon 14 of the Mln64 gene (5′-CTACCTTGATTGAACCCCAGAAC-3′). Another set of primers corresponded to a sequence in the deleted region of exon 13 of the Mln64 gene (5′-GGGACTTTGTGAATGTCCGACG-3′) and the above noted primer for exon 14 of the Mln64 gene. The mice used in these experiments were maintained in a University Laboratory Animal Resource facility and all animal protocols were approved by the University of Pennsylvania's Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. To assess fertility and fecundity, littermate males (>6 weeks old) were placed in cages with two mature wild-type females for 1 month or more. Littermate females were caged with a wild-type male for a similar period. The number of mice achieving a pregnancy and the number of offspring from each mating set or pregnancy were recorded. Mice were fed ad libitum Purina Mouse Chow 5001 or one of three experimental diets (Teklad Research Diets) containing control diet (TD7001; Teklad), or 0.5% cholesterol-enriched diet (TD88137; Teklad) or 15.75% fat and 1.25% cholesterol (high fat) diet (TD90221; Teklad). The high fat diet (TD90221; Teklad) contained (by weight) 75% Purina Mouse Chow, 15.75% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate. Mice over 6 weeks of age were housed individually and fed the specified diet for 1 week before harvesting tissue and blood. Mice were weighed and anesthetized with isoflurane (Forane; Baxter), and a syringe was used to draw blood from the heart. The mice were then killed by cervical dislocation, and organs were harvested, weighed, and flash-frozen in dry ice. Serum was generated from the blood following coagulation. To assess ovarian steroidogenic function, six immature female mice (38-45 days old) were injected intraperitoneal with 5 IU of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (Calbiochem). After 44-48 h, all mice were injected with 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma). Mice were anesthetized, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. The mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the ovaries and uterus were removed, cleaned, and weighed. Cholesterol and triglyceride were quantified in serum and bile using cholesterol reagent and triglyceride reagent (2350 and TR22321, respectively (Thermo DMA). Liver tissue (1 g) was homogenized in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Aliquots of liver homogenate were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) at 4 °C, and the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen gas. Hepatic total and free cholesterol and triglyceride in the dried extract were quantified using cholesterol reagent, triglyceride reagent, and free cholesterol reagent (401-100P and TR22321, Thermo DMA; and 274-47109; Wako Chemicals, respectively). The level of cholesterol ester was calculated by subtracting the free cholesterol content from the total cholesterol content. Hepatic and bile phospholipids levels were quantified by a modification of the Bartlett procedure (29Bartlett E.M. Lewis D.H. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 36: 159-167Google Scholar). Serum nonesterified free fatty acid and glucose were quantified using enzymatic colorimetric assays (Wako Chemicals and Stanbio Laboratories, respectively). Testosterone, corticosterone, and progesterone were quantified using radioimmunoassay kits (TKTT1, TKRC1, and TKPG2, respectively; Diagnostic Products Corp.). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Real time PCR analysis was performed on an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system with target-specific probes and primers designed with Primer Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total RNA (5 μg) was treated with DNase I (Promega) followed by cDNA synthesis using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT) primer (Promega). The resulting cDNAs were diluted 1:10 in sterile water, and 1-μl aliquots were used in the quantitative real time PCR. The primers used to quantitate mRNA are listed in Table I. In order to account for differences in starting material, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers and probe reagents from Applied Biosystems were used as described by the manufacturer. In order to quantify differences, the samples were compared with standard curves for each gene and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the average value for the triplicate determinations was used in all subsequent calculations.Table IPrimers used to generate probes for Northern analysis and for quantitative real time PCRGeneForward primer sequenceReverse primer sequenceMln64 exons 1-95′-ACTGTCCCACAGCCAGAGCC-3′5′-CTCCTCTCGAACTTCCAGTTC-3′Mln64 exons 10-135′-GAGTATGGGGACACTGTGTAC-3′5′-CTGACATATTTGTGCGTGGG-3′Npc15′-CAATCCTGTGTTTGGTATGGAGAG-3′5′-ATCTACAGACTCATTGCAGCCTTTG-3′Npc25′-ATGCGTTTTCTGGCCGCCACGATC-3′5′-CTAGCTTGTGATCTGAACTGGGATC-3′StarD45′-ATGGCTGACCCTGAGAGCCCG-3′5′-TCATGCCTTGCGTAGACCTTTTCG-3′StarD55′-ATGGACCCGTCCTGGGCCACGCAAG-3′5′-TCAGTGATGGAACTTCCTCACTGCCTTC-3′Mentho5′-ATGAACCATCTTCCAGAACAC-3′5′-CCTCAGCTTCTTCTTCAGATC-3′Actin5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCAA-3′5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′Cyp7a15′-ACTCTCTGAAGCCATGATGCAA-3′5′-GACAGCGCTCTTTGATTTAGGAA-3′HMG-CoA synthase5′-GGGCCAAACGCTCCTCTAAT-3′5′-AGTCATAGGCATGCTGCATGTG-3′Abcg55′-GTGGCGGACCAAATGATTG-3′5′-TTGGGCTGCGATGGAAAC-3′Abcg85′-GAGCTGCCCGGGATGATA-3′5′-CCGGAAGTCATTGGAAATCTG-3′Map3k75′-TGCCATGAGCTGGTGTTTACAG-3′5′-AGCGCTTTGGGCTGCAT-3′ Open table in a new tab For Northern blot studies, the total RNA samples (50 μg/lane) were separated in 1.0% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Blots were subsequently hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes prepared by reverse transcriptase PCR using primers listed in Table I and wild-type mouse liver template. Hybridization was performed with Quikhyb (Stratagene). Membranes were exposed to X-AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Target Preparation and Hybridization—All protocols were conducted as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis technical manual. Briefly, 7 μg of total RNA was converted to first strand cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase primed by a poly(T) oligomer that incorporated the T7 promoter. Second strand cDNA synthesis was followed by in vitro transcription for linear amplification of each transcript and incorporation of biotinylated CTP and UTP. The cRNA products were fragmented to 200 nucleotides or less, heated at 99 °C for 5 min, and hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C to mouse MOE 430A Affymetrix microarrays. The microarrays were then washed at low (6× SSPE) and high (100 mm MES, 0.1 m NaCl) stringency and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Fluorescence was amplified by adding biotinylated anti-streptavidin and an additional aliquot of streptavidin-phycoerythrin stain. A confocal scanner was used to collect fluorescence signal at 3-μm resolution after excitation at 570 nm. The average signal from two sequential scans was calculated for each microarray feature. Initial Data Analysis—Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 was used to quantitate expression levels for targeted genes; default values provided by Affymetrix were applied to all analysis parameters. Border pixels were removed, and the average intensity of pixels within the 75th percentile was computed for each probe. The average of the lowest 2% of probe intensities occurring in each of 16 microarray sectors was set as background and subtracted from all features in that sector. Probe pairs were scored positive or negative for detection of the targeted sequence by comparing signals from the perfect match and mismatch probe features. The number of probe pairs meeting the default discrimination threshold (τ = 0.015) was used to assign a call of absent, present, or marginal for each assayed gene, and a p value was calculated to reflect confidence in the detection call. A weighted mean of probe fluorescence (corrected for nonspecific signal by subtracting the mismatch probe value) was calculated using the one-step Tukey's biweight estimate. This signal value, a relative measure of the expression level, was computed for each assayed gene. Global scaling was applied to allow comparison of gene signals across multiple microarrays; after exclusion of the highest and lowest 2%, the average total chip signal was calculated and used to determine what scaling factor was required to adjust the chip average to an arbitrary target of 150. All signal values from one microarray were then multiplied by the appropriate scaling factor (Genespring version 6.1 (Silicon Genetics Software)). Equal amounts of liver protein (50 μg/lane) were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). Western blot analysis was carried out using a rabbit anti-recMLN64 N-terminal (amino acid residues 1-52) and anti-C-terminal MLN64 antibodies recognizing either the START domain (amino acids 216-440) or a peptide in the START domain (amino acid residues 370-385) as previously described (14Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M.C. Baker M.E. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8462-8467Google Scholar, 15Zhang M. Liu P. Dwyer N.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33300-33310Google Scholar) For the detection of antibody protein complexes, the SuperSignal West Pico or Femto Kit (Pierce) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from embryonic day 14.5 embryos from the mated Mln64-/+ littermates (30George E.L. Hynes R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 386-420Google Scholar). DNA extracted from embryos was genotyped by PCR and Southern blot using standard techniques to identify wild-type and homozygous mutants. Mouse granulosa cells were collected from periovulatory follicles from mature female mice given a follicular stimulation protocol. Three wild type and three nullizygous female mice were injected intraperitoneal with 5 IU of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (Calbiochem). After 44-48 h, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the ovaries were carefully dissected away and placed into 4 °C Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). To release the granulosa cells from the follicles, the ovaries were repeatedly punctured with a 30-gauge needle. The expressed granulosa cells and minor contaminants (i.e. oocytes, red blood cells, and stromal cells) were collected and centrifuged at 770 × g to pellet the cells in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg of penicillin-streptomycin/ml in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Dishes were coated with fibronectin from human plasma (Sigma) for at least 30 min prior to plating. Cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well in 12-well plates on day 0. On day 1, after washing with PBS, medium was changed to Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg of penicillin-streptomycin/ml without or with 5 μg/ml 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 1 mm 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP), or ethanol (added in the same volume as for 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol). Each treatment group consisted of triplicate wells. After 24 h, medium was collected and frozen at -20 °C until progesterone was assayed. Cells were scraped into ice-cold buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagents. These experiments were conducted on three separate occasions. Progesterone secretion in the basal and 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated conditions was normalized to steroidogenic potential of the cells using progesterone production in the presence of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. Mouse livers were perfusion fixed through the heart with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS from homozygous mutant Mln64 mice and wild-type mice. The livers were removed and immersed in the same fixative for an additional 2 days at 4 °C. Following perfusion fixation, 10-μm frozen sections were cut from the whole left, right, and medial lobes of each liver. The sections were stained with Nile Red (0.1 μg/ml PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and mounted in 90% glycerol in PBS containing 1 mg/ml n-propyl gallate as an antifade agent. Images were taken on a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope equipped with a Melles Griot Omnichrome krypton argon laser using a 488-nm excitation line and 515-540 band pass emission filter. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out on thin sections of liver as previously described (31Matsuo H. Strauss III, J.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1135-1145Google Scholar) Brain tissue was stained with filipin and an anti-GM3 ganglioside antibody as described by Zervas et al. (32Zervas M. Dobrenis K. Walkley S.U. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 49-64Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were grown on Nunc LabTek two-chambered glass slides. They were fixed at room temperature for 30 min in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, washed 3 × 5 min in PBS, and stained with Nile Red, mounted, and visualized as described above for liver sections. Cells were grown and fixed as above and stained overnight in 50 μg/ml filipin in PBS, washed three times for 5 min each in PBS, and mounted as for the liver sections. They were imaged on a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope equipped with a Coherent Enterprise argon laser using a 364-nm excitation line and 400-435 band pass emission filter.

https://openalex.org/W1996962180,"Resident tissue macrophages mediate early innate immune responses to microbial infection. Cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) is activated in macrophages during phagocytosis of non-opsonized yeast (zymosan) triggering arachidonic acid release and eicosanoid production. cPLA2α translocates from cytosol to membrane in response to intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) increases. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-cPLA2α translocated to forming phagosomes, surrounding the zymosan particle by 5 min and completely overlapping with early endosome (Rab5) and plasma membrane (F4/80) markers but only partially overlapping with resident endoplasmic reticulum proteins (GRP78 and cyclooxygenase 2). EGFP-cPLA2α also localized to membrane ruffles during phagocytosis. Zymosan induced an initial high amplitude calcium transient that preceded particle uptake followed by a low amplitude sustained calcium increase. Both phases were required for optimal phagocytosis. Extracellular calcium chelation prevented only the sustained phase but allowed a limited number of phagocytic events, which were accompanied by translocation of cPLA2α to the phagosome although [Ca2+]i remained at resting levels. The results demonstrate that cPLA2α targets the phagosome membrane, which may serve as a source of arachidonic acid for eicosanoid production."

They mediate much of the negative inotropic effect of acetylcholine (ACh) acting via the m2 muscarinic receptor (m2R) in the heart (3Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E.

They also play important roles in neuronal regulations of behavior and in mediation of GPCR- and alcohol-induced analgesia (6Ikeda K. Kobayashi T. Kumanishi T. Yano R. Sora I. Niki H. Neurosci.

GIRK1/2 heterotetramers, abundant in the brain, and GIRK1/4, prevailing in the heart, display a GIRK12GIRKx2 stoichiometry.

Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Gβγ binds to sites located in the N and C termini of each GIRK subunit and triggers channel opening by an unknown mechanism (11Bichet D. Haass F.A. Jan L.Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The role of Gα subunits in GIRK signaling has been controversial for many years (reviewed in Ref. 10Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), but it is now becoming clear that Gα subunits are not mere donors of Gβγ for GIRK activation. They physically interact with GIRK, and it has been proposed that they contribute to channel function in several ways: determining the specificity of activation by neurotransmitters, anchoring the Gβγ subunits to GIRK to ensure fast and specific activation (12Huang C.L.

Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The latter seems to involve GαGDP rather than GαGTP. In Xenopus oocytes, expression of Gαi3 reduces an excessively high basal activity of overexpressed GIRK channels and enhances agonist-induced activation. In excised patches, coexpressed Gαi3 enhanced GIRK activation caused by added Gβγ protein. This suggested that Gαi3 (probably in its GDP-bound form) not only sequesters free Gβγ and donates it upon agonist activation, but also predisposes (primes) the channels to Gβγ activation (14Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the priming effect is also produced by Gα subunits other than Gαi3.The role of Gα in the specificity of signaling from GPCR to GIRK is widely accepted (15Dascal N. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms are unclear. GIRK is similarly activated by all Gβγ tested (16Wickman K.D. Iniguez-Lluhl J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E.

(Online). 2000; 20: RC59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that selectivity of coupling is determined by Gβγ; Gα subunits must play a role. In cardiac and neuronal cells only pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, Gαi/o, activate GIRK (10Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Selectivity is observed even within the Gi/o family: in atrial and certain neuroendocrine and neuronal cells, upon activation of a variety of GPCRs, Gαi2 and Gαi3 rather than Gαi1 and Gαo appear to be the preferred donors of Gβγ for GIRK (see “Discussion”). The molecular mechanisms determining the specific activation of GIRK only by certain G proteins remain unknown.In contrast to the normal physiological situation, in heterologous expression systems (Xenopus oocytes, Chinese hamster ovary and human embryonic kidney cells) GIRK can be activated by Gβγ released from a variety of G protein heterotrimers. Any Gαi/o (14Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J.

Even Gαs can donate Gβγ to activate GIRK in heterologous expression systems or in native cardiomyocytes if various components of the signaling pathway (β-adrenergic receptors, Gαs, or Gβγ) are overexpressed (24Lim N.F. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25Sorota S. Rybina I. Yamamoto A. Du X.Y. J. Physiol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37347-37354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Of all Gα tested, only Gαq is unable to donate Gβγ in expression systems; activation of Gq by the relevant GPCRs inhibits GIRK, apparently via indirect pathways that involve second messengers (27Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).How, then, is the selective activation of GIRK via Gi/o in native cardiac and neuronal cells ensured? Evidently, selective coupling between GPCRs and Gαβγ heterotrimers contributes to the specificity of signaling to GIRK by neurotransmitters (20Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Robillard L. Ethier N. Lachance M. Hebert T.E. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but this cannot explain the selectivity at the G protein-GIRK interface (e.g. why Gq does not activate GIRK). Thus, factors such as colocalization or scaffolding may be involved in assigning the relevant Gα to GIRK. It has been proposed that pre-formed complexes of GIRK with certain Gαβγ heterotrimers may exist in native cells, assuring fast and selective activation of GIRK by Gβγ derived from the GIRK-anchored heterotrimer (12Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 13Slesinger P.A. Reuveny E. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Supportive evidence is that Gαi1 and Gαi3 bind to the N terminus and mutations in N terminus reduce the speed of activation of GIRK by agonists of GIRK1 (12Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 14Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N.

However, this attractive hypothesis has not been conclusively confirmed.Fundamental questions regarding the proposed complexes of GIRK with regulatory proteins remain open: whether GIRK subunits besides GIRK1 bind Gαi; whether additional Gα-binding segments besides N terminus exist in GIRK; whether other Gα subunits besides Gαi1 and Gαi3 bind to GIRK; and whether differences in binding of various Gα subunits to GIRK contribute to signaling specificity and gating. To start to address these problems, we compared Gαi3 and Gαi1 subunits, which showed striking differences in their binding to GIRK in a preliminary comparative assay, for their ability to directly interact with the channel molecule and for their ability to regulate the physiological parameters of channel function. We identified and mapped Gαi3 binding sites in N- and C-terminal parts of GIRK1 and GIRK2 subunits and then performed a comparative study of binding and physiological effects of Gαi3 and Gαi1. We found that Gαi3 was a much better binding partner for GIRK1 and GIRK2 (at all binding sites) and a better physiological companion for Gβγ in GIRK activation. The correlation between binding and function of these two Gα subunits supports a role for physical interaction between GαGDP and GIRK in determining selective regulation of GIRK by different Gα subunits.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaintenance and operation of Xenopus laevis frogs, preparation and injection of RNA, and two-electrode voltage and patch clamp procedures have been performed as described previously (14Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were incubated at 20–22 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Data acquisition and analysis were done using the Axotape and the pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments). All experiments were done at 20–22 °C. Whole cell GIRK currents were measured using two-electrode voltage clamp at –80 mV in a high K+ solution containing 24 mm KCl, 72 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.5). In patch clamp experiments, currents were recorded at –80 mV, filtered at 2 kHz, and sampled at 5 kHz. Pipette solution contained, in mm: 144 KCl, 2 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 1 GdCl3, 10 Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5. Bath solution contained, in millimolar: 130 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 10 Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5. Stock solution of the purified recombinant Gβγ (40 μm) was diluted into 50 μl of the bath solution, added to the 500-μl solution in the bath, and stirred.The cDNAs, mRNAs, GST fusion proteins, and total oocyte membrane fraction were prepared as described in our previous publications (14Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Ivanina T. Rishal I. Varon D. Mullner C.

Two buffers were used in pull-down experiments: phosphate-buffered saline or a 150 mm-K+ buffer (in mm: 50 Tris, 5 MgCl2, 1 EDTA, 150 KCl, pH 7.5). Identical binding patterns were seen in both buffers. [35S]Methionine-labeled Gα proteins were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate for 1.5–2 h, then 2–5 μl of lysate were incubated with 100 μm of either GDP or GTPγS for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 or 95 μl of binding buffer with the detergent of choice, 0.05% Tween 20 or 0.5% CHAPS. To measure Gα binding to GST fusion proteins, 5–10 μg of the GST fusion protein were added, the total reaction volume brought to 300 or 500 μl, and the incubation continued in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS or GDP for 1–2 h at room temperature, and binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads and elution with 15 mm glutathione were done as described previously (14Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were run on 10% or 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels (SDS-PAGE). The radioactive signals from protein bands of the gels were imaged and quantitated using PhosphorImager and the software ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics). The readings were corrected for the differences in the amounts of GST fusion proteins eluted from the beads as measured from Coomassie Blue-stained gels (in most cases such differences did not exceed 50%). The full-length N terminus of GIRK1, G11–84, bound Gαi3 as well as its distal part, G134–86 (data not shown), and the results obtained with these two proteins were pooled. For trypsin digestion, 1 μl of 0.25% stock of trypsin was diluted ×100 and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 30 μl of 150 mm-K+ buffer with 0.5% CHAPS containing 2 μlofGα lysate, treated with GTPγS or GDP as described above. Western blots were done using standard procedures, using a common Gαi antibody (Calbiochem) and ECL reagents from Pierce Inc. Intensity of Coomassie Blue labeling was quantified using TINA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).Results are shown as mean ± S.E.; numbers of cells, patches, or separate biochemical determinations are shown above the bars in the figures. Multiple group comparison was done using one-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls or Tukey's tests. One or two asterisks indicate p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively, compared with control group. Values of t90% parameters in Gαi1- and Gαi3-expressing groups, which report measurements independent of the control group, were compared by t test.RESULTSWe explored the binding of Gαi3 to GST-fused fragments of cytoplasmic N and C termini of GIRK1, using a standard pull-down method (Fig. 1B). The GST fusion proteins were immobilized of glutathione-agarose affinity beads. [35S]Methionine-labeled Gαi3 was synthesized in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, as it was done previously to study the interaction of Gαi3 with the N terminus of GIRK1 (14Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In vitro synthesized Gβγ has also been successfully utilized to identify Gβγ binding sites of voltage-gated Ca2+ and GIRK channels (32Ivanina T. Rishal I. Varon D. Mullner C. Frohnwieser-Steinecke B.

Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The binding experiments were routinely conducted in buffers containing 0.5% CHAPS, which minimized nonspecific binding of Gαi3 to GST. All initial screening and mapping experiments reported in Figs. 1 and 2 were performed with GDP-bound Gαi3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). In each experiment the amount of bound Gα protein was measured from autoradiograms using a PhosphorImager and normalized to the amount of the bound G1–C3 segment, which was present in all experiments (Fig. 1C). We stress that this methodology gives a highly sensitive and accurate quantitation of bound protein, because the radioactive signal from labeled Gα is measured from dried gels by using the PhosphorImager directly, in an almost unlimited linear range, and with high precision. In comparison, in Western blotting, several additional intermediate steps are involved, which reduce the accuracy of measurement.Fig. 2Binding of Gαi3-GDP to GST-fused fragments of GIRK2.

We then examined the binding of Gαi3-GDP to the whole C terminus and to six non-overlapping GST-fused fragments of C terminus, G1–C1 through G1–C6 (Fig. 1B), previously used to map the Gβγ binding sites (32Ivanina T. Rishal I. Varon D. Mullner C. Frohnwieser-Steinecke B. Schreibmayer W. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29174-29183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that three fragments covering all of the proximal part of C terminus of GIRK1, G1–C1 through G1–C3, bound Gαi3-GDP; G1–C3 showed the strongest binding (summarized in Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the whole C terminus (G1183–501) bound Gαi3 far weaker than G1–C3. It is possible that the complete C terminus is folded in such a way that the distal part beyond aa 380 (which was proposed to play a role of a “switch” that regulates the activation of the channel in protein kinase A-dependent manner (34Medina I.

The strongest binding of Gαi3-GDP was observed in the large segment G2–C2, aa 310–414, and in its smaller subdivision G2–C1–2 (aa 310–380) (Fig. 2C; summarized in Fig. 2D). This segment mostly overlaps G1–C3 of GIRK1 except the first 20 aa (Fig. 2B, part b). The first half of the N terminus did not bind Gαi3, whereas the second half bound Gαi3-GDP, although apparently somewhat weaker than G2–C2–1. The absence of Gαi3 binding to G2–C1–2, which lacks 20 C-terminal aa compared with the homologous G1–C2 that binds Gαi3 well, hints that this 20-aa stretch contains an important binding determinant for Gαi3.Incubation of in vitro synthesized Gαi3 with GTPγS protected Gαi3 from trypsin digestion, as expected for a GTPγS-bound Gα (37Fung B.K. Nash C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). This result confirms GTPγS binding and the consequent change in Gα conformation and attests to functional integrity of in vitro synthesized Gαi3 protein. Under mild non-ionic detergent conditions (0.05% Tween 20), the extents of binding of Gαi3-GDP and Gαi3-GTPγS to the N terminus of GIRK1 were comparable (Ref. 14Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and data not shown). However, under the standard conditions used in most experiments, with 0.5% CHAPS, the binding of Gαi3-GTPγS was weaker than that of Gαi3-GDP (Fig. 3C). The same was observed with the C-terminal G1–C3 segment (Fig. 3, B and C). The summary in Fig. 3C shows that, in 0.5% CHAPS, the binding of Gαi3-GTPγS to all Gα-binding fusion segments of GIRK1 and GIRK2 was only about a third of that of Gαi3-GDP (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3Differences in binding of Gαi3-GDP and Gαi3-GTPγS to GST-fused fragments of GIRK1 and GIRK2.

Rishal I. Varon D. Mullner C. Frohnwieser-Steinecke B. Schreibmayer W. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29174-29183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that GαGDP binds to GIRK indirectly, via Gβγ present in the reticulocyte lysate, we performed two types of control experiments. First, we verified that binding of Gαi3 to different segments was not increased by the addition to the reaction mixture of various amounts of untreated reticulocyte lysate, suggesting that the binding of Gαi3-GDP to GIRK was not via an endogenous protein present in the lysate (data not shown). Second, addition of lysate containing in vitro synthesized Gβ1γ2 did not increase the binding of Gαi3-GDP to G11–84 and G1–C1 (data not shown). Two additional facts argue against involvement of Gβγ in mediating Gαi3 binding to GIRK: 1) the binding preference for Gβγ in the C terminus of GIRK1 (G1–C1 > G1–C2 > G1–C3; see Ref. 32Ivanina T. Rishal I. Varon D. Mullner C. Frohnwieser-Steinecke B. Schreibmayer W. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29174-29183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) is opposite to that of Gαi3 and 2) Gαi1-GDP does not bind to G1–C3 (see below), despite the very high affinity of binding of Gαi1-GDP to Gβγ (38Sarvazyan N.A. Lim W.K. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12858-12867Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We conclude that, under our experimental conditions, Gαi3 binds directly to GST-fused segments of GIRK1.Preliminary screening of several Gα subunits indicated weak binding of Gαi1-GDP to fusion proteins of GIRK1. We thus focused on the comparison of Gαi3 and Gαi1. Functional integrity of Gαi1 was verified by the trypsin digestion test (data not shown). For each GST fusion protein, the binding reaction was performed with equal volumes of reticulocyte lysate containing the labeled Gα subunits, and the amount of bound Gα was normalized to the amount of Gα added to the reaction in the beginning (“input”). Figs. 4 (A and B) show examples of individual experiments, and Fig. 4C summarizes the results of all experiments with all GST fusion segments, showing the binding of Gαi1 relative to Gαi3. In all segments of GIRK1 tested, the binding of Gαi1-GDP was consistently weaker than that of Gαi3-GDP (Fig. 4, A and C), and the binding of Gαi1-GTPγS was too weak to be reliably quantitated (data not shown). Some Gαi1 binding was observed in the N terminus, confirming a previous finding (12Huang C.L."
https://openalex.org/W2093457400,"The activation of factor X by VIIa/TF and the Xa-dependent inhibition of the enzyme complex by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) are considered primary steps in the initiation of coagulation. IX activation by VIIa/TF is considered to contribute catalyst necessary for further Xa production in the ensuing amplification phase. We have investigated Xa and IXaβ production by VIIa-TF in a system reconstituted with both X and IX and the principal physiologic inhibitors of this pathway TFPI and antithrombin III (AT). Kinetic studies without inhibitors established that IX and X functioned as competitive alternate substrates for VIIa/TF with similar kinetic constants. When both IX and X were present, TFPI significantly inhibited the extent of formation of either IXaβ or Xa. In contrast, AT rapidly depleted active Xa with a small effect on IXaβ formation. When both AT and TFPI were present, active IXaβ formation significantly exceeded the formation of active Xa regardless of the VIIa/TF concentration. These findings could be quantitatively accounted for by a model encompassing the kinetics of the individual activation and inhibition steps. Active Xa formation by this pathway is regulated in a principal way by its rapid inactivation by AT. In contrast, the Xa-dependent inhibitory reactions of TFPI play a primary role in limiting zymogen consumption and the formation of active IXaβ. These regulatory phenomena yield active IXaβ as a major rather than secondary product of VIIa/TF. Our findings raise the possibility that IXaβ produced by the extrinsic pathway, and its ability to function within the intrinsic Xase complex to activate X may play a significant role in producing Xa necessary for both the initiation and sustained phases of the procoagulant response following vascular damage."
https://openalex.org/W2041287064,"We showed previously that Gβγ interacts with Receptor for Activated CKinase 1 (RACK1), a protein that not only binds activated protein kinase C (PKC) but also serves as an adaptor/scaffold for many signaling pathways. Here we report that RACK1 does not interact with Gα subunits or heterotrimeric G proteins but binds free Gβγ subunits released from activated heterotrimeric G proteins following the activation of their cognate receptors in vivo. The association with Gβγ promotes the translocation of RACK1 from the cytosol to the membrane. Moreover, binding of RACK1 to Gβγ results in inhibition of Gβγ-mediated activation of phospholipase C β2 and adenylyl cyclase II. However, RACK1 has no effect on other functions of Gβγ, such as activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway or chemotaxis of HEK293 cells via the chemokine receptor CXCR2. Similarly, RACK1 does not affect signal transduction through the Gα subunits of Gi, Gs, or Gq. Collectively, these findings suggest a role of RACK1 in regulating specific functions of Gβγ.

Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce extracellular signals from a large family of G protein-coupled receptors and mediate intracellular responses critical for many cellular processes, such as vision, taste, metabolism, and neuronal and cardiovascular functions (1Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). G proteins consist of three subunits, α, β, and γ. The signaling function of G proteins was once attributed totally to the Gα subunit. The Gβγ subunit was considered merely a membrane anchor and a negative regulator of the Gα. However, it is now clear that it itself plays a prominent role in signal transduction. Gβγ has a long list of effector and interacting proteins and has been shown to play a dominant role in certain cellular functions. For example, in yeast, Gβγ is the principal transducer of the mating signal for cell cycle arrest and differentiation (2Whiteway M.S. Wu C. Leeuw T. Clark K. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E.

Recently, Gβγ has also been implicated in smooth muscle cell proliferation and arterial restenosis (7Iaccarino G. Koch W.J. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 257-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The diversity of Gβγ target proteins raises the question of how the specificity and efficiency of Gβγ signaling are regulated. Several Gβγ-interacting proteins have been shown to regulate its function. For example, phosducin and phosducin-like proteins (PhLPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PhLP, phosducin-like protein; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; AC, adenylyl cyclase; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate); GST, glutathione S-transferase; IP, inositol phosphate; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PLC, phospholipase C; RACK1, receptor for activated C kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; AR, adrenergic receptor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; IL-8, interleukin-8. bind Gβγ with high affinities and are regarded as scavengers of Gβγ (8Schulz R. Pharmacol. Res. 2001; 43: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Binding of these proteins to Gβγ limits the amount of Gβγ available to interact with Gα and to form functional G protein heterotrimers, resulting in inhibition of signal transmission from receptors to G proteins (9Bauer P.H.

Moreover, they block the activation of effectors by Gβγ, because their binding sites on Gβγ overlap with the contact residues for Gβγ effectors (11McLaughlin J.N. Thulin C.D. Bray S.M. Martin M.M.

Some Gβγ effectors, such as G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) 2 and 3, could also exert regulatory roles in Gβγ signaling, because binding of these proteins impede the access of other effectors to Gβγ (13Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Touhara K. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Notably, these Gβγ-interacting proteins appear to affect various functions of Gβγ. However, whether they could modulate the signaling specificity of Gβγ remains unknown. Recently, through the use of a yeast two-hybrid screen, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation studies, we identified a new Gβγ-binding protein, RACK1 (14Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49888-49895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RACK1 is a WD40 repeat protein that is proposed to form a seven-bladed β propeller, similar to that formed by Gβ (15Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Although originally identified as a receptor for binding and translocating activated PKC to particular cell fractions, subsequent studies indicate that it can also act as an adaptor/scaffold protein to recruit or assemble many other signaling proteins into membrane-associated complexes (15Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We showed previously that RACK1 interacts not only with the Gβ1γ1 subunit but also heterotrimeric Gαtβ1γ1 (14Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49888-49895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, Gβ1γ1 competes with several RACK1-interacting proteins such as PKCβII and dynamin-1 for binding to RACK1 (14Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49888-49895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance for the interaction between RACK1 and Gβγ on G protein signaling remains unknown. In this study, we provide evidence that RACK1 interacts only with free Gβγ subunits released from activated heterotrimeric G proteins in cells. Moreover, we show that the binding of Gβγ to RACK1 results in the translocation of RACK1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, and the association of RACK1 with Gβγ specifically inhibits Gβγ subunit- but not Gα subunit-mediated signal transduction. Particularly, only a subset of Gβγ functions is affected by RACK1. To our knowledge, this is the first protein identified to be able to regulate specific functions of Gβγ. Materials—Cyclic AMP assay kits were from R&D systems, myo-[3H]inositol (80 Ci/mmol) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (5.5 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. AG1-X8 (100-200 mesh, formate form) was from Bio-Rad. Mouse anti-RACK1 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories, mouse anti-V5 from Invitrogen, rabbit anti-Gβ (T20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and p42/44 MAPK and phospho-p42/44 MAPK antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen, amylose resin from New England Biolabs, and glutathione-Sepharose from Amersham Biosciences. Other chemicals were of the highest grade available commercially. Purification of Gβ1γ1 and Gβ1γ2—Gβ1γ1 was purified from bovine retina as described (16Mazzoni M.R. Malinski J.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14072-14081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gβ1γ2 was expressed in Sf9 cells by infection with baculovirus encoding His6-Gγ2 and Gβ1, and purified to near homogeneity using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described previously (17Ford C.E.

Purification of Other Proteins—Maltose-binding protein (MBP), MBP-RACK1, and Gαs short isoform were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified as described (14Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S.

Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Vectors and DNA Constructs—The hamster α1B-, α2A-, and β2-AR cDNAs in pMT2, and GαqQ209L in pCMV were kindly provided by Dr. Robert M. Graham (Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Australia). To construct the eukaryotic expression vector for expression of RACK1 with the GST epitope at the N terminus or V5 epitope and His6 tag at the C terminus, RACK1 was first amplified by PCR and ligated into the pENTR/SD/D-TOPO entry vector using a GATEWAY cloning system (Invitrogen). Homologous recombination reactions were then conducted to transfer RACK1 cDNA from the entry vector into the expression vectors, pDEST27 containing the N-terminal GST epitope and pcDNA3-DEST40 containing the C-terminal V5 epitope and His6 tag (Invitrogen). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 and HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured and transiently transfected with the indicated constructs using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), as described previously (19Chen S. Lin F. Xu M. Riek R.P. Novotny J. Graham R.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6045-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48-60 h post-transfection. GST Binding Assays in Vivo—To determine the association of RACK1 with G proteins in cells, GST fusion RACK1 was used, because it expressed at a much higher level than other RACK1 tagged with other epitopes. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with receptors and G proteins, together with GST or GST-RACK1 as described above. After serum-starvation overnight and agonist stimulation, cells were incubated with the cross-linking reagent dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) (2 mm) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min at room temperature and then lysed in Tris buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors. GST-RACK1 was precipitated from the cell lysates using 100 μl of 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the protein complex was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis (14Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49888-49895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Sixty hours post transfection, COS-7 cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. After staining with a monoclonal antibody against RACK1 or the V5 epitope (1:100 dilution), a secondary Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) was applied at 1:100 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescence was analyzed using a LSM510 confocal scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) with an argon/krypton laser and a Plan Apo 63 × 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion lens. YFP and Alexa-568 were excited at 488 and 568 nm and monitored with 515-540 nm and 590-610 nm band-pass filters, respectively. Specificity of labeling and absence of signal crossover were established by examination of single-labeled samples. Binding of RACK1 to Lipid Vesicles—Lipid vesicles were prepared by drying a mixture of lipids (1.7 mg/ml) containing 95% phosphatidylcholine and 5% phosphatidylinositol under an N2 stream (20Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The lipids were then resuspended in PBS containing protease inhibitors and sonicated in a water bath sonicator for 20 min at room temperature. 10 pmol of MBP or MBP-RACK1 was then added to the lipid vesicles (30 μl) in the absence or presence of Gβγ (10 pmol). After incubation on ice for 1 h, lipid vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with PBS. Proteins in the supernatant and the pellet were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunoblotting—To determine the expression of GST-RACK1 in COS-7 cells, cell lysates were prepared from the transfected cells, and 100 μg of protein was used for the detection of RACK1 using a monoclonal antibody (14Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49888-49895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol Hydrolysis in Intact Cells—Phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis in intact, transfected COS-7 cells was determined as described previously (21Chen S. Lin F. Iismaa S. Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32385-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Chen S. Lin F. Xu M. Hwa J. Graham R.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4265-4271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of pertussis toxin on PI hydrolysis, cells were preincubated with pertussis toxin (0.5 μg/ml) overnight before PI measurement. Measurement of PLCβ2 Activity—The Gβγ-mediated PLCβ2 activation was determined essentially as described (17Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), except that purified Gβ1γ2 from Sf9 cells instead of Sf9 cell lysates was used in the assay. To determine the effect of RACK1, MBP-RACK1 was preincubated with Gβγ for 30 min before the addition of PLCβ2 and lipid vesicles. AC Assays—The Gβγ-mediated ACII activation was determined using cell membranes prepared from ACII baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described, except that GTPγS-bound wild-type Gαs instead of the constitutively active mutant Gαs (Q227L) was used (17Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of RACK1, MBP-RACK1 was preincubated with Gβγ for 30 min before addition into the reaction. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.1 m HCl. cAMP levels were determined using the cAMP immunoassay system (R & D Systems) for nonacetylated cAMP according to the manufacturer's instructions. MAPK Activity—HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the α2A-AR, GST, GST-RACK1, or Gαt DNAs as described above were stimulated with (-)-epinephrine in the presence of 10 μm dl-propranolol for 5 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were then prepared and used for detection of MAPK activity by Western blotting (23Wang D. Sai J. Carter G. Sachpatzidis A. Lolis E. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7100-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis Assays—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with CXCR2 and GST, GST-RACK1, or Gαt cDNAs as described above. Chemotaxis assays were performed in 96-well Boyden chambers (23Wang D. Sai J. Carter G. Sachpatzidis A. Lolis E. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7100-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cyclic AMP in Intact Cells—HEK293 cells stably transfected with CXCR2 chemokine receptor were used in this assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection with GST, GST-RACK1, or RACK1-V5-His, HEK293 cells were incubated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in serum-free medium overnight. To determine the endogenous β2-AR-mediated cAMP accumulation, cells were preincubated with 250 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 20 min before the addition of (-)-isoproterenol (22Chen S. Lin F. Xu M. Hwa J. Graham R.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4265-4271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For CXCR2-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation, cells were pretreated with 250 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 20 nm interleukin 8 (IL-8) for 20 min before the addition of 10 μm forskolin. The reaction was terminated after 20 min by removal of the medium and addition of 0.1 m HCl. cAMP levels were determined using the cAMP immunoassay system described above. Data Analysis—Data were representative of at least three independent experiments. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Student's t tests were used to determine significant differences (two-tail p < 0.05). Interaction of RACK1 with G Proteins in Vivo—We showed previously that RACK1 not only binds purified retinal Gβ1γ1 but also Gαtβ1γ1 in vitro (14Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49888-49895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To determine if these observations could be extended to other G protein subunits in vivo, we co-expressed Gβ1γ2 with GST or GST-RACK1 in COS-7 cells, and precipitated it from cell lysates using glutathione-Sepharose. As shown in Fig. 1A, Gβ was detected in the precipitate containing GST-RACK1, but not GST, indicating a specific association of RACK1 with Gβγ. Intriguingly, when Gβγ was co-expressed with Gα subunits, Gαi-2, Gαq, or Gαs, binding of Gβγ to RACK1 was significantly inhibited (Fig. 1, B-D). Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that the co-expressed Gα subunits form heterotrimers with Gβγ (data not shown). This suggests that heterotrimeric G proteins do not bind or have lower binding affinity to RACK1. In support of this contention, when heterotrimeric G protein were activated to release Gβγ subunits by co-expressed receptors, the α2A-, α1B-, and β2-ARs, respectively, the association of Gβγ with GST-RACK1 was restored (Fig. 1, B-D). However, no binding of Gα subunits to RACK1 was detected despite their significant expression in cell lysates (Fig. 1, B-D). These results indicate that RACK1 binds only the free Gβγ subunit but not the heterotrimeric G protein nor the Gα subunit in vivo. Gβγ Targets RACK1 to Cell Membranes—We next examined if interaction with Gβγ alters the cellular distribution of RACK1. As shown in Fig. 2A (panels a and b), in the absence of overexpressed Gβ1, endogenous RACK1 and RACK1-V5-His were evenly distributed in the cytosol of COS-7 cells. In contrast, a majority of YFP-Gβ1γ2 expressed in COS-7 cells was located in the cell membranes, although a small fraction was also detected in the cytosol (Fig. 2A, panel c). When YFP-Gβ1γ2 was co-expressed with RACK1-V5-His, the cellular distribution of YFP-Gβ1γ2 was not significantly altered (Fig. 2A, panels c-e). However, it resulted in a punctate distribution of RACK1-V5-His both in the cell membranes and in the cytosol where it co-localized with YFP-Gβ1 (Fig. 2A, panels c-e). These results suggest that Gβγ may target RACK1 to the cell membranes. To confirm these findings, we further assessed the effect of Gβγ on the association of an MBP-RACK1 fusion protein with lipid vesicles in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2B, after incubation with the lipid vesicles followed by centrifugation to separate the bound from the free MBP-RACK1, MBP-RACK1 was found in both the supernatant (45%) and the lipid membrane (55%). The association of MBP-RACK1 with the lipid membrane is most likely due to MBP, because MBP alone was predominantly associated with the lipid (75% in the lipid membranes). Notably, the addition of either Gβ1γ1 or Gβ1γ2 to the lipid vesicles significantly enhanced the association of MBP-RACK1 with the lipid (70 and 80% for β1γ1 and β1γ2, respectively), although it has little effect on MBP alone (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these findings suggest that the physical interaction between Gβγ and RACK1 facilitates the translocation of RACK1 from the cytosol to the membrane. RACK1 Inhibits Specific Gβγ Functions—Because RACK1 binds to Gβγ in cell membranes where the interaction of Gβγ with effectors occurs, we questioned if RACK1 could affect the ability of Gβγ to activate effectors such as PLCβ2. As shown in Fig. 3A, co-expression of Gβ1γ2 with PLCβ2 in COS-7 cells resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation. Co-expression of GST-RACK1 had little effect on the basal IP turnover but significantly inhibited the Gβ1γ2-mediated IP signaling. This effect was specific to RACK1, because co-expression with GST had no effect on the Gβ1γ2-stimulated IP generation (Fig. 3A). Moreover, like GSTRACK1, overexpression of RACK1-V5-His inhibited Gβ1γ2-mediated PLCβ2 activation (data not shown). The magnitude of the inhibitory effect of GST-RACK1 depended on the level of its expression (data not shown). The transfection of 4 μg of GST-RACK1 plasmid relative to 1 μg of Gβ1γ2 plasmid inhibited Gβ1γ2-mediated IP accumulation by ∼50% (Fig. 3A). We then evaluated if RACK1 could interfere with receptor-mediated PLC activation through endogenous Gβγ. The α2A-AR was chosen for this study, because it was known to activate phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis through the Gβγ released from the activated heterotrimer Gi. As reported previously (22Chen S. Lin F. Xu M. Hwa J. Graham R.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4265-4271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cotecchia S. Kobilka B.K. Daniel K.W. Nolan R.D. Lapetina E.Y. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 63-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 3B, stimulation of COS-7 cells transiently expressing the α2A-AR with the α2A-AR agonist UK14,304, resulted in a small but significant increase in IP accumulation, which was completely abolished by pertussis toxin pre-treatment. Co-expression of GST-RACK1 blocked the α2A-AR-mediated IP response (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the IP response initiated by the chemokine receptor CXCR2 transiently expressed in COS-7 cells via the pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway was also inhibited by RACK1 (data not shown). Because RACK1 can interact with many target proteins other than G proteins, it is possible that the inhibition of Gβγ signaling by RACK1 was mediated indirectly through the perturbation of other signaling pathways regulated by RACK1. To evaluate this possibility, the effect of RACK1 on Gβγ-mediated PLCβ2 stimulation was further evaluated in vitro using heterologously expressed and purified proteins. As shown in Fig. 3C, 10 μm MBP-RACK1 specifically inhibited the Gβ1γ2 but not the Ca2+-mediated increase in 3H-labeled phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate hydrolysis. The inhibitory effect of MBP-RACK1 on Gβ1γ2 signaling was dose-dependent, with an IC50 of ∼4.9 μm (Fig. 3D). This effect was specific, because neither Gβ1γ2 nor Ca2+-mediated PLCβ2 stimulation was affected by MBP alone. Moreover, because MBP-RACK1 did not affect Ca2+-mediated PLC activation, the inhibition of Gβ1γ2 signaling is unlikely due to a direct inhibition of PLC enzyme activity. Therefore, the inhibition of RACK1 on Gβγ signaling is directly related to its binding to Gβγ. To determine if RACK1 functions as a general inhibitor of Gβγ-dependent signaling processes, we evaluated the effect of MBP-RACK1 on Gβγ-mediated ACII activation. As shown in Fig. 4A, the activity of baculovirus-expressed ACII in Sf9 cell membranes was stimulated 100- and 150-fold by GTPγS-bound Gαs (10 nm) and forskolin (10 μm), respectively. Gβ1γ2 (50 nm) itself had little effect on the activity of ACII (data not shown), but it enhanced Gαs-mediated ACII activation by 2.5-fold (Fig. 4A). 10 μm MBP-RACK1 inhibited basal ACII activity by 50% and Gβ1γ2-mediated stimulation by 80% but had little effect on forskolin- or Gαs-stimulated activity. At the same concentration, MBP did not affect the basal activity of ACII, but caused about 40% inhibition of the Gβ1γ2-mediated stimulation (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that MBP may have nonspecific effects on the Gβ1γ2-mediated ACII activation. However, because the effect of MBP-RACK1 was significantly greater than that of MBP alone, the additional inhibition of the Gβ1γ2-mediated stimulation by MBP-RACK1 is likely specific to RACK1. The reason that MBP-RACK1 also inhibited the basal activity of ACII is unknown, but it seems to be specific to RACK1, because MBP did not have an effect. Moreover, it is unlikely that MBP-RACK1 directly inhibited the enzyme activity of ACII, because the activity stimulated by forskolin or Gαs was unaltered by MBP-RACK1 (Fig. 4A). Additional studies indicate that, as with the inhibition of the Gβ1γ2-mediated PLCβ2 activation, MBP-RACK1 abolished the Gβ1γ2-mediated ACII stimulation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Notably, the IC50 of MBP-RACK1 for inhibiting Gβ1γ2-mediated ACII activation (2.5μM) was close to that for inhibiting PLCβ2 (4.9 μm), suggesting that inhibition occurs through a similar mechanism. To determine if other Gβγ functions were inhibited by RACK1, we tested the α2A-AR-mediated MAPK activation in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), activation of the α2A-AR induced phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAPKs in a dose-dependent manner. These responses were largely abolished by pertussis toxin pre-treatment or co-transfection with Gαt, suggesting that they were mediated by Gβγ. However, despite a 2-fold increase over the level of the endogenous RACK1, overexpression of GST-RACK1 did not affect the α2A-AR-initiated MAPK activation. Similarly, overexpression of RACK1 does not affect the α2A-AR-mediated MAPK activation in COS-7 cells (data not shown). In addition, similar results were obtained when the CXCR2-mediated MAPK activation was examined (data not shown). We also evaluated the consequence of GST-RACK1 overexpression on chemotaxis of HEK293 cells transiently expressing CXCR2, a response that was mediated by Gβγ. As shown in Fig. 5C, IL-8 induced chemotaxis of HEK293 cells expressing the CXCR2, which was inhibited by co-expressed Gαt, supporting the involvement of Gβγ. Overexpression of GST-RACK1 at a level similar to that shown in Fig. 5A, however, had no effect on CXCR2-induced chemotaxis. These data suggest that RACK1 regulates specific Gβγ functions. RACK1 Does Not Affect Gαq-, Gαi-, or Gαs-mediated Signaling—To further explore the specificity of RACK1 on G protein signal transduction, we evaluated the effect of RACK1 on signaling mediated by the Gαq, Gαi, and Gαs subunits. For evaluating the Gαq signaling pathway, we transiently expressed the α1B-AR or the constitutively active GαqQ209L mutant in COS-7 cells. As seen in Fig. 6 (A and B), activation of the α1B-AR resulted in Gαq-mediated PLC activation, whereas overexpression of the constitutively active GαqQ209L mutant caused an increase in basal IP production. Neither the α1B-AR-nor the GαqQ209L mutant-mediated IP generation was affected by GST-RACK1 when it was expressed at a level that was not significantly different from that seen in Fig. 3A. To evaluate the effect of RACK1 on cAMP signaling mediated by the Gαi or Gαs subunit, we used HEK293 cells that stably express the chemokine receptor CXCR2 and endogenously express the β2-AR. Stimulation of the cells with forskolin resulted in a marked increase in cAMP levels (Fig. 6C).

These occur preferentially at CpG and CpA sequences and are enhanced 2–3-fold at methylated CpG sequences compared with non-methylated sites. We sought to understand the molecular factors involved in enhanced adduct formation at these methylated sites. This required, first, clarification of factors that contributed to the formation of adducts at CpG sites. For this purpose mass spectrometry of an oligonucleotide duplex (containing a single CpG adduct site) was used to confirm the presence of an additional carbon atom (derived from formaldehyde) on the drug-DNA complex. The effect of 3′-flanking sequences was revealed by electrophoretic analysis of oligonucleotide-drug adducts, and the preferred adduct-forming site was identified as 5′-CGG-3′. Radiolabeled studies of drug-DNA adducts confirmed that the site of attachment involved the exocyclic amino of guanine. Molecular modeling analysis of the relative stability of the intercalated form of mitoxantrone was consistent with observed adduct-forming potential of CG sites with varying flanking sequences. The known preference for adduct formation at methylated CG sites was confirmed by energetics calculations and shown to be due to a shift of equilibrium of the intercalated form of the drug from the major groove (at CG sites) to the minor groove (at methylated CG sites). This increases the relative amount of drug that is located adjacent to the N-2 exocyclic amino of guanine in the minor groove, where covalent linkage is facilitated. These results account for the enhanced covalent binding of mitoxantrone to methylated CG sequences and provide a molecular model of the interactions.

Mitoxantrone (Novatrone™, see Fig. 1A), is a synthetic anticancer agent that resulted from a concerted effort in the late 1970s to develop a less cardiotoxic form of the anthracycline antibiotics (daunomycin and doxorubicin). It is used primarily for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia and more recently also for prostate cancer (1Robak T. Gora-Tybor J. Neoplasma (Bratisl.). 2001; 48: 203-207Google Scholar, 2Perez-Gracia J.L. Colomer R. Esteban E. Barcelo R. Benavides M. Puertas J. Arcediano A. Tornamira M.V. Valentin V. Munoz A. Cortes-Funes H.

Cancer. 2001; 92: 2065-2071Google Scholar). Mitoxantrone is a classic intercalating agent that accumulates in the nucleus where it functions as a topoisomerase II poison, and there is good evidence that the impaired topoisomerase II (i.e. stabilized DNA-topoisomerase II-cleavable complex) contributes to the cytotoxic effect of mitoxantrone (4Cornbleet M.A. Stuart-Harris R.C. Smith I.E. Coleman R.E. Rubens R.D. McDonald M. Mouridsen H.T. Rainer H. van Oosterom A.T. Smyth J.F. Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol. 1984; 20: 1141-1146Google Scholar). However, in addition to this mechanism it has also been demonstrated that the oxidation products of mitoxantrone (catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase) form a covalent complex with DNA in vitro (5Reszka K. Hartley J.A. Kolodziejczyk P. Lown J.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 4253-4260Google Scholar), and similar drug-DNA adducts were subsequently also detected when mitoxantrone was oxidized in vitro by the human enzyme myeloperoxidase (6Panousis C. Kettle A.J. Phillips D.R. Anticancer Drug Des. 1995; 10: 593-605Google Scholar). The detection of drug-DNA adducts in mitoxantrone-treated promyelocytic HL-60 cells (which contain myeloperoxidase) (7Panousis C. Kettle A.J. Phillips D.R. Cancer Lett. 1997; 113: 173-178Google Scholar) and in other tumor cells (8Skladanowski A. Konopa J. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 1300-1304Google Scholar) subsequently provided direct support for the notion that mitoxantrone-DNA adducts may contribute to the mechanism of action of mitoxantrone. Over recent years it has become clear that doxorubicin can be activated by formaldehyde in vitro and the activated species formed adducts with DNA (9Taatjes D.J. Gaudiano G. Resing K. Koch T.H. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4135-4138Google Scholar, 10Taatjes D.J. Guadiano G. Resing K. Koch T.H. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1276-1286Google Scholar, 11Zeman S.M. Phillips D.R. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11561-11565Google Scholar). The structure of doxorubicin-DNA adducts has been rigorously defined by mass spectrometry, two-dimensional NMR, and x-ray diffraction (for review, see Ref. 12Phillips D.R. Cullinane C. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 68-72Google Scholar), and low levels of these adducts have been detected in MCF-7 tumor cells in culture (13Cullinane C. Cutts S.M. Panousis C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1019-1025Google Scholar). The combination of doxorubicin with formaldehyde-releasing prodrugs yields dramatically enhanced levels of doxorubicin-DNA adducts and results in a synergistic increase of cytotoxicity (14Cutts S.M. Rephaeli A. Nudelman A. Hmelnitsky I. Phillips D.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8194-8202Google Scholar). The structural and potential mechanistic similarities between mitoxantrone and doxorubicin suggested that mitoxantrone may also be activated by formaldehyde, and this was subsequently confirmed in vitro using an electrophoretic DNA cross-linking assay (15Parker B.S. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2918-2923Google Scholar). This assay also revealed that the mitoxantrone-DNA adducts were labile, similar to that observed with doxorubicin-DNA adducts (16van Rosmalen A. Cullinane C. Cutts S.M. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 42-50Google Scholar), and suggested a likely structure (15Parker B.S. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2918-2923Google Scholar) for these adducts (Fig. 1B). An in vitro transcription assay revealed that the adducts formed specifically at CpA and CpG, with greater stability (half-life of 3.0–5.3 h) at CpG sites (17Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 982-990Google Scholar), in contrast to the well documented GpC sequence specificity of anthracycline-DNA adducts (11Zeman S.M. Phillips D.R. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11561-11565Google Scholar, 12Phillips D.R. Cullinane C. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 68-72Google Scholar). The knowledge that mitoxantrone formed adducts preferentially at CpG sequences together with the fact that the majority of CpG dinucleotides in cells are methylated (18Eng C. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 101-102Google Scholar) prompted an investigation into the effect of mitoxantrone-DNA adduct formation at methylated CpG sites. In vitro transcription analysis revealed that adduct levels at 5-methyl-CG sites were enhanced 2–3-fold compared with non-methylated CG sequences (19Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15953-15960Google Scholar). Methylation of cytosine at single CpG sites on oligonucleotides also revealed that adduct levels were enhanced 3-fold by the presence of the methylated cytosine (19Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15953-15960Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that in tumor cells in culture the activity of mitoxantrone depends on the methylation status of the cell (20Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Nudelman A. Rephaeli A. Phillips D.R. Sukamar S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 259-263Google Scholar). Mitoxantrone-DNA adduct levels decreased when breast cancer cells were pretreated with the DNA de-methylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, 1B. S. Parker, S. M. Cutts, and D. R. Phillips, unpublished results. 1B. S. Parker, S. M. Cutts, and D. R. Phillips, unpublished results. and DK08 cells in which the DNA methyltransferase activity had been knocked out (resulting in a 50% decrease of methylation levels compared with the parental HCT116 cells) were also less sensitive to mitoxantrone (20Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Nudelman A. Rephaeli A. Phillips D.R. Sukamar S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 259-263Google Scholar). Both of these results are consistent with the view that some of the mechanism of action of mitoxantrone may be due to formaldehyde-mediated formation of mitoxantrone-DNA adducts at methylated CpG sequences. Because the activity of mitoxantrone depends on the methylation status of CpG sequences together with the known critical role of CpG islands and hypermethylation of these regions in regulating gene expression (21Warnecke P.M. Bestor T.H. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2000; 12: 68-73Google Scholar, 22Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Google Scholar, 23Esteller M. Lancet Oncol. 2003; 4: 351-358Google Scholar), we sought to understand how cytosine methylation at these sites affected mitoxantrone-DNA adduct formation. We show here the effect of DNA flanking sequences on adduct-forming capacity in model oligonucleotides that contain only a single CpG site, the effect of methylation at these sites, and also molecular modeling studies of mitoxantrone-DNA adducts, which account for the critical role of cytosine methylation on adduct formation. Mitoxantrone was kindly provided by Lederle Laboratories (Pearl River, NY). The drug stock solution was prepared by dissolving in Milli-Q water (Millipore, MA) to a final concentration of 2 mm and stored at -20 °C. All oligonucleotides were obtained from Gene Works. Deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), poly(dI-dC) and poly(dG-dC) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. DyNAzyme DNA polymerase was from Finnzymes, acrylamide and urea were from ICN Biomedicals Inc., bisacrylamide and ammonium persulfate were from Bio-Rad, formamide and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine were from Sigma-Aldrich, glycogen and 7-deaza-2′-dGTP were from Roche Applied Science, phenol was from Invitrogen, formaldehyde was from BDH and, Ready Safe liquid scintillation mixture was from Beckman-Coulter. Micro Bio-Spin P6 columns were from Bio-Rad, and Nensorb™ 20 columns were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Preparation of Oligonucleotides—All 20-mer oligonucleotides (see Table I) were purified electrophoretically using a 19% denaturing acrylamide gel preheated to 50 °C for 2 h at 2100 V. The DNA was visualized by UV shadowing on a TLC plate with fluorescein indicator and retrieved from the acrylamide matrix by incubation in water at 37 °C overnight. Samples were subsequently concentrated using Centricon 3 columns. The relevant oligonucleotide (100 pmol) was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and unincorporated label was removed by passing the sample through a micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed by heating at 70 °C for 5 min followed by gradual cooling to room temperature and storage at -20 °C.Table IEffect of 3′-flanking sequence The extent of cross-linking and half-life of the adduct together with calculated values for the relative energy of formation at 5′-CG-3′ central sites for both intercalated and covalently bound form of mitoxantrone with 20-mer AT4A3N4T3A4T oligonucleotide duplexes are shown. The final column shows only the H-bond contribution to the intercalated form of the drug. The central 4-bp N4 element, which contains the 5′-CG-3′ mitoxantrone binding sequence (or alternate control sequences), has been separated from the remainder of the sequence to highlight this region. For clarity, only one strand of each duplex is shown.

Samples were subsequently subjected to overnight electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 19% denaturing acrylamide gel (7 m urea, 19:1 acrylamide: bisacrylamide) at 600 V. Labeled DNA was then visualized by PhosphorImager analysis using a Model 400B PhosphorImager, and bands were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, CA). Drug-Oligonucleotide Stability—Drug-reacted oligonucleotides were passed through a gel exclusion column (Bio-Rad Micro Bio-Spin P-6 chromatography columns) to remove non-reacted drug, incubated at 37 °C for up to 120 min, then subjected to overnight electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 19% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (7 m urea, 19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at 600 V. The gel was then vacuum-dried on a Bio-Rad Model 583 gel drier and exposed to a phosphor screen overnight. The gel was analyzed, and the bands were quantitated as described above. Mass Spectrometry—A 12-mer self-complementary oligonucleotide (100 μm bp) containing a single CG binding site (5′-TTTAACGTTAAA-3′) was reacted with 40 μm mitoxantrone and 10 mm formaldehyde in a final volume of 50 μl. The samples were desalted four times into 10 mm ammonium acetate by gel filtration (Bio-Rad Micro Bio-Spin P-6) to reduce contamination of sodium. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was then carried out in the negative ion mode on a PerkinElmer SCIEX API-300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer fitted with a micro-ion spray ion source (flow rate 0.2 μl/min). Preparation of N-7-modified DNA—Fragments of 572-bp DNA containing either guanine or 7-deaza-2′-deoxyguanine were generated by PCR. Approximately 160 ng of the plasmid pCCl (24Cullinane C. van Rosmalen A. Phillips D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4632-4638Google Scholar) was used to amplify the 572-bp fragment in 1 × DyNAzyme buffer containing 18.8 μg/ml each of two oligonucleotide primers (5′-AGAATACAAGCTTGGGCTGC and 5′-AATACGCAAACCGCCTCTC-3′), 200 μm each dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and either dGTP or 7-deaza-2′-dGTP, 9.4 units/ml DyNAzyme Taq polymerase, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. PCR was performed in a PerkinElmer GeneAMP PCR System 2400 using the program 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 75 s for 30 cycles. The two amplified 572-bp fragments were excised from a 0.8% agarose gel, subjected to electroelution, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and then resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer. The concentration of the 572-bp fragments was determined spectrophotometrically using E = 13,200 m-1cm-1 at 260 nm. Formation of Mitoxantrone-DNA Adducts with N-2 and N-7-modified DNA—The 572-bp fragments (25 μm bp), containing either guanine or 7-deaza-2′-deoxyguanine, were treated with 20 μm [14C]mitoxantrone and 3 mm formaldehyde for 2 h at 37 °C to generate mitoxantrone-DNA adducts. The reaction was terminated and the DNA was purified using a phenol/chloroform extraction followed by an ethanol precipitation. DNA was then resuspended in 75 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer. Scintillation fluid (1 ml) was added to each sample, and the [14C]mitoxantrone-DNA adducts were quantitated by scintillation analysis using a Wallac 1410 liquid scintillation counter. For determination of the role of the N-2 exocyclic amino group in adduct formation, the synthetic polynucleotides poly(dI-dC) and poly(dG-dC) were dissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer (concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using E = 6900 m-1 cm-1 at 251 nm and E = 8400 m-1 cm-1 at 254 nm, respectively). The synthetic alternating co-polymers were then reacted with [14C]mitoxantrone, and adducts levels were determined as described above. Molecular Modeling—Energy calculations were performed using Sybyl (Tripos). MMFF94 Forcefield and charges were used in all energy minimization, energetics, and optimizations (25Halgren T.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1996; 17: 490-519Google Scholar, 26Halgren T.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1999; 20: 720-729Google Scholar), whereas Tripos Forcefields were used in all energy calculations since it enabled bonded molecules to be split and their energies calculated independently of each other. Energy calculations were based on the relationship Einteraction = Etotal + Efragments, in which the extent of the interaction energy can be calculated by subtracting the energies of the individual fragments (DNA and mitoxantrone) from the energy of the whole system. Each energy term is composed of two main components (electrostatic interactions and Van der Waals forces), with E = Eelectrostatic + EVan der Waals. All energies are relative and cannot be used to determine absolute reactivity. The DNA 20-mer fragment (5′-ATTTTAAAACGNTTTAAAAT-3′) was constructed using the Sybyl Biopolymer Module, and the canonical B-DNA structure was used for all calculations. Effect of Flanking Sequences on Adduct Formation and Stability—We have recently used an in vitro transcription assay to identify the sequence specificity of mitoxantrone-DNA adducts, and all high occupancy sites were observed only at 5′-CG and 5′-CA sequences, with the highest occupancy occurring at 5′-CG sequences (17Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 982-990Google Scholar). Although some 19 adduct sites were identified in the 120 bp probed in that assay, it was not possible to identify preferred flanking sequences. In the present study we have used 20-mer oligonucleotide duplexes that contained a single, central mitoxantrone 5′-CG adduct site to assess the effect of the 3′-flanking sequence. Each of the oligonucleotides was reacted overnight with 40 μm mitoxantrone and increasing concentrations of formaldehyde, and the extent of adduct formation was assessed by an electrophoretic DNA cross-linking assay. Fig. 2 shows that the central 4-bp sequences with the greatest adduct-forming capacity were 5′-ACGG and 5′-ACGC (i.e. G and C to the 3′ end of the CG adduct site) and that the extent of adduct formation was ACGG > ACGC > ACGA > ACAG > ACGT. Control sequences were also utilized in which the central site did not contain a known mitoxantrone adduct-forming sequence (i.e. 5′-GC and 5′-AT), and as expected, no adducts were detected with these sequences (Table I), consistent with the previously documented requirement for 5′-CG and 5′-CA sequences for mitoxantrone-DNA adduct formation (17Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 982-990Google Scholar). Because adducts stabilize the duplex to the extent that they withstand normal thermal denaturation conditions, the extent of duplex structures remaining after denaturation is a direct measure of the extent of adduct formation on that DNA sequence (15Parker B.S. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2918-2923Google Scholar). Once the adducts had been formed their stability was assessed by removing the reactants (mitoxantrone and formaldehyde) from the reaction mixture by gel exclusion chromatography and monitoring the residual cross-linked complex as a function of time (Fig. 3). The two sequences that exhibited the greatest adduct stability (longest half-life) were those that contained either G or C located 3′ to the central 5′-CG adduct site, consistent with the observed preference for adduct formation at 5′-CG(C/G)-3′ sequences (Table I). It should be noted that the stability of mitoxantrone-oligonucleotide adducts is considerably less than reported previously using an in vitro transcription assay (17Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 982-990Google Scholar), and this difference is thought to reflect the greater structural flexibility of the 20-bp oligonucleotides (compared with the 512-bp DNA fragment used in the in vitro transcription assay) as well as the effect of RNA polymerase on the drug dissociation process. Site of Attachment of Mitoxantrone to DNA—Although a tentative structure has been proposed for mitoxantrone-DNA adducts (14Cutts S.M. Rephaeli A. Nudelman A. Hmelnitsky I. Phillips D.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8194-8202Google Scholar) based on the analogy with doxorubicin-DNA adducts (9Taatjes D.J. Gaudiano G. Resing K. Koch T.H. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4135-4138Google Scholar, 10Taatjes D.J. Guadiano G. Resing K. Koch T.H. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1276-1286Google Scholar, 11Zeman S.M. Phillips D.R. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11561-11565Google Scholar, 12Phillips D.R. Cullinane C. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 68-72Google Scholar), there is no direct experimental evidence to support this model. To establish if the mitoxantrone-DNA link involved either the well documented reactive and accessible N-7 of guanine or the exocyclic N-2 amino of guanine, adducts were formed with a 572-bp PCR-amplified fragment of DNA that contained either guanine at all relevant positions or deaza-guanine (i.e. C-7 instead of N-7) at all positions as well as with poly(dG-dC) (where G contains the N-2 exocyclic amino group) and poly(dI-dC) (where I lacks the exocyclic N-2 amino group). The loss of the N-7 moiety reduced the adduct level somewhat, whereas removal of the N-2 amino group completely abolished adduct formation (Fig. 4). This result, therefore, establishes the absolute requirement for the N-2 amino of guanine for mitoxantrone-DNA adduct formation. As a control, reactions were also carried out in the absence of formaldehyde, and as expected, only background levels of adducts were detected (Fig. 4). Mass Spectrometry of the Mitoxantrone-Oligonucleotide Adduct—The proposed structure of mitoxantrone-DNA adducts (14Cutts S.M. Rephaeli A. Nudelman A. Hmelnitsky I. Phillips D.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8194-8202Google Scholar) involves a N-C-N aminal linkage where the central carbon of this linkage is derived from formaldehyde. It is assumed that formaldehyde reacts with a secondary nitrogen on the side chain of mitoxantrone to form a Schiff base and that this activated drug then reacts with the N-2 exocyclic amino of guanine to form an adduct with DNA. Although both side chains could potentially be activated by this process, there is no evidence to date that both side chains can simultaneously form an aminal linkage to DNA to form a substantially more stable interstrand cross-link. If this is the case and the mitoxantrone-DNA adduct is linked to only one strand of DNA, the adduct would yield a molecular weight consisting of one strand of the oligonucleotide plus mitoxantrone and one carbon (i.e. CH2 from formaldehyde, less 2H atoms, which are lost accompanying the formation of the aminal linkage). To establish if this was indeed the case, a 12-mer oligonucleotide duplex with only one central 5′-CG adduct-forming site (5′-TTTAACGTTAAA-3′) was reacted with mitoxantrone and formaldehyde, extensively desalted to reduce the sodium ion level to minimal levels (to assist ionization of the oligonucleotide), and subjected to negative mode microelectrospray mass analysis. Molecular masses observed were 4088.0 ± 0.7 and 4100.4 ± 0.7, consistent with the calculated mass of 4088.4 for the non-covalent oligonucleotide-mitoxantrone complex and 4100.4 for the covalent oligonucleotide-methylene-mitoxantrone complex (Fig. 5), where the additional 12 Da is due to the methylene carbon derived from formaldehyde. Energetics of Cytosine Methylation—We have previously shown that when mitoxantrone is reacted with 20-mer oligonucleotide duplexes in the presence of formaldehyde up to 3-fold more adducts were formed with the oligonucleotide that contained a central methylated cytosine (i.e. 5′-AmeCGG-3′, meCG is 5-methyl-CG) sequence compared with the non-methylated sequence (i.e. 5′-ACGG-3′) and that adducts formed at the methylated site were also more stable than at the nonmethylated sequence (Ref. 19Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15953-15960Google Scholar; summarized in Table II). To establish how cytosine methylation caused such a dramatic enhancement of adduct formation together with a corresponding increase of biological activity (19Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15953-15960Google Scholar, 20Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Nudelman A. Rephaeli A. Phillips D.R. Sukamar S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 259-263Google Scholar) we determined the relative free energy of binding of mitoxantrone to each sequence (with intercalation of the drug chromophore between the C and G residues) with the drug intercalated in either the major or minor groove, and these energies are summarized in Table II. Binding via the major groove was much more favorable than the minor groove for the non-methylated sequence, and this is consistent with previous NMR studies which revealed that the drug side chains were located in the major groove (29Lown J.W. Hanstock C C. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1985; 2: 1097-1106Google Scholar). However, there was little groove preference for binding to the methylated sequence. The reason that the binding energies for intercalation via the minor groove is independent of whether the cytosine is methylated or not is because the methyl group on cytosine is at the 5 position; since this projects into the major groove it does not interfere with access to the minor groove (Fig. 1C). The effect of methylation then is to shift the equilibrium of bound drug from the major groove in the non-methylated sequence to the minor groove for methylated sequences. Because the N-2 exocyclic amino group is in the minor groove, this facilitates more adduct formation when the CG site is methylated because more drug is now intercalated at that site and in close proximity to the amino of guanine.Table IIEffect of cytosine methylation on extent of intercalation of mitoxantrone at 5′-CG-3′ sequences of 20-mer duplex oligonucleotides. Values for the extent of cross-linking and half-life of the adducts at these sequences are from Parker et al. (19Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Phillips D.R. J. Biol.

To answer this question the binding energies were calculated for intercalation at each of these sites, and the preferred site was clearly between the two central CG bp (Table III). We then attempted to resolve whether the drug bound covalently to the G of the central CG dinucleotide or to the G on the opposite strand. However, there was insufficient difference of relative binding energy to resolve this issue, and at this stage we conclude that covalent attachment to either guanine residue is equally likely.Table IIIEnergetics of minor groove intercalation and covalent binding at 5′-CG-3′ sequences Open table in a new tab Energetics of the Effect of Flanking Sequences—The extent of adduct formation with different oligonucleotide sequences revealed that maximal adduct levels were detected when the nucleotide 3′ to the central CG dinucleotide was either C or G (Table I). Although total binding energies were unable to discriminate between the different 3′-flanking nucleotides (irrespective of whether the drug was intercalated or bound covalently via the minor groove), the H-bond contributions between the central 4-bp region of the oligonucleotide duplex and a single side chain of mitoxantrone provided good insight into the relative affinity of mitoxantrone for each sequence. This analysis revealed a pronounced preference for the two sequences that exhibited most adduct formation (i.e. 5′-CG flanked on the 3′ end by either G or C), and the H-bond contributions were fully consistent with the extent of adduct formation for the four oligonucleotide sequences studied experimentally (Table I). The specific groups involved in the H-bonding as well as the inter-atomic distances are shown in Fig. 6 for all four sequences examined. Molecular Modeling of Intercalated and Covalent Mitoxantrone-DNA Complexes—With the insight gained of molecular contributions to mitoxantrone-DNA adduct formation (i.e. drug chromophore intercalated between the central C and G of the CG dinucleotide; binding via the minor groove; 5′-ACGG-3′ as a preferred sequence) an energy-minimized structure was constructed for both the intercalated and covalently bound forms of the complex (Fig. 7). The specific groups that provide H-bonding contributions to this energy-minimized structure are shown in Fig. 8 both for the intercalated and covalently bound form of mitoxantrone. For the intercalated form the side chains bind essentially symmetrically in the minor groove but become distinctly nonsymmetric when the drug is covalently attached to DNA (Fig. 7). This is due to the N-C-N aminal linkage (where the C from formaldehyde is shown in gold), which brings one side chain in closer to the guanine residue to which it is attached, but has the opposite effect on the other side chain, moving it further away from the guanine on the opposite strand. This conformational effect, therefore, effectively prevents the formation of a second aminal linkage to DNA, and this is consistent with the fact that formaldehyde-activated mitoxantrone does not appear to be able to form a conventional interstrand cross-link (15Parker B.S. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2918-2923Google Scholar).Fig. 8Intermolecular minor groove contacts between mitoxantrone and DNA.

Binaschi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 185-194Google Scholar) raised the possibility that topoisomerase II cleavage by mitoxantrone might be affected by adduct formation. To address this question we used the cleavage assay of Gupta et al. (28Gupta M. Abdel-Megeed A. Hoki Y. Kohlhagen K.P. Paull K. Pommier Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 658-665Google Scholar), in which an end-labeled fragment of DNA (512 bp) was cleaved with topoisomerase II (Topogen). However, the extent of cleavage was not significantly affected by whether mitoxantrone was present as the free drug or activated by 2 mm formaldehyde to form mitoxantrone-DNA adducts. A topoisomerase II-mediated relaxation assay (25Halgren T.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1996; 17: 490-519Google Scholar) was also used to address this question, and again, no major effect on DNA relaxation was observed accompanying the formation of mitoxantrone-DNA adducts. It, therefore, appears that adduct formation at CGG sites does not dramatically affect topoisomerase II-mediated responses at these sites. Stereochemical Model of Mitoxantrone-DNA Adducts—The energy-minimized model of mitoxantrone-DNA adducts (Fig. 7) is consistent with all present and previous experimental in vitro and cellular observations as follows. 1) Adduct levels increase with formaldehyde. 2) Adducts are linked to the exocyclic N-2 amino of guanine. 3) All adduct sites involve guanine. 4) The adducts are labile, consistent with the known lability of aminal linkages. 5) Mitoxantrone-DNA adducts are less stable than the analogous doxorubicin-DNA adducts, which involve Schiff base formation with the primary amino of doxorubicin rather than a secondary amino group in the side chain of mitoxantrone. 6) Mass spectrometry data indicates covalent bonding to only one strand of DNA. 7) Mass spectrometry confirmed the addition of only one carbon group to the adduct, consistent with the reaction of formaldehyde with mitoxantrone by Schiff base chemistry and the formation of an aminal linkage. The energy calculations also indicated that the drug chromophore would be located between the C and G of the preferred adduct, forming 5′-CG dinucleotide, and that mitoxantrone could be linked with similar probability to either guanine residue abutting the intercalation site. This phenomenon also explains why high adduct levels are also observed at 5′-CA sequences, because mitoxantrone is able to bind covalently to the guanine adjacent to the intercalation site but, in this case, on the opposite DNA strand. Although energy calculations of the total drug-DNA complex were not sufficiently sensitive to be able to discriminate between the different flanking sequences for preferred adduct forming potential, a critical subset of the drug-DNA interactions was exceedingly informative. When only H-bond contributions between the side chain of mitoxantrone and DNA were considered, there was an excellent correlation between the stabilization energy from this source and the extent of adduct formation (Table I). It, therefore, appears likely that the major determinant of preferred adduct-forming sequences is due to the extent of H-bonding between mitoxantrone and the 3 bp on either side of the intercalation site. Effect of Cytosine Methylation—The most fundamental finding of the molecular modeling analysis of mitoxantrone-DNA interactions was that methylation of cytosine shifted the intercalated drug equilibrium from predominately in the major groove to an increased probability of binding via the minor groove. This occurs because 5-methylation of cytosine results in projection of the methyl group into the major groove, thereby diminishing access of mitoxantrone to the 5′-CG intercalation site, whereas access to the same intercalation site is totally unaffected by the cytosine methylation. Once more drug is intercalated via the minor groove, it is then positioned immediately adjacent to a potentially reactive N-2 exocyclic amino of guanine (i.e. the G of the 5′-CG intercalation site). If formaldehyde is also present, then it is reasonable to suggest that rapid intercalation kinetics ensures that some of the intercalated drug will react with formaldehyde to form a Schiff base and then react further with the adjacent N-2 amino of guanine to form the N-C-N aminal linkage. However, it should be noted that the order of formation of the aminal linkage is not known, and it is also conceivable that a small percentage of N-2 amino groups of guanine may be first activated by formaldehyde and that the second step involves coupling between the intercalated drug and the Schiff base of guanine. Biological Implications—There are now many questions and issues to be addressed with respect to the possible cellular responses to mitoxantrone-DNA adducts and to the further implications of these adducts in cellular systems. Although it is now clear that mitoxantrone adduct formation at CpG sites is enhanced 2–3-fold in vitro when the cytosine is methylated (19Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15953-15960Google Scholar), it has not yet been confirmed that adducts do in fact form preferentially at 5-methyl-CG sites in CpG islands, which are typically associated with promoter regions in mammalian cells (21Warnecke P.M. Bestor T.H. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2000; 12: 68-73Google Scholar, 22Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Google Scholar, 23Esteller M. Lancet Oncol. 2003; 4: 351-358Google Scholar), and we are presently examining this issue. A further complex issue to be addressed is the relationship between mitoxantrone and topoisomerase II and how this might be affected by mitoxantrone adduct formation at 5′-CG and 5′-methyl-CG sites. Although mitoxantrone is a well known topoisomerase II poison, it is not yet clear how this cellular response will be affected by increasing levels of adduct formation at these sites. A fundamental question to be addressed is whether the adducts supplement the topoisomerase II response or whether they sequester drug away from topoisomerase II to form more lethal DNA lesions, thus potentially accounting for the observed increased cytotoxicity of mitoxantrone when activated by formaldehyde-releasing prodrugs. We thank Lederle Laboratories (Pearl River, NY) for providing the mitoxantrone used in this work."

Despite the lack of a clear molecular understanding of the roles of Stat3 in embryonic and even adult tissues, Stat3 has emerged as a critical mediator in the pathogenesis of a variety of human cancers.Evidence for the role of Stat3 in human cancer includes the following observations (reviewed in Refs. 17Bowman T.

Second, Stat3 is activated by oncogenic tyrosine kinases including v-Src and bcr-abl. Third, dominant negative forms of Stat3 can block cellular transformation induced by these oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Fourth, Stat3 activation leads to the activation of target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival implicating its essential pathways involved in oncogenesis. Fifth, activated Stat3 has been found in human malignancies.v-Src is a potent oncoprotein, and the activation of Stat3 is critical for its transforming ability (6Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S.

However, the mechanism by which c-Src activation leads to Stat3 activation remains unclear. c-Src family SH3 domains have been reported to directly interact with Stat3, leading to Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation (24Schreiner S.J. Schiavone A.P. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45680-45687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Another study implicated Etk, a Tec family tyrosine kinase, as an intermediary in v-Src-induced Stat3 activation and transformation (25Tsai Y.T. Su Y.H. Fang S.S. Huang T.N. Qiu Y. Jou Y.S. Shih H.M. Kung H.J. Chen R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Etk is expressed in a variety of tissues including hematopoietic, epithelial, and endothelial cells. Besides linking v-Src to Stat3 activation, Etk participates in IL-6-induced differentiation of prostate cancer cells (26Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have reported previously that the proline-rich tyrosine kinase Pyk2 processes similar upstream information and coordinates the activation of similar down-stream signaling pathways, as do the Tec kinases (29Shi C.S.

Furthermore, both Tec kinases and Pyk2 participate in cell migration (28Chen R. Kim O. Li M. Guan J.L. Kung H.J. Chen H. Shimizu Y. Qiu Y. Nat.

A. 2003; 100: 10740-10745Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).Pyk2 and focal adhesion kinase (Fak) are members of a distinct family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases that are regulated by a variety of extracellular stimuli. Integrins, tumor necrosis factor α, T cell receptor, B cell antigen receptor, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), vascular endothelial growth factor, EGF, and platelet-derived growth factor all stimulate Pyk2 activation (reviewed in Refs. 32Schlaepfer D.D.

Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Many GPCRs trigger Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and the formation of a Pyk2 and c-Src complex leads to activation of MAPK signaling pathways (34Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many stress signals utilize Pyk2 activation to link to the Jun kinase pathway. The introduction of Pyk2 expression constructs results in Jun kinase activation, indicating that overexpressed Pyk2 has constitutive activity and is able to trigger downstream pathways without an activating signal (35Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Finally, Pyk2 has been reported to be critical for the Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated MAPK and Stat1 activation by interferon-γ but not interferon-α (36Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Mitani Y. Miyazaki T. Fujii H. Sato M. Kovarik P. Decker T. Schlessinger J. Taniguchi T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2480-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Pyk2 selectively associated with Jak2, resulting in Stat1 activation following interferon-γ treatment.Based on the overlapping functional roles of the Tec family kinases and Pyk2 and because of the established role of Pyk2 in Stat1 activation and the known role of c-Src in Pyk2 activation, we investigated whether Pyk2 participated in c-Src- and EGF-mediated Stat3 activation. We report that Pyk2 facilitates c-Src-mediated Stat3 activation and participates in EGF receptor signaling to Stat3 activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Antibodies—The expression constructs pcDNA3-Myc-Pyk2 and pcDNA3-Myc-Pyk2 (K457A and D567A), referred to as Pyk2 KD, were kindly provided by Dr. S.

The Stat3 luciferase reporter gene plasmid and Stat3 expression vector were kindly provided by Dr. Geeta Devgan (The Rockefeller University). pUse c-Src, activated c-Src, pUse c-Src (Y529F), dominant negative c-Src, pUse c-Src (K296R and Y528F), and kinase-dead c-Src, pUse c-Src (K297R) plasmids were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. Antibodies against the following proteins were purchased: Pyk2 from Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA; phospho-Stat3(Tyr-705), phospho-Stat3(Ser-727), phospho-Src(Tyr-416), c-Src, and EGF receptor from Upstate Biotechnology; Stat3 and ERK from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; and phospho-ERK1/2(Thr-202/Tyr-204) from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA).Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—HeLa and A431 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using Super-Fect (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) in 6-well plates following the manufacturer's protocol. The collected cells were lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation, 20 μl of the supernatant was tested for β-galactosidase activity, using galactan chemiluminescent substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA), or luciferase activity, using a luciferase substrate (Promega). Data from all the transfection assays were normalized using the activity of a control reporter gene.Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitations—HeLa cell lysates were prepared using reporter lysis buffer (Promega) for 30 min on ice. The detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to pure nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TTBS (Tween 20, Tris base, salt) for 1 h and then incubated with an appropriate dilution of the primary antibody in 5% milk and 0.05% sodium azide in TTBS overnight. The blots were washed three times with TTBS before the addition of the biotinylated second antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) diluted 1:5000 in TTBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Following a 1-h incubation, the blot was washed three times with TTBS and then incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO) diluted 1:10,000 in TTBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) following the recommendations of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The co-immunoprecipitations were performed using lysates (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate plus protease inhibitors) prepared from HeLa or A431 cells. Specific antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate Pyk2, Src, or EGF receptor on the appropriate second antibody-coupled magnetic beads (Dynal Corp., Lake Success, NY) from the cell lysates. None of the antibodies cross-reacted with any of the proteins used in this study. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times with the lysis buffer and twice with 500 mm NaCl salt in the same lysis buffer. Subsequently, they were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibody.Cell Proliferation Assay—HeLa cells (1 × 104/well) were seeded in 24-well plates. After incubating overnight, the cells were transfected as described above with different plasmids as indicated. Before labeling the cells, the cells were cultured in 0.5% serum-containing medium for 24 h. Then the medium was changed with 10% (v/v) Cell Counting Kit-8 labeling solution (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), and the cells were incubated for about 15 min. The medium from the labeled cells was transferred to a 96-well plate, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured on a plate reader. For the thymidine incorporation assays, HeLa cells (1 × 103/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate and cultured for 5 h prior to DNA transfection (40 ng/well) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 h later, the cells were pulsed for 4 h with 0.2 μCi of [3H]thymidine, after which the cells were harvested. The amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated was measured using a β-counter following the addition of scintillation fluid.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Pyk2 immunoprecipitates were washed three times with kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm α-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors. Following six additional washes, three with a LiCl wash buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and three with kinase reaction buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2), the kinase assays were performed. Poly(Glu,Tyr) (4:1) (Sigma) was used as a substrate.RESULTSStat3 Is Activated by Pyk2 Expression—We used two measures of Stat3 activation: the response of a Stat3-sensitive reporter gene and the status of Stat3 phosphorylation using phosphopeptide-specific antibodies. Phosphorylation of Tyr-705 of Stat3 is required for Stat3 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding activity (37Sasse J. Hemmann U. Schwartz C. Schniertshauer U. Heesel B. Landgra C. Schneider-Mergener J. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4677-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-727 of Stat3 enhances its transcriptional activity (38Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). We first determined whether Pyk2 overexpression resulted in enhanced transcription of a Stat3 reporter gene by transfecting HeLa cells with a luciferase reporter gene that contained four copies of the Stat3 binding site fused to a minimal promoter along with different amounts of the Pyk2 expression construct. Pyk2 introduced into cells by transient transfection has constitutive activity, which can be boosted by upstream activating signals (35Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In our experiments, expression of Pyk2 resulted in a modest increase in Stat3 reporter gene activity (Fig. 1A). To detect Stat3 phosphorylation, we transfected expression constructs for Pyk2 and Stat3 into HeLa cells and checked the status of Stat3 phosphorylation using phospho-Stat3 antibodies. Pyk2 dramatically induced the phosphorylation of Stat3 on Tyr-705 and Ser-727, whereas a kinase inactive form of Pyk2 (Pyk2 KD) did not induce Stat3 phosphorylation on the same residues (Fig. 1B). Similar to the Pyk2-induced Stat3 reporter gene activity, enhanced expression of Pyk2 resulted in a higher amount of Stat3 phosphorylation on both residues (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that Pyk2 overexpression can lead to Stat3 activation.Pyk2 Facilitates Src-induced Stat3 Activation—As a first test of our hypothesis that Pyk2 participates in the activation of Stat3 by c-Src, we co-transfected DNA constructs that express Stat3, activated Src, wild type, and the kinase-inactivated form of Pyk2 and measured Stat3 reporter gene activity and the status of Stat3 Tyr-705 and Ser-727 phosphorylation. In these experiments, we used HeLa cells, which express a low level of endogenous Pyk2. The results show that Pyk2 and activated c-Src individually and additively activate the Stat3 reporter gene (Fig. 2A). Expression of Pyk2 tended to result in the preferential phosphorylation of Stat3 on Ser-727, whereas activated c-Src resulted in preferential phosphorylation of Stat3 on Tyr-705. Together they induced a very strong phosphorylation of both residues (Fig. 2B). We also examined whether a dominant negative form of Pyk2 would impair the ability of activated c-Src to trigger the phosphorylation of Stat3. We found that co-expression of the dominant interfering form of Pyk2 significantly impairs activated c-Src-induced Stat3 reporter gene activation and the phosphorylation of Stat3 on Tyr-705 and Ser-727 (Fig. 2, A and C). These results indicate that Pyk2 may be a downstream tyrosine kinase involved in c-Src-mediated Stat3 activation.Fig. 2Pyk2 amplifies c-Src-induced Stat3 activation. A, Pyk2 KD form blocks c-Src-induced Stat3-dependent reporter gene activation. HeLa cells were transfected with constructs that express a Stat3 luciferase reporter (0.05 μg), Pyk2 (0.3 μg), and activated c-Src (0.3 μg) in the presence (+) or absence (–) of Pyk2 KD form (0.5 μg). Data are mean ± S.E. of three experiments and shown as-fold induction. Levels of Pyk2 and activated c-Src were detected by immunoblots. B, Pyk2 and c-Src strongly induce Stat3 phosphorylation on Tyr-705 and Ser-727. HeLa cells were transfected with constructs that express Stat3 (0.25 μg) and activated c-Src (0.25 μg) in the presence (+) or absence (–) of Pyk2 (0.25 μg). The levels of Stat3 Tyr-705 and Ser-727 phosphorylation are shown. The amounts of Stat3, Pyk2, and activated c-Src expressed are shown as detected by immunoblots. C, Pyk2 KD blocks c-Src-induced Stat3 Tyr-705 and Ser-727 phosphorylation. HeLa cells were transfected with constructs that express Stat3 (0.25 μg) and activated c-Src (0.5 μg) in the presence or absence of Pyk2 KD (0.5 μg). The levels of Stat3 Tyr-705 and Ser-727 phosphorylation are shown. The expressed levels of Stat3, Pyk2 KD, and activated c-Src were detected by immunoblots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pyk2 Associates with Stat3—Because Pyk2 and c-Src individually and together potently activate the Stat3 reporter gene and induce Stat3 phosphorylation and because Pyk2 has been reported to interact with c-Src (34Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and c-Src to interact with Stat3 (6Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), we examined whether we could detect a Pyk2-c-Src complex and a Pyk2-Stat3 complex. Based on the immunoblotting results, each of the proteins expressed well in HeLa cells. Using a lysate from the transfected cells, we immunoprecipitated with anti-Pyk2 or anti-Src antibodies or a hemagglutinin antibody as the negative control and examined for the presence of co-precipitated proteins by Western blotting. We detected Stat3 and activated c-Src in the Pyk2 immunoprecipitates and Stat3 and Pyk2 in the Src immunoprecipitates. Pyk2, Stat3, and activated c-Src could not be detected in the hemagglutinin antibody immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3). Nearly equivalent levels of activated c-Src and Pyk2 immunoprecipitated with the Pyk2 antibody, whereas the Src immunoprecipitates contained significantly less Pyk2. The amounts of Stat3 in the two immunoprecipitations were similar. Because the Stat3 antibody did not efficiently immunoprecipitate Stat3, we could not examine Stat3 immunoprecipitates for the presence of Pyk2 and Src (data not shown).Fig. 3Pyk2 associates with Stat3 and c-Src. Similar amounts of Pyk2, Stat3, and activated c-Src were expressed in the HeLa cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG, anti-Pyk2, or anti-Src followed by Western blotting (WB) with anti-Pyk2 (top), anti-Stat3 (middle), and anti-Src (bottom). The levels of Pyk2, Stat3, and activated c-Src in the cell lysate, as determined by immunoblotting, are shown.

HeLa cells were transfected with constructs that express Pyk2 or Pyk2 KD in the presence or absence of c-Src, active c-Src, a dominant negative form (c-Src DN), or a kinase-dead form (c-Src KD). We subjected immunoprecipitated Pyk2 to an in vitro kinase assay using poly(Glu,Tyr) (4:1) as a substrate. Both wild type and activated c-Src strongly enhanced Pyk2 kinase activity but had no effect on Pyk2 KD. c-Src DN and c-Src KD slightly enhanced the activity of Pyk2 when compared with its basal activity (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4c-Src potently stimulates Pyk2 kinase activity and induces Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and active c-Src interacts with Pyk2 better than does wild type c-Src. A, Pyk2 kinase activation. HeLa cells were transfected with constructs that express Pyk2 (0.25 μg, lanes 1–5) or Pyk2 KD (0.5 μg, lanes 6–10) along with activated c-Src, c-Src DN, or c-Src KD. The results of an in vitro kinase assay using immunoprecipitated Pyk2 along with poly(Glu,Tyr) as the substrate are shown. B, Pyk2 phosphorylation on Tyr-402, Tyr-579, Tyr-580, and Tyr-881. Cell lysates from the experiment described under “Experimental Procedures” were subject to immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize various Pyk2 phosphopeptides. The levels of Pyk2 and c-Src proteins found in the cell lysates are shown in the bottom two panels. C, association with Pyk2. Pyk2 immunoprecipitates from the experiment described above were immunoblotted to verify the presence of Pyk2 and to examine for the presence of the different c-Src proteins. WT, wild type; IP, immunoprecipitate; ACT, active.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also compared the effects of c-Src, active c-Src, c-Src DN, and c-Src KD on Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation using antibodies specific for various PY peptides from Pyk2. These antibodies recognize Pyk2 PY402, an autophosphorylation site and a Src-family SH2 domain binding site, which is required for Pyk2 kinase activation; PY579, present in the activation loop of the kinase domain; PY580, also located in the activation loop of the kinase domain; and PY881, a Grb2 SH2 binding site. We used the HeLa cell lysates from the same assay as shown with the Pyk2 kinase assay. Expression of either c-Src or activated c-Src resulted in the phosphorylation of Pyk2 and Pyk2 KD on Tyr-402, Tyr-579, Tyr-580, and Tyr-881, irrespective of the catalytic activity of Pyk2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, the phosphorylation on Pyk2 by c-Src (whether direct or indirect) does not require Pyk2 kinase activity. Interestingly, the expression of c-Src KD and c-Src DN also led to an increase in Pyk2 phosphorylation on Tyr-402 but faile"
https://openalex.org/W2078595720,"Rare earth element (REE) data from two ordinary chondrite chondrules show distinct negative chondrite-normalized concentration anomalies of samarium, europium, and ytterbium. The peculiar patterns may be the result of REE gas/solid fractionation at an oxygen fugacity lower than has been assumed for the canonical solar nebula. We suggest that the two ordinary chondrite chondrules acquired the fractionated REE patterns by incorporation of highly reduced, ultrarefractory condensates in their precursors. This interpretation implies that high-temperature condensation processes occurred in nebular environments with a strong deficit in oxygen, such as regions with an enhanced carbon/oxygen ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2079347968,"The von-Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) is conserved throughout evolution, as its homologues are found in organisms ranging from mammals to the Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae insects and the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode. Although the physiological role of pVHL is not fully understood, it has been shown to interact with a large number of unrelated proteins and was suggested to play a role in protein degradation as an E3 ubiquitin ligase component in the ubiquitin pathway. To gain insight into the molecular basis of pVHL activity, we analyzed its folding and stability in solution under physiologically relevant conditions. Dynamic light-scattering and gel filtration chromatography of the purified pVHL clearly indicated that the Stokes radius of the protein is larger than what would be expected from its crystal structure. However, under these conditions, the protein shows a clear secondary structure as determined by far-UV circular dichroism. Yet, the near-UV CD experiments show an absence of a tertiary structure. Upon the addition of urea, even at very low concentrations, the protein unfolds in a non-reversible manner, leading to the formation of amorphous aggregates. Furthermore, a large increase in fluorescence (>50-fold) is observed upon the addition of pVHL into a solution containing 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid. We therefore conclude that, under native conditions, the non-bound pVHL has a molten globule configuration with marginal stability. Although molten globular structures can be induced in many proteins under extreme conditions, this is one of the few reported cases of such a structure under the physiological conditions of pH, ionic strength, and temperature.

This disease is characterized by a predisposition to develop retinal angiomas, cerebellar and spinal hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, pancreatic adenomas and islet cell tumors, epididymal cystadenomas, and endolymphatic sac tumors of the inner ear (1Maher E.R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Medicine (Baltimore). 1997; 76: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The inactivation of the VHL protein occurs at the early stages of the pathogenesis of kidney lesions and clear cell renal carcinoma and is considered to be the most frequent genetic event at the onset of human kidney cancer (2Kaelin Jr., W.G. Maher E.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 423-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Ohh M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The product of the VHL gene is a 213-amino acid protein (4Iliopoulos O. Ohh M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11661-11666Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A second form of pVHL is generated by translation initiation at an internal methionine, located at residue 54, with a molecular mass of 19 kDa (4Iliopoulos O. Ohh M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11661-11666Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The structure of the 19-kDa pVHL protein was determined by x-ray crystallography in a ternary complex with Elongin C and Elongin B (5Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Another recently elucidated crystal structure of this complex, which interacts with a 20-residue destruction sequence of HIF-1α and contains a functional hydroxyproline, was recently elucidated (6Min J.H. Yang H. Ivan M. Gertler F. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 296: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The crystal structures show that the pVHL molecule consists of two domains, α and β. Both domains are connected by two short polypeptide linkers and a polar interface that is stabilized by a hydrogen bond network. The β-domain of pVHL consists of a seven-stranded β-sandwich (residues 63–154) and an α-helix (residues 193–204) that packs against one of the β-sheets through hydrophobic interactions. The α-domain of pVHL (residues 155–192) consists of three α-helices (5Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Still, no unbound crystal structures or structures of pVHL in solution are available. Like other tumor suppressors, the pVHL protein has a regulatory function in many cellular pathways, and it is suggested that many different factors interact with the pVHL protein in direct or indirect forms (7Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The pVHL protein is suggested to have a role in the regulation of transcription of many downstream elements. Biochemical studies have revealed that pVHL forms a ternary complex (VCB) with Elongin C and Elongin B proteins via a similar binding site, as exists in Elongin A (8Kibel A. Iliopoulos O. DeCaprio J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 1995; 269: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 9Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C.

This interaction could indicate that one of the pVHL tumor suppressor roles is inhibition of elongation due to competition with Elongin A in the complex formation (5Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G.

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that pVHL binds directly to the transcription factor sp1 in vitro, hence suggesting that pVHL could be a regulator of the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA (12Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that pVHL binds directly to protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ), a regulator that binds alternatively to sp1 and phosphorylates it (13Pal S. Claffey K.P. Cohen H.T. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26277-26280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been proposed that pVHL indirectly regulates a variety of downstream mRNA targets encoding platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), transforming growth factor α (TGF-α), and carbonic anhydrase 9 and12 (CA9 and CA12) (1Maher E.R.

A recent study revealed a novel ubiquitylation target, the VHL-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme 1 (VDU1), which is recruited into the VCB complex and binds directly to pVHL. VDU1 is suggested to act as a protease responsible for deubiquitylation of downstream ubiquitinated targets of the VCB-CR complex (25Li Z. Na X. Wang D. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4656-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that pVHL is involved in the extracellular matrix metabolism where it directly interacts with fibronectin, and its inactivation leads to impaired extracellular fibronectin organization in VHL(–) cells (26Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Gavin B.J. Kley N. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Iliopoulos O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 959-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Another recent study has proposed that pVHL regulates integrins and is essential for the formation of β1 fibrillar adhesions, which are involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and required for the organization of fibronectin (27Esteban-Barragan M.A. Avila P. Alvarez-Tejado M. Gutierrez M.D. Garcia-Pardo A. Sanchez-Madrid F. Landazuri M.O. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2929-2936PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the pVHL protein has been associated with regulation of the stability of microtubules and their protection from depolymerization through direct interaction (28Hergovich A. Lisztwan J. Barry R. Ballschmieter P. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Another stabilization role was observed with the short-lived protein Jade-1 (gene for apoptosis and differentiation in epithelia). This protein, which is highly expressed in the kidney, is stabilized by its strong interaction with the pVHL protein (29Zhou M.I. Wang H. Ross J.J. Kuzmin I. Xu C. Cohen H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39887-39898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Finally, the unassembled form of pVHL is associated with two different types of molecular chaperones, Hsp70 and TriC/CCT (30Feldman D.E. Thulasiraman V. Ferreyra R.G. Frydman J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Melville M.W. McClellan A.J. Meyer A.S. Darveau A. Frydman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3141-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The biological significance of pVHL is evident by its evolutionary conservation. Homologues of the mammalian pVHL protein are found in low invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, and Caenorhabditis elegans. As more complete eukaryotic genomes are sequenced, we will expect to find additional pVHL homologues along the evolutionary tree. The understanding of pVHL structure-function relationship in the context of its unbound solution structure is therefore highly important. Such studies are significant in the wider context of structure and stability of other tumor suppressor proteins as well. The wild-type p53 tumor suppressor protein was found to be relatively unstable; its isolated core domain had moderate thermodynamic stability with relatively small changes leading to loss of function (32Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Likewise, the wild-type p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor protein was found to have low stability and to be highly vulnerable to mutations, which altered its secondary structure and global fold (33Tevelev A. Byeon I.J. Selby T. Ericson K. Kim H.J. Kraynov V. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9475-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Tang K.S. Guralnick B.J. Wang W.K. Fersht A.R. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1869-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These findings may imply that intrinsic instability could be a functional trait in tumor suppressors and may be the means by which these key role proteins modulate their activity. Here, we examine the secondary structure, hydrodynamic characteristics, core packing, and thermodynamic stability of the pVHL tumor suppressor protein in solution under physiologically relevant conditions by using biophysical techniques. The results of our studies, as presented here, allow better understanding of the role of the pVHL protein in various cellular processes and may shed light on the general paradigm of tumor suppressor proteins. Protein Expression and Purification—The BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli was co-transformed by electroporation (Bio-Rad Micro-Pulser) with two plasmids that were kindly provided to us by Dr. Nikola Pavletich (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). The first plasmid, pGEX-4T-3, includes the human VHL gene (residues 54 to 213) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the full-length human Elongin B gene as a dicistronic massage. The second plasmid, pBB75, includes the human Elongin C gene (residues 17 to 112). Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C, 200 rpm, in 2XYT medium under dual antibiotic selection (100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml kanamycin). Cells were induced overnight at 25 °C with two doses of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and supplementary ampicillin (100 μg/ml); one dose was applied at A600 = 0.8–1, and a second dose was applied after 6 h of induction. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were frozen at –70 °C before purification. Cell pellets were resuspended in suspension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and mixture protease inhibitor), and suspended cells were lysed by a French press cell disruptor at 14,000 p.s.i. The lysate was treated with DNase (10 units/ml) and centrifuged for 30 min, at 4 °C. Supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (Corning) and subjected to GSTrap FF 1-ml column (Amersham Biosciences) using the ÄKTA prime automated liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-pVHL fusion protein was treated on column with thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences) overnight to cleave the GST moiety, and purified pVHL was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 200 mm NaCl. Purification was assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS/PAGE. Protein concentration was determined from absorbance at 280 nm using ϵ280 nm = 17,900 cm–1m–1. CD Spectra Measurements—CD spectra at far- (200–250 nm) and near-UV (250–320 nm) were recorded with an AVIV 202 spectropolarimeter (Aviv Instruments, Lakewood NJ) equipped with a temperature-controlled cell using a cell of pathlength 0.5 cm; bandwidth was 1 nm, and averaging time was 30 s for each measurement. Protein concentration was 3 μm (far-UV) and 7 μm (near-UV) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 200 mm NaCl. Chemical Denaturation—Urea denaturation studies were carried out using CD. A solution of 3 μm protein in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 200 mm NaCl) was mixed stepwise with appropriate amounts of the same solution containing 6 m urea to achieve the appropriate concentration of protein and denaturant for the chemical denaturation. Changes in ellipticity were scanned from 222 to 218 nm for each step of urea addition; bandwidth was 1 nm, averaging time was 30 s, and cell pathlength was 0.5 cm. Measurements were conducted at 37 and 25 °C. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration experiments were performed using a Sephacryl S100 16/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a separation range of 1–100 kDa connected to an ΔKTA prime automated liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The running buffer used was 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8, and 200 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated using gel filtration low molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences). A 1-ml sample at a final protein concentration of 8 μm was chromatographically analyzed using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm, and elution volumes were determined from UV chromatogram. The partition coefficient, Kav, was calculated from the elution volume of the sample, Ve, and total bed volume, Vt, using the expression: Kav = (Ve – V0)/(Vt – V0). Calibration curves and equations were established. Dynamic Light-scattering Measurements—Hydrodynamic radius (RH) measurements were made at 25 °C with a DynaPro MSTC800 instrument (Protein Solutions Inc., Charlottesville, VA). A sample (50 μl) containing 0.3 mg/ml protein in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 200 mm NaCl) was centrifuged and filtered to avoid dust particles. The sample was placed directly in a quartz cuvette, and the light-scattering intensity was collected at an angle of 90° using a 10-s acquisition time at 74% laser power. Particle diffusion coefficient was calculated from auto-correlated light intensity data and converted to RH with the Stokes-Einstein equation. A histogram of the percentage of the scattering mass versus RH was calculated using Dynamics data analysis software (Protein Solutions). 8-Anilino-1-naphthalene Sulfonic Acid (ANSA) Fluorescence Studies—Fluorescence emission spectra of two solutions were generated with excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The first solution contained 3 μm ANSA in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 200 mm NaCl). The second solution was similar and contained protein at a final concentration of 3 μm. Samples were equilibrated at room temperature. The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded (Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cuvette length was 1 cm. Measurements were conducted at room temperature. Baseline corrections were made with buffer lacking protein and ANSA, but otherwise identical. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed overnight at 20 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) equipped with 12-mm Epon double sector cells in an An-60 Ti rotor. Protein was analyzed in PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Sedimentation equilibrium scans were carried out at 21,000 rpm. Absorbance of sedimenting material was assayed at 232 nm. Molecular masses were evaluated from ln A versus r2 plots employing the SEGAL computer program based on the concept of numerical fitting of the sedimentation equilibrium pattern where A is the absorbance and r is the distance from the rotor center. A partial specific volume of 0.73 cm3/g was used for all calculations. Fluorescence Labeling and Spectroscopy—Purified VHL protein was reacted with two equivalents of N-hydroxysuccinimide fluorescein ester (Pierce) in PBS (pH 8) for 24 h at room temperature in the dark as described (35Gazit E. Burshtein N. Ellar D.J. Sawyer T. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15546-15554Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Unreacted dye was separated from labeled protein by gel filtration chromatography on a MicroSpin G-50 Sephadex column (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence emission and anisotropy were monitored in PBS using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer. Although the crystal structure of pVHL was determined in the context of the ternary complex with Elongin proteins using x-ray crystallography (5Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 6Min J.H. Yang H. Ivan M. Gertler F. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 296: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), the structure of the protein in solution and its unbound structure have not yet been studied. To gain insight on the structure of the protein under such conditions, we studied the secondary and tertiary structure, the hydrodynamic properties, the thermal and chemical stability, and the core packing of pVHL under near-physiological solvent conditions using biophysical techniques. Determination of Secondary and Tertiary Structure by Circular Dichroism—Initial information regarding the secondary and tertiary structure of the purified, unbound pVHL in solution was obtained by CD. The far-UV CD spectra of pVHL at 25 °C, shown in Fig. 1A, reveals spectral signals consistent with a protein comprising an intact secondary structure, rendering both α-helices and β-sheets. The α-helical and β-sheet content estimated by deconvolution of the CD spectra (k2d; www.embl-heidelberg.de/~andrade/k2d) shows 29% α-helix content and 34% β-sheet content. This is consistent with the secondary structure of the bound pVHL protein as determined previously by x-ray crystallography (5Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The near-UV CD spectra of pVHL at 25 °C shown in Fig. 1B reveals no significant signals originating from aromatic side chains, thus suggesting a dramatic loss of tertiary structure of the soluble and unbound protein in comparison with the complex-related crystal structure. Chemical Denaturation—The thermodynamic instability of tumor suppressor proteins appears to be a common structural denominator (32Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 33Tevelev A. Byeon I.J. Selby T. Ericson K. Kim H.J. Kraynov V. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9475-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Tang K.S. Guralnick B.J. Wang W.K. Fersht A.R. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1869-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the thermodynamic stability of purified pVHL using urea melt at two different temperatures (37 and 25 °C). The degree of denaturation was assessed by monitoring ellipticity changes at 222 and 218 nm as a function of urea concentrations. As can be observed in Fig. 2, the unfolding of pVHL occurs at fairly low urea concentrations. Unfolding as reflected by a significant reduction in ellipticity was observed at urea concentrations as low as 0.25 m at both temperatures. Furthermore, the unfolding event was partially irreversible, and the formation of amorphous aggregates could be visualized by the naked eye. Therefore, no exact thermodynamic parameters could be calculated. However, the linear nature of the initial slope of the curve and the aggregative behavior implies that unbound pVHL stability is marginal, as was observed previously with other tumor suppressor proteins (33Tevelev A. Byeon I.J. Selby T. Ericson K. Kim H.J. Kraynov V. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9475-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—The marginal stability of pVHL, as observed in the chemical denaturation experiments, raised the possibility that pVHL might be partially unfolded in its unbound state. Size exclusion chromatography was therefore used to estimate the hydrodynamic dimensions of the protein and as a probe for elucidating the compactness of the protein's tertiary structure, because the elution volume of partially or fully unfolded proteins is significantly smaller than that of well folded proteins due to the large increase in the Stokes radius. We performed size exclusion chromatography in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 200 mm NaCl. The pVHL protein was eluted at a volume of 58.5 ml on a calibrated column (as described under “Experimental Procedures”), which is very close to the ovalbumin standard (Mw = 43,000 Da) el"

In a search for nonhematopoietic counterparts to Dok molecules, we identified and characterized Dok-4, a recently cloned member of the family. dok-4 mRNA was strongly expressed in nonhematopoietic organs, particularly the intestine, kidney, and lung, whereas both mRNA and protein were expressed at high levels in cells of epithelial origin. In Caco-2 human colon cancer cells, endogenous Dok-4 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation in response to pervanadate stimulation. In transfected COS cells, Dok-4 was a substrate for the cytosolic tyrosine kinases Src and Fyn as well as for Jak2. Dok-4 could also be phosphorylated by the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret but not by platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β or IGF-IR. In both mammalian cells and yeast, Dok-4 was constitutively localized at the membrane in a manner that required both its PH and PTB domains. The PH and PTB domains of Dok-4 were also required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-4 by Fyn and Ret. Finally, wild type Dok-4 strongly inhibited activation of Elk-1 induced by either Ret or Fyn. The attenuation of this inhibitory effect by deletion of the PH domain and its restoration by the addition of a myristoylation signal suggested an important role for constitutive membrane localization of Dok-4. In summary, Dok-4 is a constitutively membrane-localized adapter molecule that may function as an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase signaling in epithelial cells.

In summary, Dok-4 is a constitutively membrane-localized adapter molecule that may function as an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase signaling in epithelial cells. Increased tyrosine kinase activity is a common mechanism for initiation of intracellular signaling following stimulation of many cell surface receptors. The specificity of the information conveyed by such events is determined in large part by the amino acid context of tyrosine residues accessible for phosphorylation within the cytoplasmic tail of the involved receptor(s) and by the availability of motif-specific Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) 1The abbreviations used are: PTB, phosphotyrosine-binding; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PH, pleckstrin homology; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase(s); PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, PDGF receptor; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; EST, expressed sequence tag; RT, reverse transcription; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; IP, immunoprecipitation; GDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; GEC, glomerular epithelial cell(s); IGF, insulin-like growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase. domain-containing partner molecules (1Schlessinger J. Lemmon M.A. Science's STKE.http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2003/191/re12Date: 2003Google Scholar), including adapter molecules. While devoid of enzymatic activity, adapter molecules often contain additional sites for tyrosine phosphorylation and can generate signaling complexes through protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions in a phosphorylation-dependent or -independent manner, leading to signal amplification or diversification (2Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Google Scholar). One example of a well characterized adapter molecule involved in tyrosine kinase signaling is the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 molecule. IRS-1 belongs to a family of at least four members with overlapping yet distinct tissue expression patterns (3White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Google Scholar, 4Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Google Scholar, 5Patti M.E.

Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29686-29692Google Scholar). IRS molecules are characterized by an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain immediately followed by a PTB domain and a C-terminal region of variable length containing potential docking sites for Src homology 2 domains. IRS-1 interacts with both membrane phospholipids and with the phosphorylated insulin receptor through its PH and PTB domains, respectively (7Whitehead J.P. Clark S.F. Urso B. James D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 222-228Google Scholar). Following tyrosine phosphorylation by the insulin receptor, IRS-1 allows the recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through multiple YXXM motifs contained in its sequence. In addition, perhaps because its association with the membrane and the insulin receptor is weak and transient, IRS-1 can translocate from the membrane to other cellular compartments where its signal is propagated (8Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Google Scholar). Recently, the Dok family of adapter molecules (including Dok-1, -2, and -3) has emerged as an expanding group of related signaling molecules composed of an amino-terminal tandem of PH and PTB domains reminiscent of IRS molecules. Dok-1 was identified as a major 62-kDa RasGAP-associated phosphoprotein in v-Abl-transformed B cells and in Bcr-Abl-expressing leukemic cells (9Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Google Scholar, 10Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Google Scholar). Subsequently, Dok-2 was identified as a partner for the interleukin-4 receptor (11Nelms K. Snow A.L. Hu-Li J. Paul W.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 13-24Google Scholar) and the angiopoietin receptor Tie-2 (12Jones N. Dumont D.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1097-1108Google Scholar) and as a substrate of the Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn (13Lock P. Casagranda F. Dunn A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22775-22784Google Scholar). We and others cloned a third member, Dok-3, as a molecule associating with the tyrosine kinases Abl (14Cong F. Yuan B. Goff S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8314-8325Google Scholar) and Csk (15Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Google Scholar). The first three members of the Dok family (in particular Dok-2 and Dok-3) are primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells (11Nelms K. Snow A.L. Hu-Li J. Paul W.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 13-24Google Scholar, 14Cong F. Yuan B. Goff S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8314-8325Google Scholar, 15Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Google Scholar). dok-1 is also expressed at significant, although reduced levels in nonhematopoietic tissues (9Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Google Scholar, 10Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Google Scholar, 16Lemay S. Rabb H. Postler G. Singh A.K. Transplantation. 2000; 69: 959-963Google Scholar). These three molecules can serve as substrates for cytosolic tyrosine kinases of the Abl and Src families (15Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Google Scholar), which allows them to recruit Src homology 2 domain-containing molecules such as RasGAP, Csk, and SHIP-1 (9Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Google Scholar, 15Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Google Scholar). In addition, Dok-1 and/or Dok-2 may be phosphorylated by a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) including macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (17Heidaran M.A. Molloy C.J. Pangelinan M. Choudhury G.G. Wang L.M. Fleming T.P. Sakaguchi A.Y. Pierce J.H. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 147-152Google Scholar), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (18Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.Y.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32781-32790Google Scholar), and c-Kit (23van Dijk T.B. van Den Akker E. Amelsvoort M.P. Mano H. Lowenberg B. von Lindern M. Blood. 2000; 96: 3406-3413Google Scholar), although the last seems to also require Src kinase activity (24Liang X. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Shivakrupa Clarkson B. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13732-13738Google Scholar). Dok-1 can also be phosphorylated in response to cell adhesion (19Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Google Scholar), presumably because its PTB domain interacts with various β-integrin chains (25Calderwood D.A. Fujioka Y. de Pereda J.M.

It is believed that IRS and Dok proteins function as docking molecules with regulated membrane-targeting properties (3White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Google Scholar, 21Zhao M. Schmitz A.A. Qin Y. Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P. Van Aelst L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 265-274Google Scholar, 23van Dijk T.B. van Den Akker E.

Whereas inducible membrane localization may be a common feature of these molecules, the mechanisms through which this occurs may vary. For instance, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-generated phosphoinositides seem necessary for membrane targeting and phosphorylation of Dok-1 in response to PDGF stimulation (21Zhao M. Schmitz A.A. Qin Y. Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P. Van Aelst L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 265-274Google Scholar), but they are not involved in IRS-1 recruitment to the insulin receptor. Moreover, among the different members of the IRS family, distinct patterns of intracellular distribution have been observed (6Anai M. Ono H. Funaki M. Fukushima Y. Inukai K. Ogihara T. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29686-29692Google Scholar). The PH domain of Dok-1 is necessary and sufficient for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated membrane translocation (21Zhao M. Schmitz A.A. Qin Y. Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P. Van Aelst L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 265-274Google Scholar), and the PH domain of IRS-1 appears equally important in subcellular targeting and function (34Jacobs A.R. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40795-40802Google Scholar, 35Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Google Scholar). PH domains form a family of highly divergent amino acid sequences with a remarkably conserved tridimensional structure (reviewed in Ref. 36Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 39-74Google Scholar). They are generally believed to bind phospholipids and as such serve as membrane-targeting domains. Some PH domains, such as that of Btk, display specificity for binding products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase metabolism (37Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Google Scholar), which allows their membrane localization to be regulated (38Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Google Scholar). However, unlike that of Btk, most PH domains studied so far bind phospholipids with low affinity and specificity (39Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Google Scholar), and the identity of their physiological ligands therefore remains controversial (40Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has been postulated that either post-translational modification (such as serine/threonine or tyrosine phosphorylation) or oligomerization might enable low affinity PH domain-containing molecules to bind membranes with more avidity (40Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Google Scholar). PTB domains are structurally related to PH domains (41Borg J.P. Margolis B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 23-38Google Scholar, 42Blomberg N. Baraldi E. Nilges M. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 441-445Google Scholar). Like PH domains, some PTB domains may bind phospholipids (43Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Google Scholar, 44Ravichandran K.S. Zhou M.M. Pratt J.C. Harlan J.E. Walk S.F. Fesik S.W. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5540-5549Google Scholar), although they mainly serve as protein-protein interaction modules (1Schlessinger J. Lemmon M.A. Science's STKE.http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2003/191/re12Date: 2003Google Scholar, 45Forman-Kay J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 690-695Google Scholar). Whereas the typical target peptide initially described for the PTB domains of Shc and IRS-1 is a phosphorylated NPXY sequence (46Zhou S. Margolis B. Chaudhuri M. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14863-14866Google Scholar, 47Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Google Scholar), it has more recently been recognized that many PTB domains can bind peptide sequences in a phosphorylation-independent (48Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Google Scholar) or in a tyrosine-independent manner (49Charest A. Wagner J. Jacob S. McGlade C.J. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8424-8429Google Scholar, 50Ong S.H. Guy G.R. Hadari Y.R. Laks S. Gotoh N. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 979-989Google Scholar, 51Meyer D. Liu A. Margolis B. J.

Whereas PH and PTB domains co-exist in IRS and Dok family proteins, a related adapter molecule, FRS2, possesses a myristoylation signal instead of a PH domain (53Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Google Scholar), presumably bypassing the requirement for PtdIns binding in membrane targeting. In contrast to IRS family members and other RTK-associated adapter molecules, which are generally involved in signal amplification, Dok family molecules have been shown to function primarily as inhibitors of tyrosine kinase signaling (14Cong F. Yuan B. Goff S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8314-8325Google Scholar, 15Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Google Scholar, 26Tamir I. Stolpa J.C.

Zhao M. Karnell F.G. Clarkson B. Pear W.S. Van Aelst L. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 275-284Google Scholar). Since Dok molecules had been found to be prominent Src kinase substrates in hematopoietic cells, we hypothesized that additional nonhematopoietic family members might also exist to serve as substrates downstream of these ubiquitously expressed kinases. In the current study, we present evidence that a novel Dok family member, Dok-4, is expressed prominently in epithelial cells and can be phosphorylated by a number of tyrosine kinases, including Src family members. The structural basis of Dok-4 tyrosine phosphorylation was studied as well as its relationship to intracellular localization. Surprisingly, we found that Dok-4 was constitutively membrane-associated in mammalian cells as well as in yeast, through a mechanism that required both its PH and PTB domains. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-4 also required an intact PH and PTB domain. Finally, Dok-4 inhibited the tyrosine kinase-induced activation of the transcription factor Elk-1, suggesting that inhibitory signaling is a general property of Dok family molecules. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—RNase protection assays were performed essentially as described previously (15Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Google Scholar, 54Lemay S. Mao C. Singh A.K. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 85-93Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Radiolabeled antisense RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription (Promega kit) of appropriate cDNA templates in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The templates for probe synthesis were as follows. For dok-4, pBluescriptSK-D4RPA was prepared by subcloning the EcoRI/XmnI fragment from expressed sequence tag (EST) W85217 (a putative splice variant of dok-4 containing a 62-bp deletion compared with wild-type dok-4) into the EcoRI/SmaI sites of the pBluescriptSK vector. After linearization with EcoRI and transcription with T3 RNA polymerase, this resulted in a probe of ∼325 nucleotides when undigested. Because of the internal position of its 62-bp deletion (presumably allowing loop formation in the sense RNA transcripts with full protection of some antisense probes), this probe resulted in RNase-protected fragments of 255 and 211 nucleotides when hybridized to full-length dok-4 (data not shown). For dok-5, a template containing nucleotides -9 to 293 of murine dok-5 was derived from plasmid pPCR-Script-Dok-5 (see below) by BglII/EcoRI digestion and vector religation. After linearization with NotI and transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, the resulting probe had ∼395 nucleotides when undigested and 302 nucleotides when RNase-protected. A probe for the L32 riboprotein transcript (template from BD Pharmingen; 141 nucleotides undigested, 112 nucleotides protected) was included with each dok-4 and dok-5 hybridization reaction to ensure equal loading. Each sample contained 25 μg of total RNA obtained from organs of adult CD-1 mice using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Cloning of dok-4 and dok-5—The full-length murine dok-4 cDNA was obtained from EST AA111459 and later cloned independently by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from mouse kidney RNA to confirm the sequence. The oligonucleotides used to clone dok-4 were AACCATGGCGACCAATTTCA (4-3) and CAGCTCCTCGAGGCTGTC (4-2). The full-length murine dok-5 cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR cloning using oligonucleotides derived from the consensus sequence of ESTs AK012430 and AU051646 as follows. First, mouse brain total RNA was reverse transcribed using oligonucleotide GAAAATCACACAAATCCACA (6-4). An initial PCR was performed using oligonucleotides AAAGTGGCTGCTGGGCG (6-7) and 6-4 (see above), followed by a second nested PCR with oligonucleotides CTGTCTGGGATGGCTTCCAA (6-5) and 6-4. All PCR products were blunt-ended and cloned in the SrfI site of the pPCR-Script vector (Stratagene). All constructs were fully sequenced (Sheldon Biotechnology Centre, McGill University). Cells—COS-1 and 293 cells as well as primary mouse mesangial cells (from Dr. D. Baran) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing pyridoxine-HCl and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Caco-2 human colon cancer cells (from Dr. C. Stanners) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum. Differentiated Caco-2 cells were obtained by keeping fully confluent monolayers in culture for 14 days with medium change every 2-3 days. LLC-PK1 cells (from Dr. J. Orlowski) were grown in RPMI 1640 with 6% fetal bovine serum. MDCK cells (from ATCC) were grown in minimal essential medium containing Earle's salts, NaHCO3, nonessential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. Parental and cytosolic phospholipase A2-transfected rat glomerular epithelial cells (GEC and GEC-cPLA2, from Dr. A. Cybulsky) were grown in K1 medium as described previously (55Takano T. Cybulsky A.V. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 2091-2101Google Scholar). RT-PCR Expression Studies—RNA was extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Human umbilical vein endothelial cell total RNA was obtained from Dr. M.-J. Hébert. Glomerular RNA was obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats after differential sieving of a kidney cortex preparation (55Takano T. Cybulsky A.V. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 2091-2101Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen) in the presence of oligo(dT)12-18 primer. For dok-4, the primer sequences were AACCATGGCGACCAATTTCA (4-3) and ATAGCTGGAGGCTTCAGC (4-10). The sequences of the β-actin oligonucleotides (derived from the rat sequence) were AGCCATGTACGTAGCCATCC (β-actin sense) and GCCATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTC (β-actin antisense). The size of the expected PCR products was 862 bp for dok-4 and 298 bp for β-actin. The PCRs were performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) under the following conditions: 1.5 mm MgCl2, 52 °C annealing temperature, 30 cycles (for dok-4) or 28 cycles (for β-actin). Aliquots of PCRs representing ∼80 ng of initial RNA were loaded for agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNAs—The human PDGFR-β cDNA cloned in the pCDNA3 vector was from Dr. S. Meloche. The human wild-type and activated (C634R) Ret cDNA (from Dr. Lois Mulligan) were subcloned in the pCDNA3.1 vector. The pCI-IGF-IR plasmid was from Dr. D. LeRoith. The pME18S vectors containing cDNAs for mouse Fyn (wild-type and kinase-negative), Src, and Csk were from Dr. T. Yamamoto. The Jak2 cDNA cloned in vector pRK5 was from Dr. J. Ihle. The murine Dok-1 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Y. Yamanashi. The pFC-MEKK1 plasmid containing the activated (N-terminal deletion mutant) of MEKK1 was purchased from Stratagene. Mammalian Expression Constructs for Dok Proteins—The dok-4 cDNA originally cloned in pPCR-Script vector (see above) was sub-cloned in the pCDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). All sequence modifications were performed by PCR using the proofreading Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Dok-1 and Dok-4 were tagged with a Myc epitope by replacing their stop codon with an in-frame Hind III site and cloning in the pCDNA3.1(-)Myc-His A vector (Invitrogen). A Myc-tagged Dok-5 construct was also created with the same vector after replacing the stop codon with an in-frame KpnI site. The antisense oligonucleotides used for these three constructs were, respectively, as follows: TTAAGCTTGGTGGAACCCTCAGACTT (Dok-1 Myc), TTAAGCTTCTGGGCAGGGGTCTTGG (Dok-4 Myc), and ATATAGGTACCGTGCTCAGACCGGTAGGT (Dok-5 Myc) (restriction sites underlined). The Dok-4 Myc ΔCT mutant (deletion of amino acids 234-325) was created with the antisense oligonucleotide CTGTATAAGCTTCTGCTCGGCGATGGCCAG (D4ΔCT). Dok-4 ΔPH (deletion of amino acids 1-99) was generated with the sense oligonucleotide CAACCATGGCGACCAATTTCAACGCAGAAGAGTGGTACAAG (D4ΔPH). The PCR product was cloned in pPCR-Script with the initiation codon toward the EcoRI site. The EcoRI/PpuMI fragment resulting from this was used to replace the corresponding sequence in pCDNA3.1-Dok-4 Myc. Dok-4 Myc Myr-ΔPH (substitution of amino acids 1-99 of Dok-4 by amino acids 1-6 of FRS2 (53Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Google Scholar)) was generated with the sense oligonucleotide TATGAATTCACCATGGGCTCATGTTGTTCGGCAGAAGAGTGGTACAA (EcoRI site underlined), followed by EcoRI/PpuMI exchange as above. Dok-4 Myc ΔPTB (deletion of amino acids 100-233) was generated by overlap PCR using the sense oligonucleotide TCAGAGCTGGAGCACAAGCGGGTCCTGCTG and the antisense oligonucleotide GACCCGCTTGTGCTCCAGCTCTGAGTCACA. The BGHR antisense and T7 sense oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) derived from pCDNA3.1 were used to complete the reactions. The final PCR product was used for an EcoRI/PpuMI exchange as above. For fusion of Dok molecules to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), the NheI/HindIII inserts from pCDNA3.1Myc constructs were cloned in-frame in the NheI/HindIII sites of pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Dok-4 PH-EGFP (fusion of amino acids 1-108 of Dok-4 to EGFP) was obtained by PCR amplification with the antisense oligonucleotide TATAAAGCTTGGACAGTGTCTTGATCCA (HindIII site underlined) and cloning of the resulting NheI/HindIII in pEGFP-N1. The Dok-1 Myc Y146F mutant was generated using overlap PCR with oligonucleotides GAGAATTCGCTGTTCAGCCCCACCTGG (D1Y146F sense) and CCAGGTGGGGCTGAACAGCGAATTCTC (D1Y146F antisense), completed by BGHR and T7 (see above). COS Cell Tranfections—One day prior to transfection, COS-1 cells were trypsinized and plated on 100-mm culture dishes at a density of ∼25%. Transfection was performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in a ratio of 3 μl per μg of plasmid. After overnight incubation, 1 volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal bovine serum and 2× penicillin/streptomycin was added. The next morning, cells were washed in PBS, collected by scraping, and lysed in ice-cold immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer. Where applicable, stimulation with IGF-IR was performed with the addition of human IGF-IR (PeproTech) (100 ng/ml) prior to lysis. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies against the Myc epitope (9E10; sc-40), as well as polyclonal antibodies against Fyn (sc-16), Csk (sc-286), Ret (sc-167), PDGFR-β (sc-432), and Dok-1 (sc-6934) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (used for all anti-Myc immunoblots) was from Cell Signaling. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10), as well as anti-Src and anti-Jak2 polyclonal antibodies, were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Dok-4 antiserum was generated by immunizing rabbits with a bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing amino acids 234-325 of Dok-4, a strategy similar to that previously employed to obtain anti-Dok-1, -2, and -3 antisera (15Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed on ice in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrosphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A. IP was performed by the addition of either 1 or 2 μg of affinity-purified antibody or 5 μl of Dok-4 antiserum followed by 8 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For monoclonal antibodies, protein A-agarose was precoupled to 5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). After three washes, immunoprecipitates were eluted in 1× Laemmli buffer, boiled, and resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond P; Amersham Biosciences), and immunodetection was performed according to a standard protocol using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and ECL or ECL Plus detection solutions (Amersham Biosciences). Inducible Expression of Dok-4-EGFP in 293 Cells—293 cells were stably transfected with the pVgRXR vector (Invitrogen) and selected in zeomycin (300 μg/ml). Individual clones confirmed to overexpres"

In addition to its critical function in fibrinolysis, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 has been implicated in roles in other physiological and pathophysiological processes. To investigate structure-function aspects of mouse plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Five variant recombinant murine proteins (R76E, Q123K, R346A, R101A, and Q123K/R101A) were also generated using site-directed mutagenesis. The variant (R346A) was found to be defective in its inhibitory activity against tissue plasminogen activator relative to its wild-type counterpart. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated reduced vitronectin-binding affinity of the (Q123K) variant (KD = 1800 nm) relative to the wild-type protein (KD = 5.4 nm). Kinetic analyses indicated that the (Q123K) variant had a slower association (kon = 2.92 × 104m-1 s-1) to, and a faster dissociation from, vitronectin (koff = 5.3 × 10-2 s-1), (wild-type kon = 1.03 × 106m-1 s-1 and koff = 5.27 × 10-3 s-1). The Q123K/R101A variant demonstrated an even lower vitronectin-binding ability. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein binding was decreased for the (R76E) variant. It was also demonstrated that the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1/vitronectin complex decreased the interaction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. These results indicate that the complex interactions traditionally associated with different plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 functions apply to the murine system, thus showing a commonality of subtle functions among different species and evolutionary conservation of this protein. Further, this study provides additional evidence that the human hemostasis system can be studied effectively in the mouse, which is a great asset for investigations with gene-altered mice.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 1The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; SERPIN, serine protease inhibitor; uPA, urokinase; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; VN, vitronectin; uPAR, urokinase receptor; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; sctPA, single-chain tPA; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; WT, wild-type; NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; pNA, p-nitroaniline; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RU, response units; RCL, reactive center loop. 1The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; SERPIN, serine protease inhibitor; uPA, urokinase; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; VN, vitronectin; uPAR, urokinase receptor; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; sctPA, single-chain tPA; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; WT, wild-type; NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; pNA, p-nitroaniline; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RU, response units; RCL, reactive center loop. is a member of the serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) superfamily and is the primary physiological regulator of urokinase (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity (1Von Mourik J.A. Lawrence D.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14914-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivation of these latter proteases with PAI-1 is mediated through high affinity interactions, resulting in the formation of stable serpin-protease complexes (2Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Colman R.W. Hirsch J. Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, PA1987: 358Google Scholar). PAI-1 has two major conformations, an active and a latent form. PAI-1 is a labile protein unless complexed with the plasma protein, vitronectin (VN), which stabilizes PAI-1 in an active form (3Declerck P.J. DeMol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Otherwise, PAI-1 would be converted to a latent conformation and become inactivated. VN is also present in the extracellular matrix of many tissues and may serve to selectively localize PAI-1 function (3Declerck P.J. DeMol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The urokinase receptor (uPAR) also binds to VN, and the N-terminal region of this matrix protein contains the binding domain for both of these proteins (4Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 13: 1563-1571Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Occupancy of the receptor by uPA results in an increased affinity for VN (5Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol.

Colocalization of this complex with integrins is the result of RGD-containing binding sites for αv integrins in VN, which are located adjacent to the N-terminal domain of VN (7Suzuki S. Oldberg A. Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This complex can lead to local dissolution of extracellular matrix protein through activation of a proteolytic cascade. Regulation of this process occurs as a result of active PAI-1 sterically interfering with binding of either uPAR or integrin to VN (4Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 13: 1563-1571Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 8Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 9Loskutoff D.J. Curriden S.A. Hu G. Deng G. APMIS. 1999; 107: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Additionally, the interaction of PAI-1 with the surface-associated uPA-uPAR complex induces internalization of the complex via interaction with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (10Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). This process alters cytoplasmic signaling via uPA-uPAR. Because cell proliferation relies on a cycle of cell attachment, spreading, flattening (to initiate DNA synthesis), and then rounding up (the latter property resulting from disengagement of cell contacts through dissolution of the matrix), it would seem that alterations in PAI-1 expression could have a profound effect upon these cellular events.Previous in vitro studies have elaborated structure/function relationships of human PAI-1, resulting in the delineation of functional domains that play a significant role in regulating its pathophysiology. Identification of critical sequences within specific domains has been achieved through structural and site-directed mutagenesis studies. For example, it is now known that human PAI-1 can inhibit VN-mediated cell adhesion and migration through interaction with VN. Sequences within human PAI-1, specifically encompassing the region 110-147, primarily localized in the α helix E, have been identified that mediate this interaction (11Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palanniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Arroyo De Prada N. Schroeck F. Sinner E.K. Muehlenweg B. Twellmeyer J. Speri S. Wilhelm O.G. Schmitt M. Magdolen V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Further, a mutation at amino acid 123 (Q → K) has been shown to maintain PAI-1 serpin activity, but to significantly reduce affinity for VN (11Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palanniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, an R → A mutation at position 346, a critical residue in the reactive center loop, leads to a variant that interacts with the active site of target proteases, binds VN normally, but does not inhibit plasminogen activation (8Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In terms of LRP interactions, a cryptic site within the heparin-binding domain was identified (13Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An R → E mutation at amino acid position 76 of PAI-1 within this domain results in a protein with preserved inhibitor activity but diminished affinity for LRP. These targeted mutations of human PAI-1 indicate that functional changes at sites other than those specifically targeted are minor and, therefore, are ideal for delineating specific functional domains in select biological processes involving PAI-1. This study was aimed at an exploration of these functional domains in the murine PAI-1 through the expression and characterization of site-specific mutations in recombinant murine PAI-1. One practical value of this work is to evaluate the commonality of these subtle functions of PAI-1 across species, with special emphasis on the murine system, which is so widely employed for in vivo studies of PAI-1. The results of this investigation are described herein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, reverse transcriptase, and TaqDNA polymerase were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), unless otherwise specified. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech (High Point, NC). The gel purification, PCR product purification, and plasmid mini/midi preparation kits were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The chromogenic substrates H-d-Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA (S-2288) and pyro Glu-Phe-Lys-pNA (S-2403) were purchased from Chromogenix AB (West Chester, OH). Human VN, purified under non-denaturing conditions, was obtained from Promega. Human recombinant single-chain tPA (sctPA) was obtained from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). Human LRP was a gift from Dr. Dudley Strickland of the American Red Cross, and human PAI-1 and PAI-1 mutants were generated as described earlier (8Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 11Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palanniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol.

The data were analyzed by either Origin version 7.0 (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA) or GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) software.Construction of Mouse PAI-1 Variant Expression Vectors—The coding region of WT mouse PAI-1 (amino acid region 24-402, Swiss-Prot primary accession no. P22777) was cloned in-frame with an N-terminal His6 tag into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET15-b (Novagen, Madison, WI) using Nde-I/BamH-I sites. This construct lacks nucleotides encoding the first 23 amino acids that are thought to be the secretory signal region. The forward primer was 5′-GGAATTCCATCATATGTTTACCCCTCCGAGAA-3′. The reverse primer was 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAAGGCTCCATCAC-3′. The plasmids were transformed into DH5α competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The sequences were verified by DNA sequencing performed by the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Center (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL). Mouse PAI-1 variants were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described in the manual, using the following oligonucleotides: R76E mutation forward primer, 5′-GGCACAGCTCATGCCCTCGAGCAGCTCTCCAAGGAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCTCCTTGGAGAGCTGCTCGAGGGCATGAGCTGTGC-3′; Q123K mutation forward primer, 5′-TTCCAGACTATGGTGAAAAAGGTGGACTTCTCAGAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CCTCTGAGAAGTCCACCTTTTTCACCATAGTCTGGA-3; R346A mutation forward primer, 5′-GCCTTTGTCATCTCAGCCGCCATGGCCCCCACGGAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTCCGTGGGGGCCATGGCTGAGATGACAAAGG-3′; R101A mutation forward primer, 5′-CTTTGTCCAGGCCGATCTAGAGCTGGTCCAGGGCTT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GAAGCCCTGGACCAGCTCTAGATCGGCCTGGACAAA-3′. The Q123K/R101A double mutation was generated by using Q123K as a template. A new restriction site was incorporated into the primers to facilitate screening. The integrity of all mutant clones selected for protein expression was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Murine PAI-1 Proteins—Vectors containing mouse WT or variant murine PAI-1 were transformed into the E. coli expression strain BL21/DE3 (Novagen, Madison, WI). Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by adding isopropyl thio-b-d-galactoside (final concentration, 1 mm), into the cell suspension pregrown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to A600 = 0.4-0.5. The induced cells were grown at 37 °C for another 3 h and then harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were stored at -70 °C. For purification of the recombinant proteins, the cell pellets were re-suspended in BugBuster™ reagent (5 ml/gram pellet weight) (Novagen). Benzonase (1 μl/ml) was added to reduce viscosity and to remove nucleic acids. The insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The soluble PAI-1-containing supernatants were applied to an affinity chromatography column using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) agarose (Qiagen) resin. The column was then extensively washed with 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% Tween 80 (v/v), 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% Tween 80 (v/v), 10-150 mm imidazole gradient, pH 7.0. Fractions containing PAI-1 were pooled and subjected to gel-filtration chromatography using Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) to desalt proteins and to change the buffer to 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Pooled mouse PAI-1 preparations (except for the R76E variant) were further purified by heparin-agarose (Sigma) chromatography. Proteins were eluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with a 0-1 M NaCl gradient. (R76E)-PAI-1 was purified by a second NTA chromatography. The purified recombinant proteins were denatured with 4 m guanidinium-HCl and then refolded by extensive dialysis against 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% Tween 80 (v/v), pH 7.0. The proteins were subsequently concentrated by Centricon centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Protein concentrations were determined by Micro BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Proteins were assessed for purity and size by SDS-10% PAGE under non-reducing conditions and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Expression and purification of mouse PAI-1 variants were confirmed by Western blotting employing a polyclonal rabbit-anti-rat-PAI-1-IgG (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) as the primary antibody and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit-IgG (H+L) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) as the secondary antibody. The chromogen, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium was used for detection. The molecular weights of purified proteins were determined by ProteinChip (Ciphergen, Fremont, CA) using the Au chip.Inhibitory Activity Assay—The inhibitory activity of PAI-1 toward tPA was determined by the Coatest™ PAI-1 assay (Chromogenix, West Chester, OH). Briefly, a fixed amount of tPA was added in excess to undiluted plasma, in which a portion rapidly forms an inactive complex with PAI-1. Plasminogen was then activated to plasmin by the residual tPA in the presence of a stimulator (fibrinogen degradation products). The amount of plasmin formed was directly proportional to the residual tPA activity and, hence, inversely proportional to the PAI-1 activity in the sample. The amount of plasmin was determined by measuring the amidolytic activity with the chromogenic substrate, S-2403. The release of p-nitroaniline (pNA) was then determined by the absorbancy at 405 nm.ELISA Assays—The capturing ligand, VN or LRP, was diluted to a concentration of 1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4,2mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). To coat the plates, 100 μl/well of ligand was added to a NuncMaxiSorp 96-well microtiter plate (Fisher) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, the plate was blocked with 5% dried milk dissolved in washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 80 (v/v)) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed 3× with washing buffer, and PAI-1 variants were added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. For studies involving analyses of PAI-1/tPA or PAI-1/VN complex interactions with LRP, 20 nm of each were incubated for 15 min at room temperature prior to addition to the LRP-coated plates. After three additional washings, the amount of PAI-1 captured by immobilized VN or LRP was visualized by addition of the primary antibody, polyclonal rabbit-anti-rat-PAI-1-IgG, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit-IgG (H+L) secondary antibody. The chromogen, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma), was used for detection. The absorbancy was measured at 405 nm and normalized against readings from noncoated wells.Characterization of Mouse PAI-1 Variants by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—The binding of label-free PAI-1 variants to VN was analyzed by SPR using a BIAcore™ 3000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were performed at 25 °C employing HBS-EP (10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20, pH 7.4) as running buffer at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. VN (20 μg/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 4.0) was coupled to sensor chip CM-5 utilizing an amine-coupling kit (BIAcore AB) through the BIAcore flow cell at a rate of 5 ml/min for 6 min, resulting in ∼3,000 response units (RUs) immobilized. The binding reactions were then carried out by injecting various concentrations of PAI-1 (diluted with running buffer) to the immobilized chip surface. Binding levels were determined by monitoring the resulting signal expressed as RUs. Between experiments, the chip surfaces were regenerated by washing with 30 μl of 0.1 mm HCl, pH < 2.0, which did not alter the binding properties of the VN-immobilized chips. The data from sensorgrams were subtracted from those of a reference flow cell prepared by the same method, with the exception that VN was not immobilized on the chip. Kinetic constants were calculated from the association and dissociation rate curves generated by applying different concentrations of analytes onto ligand-immobilized surfaces, using a 1:1 binding model. All of the sensorgrams were analyzed utilizing the BioEvaluation software package version 3.0 (BIAcore AB).Measurement of the Functional Half-life—PAI-1 was diluted to 20 μg/ml in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG-8000, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. The inhibitory activity against sctPA, at t = 0, was designated as 100% activity. The proteins were then incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at various times and the remaining sctPA inhibitory activity was determined and converted to percent relative to time zero.RESULTSPurification of PAI-1 Proteins—Typical final yields for recombinant WT PAI-1 were 3.8 mg/liter of culture. Yields for the variants were slightly better at 4.0-4.8 mg/liter of culture. Fig. 1 represents SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses of the WT and the five variant (R76E, Q123K, R101A, Q123K/R101A, and R346A) proteins.Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Function—Analyses were performed on the purified rPAI-1 proteins with respect to their plasminogen activator inhibitory activity. The human and murine homologues of Q123K, R76E, and murine R101A and R101A/Q123K retain inhibitory activity, whereas murine and human (R346A)-PAI-1 demonstrated a significant reduction in activity (Fig. 2), confirming a conserved functional domain between the human and murine molecules with respect to inhibitory activity.Fig. 2Comparative analyses of plasminogen activator inhibitory activity of WT murine and human rPAI-1 and variants. Inhibitory activity was determined using single-chain tPA in a chromogenic assay. The relative levels of inhibitory activities of WT murine and human recombinant PAI-1 were considered to be 100%. The inhibitory activity of the variants was expressed as a percentage of WT PAI-1 activity. Assays were performed in four replicates, and values are expressed as the means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)VN Binding by ELISA—The VN-binding capacity of the Q123K, R101A, and Q123K/R101A variants of PAI-1 were compared with the WT protein and the other two PAI-1 variants (R76E and R346A) by ELISA. (Q123K)-PAI-1 demonstrated impaired binding capacity to VN relative to the WT protein and the other two variants (Fig. 3), which is similar to the human protein studies. Additionally, (R101A)-PAI-1 and the double mutation (R101A/Q123K)-PAI-1 demonstrated even lower VN-binding abilities.Fig. 3VN-binding ability of WT murine rPAI-1 and its variants. The VN-binding ability was examined by ELISA. (Q123K)PAI-1 variant demonstrated impaired VN-binding ability compared with WT PAI-1 (p < 0.005, n = 20). (R101A)PAI-1 and (Q123K/R101A)PAI-1 demonstrated even lower VN-binding abilities. Assays were performed at least in triplicate and are expressed as the mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kinetic Characterization of Murine rPAI-1 WT and Q123K Binding to VN by SPR—Approximately 3000 RUs of VN were immobilized onto a CM5 chip using an amine-coupling method. Various amounts of rPAI-1 were then injected onto the surface, and the binding levels were detected in real time (Fig. 4A). A KD value for the interaction of murine WT PAI-1 with VN (KD = 5.4 nm) was determined by nonlinear regression fitting of steady-state binding (Fig. 4B). The association progress curves of WT PAI-1 binding were fit by a nonlinear single-exponential function to obtain the value of kobs. The kon was then determined by linear fitting of kobs as a function of PAI-1 concentrations (Fig. 4C). Murine (Q123K)-PAI-1/VN binding at steady state was used to determine the KD value (KD = 1800 nm) (Fig. 4D). The kon was determined from the association phase of (Q123K)-PAI-1/VN binding curves and then used to calculate the koff value (Fig. 4E). Murine (Q123K)-PAI-1 demonstrated slower association (kon = 2.92 × 104m-1 s-1) and faster dissociation (koff = 5.3 × 10-2 s-1) compared with WT murine PAI-1 (kon = 1.03 × 106m-1 s-1; koff = 5.27 × 10-3 s-1). Similar values were obtained for the equivalent human PAI-1 variants (Fig. 4F).Fig. 4Kinetic analyses of WT and (Q123K)PAI-1/VN interactions by SPR analyses. 20 μg/ml of VN was injected onto a CM5 sensor chip at a speed of 5 μl/min for 6 min. Approximately 3000 RUs of VN were immobilized by using an amine-coupling method. Various amounts of rPAI-1 were then injected onto the surface of the chip at a speed of at least 20 μl/min, and the binding levels were detected in real time by SPR. A, kinetic characterization of WT murine rPAI-1 binding to VN. WT murine PAI-1 demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of binding. B, KD value of WT murine PAI-1/VN binding was determined by nonlinear regression fitting of the steady-state binding. C, the association progress curves were nonlinearly fit by a single-exponential function to obtain the value of kobs. The kon constant was then determined by linear fitting of kobs as a function of PAI-1 concentrations. Insert, association progress curves at different PAI-1 concentrations. D, (Q123K)PAI-1/VN binding at various protein concentrations. The KD value of murine (Q123K)PAI-1/VN binding demonstrated more than a 300-fold difference relative to WT murine PAI-1. E, the kon value was determined from the association phase of (Q123K)PAI-1/VN binding and then used to calculate the koff value. These values demonstrated slower association and faster dissociation relative to WT murine rPAI-1. F, kinetic constants of the PAI-1/VN interaction. Murine (Q123K)PAI-1 demonstrated a slower association and a faster dissociation compared with the WT protein. Furthermore, these values are comparable with their human counterparts, indicating conservation of the VN-binding domain in murine PAI-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LRP-binding Abilities of Murine PAI-1 Variants—The LRP-binding capacities of the altered PAI-1 forms were determined by ELISA experiments. (R76E)-PAI-1 demonstrated impaired LRP-binding ability, indicating that the LRP-binding domain was present in murine PAI-1 (Fig. 5A). Also, the PAI-1 variants were denatured by dialysis against 4 m guanidinium-HCl and then refolded by removing denaturant. At least a fraction of the PAI-1-binding activity was enhanced by this unfolding/refolding process (Fig. 5A, gray columns). Active PAI-1 demonstrated a higher LRP-binding ability than the latent form. PAI-1, in association with its protease substrate, tPA, also demonstrated enhanced association with LRP (Fig. 5B). VN decreased the LRP-binding ability of murine PAI-1 (Fig. 5C). This is most likely the result of steric hindrance due to the close proximity of the VN and LRP-binding sites.Fig. 5LRP-binding ability of WT murine PAI-1 and its variants. The LRP-binding capacity of WT PAI-1 and its variants was determined by ELISA experiments. A, (R76E)PAI-1 demonstrated impaired LRP-binding ability, indicating that LRP-binding domain was conserved in murine PAI-1. Also, PAI-1 variants were denatured by dialysis against 4 m guanidinium-HCl and then refolded by removing the denaturant. An increase in the PAI-1/LRP interaction was observed by this unfolding/refolding process (gray columns) relative to proteins that did not undergo the unfolding/refolding process (black columns). B, the LRP-binding ability of PAI-1 is increased if murine PAI-1 initially forms a complex with its protease substrates (gray columns) relative to PAI-1 alone (black columns). For the R346A mutant, the LRP-binding ability did not increase because its substrate-binding ability is impaired. C, VN decreases the LRP-binding ability of murine PAI-1 (gray columns) relative to PAI-1 alone (black columns). Because VN- and LRP-binding sites are in close proximity, this effect may be due to steric hindrance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stability of Murine rPAI-1 Variants—The inhibitory activity against sctPA at t = 0 was designated as 100%.

https://openalex.org/W1978075691,"The Y1250F/Y1251F mutant of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) has tyrosines 1250 and 1251 mutated to phenylalanines and is deficient in IGF-I-mediated suppression of apoptosis in FL5.12 lymphocytic cells. To address the mechanism of loss of function in this mutant we investigated signaling responses in FL5.12 cells overexpressing either a wild-type (WT) or Y1250F/Y1251F (mutant) IGF-IR. Cells expressing the mutant receptor were deficient in IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of the JNK pathway and had decreased ERK and p38 phosphorylation. IGF-I induced phosphorylation of Akt was comparable in WT and mutant expressing cells. The decreased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways was accompanied by greatly decreased Ras activation in response to IGF-I. Although phosphorylation of Gab2 was similar in WT and mutant cell lines, phosphorylation of Shc on Tyr313 in response to IGF-I was decreased in cells expressing the mutant receptor, as was recruitment of Grb2 and Ship to Shc. However, phosphorylation of Shc on Tyr239, the Src phosphorylation site, was normal. A role for JNK in the survival of FL5.12 cells was supported by the observation that the JNK inhibitor SP600125 suppressed IGF-I-mediated protection from apoptosis. Altogether these data demonstrate that phosphorylation of Shc, and assembly of the Shc complex necessary for activation of Ras and the MAPK pathways are deficient in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant IGF-IR. This would explain the loss of IGF-I-mediated survival in FL5.12 cells expressing this mutant and may also explain why this mutant IGF-IR is deficient in functions associated with cellular transformation and cell migration in fibroblasts and epithelial tumor cells.

A double tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant Y1250F/Y1251F displays a very dramatic phenotype, in that cells expressing this mutant are completely deficient in suppression of apoptosis by IGF-I in response to IL-3 withdrawal, serum deprivation, or activation of c-Myc (6O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G.I. Baserga R. Blattler W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Google Scholar). The Y1250F/Y1251F mutant receptor is competent for mitogenic activity, but is also deficient in anchorage-independent growth (21Miura M. Surmacz E. Burgaud J.L. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22639-22644Google Scholar), and cells expressing it have altered cytoskeletal organization (22Blakesley V.A. Koval A.P. Stannard B.S. Scrimgeour A. LeRoith D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33608-33615Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which mutation of these two tyrosines results in specific abrogation of IGF-IR function has not been elucidated. There is no evidence of their phosphorylation by the IGF-IR (23Peterson J.E. Kulik G. Jelinek T. Reuter C.W. Shannon J.A. Weber M.J. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 330: 923-932Google Scholar) leading to activation of the MAPK (ERK) pathway, which has been associated with cell proliferation and differentiation (28Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Google Scholar); as well as the PI 3-kinase (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathway that leads to activation of Akt, Bad (29Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Google Scholar), and other downstream targets that suppress apoptosis and promote growth. A mitochondrial-associated pool of Raf-1 leading to Bad phosphorylation (30Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Google Scholar), and the stress kinase (SAPK/JNK) family, have also been linked with IGF-IR-mediated survival signaling. P38 activity is associated with rescue of cells from DNA damage (31Heron-Milhavet L. Karas M. Goldsmith C.M. Baum B.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18185-18192Google Scholar), whereas both Akt and p38 activity and transient activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) in hematopoietic cells have been associated with protection from IL-3 withdrawal (32Krause D. Lyons A. Fennelly C. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19244-19252Google Scholar). In this article, we investigated the signaling potential of the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant IGF-IR compared with the wild-type receptor. We found that this mutant is deficient in IGF-I-mediated activation of the MAPK pathways including ERK, JNK, and p38. This was accompanied by greatly diminished activation of Ras by IGF-I stimulation. Investigation of proximal signaling events at the receptor revealed that phosphorylation of Shc was reduced on Tyr313, and this was accompanied by decreased recruitment of Grb2 and the SH2-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase Ship to Shc. The data indicate that the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant IGF-IR elicits deficient phosphorylation of Shc leading to reduced substrate recruitment and reduced activation of the Ras and MAPK pathways. Data from pharmacological inhibitors also suggest that JNK, as well as p38 and Akt, contributes to IGF-I-mediated survival in FL5.12 cells. Materials—Recombinant IGF-I was purchased from Pepro Technology Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). The anti-Akt, anti-phospho-ERK 1/2, anti-phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase-4 (MKK4), anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK, and anti-SAPK/JNK antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), as was the PhosphoPlus p38 MAPK (Tyr182) antibody kit. The anti-ERK2, anti-Gab2, anti-Grb2, anti-phospho-Jun (serine 73), anti-Shc (rabbit polyclonal), anti-phospho-Shc (Tyr239), anti-phospho-Shc (Tyr313), anti-Ship, and anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) antibodies, and the Ras activation assay kit (non-radioactive) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-JNKK1/MKK4 and anti-Shc (mouse monoclonal) were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Phosphospecific anti-Akt (pSer-473) was obtained from BioSource Europe, Nivelles, Belgium, and the anti-IGF-IR β-chain (C-20) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin (clone AC-15) was purchased from Sigma. The monoclonal IGF-IR (Ab-1) used for indirect immunofluoresence was from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). Immobilized protein G was purchased from Pierce. Goat anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibodies (peroxidase conjugates) were obtained from DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from Sigma. The JNK inhibitor II (SP600125) and the Src inhibitor PP2 were purchased from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). Cells Lines—FL5.12 cells that overexpress the wild type (FL5.12/WT) and mutant (FL5.12/Y1250F/Y1251F) IGF-IRs have been described previously (6O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G.I. Baserga R. Blattler W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (all from BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium), and 10% conditioned medium (CM) from the IL-3-producing cell line WEHI-3B. Indirect Immunofluoresence Assays—To measure expression levels of cell surface proteins FL5.12 cells (5 × 105) were removed from culture by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 μl of IMDM containing 25 mm Hepes, 10% horse serum, and 0.01% sodium azide (FACS buffer). A monoclonal anti-IGF-IR antibody reactive with the human IGF-IR (Ab-1) was added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Following 1 h incubation at room temperature cells were washed three times in FACS buffer. Cells were then incubated in 100 μl of FACS buffer containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mouse-specific secondary antibody in darkness at 4 °C for 30 min. Following this incubation, cells were again washed twice with FACS buffer, and the cell-associated fluorescence was quantified with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). Cell Viability and Inhibitor Assays—FL5.12/WT cells were cultured at 3 × 105 cells/ml in IMDM containing 10% FBS plus 10% WEHI-CM for 24 h, washed three times in serum-free medium, and then cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml in IMDM containing 5% FBS (2 ml/well) in 24-well plates. IGF-I (100 ng/ml) or IL-3 (10% WEHI-CM) was added to triplicate cultures. At the indicated time points, 200-μl aliquots were removed from each well and viability was determined by counting live and dead cells after trypan blue staining. The percentage of viable cells was calculated from the total number of cells per well, and all data are presented as the mean of triplicate cultures for each culture condition. Survival assays were performed in medium supplemented with 5% FBS to reduce the amount of endogenous IGF-I and IGF-II available in FBS that would mask the effects of exogenously added IGF-I. IGF-I- and IL-3-mediated suppression of apoptosis were also assayed in the presence of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (5–30 μm). This was added to cultures that were exposed to IGF-I, IL-3, or 5% FBS. Cell viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion over a 72-h time period, compared with controls without inhibitor measured at the same time, and the data are presented as described above. The Src inhibitor PP2 was obtained from Calbiochem and cells were pretreated for 30 min at a final concentration of 25 μm before stimulation with IGF-I. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—FL5.12 cells overexpressing WT and mutant forms of the IGF-IR were seeded at 4 × 105 cells/ml in IMDM containing complete medium and cultured for 24 h, washed three times in serum-free medium, and then starved for 3.5 h in serum-free medium. Following serum starvation, cells were stimulated with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) for various times, and then washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in ice-cold SDS-lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1% SDS, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.6). Debris was removed by centrifugation (20,800 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C, and samples were denatured by boiling in 5× Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schull, Dassel, Germany). Blots were blocked in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.6) with 5% milk for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were typically diluted 1/1000 in TBST, 5% goat serum or TBST, 5% milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) were used for detection by chemiluminescence with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperSignal reagent (Pierce). For immunoprecipitations cells were stimulated as above and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer that did not contain SDS (i.e. 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, protease inhibitors, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 15 min. Nuclei and cell debris were then removed by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Following protein estimation, lysates (typically 500 μg of protein per sample) were incubated with 3 μg of rabbit anti-Shc antibody or 5 μg of anti-Gab2 overnight at 4 °C, followed by addition of 20 μl of bovine serum albumin-coated protein G-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Samples were rocked gently during this procedure. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min. The beads were then boiled in 15 μl of 2× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer and proteins released into the sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein phosphorylation and proteins co-immunoprecipitating with Shc were identified using Western blotting as described above. Ras Activation Assay—The Ras Activation Assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology was used to measure IGF-I-mediated Ras activation. FL5.12 cells were cultured in complete medium, starved, and stimulated with IGF-I as described above. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in the supplied lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) to which 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotonin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate were added. Active Ras was precipitated from the lysates using Ras Assay Reagent (a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, corresponding to the human Ras binding domain of Raf-1, bound to glutathioneagarose beads), which specifically binds to and precipitates active Ras-GTP. Lysates and beads were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, then resuspended and boiled in 2× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer. Western blotting with anti-Ras was used for detection of bead-bound activated Ras. Positive and negative controls were prepared by in vitro labeling of samples with either GTPγS or GDP, respectively, prior to affinity precipitation. FL5.12 Cells Expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F IGF-IR Mutant Have Reduced Activation of JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPKs— FL5.12 cells expressing the wild-type IGF-IR can be effectively protected from apoptosis following IL-3 withdrawal by exogenously added IGF-I. By contrast, FL5.12 cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant display no IGF-I-mediated protection from apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Expression levels of wild-type and mutant receptors in these cells are equivalent (Fig. 1B). We have previously demonstrated that JNK, ERK, and Akt are phosphorylated in response to IGF-I stimulation in FL5.12/WT cells (32Krause D. Lyons A. Fennelly C. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19244-19252Google Scholar). To investigate differences in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant receptor we explored the ability of FL5.12/WT cells or FL5.12/Y1250F/Y1251F cells to activate these signaling pathways in response to stimulation with IGF-I. The PI 3-kinase pathway was activated to similar levels in both cell lines as indicated by Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Transient phosphorylation of the JNK pathway was diminished in FL5.12/Y1250F/Y1251F cells compared with FL5.12/WT cells. In addition activation of the ERK pathway was greatly reduced in Y1250F/Y1251F-expressing cells relative to FL5.12/WT cells as shown by phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 1D). We had previously observed constitutive phosphorylation of p38 in these cells with or without IGF-I. Here we observed that transient phosphorylation of p38 in response to IGF-I stimulation for up to 5 min is deficient in cells expressing the mutant (Fig. 1E). Together, these data indicate that mutation of tyrosines 1250 and 1251 results in reduced JNK, ERK, and p38 activation, whereas Akt activation is not affected. This suggests that decreased activity of the MAPK families contributes to the loss of anti-apoptotic activity seen in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant receptor. MKK4 and c-Jun Activation Is Inhibited in the Y1250F/Y1251F Mutant Expressing Cells—Although activation of JNK in response to IGF-I has previously been demonstrated in FL5.12 cells and other cells, very little is known about the contributions of the JNK pathway to IGF-I-mediated survival signaling or other functions. Because our data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant showed decreased JNK activation in FL5.12 cells we further investigated the activation status of other members of the Jun kinase-signaling pathway. Activation of Jun kinases is thought to occur in a hierarchy of phosphorylation steps via a cascade of MAPKs that may assemble in a complex or scaffold (33Barr R.K. Bogoyevitch M.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 1047-1063Google Scholar). MAPK kinase-4 (MKK4) lies directly upstream from JNK. Fig. 2 shows that phosphorylation of MKK4 in response to IGF-I was diminished in FL5.12/Y1250F/Y1251F cells compared with the FL5.12/WT cells. In addition, phosphorylation of the JNK substrate c-Jun was decreased in these cells. This indicates that activation of both an upstream and a downstream component of the JNK pathway is deficient in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant IGF-IR. Altogether the data indicate that activation of the JNK pathway is blocked in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant. This together with the decreased activation of ERK and p38 suggests that either a scaffolding protein or other upstream signaling molecules necessary for activating the MAPK cascades are not active in cells expressing this mutant. Ras Activation Is Decreased in FL5.12 Cells Expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F Mutant—Growth factor-mediated activation of the Ras superfamily of GTPases has been shown to contribute to activation of the MAPK and JNK pathways and contribute to growth, survival, transformation, and cytoskeletal organizations associated with cell movement (34Hochbaum D. Tanos T. Ribeiro-Neto F. Altschuler D. Coso O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33738-33746Google Scholar, 35Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to determine whether Ras activity was normal in FL5.12 cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant. To do this we probed cell lysates from IGF-I-stimulated cells for Ras activity using an assay for activated Ras that employs a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, corresponding to the human Ras binding domain of Raf-1, bound to glutathione-agarose. The results are shown in Fig. 3 and demonstrate that IGF-I-mediated activation of Ras peaks at 1 min in cells expressing the WT IGF-IR and that this activity is greatly diminished in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant receptor. The results also show that Ras protein is expressed in equivalent amounts in both cell lines and the positive and negative controls for the assay demonstrate its potential for activation and inactivation by loading with GTP or GDP, respectively. Thus, the data demonstrate that the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant IGF-IR is deficient in its ability to activate Ras in response to IGF-I stimulation. This could explain the decreased activation of the MAPK pathways in these cells and the loss of cell survival in FL5.12 cells and could also explain other defects associated with this mutant in cellular transformation and migration. IGF-IR-mediated Shc Phosphorylation Is Decreased, and Recruitment of Grb2 and Ship to Shc Is Diminished in FL5.12 Cells Expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F Mutant—To address how Ras and MAPK family activation might be reduced in FL5.12 cells because of a mutation in the C terminus of the IGF-IR, we next turned our attention to proximal signaling events at the IGF-IR following stimulation with IGF-I. Shc is a major substrate of the IGF-IR in FL5.12 cells and it can recruit proteins necessary for activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway and Ras pathway. To investigate the status of Shc activity we immunoprecipitated Shc from IGF-I-stimulated FL5.12 cells expressing either the WT or Y1250F/Y1251F mutant and then assessed phosphotyrosine content and co-precipitated proteins. The IRS family protein Gab2, which contributes to IGF-I signaling to the PI 3-kinase pathway in these cells (32Krause D. Lyons A. Fennelly C. O'Connor R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19244-19252Google Scholar), was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 4A, IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation of Gab2 on tyrosine was similar in FL5.12/WT and FL5.12/Y1250F/Y1251F cells. In contrast, phosphorylation of Shc on tyrosine in response to IGF-I stimulation was decreased in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant (Fig. 4B). The reduced phosphorylation of Shc was accompanied by decreased recruitment of the adapter protein Grb2 and the 5′-phosphatidylinositol phosphatase Ship to Shc. To further investigate the differences in IGF-I-mediated Shc phosphorylation in FL5.12/WT and FL5.12/Y1250F/Y1251F cells, the phosphorylation status of specific sites on Shc were examined. Shc can be phosphorylated on three different tyrosine residues: Tyr239, Tyr240, and Tyr313 (equivalent to Tyr317 in human Shc). The Tyr239-Tyr240 sites are phosphorylated by Src (36Sato K. Gotoh N. Otsuki T. Kakumoto M. Aoto M. Tokmakov A.A. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 399-404Google Scholar) and have been associated with recruitment of Grb2. Tyr313 on Shc can bind an SH2 domain in Ship (37Liu L. Damen J.E. Hughes M.R. Babic I. Jirik F.R. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8983-8988Google Scholar) and can also recruit Grb-2 (38Ishihara H. Sasaoka T. Wada T. Ishiki M. Haruta T. Usui I. Iwata M. Takano A. Uno T. Ueno E. Kobayashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 139-144Google Scholar). We investigated the phosphorylation status of these sites by using anti-phospho-Shc Tyr239 or anti-phospho-Shc Tyr313 antibodies. Data shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate that in IGF-I-stimulated FL5.12/Y1250F/Y1251F cells there was a decrease in the amount of Shc phosphorylated on Tyr313 compared with WT cells, whereas the cellular content of Shc phosphorylated on Tyr239 was equivalent in WT and mutant cells. This suggests that the decrease in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation observed in the total immunoprecipitated Shc (Fig. 4B) is because of decreased phosphorylation of Tyr313. Overall these data demonstrate that IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation of Shc is reduced on Tyr313 in cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant and this is accompanied by decreased recruitment of both Grb2 and Ship. Lack of this tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of Grb2 and Ship may contribute to the reduced Ras and MAPK activation observed in these cells (35Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Google Scholar). Inhibition of Src Activity Leads to Decreased Shc Phosphorylation on Tyr239, Decreased Ship Recruitment, and Differential Effects on MAPK Activation—The data above indicate that FL5.12 cells expressing the Y1250F/Y1251F mutant have decreased Shc phosphorylation and recruitment of Grb2 and Ship. To further investigate the role of Tyr313, and determine whether Ship has a role in IGF-IR signaling, we sought to inhibit Shc phosphorylation by blocking Src activity. It was also of interest to determine whether Src has any role in IGF-I-mediated Shc phosphorylation and activation of the MAPK pathways. To do this we used the Src inhibitor PP2. As can be seen in Fig. 6A, PP2 caused decreased IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation of Shc on Tyr239. Phosphorylation of Shc on Tyr313 was also slightly reduced. PP2 suppressed recruitment of Ship and only slightly affected Grb2 recruitment to Shc in response to IGF-I (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, PP2 caused increased ERK activity and slightly increased Akt phosphorylation in FL5.12/WT cells, but did not alter IGF-I-mediated activation of JNK (Fig. 6C). PP2 also decreased p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 6D) and suppressed cell viability"
https://openalex.org/W2070744775,"V(1)-ATPase from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus is a molecular rotary motor with a subunit composition of A(3)B(3)DF, and its central rotor is composed of the D and F subunits. To determine the role of the F subunit, we generated an A(3)B(3)D subcomplex and compared it with A(3)B(3)DF. The ATP hydrolyzing activity of A(3)B(3)D (V(max) = 20 s(-1)) was lower than that of A(3)B(3)DF (V(max) = 31 s(-1)) and was more susceptible to MgADP inhibition during ATP hydrolysis. A(3)B(3)D was able to bind the F subunit to form A(3)B(3)DF. The C-terminally truncated F((Delta85-106)) subunit was also bound to A(3)B(3)D, but the F((Delta69-106)) subunit was not, indicating the importance of residues 69-84 of the F subunit for association with A(3)B(3)D. The ATPase activity of A(3)B(3)DF((Delta85-106)) (V(max) = 24 s(-1)) was intermediate between that of A(3)B(3)D and A(3)B(3)DF. A single molecule experiment showed the rotation of the D subunit in A(3)B(3)D, implying that the F subunit is a dispensable component for rotation itself. Thus, the F subunit binds peripherally to the D subunit, but promotes V(1)-ATPase catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2092988244,"The Bacillus thuringiensis δ-endotoxins Cry1C and Cry1E share toxicity against several important lepidopteran species. Their combined use to delay development of resistance in target insects depends on their differential interaction with the gut epithelial cells. The three structural domains and combinations of two consecutive domains of Cry1C and Cry1E were separately expressed in Escherichia coli, and their interactions with the brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) of Cry1E-tolerant and -susceptible Spodoptera littoralis larvae were studied. About 80% reduction in binding of Cry1E and each of its separate domains to BBMV of Cry1E-tolerant larvae was observed, whereas Cry1C was toxic to all larvae and bound equally to BBMV derived from both Cry1E-tolerant and -susceptible larvae. These results suggest differential interactions of the two toxins with BBMV encompassing all three domains. Comparable binding assays performed with fluorescent Cry1C and Cry1C domain II showed that Cry1C has higher Bmax and lower Kd than Cry1C domain II and further supported the existence of toxin multisite interactions. Competitive binding assays were used to estimate the sequence of interaction events. Cry1C domain II could compete with domain III binding, whereas domain III did not interfere with domain II binding, indicating sequential interactions of domain III and then domain II with the same membrane site. No competition between domain II of Cry1C and Cry1E was observed, confirming the existence of different domain II binding sites for the two toxins. Taken together, all three domains specifically interact with the epithelial cell membrane. The folding of the three-domain toxin probably dictates the sequence of interaction events. The Bacillus thuringiensis δ-endotoxins Cry1C and Cry1E share toxicity against several important lepidopteran species. Their combined use to delay development of resistance in target insects depends on their differential interaction with the gut epithelial cells. The three structural domains and combinations of two consecutive domains of Cry1C and Cry1E were separately expressed in Escherichia coli, and their interactions with the brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) of Cry1E-tolerant and -susceptible Spodoptera littoralis larvae were studied. About 80% reduction in binding of Cry1E and each of its separate domains to BBMV of Cry1E-tolerant larvae was observed, whereas Cry1C was toxic to all larvae and bound equally to BBMV derived from both Cry1E-tolerant and -susceptible larvae. These results suggest differential interactions of the two toxins with BBMV encompassing all three domains. Comparable binding assays performed with fluorescent Cry1C and Cry1C domain II showed that Cry1C has higher Bmax and lower Kd than Cry1C domain II and further supported the existence of toxin multisite interactions. Competitive binding assays were used to estimate the sequence of interaction events. Cry1C domain II could compete with domain III binding, whereas domain III did not interfere with domain II binding, indicating sequential interactions of domain III and then domain II with the same membrane site. No competition between domain II of Cry1C and Cry1E was observed, confirming the existence of different domain II binding sites for the two toxins. Taken together, all three domains specifically interact with the epithelial cell membrane. The folding of the three-domain toxin probably dictates the sequence of interaction events. Cry proteins are produced and assembled as heterologous crystalline bodies during sporulation of Bacillus thuringiensis. Usually Cry proteins display a narrow, specific spectrum of insecticidal activity. Cry1C is an effective insecticide against about 35–40 species and differs in its insecticidal host range from the three Cry1A toxins. Among the Cry1C-sensitive lepidopteran species, some are also sensitive to Cry1E, which has been considered as a potential alternative to avoid evolution of resistance due to intensively used Cry1C either as a component of bacterial formulations or as a transgenic plant protein (1Strizhov N. Keller M. Mathur J. Koncz-Kalman Z. Bosch D. Prudovsky E. Schell J. Sneh B. Koncz C. Zilberstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15012-15017Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The N-terminal toxic parts of Cry1C and Cry1E are composed of three structural domains found to be highly similar in Cry1, Cry2, and Cry3 proteins (2Li J.D. Carroll J. Ellar D.J.

The β-sheets comprising domain II and domain III are involved in specific interaction(s) with membrane receptors of the larval midgut epithelium, leading to the insertion into the membrane of domain I amphipathic α4 and α5 and their connecting loop. It is assumed that α4-α5 pairs from at least 4 toxin molecules are assembled to form a lethal nonselective ion channel (5Schwartz J.L. Lu Y.J. Sohnlein P. Brousseau R. Laprade R. Masson L. Adang M.J.

Oligomer formation may occur prior to the insertion of α-helices assisted by an earlier interaction with a membrane receptor as was recently shown for the interaction of cadherin-like Bt-R1 receptor with Cry1Ab (11Gomez I. Sanchez J. Miranda R. Bravo A. Soberon M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).

Interaction of Cry1A, Cry1C, Cry1F, and Cry1J toxins with APNs have been shown in different lepidopteran species (15Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Appl. Environ.

Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 4760-4766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding specificity has always been studied by using the complete toxic part of each Cry protein, carrying different point mutations or domain shuffling changes. However, the net contribution of each of the structural domains independent of the two other domains has not been examined. Here we describe the expression and separate interaction of each of the structural Cry1C and Cry1E domains and combinations of two consecutive domains with Spodoptera littoralis brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV). In a natural S. littoralis population that reveals a split sensitivity to Cry1E and homogenous sensitivity to Cry1C, an 80% reduction in the interaction of all three Cry1E domains with BBMV of the Cry1E-tolerant larvae was observed. The interaction of Cry1C with BBMV of both Cry1E-tolerant and Cry1E-sensitive larvae was similar. This overall reduction in binding capacity correlates with a lack of larval sensitivity to Cry1E and indicates that all three domains, as independent entities, reveal specific interactions with the gut epithelial membrane. Identification of Cry1E-tolerant Larvae—S. littoralis neonate larvae (100 larvae) from a population that had never been exposed to any Cry protein were fed on an artificial diet (26Keller M. Sneh B. Strizhov N. Prudovsky E. Regev A. Koncz C. Schell J. Zilberstein A. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) containing 1 μg/ml Cry1E for 48 h and then rescued by feeding on fresh castor bean leaves until pupation. After 7 days of recovery, the larvae were separated according to their size into Cry1E-susceptible subpopulation exhibiting retarded development and Cry1E-tolerant subpopulation with normal larval size. This Cry1E-tolerant larval population was separately propagated for an additional five subsequent generations, repeating the same selection procedure. In each generation, the percentage of the Cry1E-“resistant” larvae remained constant and ranged between 10 and 20%. No typical genetic segregation was observed in three identical rearing experiments; therefore, the Cry1E recoverable larvae were termed as “Cry1E-tolerant” to discriminate them from Cry1C-resistant larvae that exhibit usual genetic segregation (27Zhao J.Z. Collins H.L. Tang J.D. Cao J. Earle E.D. Roush R.T. Herrero S. Escriche B. Ferre J. Shelton A.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3784-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Zhao J.Z.

BBMV Preparation—BBMV were produced from isolated midguts of fifth instar larvae of S. littoralis, according to Wolfersberger et al. (29Wolfersberger M. Luethy P. Maurer A. Parenti P. Sacchi F.V. Giordana B. Hanozet G.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 86: 301-308Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Cloning and Expression of Cry1C and Cry1E Domains—All proteins were expressed using the pET expression system (Novagen) in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cloning of the C-terminally truncated 86-kDa Cry1C and Cry1E was described by Strizhov et al. (30Strizhov N. Keller M. Koncz-Kalman Z. Regev A. Sneh B. Schell J. Koncz C. Zilberstein A.

The size, molecular weight, and primers used for the amplification of separate domains or combinations of two consecutive domains of Cry1C and Cry1E are described in Table I. All domains were amplified by PCR, using the corresponding listed primers and were cloned in pET11a expression vector. Overexpression, induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, was carried out at 18 °C for 6 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8. Total proteins were obtained by three cycles of French Press extraction. Following centrifugation at 20,000 × g, for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of 50 mm Na2CO3, pH 10, 20 mm dithiothreitol and incubated with gentle shaking at 37 °C for 12 h. After an additional spin, the supernatant was loaded on a desalting column (HiTrap; Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 6 ml of 50 mm Na2CO3, pH 10.0. Cry1C (65 kDa) and Cry1C domain II proteins were further purified by an FPLC-Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences), using a 0–600 mm NaCl gradient. Cry1C was eluted at 200 mm and Cry1C domain II at 400 mm NaCl, as verified by SDS-PAGE.Table ISummary of Cry1C and Cry1E domains and the primers used for their amplificationNameAbbreviationPrimersBase pairsAmino acidsMasskDa1C domain IC-IGCATATGGAGGAAAATAATC (primer 1)7561-25228.80GAATTGGATCCTACCTATTG (primer 2)1C domain IIC-IIGGATCCCATATGTATCCAATTC (primer 3)621253-45923.35CGCGGATCCTATGAAGAGTTGCACT (primer 4)1C domain IIIC-IIICGCGGATCCCATATGACAAATACAATT (primer 5)513460-63019.15CAGGATCCTACTTTTGTGCTCTTTCTAAATC (primer 6)1C domain [I + II]C-[I + II]Primers 1 and 413771-45952.141C domain [II + III]C-[II + III]Primers 3 and 61134253-63042.481C domain [I + II + III]C-65Primers 1 and 618901-63065.00Truncated Cry1CaDescribed in Ref. 30.C-86Used as template22681-75686.001E domain IE-IGGATCCCATATGGAGATAGTG (primer 7)7561-25228.80CGCGGATCCTATCTAGAATCGTAATT (primer 8)1E domain IIE-IICGCGGATCCCATATGTATCCAATTC (primer 9)612253-45622.86CGCGGATCCTATGTATTAGTAGCACT (primer 10)1E domain IIIE-IIICGCGGATCCCATATGACAAATACAATT (primer 11)477457-61617.87CAGGATCCTACTTTTGTGCTCTTTCTAAATC (primer 12)1E domain [I + II]E-[I + II]Primers 7 and 1013681-45651.741E domain [II + III]E-[II + III]Primers 9 and 121089253-61640.72Truncated Cry1EaDescribed in Ref. 30.E-86Used as template22261-74286.00a Described in Ref. 30Strizhov N.

Open table in a new tab Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—Purified Cry1C domain II was subjected to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. Infrared spectra were recorded using a Nicolet Nexus 470 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector. The measurements were recorded using 2 cm–1 resolution and 2000 scans averaging. The transmittance minimal value was determined by the OMNIC analysis program (Nicolet). Purified Cry1C domain II (1 μg) in 100 μl of 50 mm Na2CO3 buffer, pH 10.5, was lyophilized and then resuspended in 50 μlofD2O. The sample was loaded between two CaF2 windows using a 0.05-mm spacer (31Haris P.I. Chapman D. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). FITC Labeling—FPLC-purified Cry1C or Cry1C domain II was dissolved in 50 mm Na2CO3 buffer, pH 10, and incubated with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC) (Sigma) in a 1:5 molar ratio, respectively, for 48 h, at 25 °C. The labeled proteins were separated from the nonbound FITC by using a G-25 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) and verified at 310 nm after SDS-PAGE separation. The fluorescence was measured in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B luminescence spectrometer with excitation light at 470 nm and emission at 530 nm. Binding Assays—Binding experiments with FITC-labeled Cry1C or Cry1C domain II were performed in triplicates in a total volume of 100 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 50 μg of BBMV proteins. Various concentrations (0–50 nm) of FITC-labeled Cry1C or Cry1C domain II were tested in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 1000 nm nonlabeled competitor. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the BBMV-bound proteins were separated from free proteins by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The pellet, containing BBMV and bound proteins was washed twice with 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8. After washing, the pellet was dissolved in 2 ml of 50 mm Na2CO3 buffer, pH 10, containing 5% SDS, and boiled for 5 min to denature and release the bound labeled proteins. Luminescence of the bound proteins was then measured in a luminescence spectrometer (as above). Binding data were analyzed using the LIGAND computer program (32Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar) adapted for Macintosh (Biosoft/Elsevier). Binding assays and heterologous competitions with nonlabeled domains were carried out in a 0.5-ml total reaction volume containing 50 μg of BBMV and 250 μm Cry protein domains or as otherwise stated under “Results.” The binding reactions were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. Initial calibration of the binding reaction showed that saturated binding is reached in less than 5 min. The washed pellets were suspended in 30 μlofH2O and boiled for 5 min after adding 10 μl of sample buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 20% 2-mercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol). The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (15%), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Gelman Sciences), and incubated with rabbit anti-Cry1C polyclonal antibodies and then with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The colored bands of the bound domains were quantified using the NIH Image program (available on the World Wide Web at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Three-dimensional Structure Prediction—Comparisons of three-dimensional structures of domain II and domain III were based on Cry1Aa structure (3Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and generated by the fully automated homology-modeling program on the ExPASy SWISS-MODEL Web site (www.expasy.org), processed by WebLad™ViewerLite version 3.2 (Molecular Simulations Inc.). Expression of the Cry1C and Cry1E Domains and Assessment of Binding—Binding ability of Cry proteins to the plasma membrane of lepidopteran larval epithelial cells has been linked to the correct folding of the three-domain entity. Further information was gained when isolated Cry1Ab domain [II + III] polypeptide was shown to specifically interact with Manduca sexta and Trichoplusia ni BBMV, suggesting that interaction of these two domains may maintain toxin specificity (33Flores H. Soberon X. Sanchez J. Bravo A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and raised the question that perhaps specificity is domain-dependent. To further characterize the interaction of each of the three Cry protein structural domains with the plasma membrane of the epithelial cells, all three domains of two closely related Cry1C and Cry1E toxins were separately expressed, and their interaction with BBMV prepared from S. littoralis larvae was estimated. The borders of each domain were determined by multiple amino acid sequence alignment of Cry1Aa (3Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) with Cry1C and Cry1E. All domains and combinations of two consecutive domains were PCR-amplified by using the corresponding primers (Table I). pET11a vectors harboring the 3′-truncated Cry1C (C-86) or Cry1E (E-86) genes encoding 86-kDa toxins (30Strizhov N. Keller M. Koncz-Kalman Z. Regev A. Sneh B. Schell J. Koncz C. Zilberstein A. Konez-Kalman Z. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) served as templates. Most of the domains and domain combinations were sufficiently expressed in E. coli, except for Cry1E domain III and domain [II + III], which were insoluble and therefore not tested in binding assays. The interaction of separate domains and combinations of two consecutive domains with S. littoralis fifth instar larval BBMV was estimated by binding assays. The bound fractions were quantified by Western blot analysis using anti-Cry1C polyclonal antibodies that also recognize all three Cry1E domains. All three Cry1C domains as well as combinations of two consecutive domains bound significantly to the BBMV (Fig. 1). Estimation of binding parameters, using increasing BBMV concentrations in the binding assays, showed that in the range of 0.1–0.6 μg/ml total BBMV proteins, constant amounts of Cry1C-86, Cry1C-65, and individual Cry1C domains interacted with the membrane, reaching binding saturation within 5 min (data not shown). Longer incubation periods up to 30 min did not increase binding, not even to the full-length C-65 or its longer version C-85. Thus, the whole binding process (34Liang Y. Patel S.S. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24719-24724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) occurred rapidly, within 5 min of incubation. The binding capacity of Cry1E domains was estimated by using two types of BBMV prepared from Cry1E-tolerant and Cry1E-susceptible subpopulations of S. littoralis. These two subpopulations were obtained by feeding a laboratory reared S. littoralis population, which has never been exposed to any Cry protein, a Cry1E-containing diet. About 10–20% of the larvae could tolerate a 48-h exposure to 1 μg/ml Cry1E and then reached normal larval size when fed on castor bean leaves (Fig. 2A). The rest of the larval population (∼80–90%) could not tolerate the Cry1E treatment and showed significantly retarded development when being rescued by feeding on castor bean leaves (Fig. 2A). No changes in Cry1C susceptibility were observed in the examined population, which remained consistently sensitive to Cry1C. Five consecutive generations of Cry1E-tolerant larvae were equally treated with Cry1E. Similar ratios of tolerant to susceptible larvae were recorded in all five generations of inbreeding, without any increase in the number of Cry1E-tolerant larvae. When comparable binding assays were performed with BBMV prepared from Cry1E-tolerant and Cry1E-susceptible larvae, the two types demonstrated differential binding capacity of Cry1E-86, whereas the ability to bind Cry1C-86 was fully maintained by the whole population (Fig. 2B). The binding capacity of BBMV derived from Cry1E-tolerant larvae was 20% of that of the susceptible larvae (Fig. 2B). All Cry1E domains, including domain I, showed a similar reduction in binding capacity (Fig. 2C), suggesting a general change in the interaction between the plasma membrane of the epithelial cells and Cry1E. The differential interaction of Cry1C and Cry1E domains indicated that these two Cry proteins interact with different membrane sites/receptors and that all three structural domains are involved in the interaction. Characterization of Specific Domain Membrane Interactions—To further evaluate the specificity of individual domain interactions with BBMV, kinetic parameters of initial binding of Cry1C-65 and Cry1C domain II (C-II) were determined using FITC-labeled proteins (Fig. 3A). Larval feeding bioassays confirmed that FITC-labeled Cry1C was as toxic as the unlabeled toxin. Binding assays were carried out using labeled Cry1C or C-II at a concentration range of 5–50 nm. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1000 nm unlabeled protein (Fig. 3B), and the binding values were estimated by the LIGAND program based on the Scatchard equation. The Kd value of C-II was 19-fold higher than that of Cry1C. Also, the higher Bmax value of Cry1C-65 binding compared with that of C-II indicated that there may be additional interacting sites within the whole toxin. FTIR analysis of purified C-II (Fig. 3C) and second derivative analysis of the absorbance spectrum using the OMNIC analysis program (Nicolet) clearly revealed a single absorbance peak at 1626 cm–1, which is consistent with a β-sheet secondary structure (31Haris P.I. Chapman D. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). No peaks corresponding to other secondary structure elements were observed. This suggests that the isolated domain maintains the predominant β-sheet structure, and thus the loops extending from the domain core structure may exert similar interaction when they are a part of the Cry1C-65 toxin or a separately expressed C-II polypeptide. The observed low Kd (1.2 nm) of Cry1C-65 binding is in the affinity range measured for Cry1C binding to Spodoptera exigua BBMV (1.5 nm) (37de Maagd R.A. Bakker P.L. Masson L. Adang M.J. Sangadala S. Stiekema W. Bosch D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and for Cry1Ab binding to M. sexta cadherin-like protein (Bt-R1) (35Gomez I. Dean D.H. Bravo A. Soberon M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10482-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that interacts with Cry1Ab domain II loops α8 and 2. Under native binding conditions, a higher affinity of Cry1Aa to cadherin-like (Kd = 2.6 nm) than to the APN (75 nm) receptor, both derived Bombyx mori, was found (34Liang Y. Patel S.S. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24719-24724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As yet, a cadherin-like protein has not been identified as a Cry1C receptor, whereas a 108-kDa APN capable of interacting with Cry1C has recently been isolated from S. littura (23Agrawal N. Malhotra P. Bhatnagar R.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and a 106-kDa Cry1C binding APN was isolated from M. sexta (22Luo K. Lu Y.J. Adang M.J. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 783-791Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). APN demonstrated to interact with domain II loops (15Jurat-Fuentes J.L. Adang M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Jenkins J.L. Lee M.K. Valaitis A.P. Curtiss A. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14423-14431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, only in Cry1Ac domain III a specific binding site was identified, responsible for its primary interaction with the APN N-acetylgalactosamine moiety (16Jenkins J.L. Lee M.K. Valaitis A.P. Curtiss A. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14423-14431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since all three domains of both Cry1C and Cry1E were able to interact with S. littoralis BBMV (Fig. 1 and 2), homologous and heterologous competitive binding assays of domains II and III were performed to verify their role in the binding process. Binding of Cry1C domain II was evaluated in the presence of increasing concentrations of Cry1E domain II (Fig. 4). Three-dimensional structure comparison and amino acid sequence alignment of C-II and E-II (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively) demonstrated that their antiparallel β-sheets overlap, revealing a high degree of sequence identity. Conversely, C-II and E-II loop regions diverge in their stereo-orientation, reflecting the differences in the amino acid sequences. In BBMV binding assays, increasing concentrations of E-II up to 10-fold did not change the amount of bound Cry1C domain II, which remained constant (Fig. 4C), indicating that there is no competition between the two domains.

https://openalex.org/W2031164737,"Mex67, the homolog of human TAP, is not an essential mRNA export factor in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here we show that S. pombe encodes a homolog of the TAP cofactor that we have also named p15, whose function in mRNA export is not essential. We have identified and characterized two distinct nuclear export activities, nuclear export signal (NES) I and NES II, within the region of amino acids 434–509 of Mex67. These residues map within the known NTF2-like fold of TAP (amino acids 371–551). We show that the homologs of these two NESs are present and are functionally conserved in TAP. The NES I, NES II, and NES I + II of TAP and Mex67 directly bind with -phenylalanine-glycine (-FG)-containing sequences of S. pombe Nup159 and Nup98 but not with human p62. Mutants of NES I or NES II of Mex67/TAP that do not bind -FG Nup159 and Nup98 in vitro are unable to mediate nuclear export of a heterologous protein in S. pombe and in HeLa cells. Fused with the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of Crp79 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (RRM-NES-GFP), the NES I and NES II of Mex67 or TAP can suppress the mRNA export defect of the Δp15 rae1-167 synthetic lethal S. pombe strain, suggesting that the NESs can function in the absence of p15. These novel nuclear export sequences may provide additional routes for delivering Mex67/TAP to the nuclear pore complex."
