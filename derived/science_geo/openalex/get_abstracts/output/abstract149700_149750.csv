https://openalex.org/W2156211472,"Type I protein arginine methyltransferases catalyze the formation of asymmetric ω-N G,N G-dimethylarginine residues by transferring methyl groups fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine to guanidino groups of arginine residues in a variety of eucaryotic proteins. The predominant type I enzyme activity is found in mammalian cells as a high molecular weight complex (300–400 kDa). In a previous study, this protein arginine methyltransferase activity was identified as an additional activity of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) protein. However, immunodepletion of FDH activity in RAT1 cells and in murine tissue extracts with antibody to FDH does not diminish type I methyltransferase activity toward the methyl-accepting substrates glutathione S-transferase fibrillarin glycine arginine domain fusion protein or heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1. Similarly, immunodepletion with anti-FDH antibody does not remove the endogenous methylating activity for hypomethylated proteins present in extracts from adenosine dialdehyde-treated RAT1 cells. In contrast, anti-PRMT1 antibody can remove PRMT1 activity from RAT1 extracts, murine tissue extracts, and purified rat liver FDH preparations. Tissue extracts from FDH(+/+), FDH(+/−), and FDH(−/−) mice have similar protein arginine methyltransferase activities but high, intermediate, and undetectable FDH activities, respectively. Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-PRMT1, but not purified FDH, can be cross-linked to the methyl-donor substrateS-adenosyl-l-methionine. We conclude that PRMT1 contributes the major type I protein arginine methyltransferase enzyme activity present in mammalian cells and tissues.

At least two types of protein arginineN- methyltransferase (PRMT)1 activities that transfer methyl groups fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the guanidino group of arginine residues exist in mammalian cells (3.Lee H.W.

Type I PRMT enzymes catalyze the formation of ω-monomethylarginine and asymmetric ω-N G,N G-dimethylarginine.

Sequence analysis identified the major polypeptide in this preparation as 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH, EC 1.5.1.6), suggesting that the major protein arginine methyltransferase may be encoded by a gene encoding an enzyme involved in folate metabolism. FDH catalyzes (i) NADP+-dependent oxidation of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-FTHF) to tetrahydrofolate, NADPH, and CO2; (ii) NADP+-independent hydrolysis of 10-FTHF to formate and tetrahydrofolate; and (iii) NADP+-dependent oxidation of 2-propanal (22.Cook R.J.

To understand further the relationship between the PRMT and FDH gene products, we sought to identify the major type I protein arginineN-methyltransferase in cells and tissues. We used cultured rat cells and tissues from FDH(+/+), FDH(+/−), and FDH(−/−) mice to determine (i) which methyltransferase is the predominant type I protein arginine methyltransferase and (ii) whether the protein arginine methyltransferase activity in FDH enzyme preparations is catalyzed by the FDH enzyme or by a copurified, but distinct, methyltransferase.

https://openalex.org/W1970925815,"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients are highly sensitive to sunlight, and they suffer from a high incidence of skin cancers. The variant form of XP results from mutations in the hRAD30A gene, which encodes the DNA polymerase in humans, hPol(eta). Of the eukaryotic DNA polymerases, only human Pol(eta) and its yeast counterpart have the ability to replicate DNA containing a cis-syn thymine-thymine (T-T) dimer. Here we measure the fidelity of hPol(eta) on all four nondamaged template bases and at each thymine residue of a cis-syn T-T dimer. Opposite all four nondamaged template bases, hPol(eta) misincorporates nucleotides with a frequency of approximately 10(-2)-10(-3), and importantly, hPol(eta) synthesizes DNA opposite the T-T dimer with the same accuracy and efficiency as opposite the nondamaged DNA. The low fidelity of hPol(eta) may derive from a flexible active site that renders the enzyme more tolerant of geometric distortions in DNA and enables it to synthesize DNA past a T-T dimer."
https://openalex.org/W2099094190,"Xanthine oxidase (XO) was shown to catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide (NO), under anaerobic conditions, in the presence of either NADH or xanthine as reducing substrate. NO production was directly demonstrated by ozone chemiluminescence and showed stoichiometry of approximately 2:1 versus NADH depletion. With xanthine as reducing substrate, the kinetics of NO production were complicated by enzyme inactivation, resulting from NO-induced conversion of XO to its relatively inactive desulfo-form. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined spectrophotometrically for urate production and NADH oxidation catalyzed by XO and xanthine dehydrogenase in the presence of nitrite under anaerobic conditions. pH optima for anaerobic NO production catalyzed by XO in the presence of nitrite were 7.0 for NADH and ≤6.0 for xanthine. Involvement of the molybdenum site of XO in nitrite reduction was shown by the fact that alloxanthine inhibits xanthine oxidation competitively with nitrite. Strong preference for Mo=S over Mo=O was shown by the relatively very low NADH-nitrite reductase activity shown by desulfo-enzyme. The FAD site of XO was shown not to influence nitrite reduction in the presence of xanthine, although it was clearly involved when NADH was the reducing substrate. Apparent production of NO decreased with increasing oxygen tensions, consistent with reaction of NO with XO-generated superoxide.

Each subunit contains one molybdenum, one FAD, and two nonidentical iron-sulfur redox centers (1.Bray R.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 12. Academic Press, New York1975: 299-420Google Scholar,2.Bray R.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 299-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although it has broad specificities for both reducing and oxidizing substrates, its conventionally accepted role is in purine catabolism, where it catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. In mammals, XOR exists in two interconvertible forms, xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH; EC 1.1.1.204), which predominatesin vivo, and xanthine oxidase (XO; EC 1.1.3.22). Both forms of the enzyme can reduce molecular oxygen, although only XDH can reduce NAD, which is its preferred electron acceptor. Reduction of oxygen leads to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide; it is the potential to generate these reactive oxygen species that has led to widespread interest in the enzyme as a pathogenic agent in many forms of ischemia-reperfusion injury (3.McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1975; 312: 159-163Google Scholar). More recently, reactive oxygen species are increasingly cited as intermediates in normal signal transduction pathways (4.Khan A.U. Wilson T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 437-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5.Winyard P.G. Blake D.R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 38: 403-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide (NO) also is a biological messenger and, over the last decade, has become the focus of intense research activity in its own right. It is implicated in a wide range of physiological processes, including smooth muscle relaxation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, neurotransmission, and immune regulation (6.Moncada S.M. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J.

Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1996; 55: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the enzymic source of NO in mammalian tissues is NO synthase, which catalyzes the oxidation of arginine in the presence of NADPH and molecular oxygen (10.Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar). We have recently briefly reported that XO is capable of catalyzing the reduction of glyceryl trinitrite, as well as inorganic nitrate and nitrite, to NO under hypoxic conditions in the presence of NADH (11.Millar T.M. Stevens C.R. Benjamin N. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Blake D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 427: 225-228Crossref Scopus (415) Google Scholar). We now examine the kinetics and stoichiometry of NO production catalyzed by XOR in the presence of inorganic nitrite and both NADH and xanthine as reducing substrates under conditions of different oxygen tensions and provide evidence for the sites of action of the various substrates. XOR was purified from bovine milk, essentially as described by Sanders et al. (12.Sanders S.A. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Fresh milk (1500–2000 ml) was centrifuged (2000 × g, 30 min) at 4 °C to separate the cream. All subsequent operations were carried out at 4 °C. The cream was resuspended in 5 volumes of 0.2 mK2HPO4, containing 1 mm EDTA and 5.0 mm dithiothreitol, with stirring for 90 min. The suspension was centrifuged (3000 × g, 30 min), and the subnatant was collected, filtered through glass wool, and mixed slowly with 15% (by volume) cold butanol (−20 °C). Ammonium sulfate (15 g/100 ml) was added slowly with stirring, which was continued for a further 50 min, before centrifugation (8000 × g, 20 min) and filtration of the supernatant through glass wool. Ammonium sulfate (20 g/100 ml) was then added slowly to the supernatant with mixing, and the suspension was stirred for a further 30 min before centrifuging (9500 × g, 30 min). The brown precipitate was suspended in a small volume of buffer A (25 mm Na/MES, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm EDTA) and dialyzed against the same buffer (3.5 liters) overnight. Any precipitate was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 60 min) and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane, before applying to a column (1 × 9 cm) of heparin immobilized on cross-linked 4% beaded agarose (Sigma, type 1), previously equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 50 mm NaCl in buffer A (20 ml), and XOR was eluted with 0.3 m NaCl in the same buffer. Further purification was effected by ion exchange chromatography. Eluate from the heparin column was dialyzed into 50 mmNa/Bicine, pH 8.3, containing 50 mm NaCl, filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter, and applied to an equilibrated HiTrap Q ion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for fast protein liquid chromatography. The column was eluted with 50 mm Na/Bicine, pH 8.3, followed by an increasing salt gradient (0.05–1.0m NaCl) in buffer, when enzyme-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated. Typical yields after heparin chromatography were 15 mg of enzyme protein/liter of milk, withA 280/A 450 5.0–5.5. Mono Q chromatography yielded enzyme withA 280/A 450 ratios of 5.0–5.2 in yields of approximately 85%. The enzyme-containing eluate from HiTrap Q was dialyzed overnight into 50 mm Na/Bicine, pH 8.3, frozen dropwise in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until required. Following thawing, the enzyme showed >97% oxidase activity as determined by the method described below and constituted XO for the studies described here. XDH was obtained by incubation of purified XO in 50 mm Na/Bicine, pH 8.3, containing 10 mmdithiothreitol for 40 min at 37 °C. Dithiothreitol was subsequently removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G25. XDH prepared by these means contained >90% dehydrogenase form. The oxidase content of XOR was determined by measuring the rate of oxidation of xanthine to uric acid spectrophotometrically at 295 nm, in a Cary 100 spectrophotometer, using an absorption coefficient of 9.6 mm−1 cm−1 (13.Avis, P. G., Bergel, F., and Bray, R. C. (1956) J. Chem. Soc. 1219–1226Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 25.0 ± 0.2 °C in air-saturated 50 mmNa/Bicine buffer, pH 8.3, containing 100 μm xanthine. The sum of oxidase and dehydrogenase contents was determined as above but in the presence of 0.5 mm NAD. The enzyme used contained 35–38% functional active sites, as judged by the activity:flavin ratio, assuming fully active enzyme has an activity:flavin ratio of 208 (14.Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of enzyme were determined from the UV-visible spectrum, by using an absorption coefficient of 36 mm subunit−1cm−1 at 450 nm. Desulfo-XO was prepared essentially according to the procedure described by Massey and Edmondson (15.Massey V. Edmondson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). XO (∼1.5 mg ml−1) was incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10 mm KCN, for 2 h at 37.0 ± 0.2 °C. Before assay of xanthine oxidase activity (determined as above), enzyme was gel-filtered on Sephadex G25. This activity was routinely undetectable. Desulfo-enzyme was resulfurated by modification of the method described by Wahl and Rajagopalan (16.Wahl R.C. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1354-1359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. Enzyme (∼1.5 mg ml−1) in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was allowed to equilibrate for 1 h in an anaerobic cabinet (<3 ppm O2), prior to gel filtration, in the cabinet, using 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, itself preequilibrated in the cabinet for at least 24 h. Anaerobic methyl viologen and Na2S were then added to final concentrations of 0.2 and 8.4 mm, respectively, before titration with anaerobic 1 mm sodium dithionite until a faint blue color appeared. Enzyme was incubated at 22 °C in the cabinet, and at regular intervals samples were gel-filtered as above (also in the cabinet), taken out, and assayed for xanthine oxidase activity (determined as above). Deflavo-XO was prepared from XO according to the procedure described by Komai et al. (17.Komai H. Massey V. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1692-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme so prepared showed xanthine oxidase activity (determined as above) of 16.0 ± 1.0 nmol of urate min−1 mg−1. Reconstitution by the addition of FAD (200 μm) (17.Komai H. Massey V. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1692-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) yielded enzyme with specific activity of 1060 ± 30 nmol of urate min−1mg−1. IDP-inhibited XO was prepared essentially as described by O'Donnell et al.(18.O'Donnell V.B. Smith G.C.M. Jones O.T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 778-785PubMed Google Scholar) for DPI-inhibited enzyme. XO (16 nmol) was incubated with 200 μm IDP in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 25.0 ± 0.2 °C. Aliquots of xanthine (100 nmol) were added, and after 5 min, a sample of the reaction mixture was assayed for xanthine oxidase activity (determined as above). After the addition of 1.5 μmol of xanthine, xanthine oxidase activity had fallen to 8.5 ± 4.0 nmol of urate min−1 mg−1, and this enzyme was used for relevant studies. Dithiothreitol was purchased from Alexis Corp. Oxygen-free nitrogen and compressed air were purchased from British Oxygen Corp. Standard NO in nitrogen was obtained from Air Products Corp. All other reagents, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma. Steady state kinetic studies under anaerobic conditions were carried out in nitrogen-sparged 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 37.0 ± 0.2 °C in an anaerobic cabinet (Belle Technologies) containing <3 ppm O2, using a Hi-Tech SF61 rapid mixing device. With xanthine as reducing substrate, urate was determined as described above for determination of oxidase content of XOR. With NADH as reducing substrate, NADH utilization was followed at 340 nm using an absorption coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1(19.Horecker B.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nitric oxide generation was followed by using an ozone chemiluminescence assay in a continuous flow apparatus (Sievers NOA 280). The mean concentration of NO in the ozone chamber, derived from readings taken every second, is displayed as ppb, calibrated by using a known concentration of NO in nitrogen (Air Products). The apparatus was modified to allow a constant stream of nitrogen (containing <3 ppm O2), mixed, as necessary, with defined concentrations of oxygen to flow over the surface of a stirred reaction mixture (1 ml). In the course of equilibration, displayed concentrations of NO rise to a peak value, usually attained approximately 2 min after initiation of the reaction. This value minus background levels is used, together with the measured gas flow, to calculate the molar production of NO. Reactions were carried out at 37.0 ± 0.2 °C in nitrogen-sparged 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing sodium nitrite and either xanthine or NADH and were initiated by the addition of enzyme. pH profile experiments were also carried out in phosphate buffer. The stoichiometry of NO production with respect to urate production or to NADH depletion was calculated as follows. Ratios of the means of replicate determinations of NO production versus the means of urate production (or NADH depletion) were determined for each concentration of variable substrate. These ratios were then treated as individual data for determination of overall means and S.D. values. XO-catalyzed generation of NO in the presence of nitrite could be directly demonstrated by ozone chemiluminescence (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the presence of NADH, rates of NO production and NADH depletion both followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 1), showing a stoichiometry (see “Experimental Procedures”) of (2.19 ± 0.15):1, consistent with transfer from NADH of pairs of electrons (12.Sanders S.A. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), each of which reduces one molecule of nitrite to NO. With xanthine as reducing substrate, the stoichiometry of NOversus urate production was considerably less than 2:1, approximating rather 1:1 (data not shown). In view of reports that XOR is inactivated by NO (20.Hassoun P.M., Yu, F.S. Zulueta J.J. White A.C. Lanzillo J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L809-L817PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Cote C.G., Yu, F-S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7763-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), particularly in the presence of xanthine (22.Ichimori K. Fukahori M. Nakazawa H. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7763-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we sought evidence of such inactivation under the experimental conditions of NO generation. As can be seen in Fig.2, in the presence of xanthine the enzyme is indeed progressively inactivated over the time course of NO production. After 2 min, the point at which the NO reading is commonly taken (see “Experimental Procedures”), inactivation has reached approximately 60%, a value consistent with the approach to 1:1 stoichiometry discussed above. Ichimori et al. (22.Ichimori K. Fukahori M. Nakazawa H. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7763-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) demonstrated inactivation of conventional aerobic XO activity by exogenous NO and attributed this inactivation to generation of desulfo-XO, in which Mo=S is replaced by Mo=O. In the present context, it was clearly of interest to determine whether inactivation observed in the course of NO generation results from desulfuration of XO. A sample of XO (initial activity of 4500 ± 120 nmol of urate min−1 mg−1) was incubated anaerobically for 20 min in the presence of nitrite and xanthine, as outlined in the legend to Fig. 2. The reaction mixture was gel-filtered (see “Experimental Procedures”) to yield 90% inactivated enzyme (450 ± 30 nmol of urate min−1mg−1), which could, indeed, be reactivated on sulfuration (see “Experimental Procedures”) (final activity of 5430 ± 290 nmol of urate min−1 mg−1). This is consistent with the conclusion that NO, whether exogenously added (22.Ichimori K. Fukahori M. Nakazawa H. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7763-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or endogenously generated in the presence of xanthine, inactivates XO by transforming it to the desulfo-form. In contrast to the situation observed with xanthine, rates of enzyme inactivation were very much lower in the presence of NADH, leading to less than 5% inactivation after 2 min (Fig. 2). The kinetics of the reduction of nitrite by NADH catalyzed by XO were followed by observing the rate of NADH depletion at 340 nm. Treating either nitrite or NADH as the varied substrate, the variation of rate with substrate concentration follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. With xanthine as reducing substrate, the reaction rates were monitored by following urate accumulation at 295 nm. When nitrite is treated as the variable substrate concentration, Michaelis-Menten behavior was again found. However, the variation of rate with xanthine concentration fitted well to Equation 1 for substrate inhibition (Fig.3), where K m is the Michaelis constant and K i is the substrate inhibition constant. v=Vmax1+Km/[S]+[S]/KiEquation 1 Substrate inhibition was relieved by increasing nitrite concentration; over the range of 20–120 mm nitrite,K i varied from 30 to 230 μm. Using XDH, with xanthine as the reducing substrate, the kinetic behavior was identical to that using XO (Fig.4). However, with NADH as the reducing substrate, Michaelis-Menten kinetics were followed (as with the oxidase), but the parameters were significantly different from those obtained using the oxidase form (TableI).Table IValues of Km and Vmax for NADH depletion or urate production catalyzed by XOR in the presence of nitriteXOXDHNADH depletion V max (nmol min−1mg−1)52.4 ± 2.7807.1 ± 16.1 K mNADH(μm)39.4 ± 5.26.6 ± 0.5 K mnitrite(mm)35.7 ± 4.311.9 ± 0.9Urate production V max (nmol min−1mg−1)1185.4 ± 35.1 K mxanthine(μm)3.6 ± 0.6 K mnitrite(mm)15.7 ± 2.1XO or XDH was incubated in nitrogen-sparged 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, in an anaerobic cabinet (<3 ppm O2) at 37 ± 0.2 °C with at least five different concentrations of nitrite (5–80 mm), each at a minimum of five different concentrations of xanthine (2.5–100 μm) or NADH (2.5–100 μm). Urate production or NADH depletion was followed by monitoring absorbances at 295 or 340 nm, respectively. Apparent values of Vmax were obtained by fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (or Equation 1) at each fixed concentration of second substrate. Secondary plots ofV maxapp against the concentration of the first substrate showed good fits to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The asymptote of these curves gave the “true” (i.e.concentration-independent) V max. The trueK m values were obtained from the value of thex coordinate giving half the asymptotic value ofV maxapp. Values are means ± S.D. (n = 3). Open table in a new tab XO or XDH was incubated in nitrogen-sparged 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, in an anaerobic cabinet (<3 ppm O2) at 37 ± 0.2 °C with at least five different concentrations of nitrite (5–80 mm), each at a minimum of five different concentrations of xanthine (2.5–100 μm) or NADH (2.5–100 μm). Urate production or NADH depletion was followed by monitoring absorbances at 295 or 340 nm, respectively. Apparent values of Vmax were obtained by fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (or Equation 1) at each fixed concentration of second substrate.

The trueK m values were obtained from the value of thex coordinate giving half the asymptotic value ofV maxapp. Values are means ± S.D. (n = 3). Because of the substrate inhibition by xanthine, it was not possible to draw any mechanistic conclusions from the values of the apparent steady-state kinetic parameters. However, with NADH as reducing substrate, Vmaxapp/ Vmappfor XO was constant throughout the range of substrates employed, consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. Interestingly, with XDH, Vmaxapp/ Vmappincreased with increasing substrate concentration for both NADH and nitrite. All of the above kinetic experiments were carried out with enzyme of 35–38% functionality (see “Experimental Procedures”). NADH-nitrite reductase activity of desulfo-XO (see “Experimental Procedures”) was low but significant, contributing rates of less than 3% in those of the standard enzyme preparation. The pH profiles for NO production in the presence of nitrite and NADH or xanthine catalyzed by XO under anaerobic conditions are shown in Fig. 5. Essentially identical profiles were obtained when NADH depletion or urate production, respectively, were monitored in the presence of nitrite (data not shown). Direct involvement of the molybdenum site in nitrite reduction was demonstrated by inhibition of anaerobic NADH oxidation in the presence of alloxanthine. The well known inhibitor, allopurinol, exerts its effect by acting as a reducing substrate for XOR, thereby being itself oxidized to alloxanthine (also known as oxypurinol), which then binds very tightly to the reduced form of the enzyme (14.Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Robins R.K. Revanker G.R. O'Brein D.E. Springer R.H. Novinson T. Albert A. Senga K. Miller J.P. Streeter D.G. J. Hetercyclic Chem. 1985; 22: 601-634Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the observation (24.Miyamoto Y. Akaike T. Yoshida M. Goto S. Horie H. Maeda H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 211: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that alloxanthine acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor of xanthine, which binds to the completely oxidized form of the enzyme. In the course of its anaerobic reduction, nitrite might be expected to bind also to the reduced form of molybdenum; that this is indeed the case is indicated by the demonstration that alloxanthine inhibited NADH depletion competitively with nitrite (Fig. 6). It was shown, furthermore, that reduction of nitrite to NO is dependent on the sulfo-form of XO. Conversion of XO to its desulfo-form (see “Experimental Procedures”) resulted in apparent loss of its ability to catalyze either aerobic xanthine oxidation or anaerobic NO production in the presence of NADH and nitrite. Both of these activities were recovered, with essentially identical time courses, upon resulfuration (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig.7). Urate production in the presence of xanthine and nitrite catalyzed by XO anaerobically was essentially identical to that catalyzed aerobically by IDP-inhibited XO (Fig. 8), consistent with a lack of involvement of the FAD site in nitrite reduction. With deflavo-enzyme, under aerobic conditions, rates of urate production were somewhat lower (Fig. 8), probably reflecting instability of this form of the enzyme (see “Discussion”). In the presence of NADH and nitrite, neither deflavo- nor IDP-inhibited enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed detectable NO production or NADH depletion (data not shown); a result that is unsurprising, in view of the well established direct interaction of NADH with the FAD site of XO (17.Komai H. Massey V. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1692-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of NADH and nitrite, XO-catalyzed NO production apparently decreased as oxygen concentration increased, remaining detectable only at higher concentrations of nitrite (Fig.9). This phenomenon can be largely attributed to rapid reaction of NO with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (27.Goldstein S. Czapski G. Free Radical Biol.

In the presence of 200 units of superoxide dismutase, the rate profile of NO production versus nitrite concentration was identical to that obtained anaerobically in the absence of superoxide dismutase (Fig. 10).Figure 10Comparison of NO production catalyzed by XO under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the presence and absence, respectively, of superoxide dismutase. ●, NO production was monitored at 37 ± 0.2 °C in air-equilibrated potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, in a chemiluminescence NO detector in a stream of air.

We briefly described this phenomenon in the presence of NADH under hypoxic conditions (11.Millar T.M. Stevens C.R. Benjamin N. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Blake D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 427: 225-228Crossref Scopus (415) Google Scholar); a subsequent communication (32.Zhang Z. Naughton D. Winyard P.G. Benjamin N. Blake D.R. Symons M.C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) reported NO generation in both hypoxia and ambient air. The present study examines the kinetics and mechanism of nitrite reduction catalyzed by XOR with both NADH and xanthine as reducing substrates and addresses the effects of oxygen. Anaerobic NO production catalyzed by XO in the presence of nitrite and NADH could be directly demonstrated by ozone chemiluminescence using a chemiluminescence NO detector. Comparison with rates of NADH utilization showed a stoichiometric ratio of approximately 2:1versus NO production. This result is predicted on the basis of a redox reaction comprising a two-electron oxidation of NADH to NAD+ and a one-electron reduction of nitrite to NO. Involving as it does both spectrophotometric and chemiluminescence NO detector data, this finding serves to validate the latter. Corresponding experiments in the presence of xanthine, rather than NADH, showed relatively less NO production. This initially surprising finding was satisfactorily explained in terms of NO-induced inactivation of XO under conditions of the assay. While it is not clear why such inactivation should be markedly greater in the presence of xanthine rather than NADH, this may reflect the extent to which the enzyme is present in reduced states (22.Ichimori K.

https://openalex.org/W2014415555,"The potential role of glycogen synthase kinase-3β in modulating apoptosis was examined in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.

Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have demonstrated that GSK-3 surpasses this function and plays a broad role in cellular metabolism, including contributions to signaling activities, growth, and differentiation (2.Welsh G.I. Wilson C. Proud C.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 274-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). GSK-3β has been shown to phosphorylate numerous substrates, including several transcription factors such as c-jun, c-myc (3.Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 4.de Groot R.P. Auwerx J. Bourouis M. Sassone-Corsi P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 841-847PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Nikolakaki E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), cytoskeletal proteins such as the microtubule-associated protein tau (7.Hanger D.P. Hughes K.

Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Thus it is now evident that the activity of GSK-3β influences a wide variety of cellular functions, including multiple signaling systems. Much still remains to be learned about the regulation of GSK-3β activity and its role as a modulator of signaling cascades that determine cell fate. Although often considered to be a constitutively active enzyme, GSK-3β can be both activated and inhibited. Activation has been shown to occur subsequent to phosphorylation of Tyr216 (10.Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and recently by transient increases in intracellular calcium (11.Hartigan J.A. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21395-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Inhibition of GSK-3β can be induced by activation of the Wnt pathway (12.Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) or by agents that activate a signaling cascade that commences when growth factors or insulin bind to their respective receptors (see Ref. 13.Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar for review), resulting in the recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which binds the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt (also known as protein kinase B) to bring it into close proximity with phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. The juxtaposition of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 to Akt on the membrane facilitates the phosphorylation and activation of Akt by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (14.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, Akt dissociates from the membrane and can phosphorylate Ser9 of GSK-3β, which inhibits its activity (15.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-signaling pathway protects cells from pro-apoptotic stimuli as well as reducing the activity of GSK-3β. For example, activators of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, such as insulin-like growth factor-1, platelet-derived growth factor (16.Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar, 17.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar), and interleukin-2 (18.Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and -3 (19.Songyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar), protect cells from a variety of apoptotic insults. Thus, the signaling mechanism that is associated with inhibition of GSK-3β is also associated with anti-apoptotic outcomes. Akt-mediated cell protection has been attributed to processes other than inhibition of GSK-3β, such as by phosphorylation of the proapoptotic Bcl family member Bad (21.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar) or by preventing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (22.Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether or not inhibition of GSK-3β contributes to the anti-apoptotic effects of Akt activity. There is some evidence of the converse, that activation of GSK-3β contributes to pro-apoptotic signaling, as it was recently found that overexpression of GSK-3β in Rat-1 and PC12 cells stimulated apoptosis (23.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Considering the potentially important role of GSK-3β in regulating apoptosis, it was of great interest to note that lithium was recently discovered to inhibit of GSK-3β (24.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar,25.Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lithium is used therapeutically for the treatment of bipolar disorder, and although it has been used in the psychiatric domain for many years, its influences at the biochemical level are only beginning to be elucidated (26.Jope R.S. Mol. Psychiatry. 1999; 4: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). One of the most intriguing findings is that lithium confers protection to neurons against pro-apoptotic stimuli such as glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (27.Nonaka S. Hough C.J. Chuang D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), C2-ceramide (28.Centeno F. Mora A. Fuentes J.M. Soler G. Claro E. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), radiation (29.Inouye M. Yamamura H. Nakano A. J. Radiat. Res. 1995; 36: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and ischemia (30.Nonaka S. Chuang D.M. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2081-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings raise the possibilities that GSK-3β contributes to apoptotic-signaling cascades and that inhibition of GSK-3β contributes to the neuroprotective properties of lithium. The enzymes that ultimately carry out the command for apoptosis are the cysteine proteases known as caspases. Caspases, which are zymogens, are typically cleaved autocatalytically or by other caspases from inactive procaspase proteins to produce activated enzymes (31.Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar, 32.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6137) Google Scholar). Caspase-3, also called CPP32, is activated by many pro-apoptotic stimuli and is an early step in the execution phase of apoptosis (33.Harvey K.J. Blomquist J.F. Ucker D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2912-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The activation of caspase-3 commences after apoptotic signals induce the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (34.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which subsequently associates with apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 and procaspase-9 to form the “apoptosome” (35.Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). This complex formation stimulates the oligomerization of procaspase-9 and its autocatalytic activation. The effect of caspase-9 activity is the proteolytic activation of downstream caspases such as caspase-3 (36.Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar), which in turn proteolyzes the DNA-binding protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (37.Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar) and other proteins. Hence the measurement of caspase-3 activity can serve as a biochemical marker for the execution phase of apoptosis. The goal of this investigation was to test if GSK-3β activity modulates apoptosis using the neuronal model system of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Apoptosis was generated using staurosporine, which previously has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in these and other cells (38.Kruman I. Guo Q. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 39.Jacobsen M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 40.Posmantur R. McGinnis K. Nadimpalli R. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2328-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and heat shock, a method widely used to cause cell stress (41.Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Samali A. Orrenius S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). GSK-3β activity was increased by overexpression, and GSK-3β activity was decreased by using lithium. The results show that overexpression of GSK-3β alone did not induce apoptosis, but it sensitized cells to apoptosis caused by exposure to staurosporine or to heat shock, and that inhibition of GSK-3β by lithium attenuated activation of caspase-3. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown in continuous culture RPMI media (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) containing 10% horse serum (Life Technologies), 5% fetal clone II (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Stably transfected cells were maintained with transfection-maintenance medium that contained 100 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin); other components were the same as continuous culture media. Cells were maintained in humidified, 37 °C incubators with 5% CO2. Cells were plated at a density of 105cells/60-mm dish 48 h before apoptosis-inducing treatments. For stable transfection, SH-SY5Y cells were replated one day before electroporation. The cells were removed from the dish with continuous culture medium containing 0.05% of trypsin, diluted with continuous culture medium, and centrifuged for 5 min at 250 × g. Cells were washed, resuspended in 1 ml HEPES buffer (0.14 mNaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 0.075 mmNa2HPO4, pH was adjusted to 7.05 with 10m NaOH), and incubated with 10 μg of HA-GSK-3β in pcDNA3.1 (generously provided by Dr. J. R. Woodgett, University of Toronto) on ice for 10 min. Electroporation was carried out with a Bio-Rad Pulse II electroporator set at 0.25 kV and 960 microfarads as described previously (43.Potter H. Weir L. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7161-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). After electroporation, cells were incubated on ice for 10 min and then mixed with 10 ml of continuous culture medium and plated onto a 100-mm Corning dish. After 48 h the medium was replaced with transfection-maintenance medium, and the cells were maintained in transfection-maintenance medium for approximately 1 month until only cells resistant to Geneticin survived. Cells were cloned and screened for expression of HA-GSK-3β. For immunoblotting, cells in 60-mm plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). For caspase activity, cells were lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer without sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were collected in microcentrifuge tubes, sonicated, and centrifuged. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce). The lysates were stored at −80 °C until used either for immunoblotting or measuring caspase activity. Cell lysates were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS) and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Proteins were separated in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for immunoblotting GSK-3β and caspase-9 or in 7.5% and 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for immunoblotting PARP and caspase-3, respectively. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with antibodies to GSK-3β, caspase-3, caspase-9, or PARP (PharMingen/Transduction Laboratories San Diego, CA) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were developed using peroxidase substrate chemiluminescence (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) and analyzed by PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics). The activity of GSK-3β was measured essentially as described previously (44.van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M., Th. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28279-28285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 nm okadaic acid, 100 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mg/ml glycogen). The lysates were sonicated in microcentrifuge tubes for 10 s on ice and centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 15 min. After the protein concentration was determined, 100 μg of protein (1 μg/μl) was precleared with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C, then incubated with 2 μg of monoclonal GSK-3β antibody (Pharmingen/Transduction Laboratories) overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The immobilized immune complexes were washed three times with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer and once with 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol. Kinase activity was assayed in a total volume of 15 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm ATP, 1.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 μm phosphoglycogen synthase peptide-2 (YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQSEDEEE) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Glycogen synthase (Ala21) peptide-2 was used as negative control. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction tubes were centrifuged for 1 min, and triplicate 5-μl aliquots of reaction supernatants were spotted onto 1 cm × 2 cm P81 filter paper. The filter papers were washed 4 times in 0.5% phosphoric acid for a total time of 1 h, rinsed in 95% ethanol, air-dried, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The efficiency of GSK-3β immunoprecipitation was determined by immunoblotting for GSK-3β. Fluorometric assays were conducted in 96-well clear-bottom plates, and all measurements were carried out in triplicate wells. To each well 200 μl of assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mmdithiothreitol) was added. Peptide substrates for caspase-3 (Ac-DEVD-AMC), caspase-9 (Ac-LEHD-AMC), or caspase-1 (Ac-YVAD-AMC) (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) were added to each well to a final concentration of 25 ng/μl. When the caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) was used, it was added at a concentration of 2.5 ng/μl immediately before the addition of the caspase-3 substrate. Cell lysates (20 μg of protein) were added to start the reaction. Background fluorescence was measured in wells containing assay buffer, substrate, and lysis buffer without the cell lysate. Assay plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h for measurement of caspase-3 and 3 h for measurement of caspase-1 and caspase-9, based on preliminary measurements of the time course (0.5 to 6 h) of caspase activities. Fluorescence was measured on a fluorescence plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT) set at 360 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. Caspase activity was calculated as ((mean AMC fluorescence from triplicate wells) − (background fluorescence))/μg of protein. Cells were cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips placed in 35-mm culture plates. After treatments, medium was removed, and the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were stained with 10 ng/μl Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then mounted onto glass slides using Immu-Mount (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). The slides were examined by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon) set at 400× magnification. To score the number of cells exhibiting apoptotic morphology, a minimum of 300 cells were counted/coverslip. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with staurosporine and then examined for characteristics associated with apoptosis, including activation of caspases, proteolysis of PARP, and changes in cellular morphology. Caspase-3 activity increased concentration dependently after treatment with 0.1 to 1 μm staurosporine (Fig.1 A). Examination of the time-dependent activation of caspases induced by 0.5 μm staurosporine revealed that caspase-3 activity began to increase approximately 1 h after staurosporine treatment and reached maximum activation after 4–5 h (Fig. 1 B). The specificity of the caspase-3 assay was confirmed by the use of a caspase-3 inhibitor, which resulted in the complete inhibition of caspase-3 activity. Caspase-9 and caspase-1 were also evaluated to test if other caspases were activated by staurosporine treatment. Caspase-9 activity began to increase after 1 h of staurosporine treatment and reached a maximum within 3 h (Fig. 1 C), but caspase-1 was not activated. The time-dependent proteolytic cleavage of PARP to the 85-kDa fragment after treatment with 0.5 μm staurosporine corresponded to the time-dependent activation of caspase-3 (Fig.1 D). Examination of cells treated with 0.5 μmstaurosporine for 8 h and stained with Hoechst 33342 revealed the characteristic morphology associated with apoptosis, such as nuclear condensation and cell shrinkage (Fig. 1 E). To test the hypothesis that GSK-3β facilitates apoptosis, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with HA-tagged GSK-3β, and several stable cell lines were established. Fig.2 shows the levels of GSK-3β, procaspase-3, and procaspase-9 in untransfected control cells, vector-transfected cells, and four cell lines of HA-GSK-3β-overexpressing cells. Two bands are evident on the GSK-3β immunoblots because HA-GSK-3β migrates slower than endogenous GSK-3β due to the HA-tag (Fig. 2 A). In these four cell lines total GSK-3β averaged 347% ± 7% and 379% ± 7% of the GSK-3β in untransfected cells and vector-transfected cells, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The activity of GSK-3β was also measured in each cell line (Fig. 2C). In the four GSK-3β-transfected cell lines, GSK-3β activity averaged 327% ± 57% and 349% ± 61% of the GSK-3β in untransfected and vector-transfected cells, respectively. In GSK-3β-overexpressing cells, the levels of procaspase-3 averaged 90% ± 11% and 113% ± 13% (Fig.2 B), and the level of procaspase-9 averaged 111% ± 10% and 95% ± 9% that of the levels of these caspases in untransfected cells and vector-transfected cells, respectively. Further experiments were carried out using cell line 7, and results were confirmed using the other three HA-GSK-3β-expressing cell lines. The staurosporine concentration-dependent activation of caspase-3 was measured 3 h after treatment in vector-transfected cells and in the four subclones of HA-GSK-3β-transfected cells. Basal caspase-3 activities in vector- and HA-GSK-3β-transfected cells were not different from control SH-SY5Y cells. In vector-transfected cells, activation of caspase-3 by staurosporine (Fig.3 A) was equivalent to that obtained in untransfected SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1). In marked contrast, overexpression of HA-GSK-3β greatly potentiated staurosporine-induced activation of caspase-3 in all four cells lines overexpressing GSK-3β. The caspase-3 activity in HA-GSK-3β-transfected cells averaged 280% and 250% of that in vector-transfected cells after treatment with 0.1 and 0.5 μm staurosporine, respectively (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, caspase-9 activity in HA-GSK-3β-transfected cells averaged 180% and 245% of that in vector-transfected cells after treatment with 0.1 and 0.5 μm staurosporine, respectively (Fig. 3 B). The potentiation of staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activity by GSK-3β overexpression was confirmed by a greater degree of PARP proteolysis (Fig. 3 C) and greater numbers of cells exhibiting apoptotic morphology (Fig. 3, D and E). These results indicate that overexpression of HA-GSK-3β increases the sensitivity of cells to staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Cells were pretreated with lithium to inhibit GSK-3β to test if inhibition of GSK-3β attenuates staurosporine-induced activation of caspase-3 in control or HA-GSK-3β-transfected cells. The large differences in the concentration of staurosporine that activated caspase-3 in control and HA-GSK-3β-transfected cells made it necessary to use different protocols for each cell line, so caspase-3 was measured in untransfected cells 4 h after treatment with 0.5 μmstaurosporine and in HA-GSK-3β-transfected cells 3 h after treatment with 0.1 μm staurosporine. Untransfected SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mmlithium for 24 h and then treated with 0.5 μmstaurosporine for 4 h. Pretreatment of control SH-SY5Y cells with 5 mm lithium significantly decreased staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activity by 28% (Fig.4 A). HA-GSK-3β-transfected cells were pretreated for 24 h (Fig. 4 B) or were treated chronically for 7 days (Fig. 4 C) with 1.25, 2.5, or 5 mm lithium. Pretreatment for 24 h with 5 mm lithium significantly reduced the staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activity by 40%. Chronic treatment with 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mm lithium resulted in reductions of 23%, 31%, and 65%, respectively, of caspase-3 activity induced by staurosporine. These results demonstrate that the facilitatory effect of GSK-3β on staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activity is attenuated by lithium. To test if the potentiation by HA-GSK-3β and attenuation by lithium of caspase-3 activation occur with another apoptotic paradigm, the effects of these treatments were measured in cells subjected to heat shock (30 min at 45 °C) followed by incubation at 37 °C, a model widely used to study the responses of cells to stress (41.Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Samali A. Orrenius S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In vector-transfected cells caspase-3 activity increased to 425% and 975% that of the basal activity following 30 min and 90 min of incubation at 37 °C, respectively (Fig.5 A). In HA-GSK-3β-transfected cells, caspase-3 activity increased to 1500% and 3100% that of the basal activity after 30 and 90 min of incubation at 37 °C, respectively. Pretreatment of HA-GSK-3β-transfected cells with 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mm Li for 24 h reduced the heat shock-induced caspase-3 activation by 13%, 25%, and 56%, respectively. These results demonstrate that overexpression of GSK-3β potentiates the activation of caspase-3 after treatment with heat shock and that pretreatment with lithium, a GSK-3β inhibitor, attenuates this effect. In marked contrast to its modest beginning as a regulator of glycogen synthesis, GSK-3β has been found to participate in a remarkable number of signaling pathways, which, based on the findings reported here, include the ultimate decision between cell death and survival. Thus, cells overexpressing GSK-3β succumbed much more rapidly to the apoptosis-inducing actions of staurosporine or exposure to elevated temperature than did cells with a normal complement of GSK-3β. Furthermore, lithium, an inhibitor of GSK-3β, counteracted the facilitation of apoptosis caused by overexpression of GSK-3β. These findings demonstrate that initial steps in the apoptotic signaling involving activation of caspases can be influenced by GSK-3β. Staurosporine is one of the most commonly used agents to experimentally induce apoptosis, and apoptosis occurs in essentially all cell types exposed to appropriate concentrations of staurosporine, suggesting that it activates a cell death program common to all cells (38.Kruman I. Guo Q. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Staurosporine previously has been reported to induce apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (40.Posmantur R. McGinnis K. Nadimpalli R. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2328-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 46.Chakravarthy B.R. Walker T. Rasquinha I. Hill I.E. MacManus J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In these cells, 0.5 μm staurosporine was reported to increase caspase-3 activity, result in PARP proteolysis, and cause morphological changes indicative of apoptosis within a few hours of treatment (40.Posmantur R. McGinnis K. Nadimpalli R. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2328-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), effects also observed in this investigation. Furthermore, we observed approximately a linear concentration-dependent activation of caspase-3 within the range of 0.1 to 1 μmstaurosporine. In cells overexpressing GSK-3β, the staurosporine concentration-dependent activation of caspase-3 and of caspase-9 was shifted to the left, so greater activation of these caspases were achieved after treatment with low concentrations of staurosporine. These findings indicated that GSK-3β facilitated staurosporine-induced apoptosis. This conclusion was further confirmed by the findings of greater PARP proteolysis and morphological changes denoting apoptotic cells in GSK-3β-transfected cells than control cells after exposure to staurosporine. Furthermore, the GSK-3β inhibitor, lithium, attenuated the facilitation of staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activity in cells overexpressing GSK-3β. Taken together, these results demonstrate that GSK-3β is a facilitator of the apoptosis-signaling cascade induced by staurosporine. Our results extend those of Pap and Cooper (23.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), who recently presented evidence that GSK-3β is proapoptotic. In their studies, transient transfection of GSK-3β in PC12 cells and Rat-1 fibroblasts caused 60 to 70% of cells to spontaneously undergo apoptosis with no additional treatment within 48 h in a caspase-3-dependent manner. Our results differ from those of Pap and Cooper (23.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) in that a 3.5-fold overexpression of GSK-3β alone failed to alter caspase-3 activity or cell survival, a difference that may be due to differential cell susceptibilities to the action of GSK-3β or to differences in the expression levels of GSK-3β, which were not reported by Pap and Cooper (23.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Regardless of this difference, both studies clearly support the conclusion that GSK-3β is an important modulator of cell survival. In addition to staurosporine-induced apoptosis, overexpression of GSK-3β potentiated, and lithium treatment attenuated, caspase-3 activation following subjection of cells to heat shock. A variety of strategic responses are initiated in cells to limit the deleterious consequences of stressors, as modeled by heat shock, such as alterations in the activities of signaling protein kinases and induction of the expression of heat shock proteins (see Ref. 47.Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Volloch V.Z. Sherman M.Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar for review). In SH-SY5Y cells as well as many other types of cells, the responses to a 30-min period of heat shock (45 °C) are adequate to support survival; thus, little caspase-3 activation was observed following heat shock in control cells in this study. Both activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (48.Lin R.Z. Hu Z.W. Chin J.H. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31196-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and inactivation of GSK-3β (49.Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) have been reported to follow heat shock, responses that may contribute, along with others, to protection from heat shock. The results of the present study suggest that adequate inactivation of GSK-3β is critical for cell survival, as excessive GSK-3β resulted in a massive activation of caspase-3 following heat shock, whereas inhibition of GSK-3β by lithium in cells overexpressing HA-GSK-3β protected cells from heat shock-induced caspase-3 activation. The results presented here suggest two complementary conclusions, that activation of GSK-3β facilitates apoptosis, and that the anti-apoptotic actions of agents that stimulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (17.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar) may be due in part to the inhibitory effect of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling on GSK-3β activity. The mechanism by which decreased GSK-3β activity contributes to neuroprotection and increased GSK-3β activity contributes to apoptosis remains unknown. One possible mechanism is the regulation by GSK-3β of β-catenin. Increased GSK-3β activity facilitates degradation of β-catenin (50.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar), and reduced β-catenin and the associated reduction in the activity of Tcf/Lef transcription factors has been linked to decreased cell survival (51.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar, 52.Rubinfeld B. Robbins P. El-Gamil M. Albert I.

Sommer B. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. Saftig P. De Strooper B. He X. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have found that activation of the heat shock factor-1 transcription factor and the associated expression of heat shock protein-70, which is known to protect against cell death (54.Li G.C. Werb Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 55.Jäättelä M. Wissing D. Kokholm K. Egeblad M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), were impaired by expression of GSK-3β and restored by lithium treatment (56.Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1999; 25: 2015Google Scholar). However, since GSK-3β affects a large number of signaling systems, further investigation is necessary to identify those that are critical for its facilitatory action on apoptosis. Regardless of the mechanism by which GSK-3β facilitates apoptosis, it is evident that inhibition of GSK-3β by lithium reduced caspase-3 activation after both staurosporine and heat shock treatments of GSK-3β-transfected cells. Although lithium has been reported to affect a variety of other targets (26.Jope R.S. Mol. Psychiatry. 1999; 4: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) that cannot completely be discounted as contributory, the accentuated protective effects of lithium in GSK-3β-transfected cells suggests that inhibition of GSK-3β accounts for the protection from apoptosis conferred by lithium. During the last few years several studies (reviewed in Ref.26.Jope R.S. Mol. Psychiatry. 1999; 4: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), especially those from Chuang and co-workers, have shown that lithium protects neurons from the deleterious effects of a wide variety of insults, such as ischemia (30.Nonaka S. Chuang D.M. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2081-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and activation of excitatory amino acid receptors (27.Nonaka S. Hough C.J. Chuang D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 57.Chen R.W. Chuang D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6039-6042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The findings in this study raise the possibility that these neuroprotective actions of lithium may occur at least in part because of its capacity to inhibit GSK-3β. In summary, the results reported here demonstrate for the first time that modest increases in GSK-3β facilitate apoptosis in two model systems, including apoptosis induced by staurosporine and by heat shock. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of lithium on GSK-3β and its attenuation of GSK-3β-facilitated apoptosis suggest that some of the widely reported neuroprotective effects of lithium may result from this action.

Four different elicitors from bacteria, fungi, and plants lead to a rapid and transient activation of AtMPK6, indicating a conserved signaling pathway. The induction was equally rapid as medium alkalinization, one of the earliest elicitor response observed in cell cultures. A similarly rapid activation of AtMPK6 was observed in elicitor-treated leaf strips, demonstrating that recognition of the elicitors and activation of the MAPK pathway occurs also in intact plants.

Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Homologues of MAPKs as well as upstream kinases have been found in fungi, invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants. Activation of MAPKs requires phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues (2.Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) by upstream dual specificity kinases, termed MAPK kinases or MAPKKs (3.Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). MAPKKs, in turn, are activated through phosphorylation by a highly diverse group of MAPKK kinases. A remarkable feature of this three-tiered cascade is that a relatively small number of MAPKs and MAPKKs appear to be coupled to a vast range of extracellular stimuli to give tissue-specific responses. Specificity is thought to be achieved by scaffolding of the cascade components, differences in signaling kinetics, and co-activation of other pathways (4.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, 5.Tan P.B.O. Kim S.K Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The biological processes in which MAPKs are involved are best understood in yeast and mammals. Five MAPK modules have been described in yeast that regulate mating, filamentous growth, high osmolarity response, cell wall remodeling, and sporulation (6.Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In mammals, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 regulate growth and differentiation, while stress responses are signaled through p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (1.Widmann C.

More than 20 cDNAs encoding putative MAPKs have been cloned from different plant species, which can be grouped into four or five classes according to sequence similarity (9.Mizoguchi T. Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Trends. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 15-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 10.Jonak C. Ligterink W. Hirt H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Within each class, the high degree of sequence similarity appears to reflect a functional conservation between plant species (10.Jonak C. Ligterink W. Hirt H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite extensive evidence for the induction of MAPK-like activity in plants, the identification of a particular class of MAPK-like plant kinases induced by a particular stimulus has been difficult and has successfully been performed only in two cases. During cell cycle and cytokinesis, specific changes in transcript levels, kinase activities, and subcellular localization were reported for two members of one class, Ntf6 from tobacco and MMK3 from alfalfa (12.Calderini O. Bögre L. Vicente O. Binarova P. Heberle-Bors E. Wilson C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Bögre L. Calderini O. Binarova P. Mattauch M. Till S. Kiegerl S.

The second and most thoroughly studied class of MAPKs is that induced in stress and elicitor responses, in particular salicylate-induced protein kinase (SIPK) and wound-induced protein kinase (WIPK) in tobacco. SIPK was originally identified as a 48-kDa kinase induced in tobacco suspension culture by salicylic acid (24.Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Increased SIPK activity has been demonstrated after treatment with general and race-specific elicitors (22.Zhang S. Du H. Klessig D.F Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 435-449PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D.G.

Similarly, transcript levels of the highly related genes MMK4 and AtMPK3 increase in wounded alfalfa plants (19.Bögre L. Ligterink W. Meskiene I. Barker P.J. Heberle Bors E. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H.

Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), respectively. Recently, the induction of WIPK kinase activity has been reported in wounded tobacco (28.Seo S. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and Avr9-treated suspension cells of tobacco expressing the Cf9 gene (26.Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar). For the study of the responses of plants to pathogens,Arabidopsis thaliana is a well established model organism (29.Kunkel B.N. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 63-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30.Innes R.W. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 229-304Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although a large collection of mutants with altered pathogen responses is available, the question remains open which “classical” signal transduction pathways, if any, play a role in pathogen sensing. Nine MAP kinases, five MAPKKs, and eight MAPKK kinases have been cloned from Arabidopsis (9.Mizoguchi T. Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Trends. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 15-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31.Mizoguchi T. Hayashida N. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Kamada H. Shinozaki K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but it is not known which of these kinases is involved in elicitor signal transduction. The high degree of sequence similarity between the AtMPK6 and SIPK indicates that theArabidopsis protein might perform a function similar to that of SIPK in tobacco. We have used previously characterized elicitors (32.Boller T. Annu. Rev. Plant Phys. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 189-214Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and the peptide flg22 (33.Felix G. Duran J.D. Volko S. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 34.Gómez-Gómez L. Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) to study the induction of kinase activities in A. thaliana. flg22, a peptide derived from the most conserved domain of the eubacterial flagellin protein, is a potent elicitor of defense responses in cell cultures of several plant species (33.Felix G. Duran J.D. Volko S. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) andArabidopsis seedlings (34.Gómez-Gómez L. Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that at least four elicitors are able to induce AtMPK6 activity inArabidopsis suspension cultures. Activation of AtMPK6 is rapid (i.e. concomitant with the other earliest observable responses) and correlated with its phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues. Suspension-cultured cells ofA. thaliana, ecotype “Landsberg erecta” were maintained as described previously (35.May M.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and used for experiments 7 days after subculture. Flagellin peptide (flg22) was synthesized by F. Fischer (Friedrich-Miescher-Institut, Basel, Switzerland). Hexa-N-acetylchitohexaose was obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan), and xylanase from Trichoderma viride was purchased from Fluka (Buchs Switzerland). Pectic fragments were prepared by incubation of citrus pectin (Roth) at 60 mg/ml (adjusted to pH 5 with NaOH) with pectolyase Y23 (Seishin) at 30 μg/ml for 20 min at room temperature. After digestion, the solution was boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was lyophilized and redissolved to yield a stock solution of 50 mg/ml. Suspension-cultured cells were transferred to a beaker on a rotary shaker at 120 cycles/min. The pH of the culture medium was measured continuously with a small combined glass electrode (Metrohm) and registered with a pen recorder. At the indicated times after the addition of an elicitor, samples of 0.5 ml were taken, the medium was removed by filtration, and the cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Further sample processing was done according to Ref. 18.Jonak C. Kiegerl S. Ligterink W. Barker P.J. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11274-11279Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were ground in liquid nitrogen after the addition of 2 ml/(g of plant material) homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNaF, 0.5 mm NaVO3, 15 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 15 mm para-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min to yield a crude, soluble protein extract. For in-gel kinase assays, 50 μg of protein (assayed with the DC system; Bio-Rad) were precipitated in 80% acetone, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.2 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma). Renaturation and kinase assay were performed according to Ref.36.Suzuki K. Shinshi H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar. Radioactive bands were visualized by exposure of the dried gels to a PhosphorImager and quantified with ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For immunoprecipitations, 0.5–2 μl of the M23 antibody (raised against the C-terminal sequence FNPEYQQ of the alfalfa MAP kinase MMK1) 2Munnik, T., Ligterink, W., Meskiene, I., Calderini, O., Beyerly, J., Musgrave, A., and Hirt, H. (1999)Plant J. 20, 381–388 were incubated with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in SucI buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After four washes with SucI buffer, 200 μg of crude protein extract was added and incubated with the antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. Washing steps were performed as in Ref. 18.Jonak C. Kiegerl S. Ligterink W. Barker P.J. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11274-11279Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar. Kinase assays were performed in 25 μl of 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mg/ml MBP, 0.2 mm ATP, and 37 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min at room temperature. Phosphate incorporation into MBP was quantified after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 15% gel. A. thaliana (ecotype “Landsberg erecta”) was grown in soil in a growth chamber for 5 weeks. Fully expanded leaves were cut into 1–2-mm strips and floated overnight on water with gentle shaking. Ten strips were submerged in a tube with 1 ml of water or dilute elicitor solutions; vacuum-infiltrated for 20 s; and incubated for another 3 or 10 min before drainage, freezing in liquid nitrogen, and sample processing as described for suspension-cultured cells. Suspension-cultured cells were equilibrated on a rotary shaker as described and buffered 30 min before labeling by the addition of 20 mm MES/KOH, pH 6. One-ml aliquots were taken before and 2 min after elicitation with 100 nm flg22 and added to 300 kBq [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a small glass potter. After 30 s, the medium with the excess radioactivity was removed. One ml of homogenization buffer was added, and the cells were homogenized on ice. Immunoprecipitation was done as described, and the precipitate was analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained and dried, and the labeled 49-kDa band was localized by autoradiography. The excised band was washed with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, dried, and digested with 1 μg of modified trypsin (Promega) in 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C. Phosphopeptides were recovered by extraction of the gel piece with 50% acetonitrile, dried, and analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography/electrophoresis on cellulose plates as described by Boyle et al. (37.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Chromatographic separation inn-butanol/H2O/pyridine/glacial acetic acid (7.5:6:5:1.5) in the first dimension was followed by electrophoresis in pH 8.9 buffer (1% ammonium bicarbonate) for 1 h at 1000 V in the second dimension. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed with protein blotted to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp.) for 1 h at 2.4 mA/cm2 gel area in a Milliblot-SDE electroblotting apparatus (Millipore). The identified band was excised and hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysate was cleared by centrifugation (5 min at 20,000 × g), dried in a vacuum concentrator, redissolved in H2O, and analyzed by one-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis at pH 3.5 (5% glacial acetic acid, 0.5% pyridine) as described by Boyle et al.(37.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Alternatively, phosphopeptides were recovered from TLC plates, eluted with 50% acetonitrile, dried, and hydrolyzed as described above. Initial experiments were performed to test whether flg22, a peptide with potent elicitor activity derived from the most conserved domain of bacterial flagellin (33.Felix G. Duran J.D. Volko S. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), would induce MAP kinase-like activity in Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures. After the addition of flg22 to the culture, cells were harvested at various times, and cell extracts were analyzed by an in-gel kinase assay with MBP as substrate. Within 2 min after the addition of 100 nm flg22, MAP kinase-like activity of two protein classes with apparent molecular masses of 45 and 49 kDa began to increase (Fig. 1). These MBP kinase activities peaked at 5–10 min after elicitation and returned to nearly basal levels within 60 min. A weak band of approximately 40 kDa was sometimes observed that showed a pattern of activation opposite to the 45- and 49-kDa bands. It was detectable in control samples, disappeared when the 45- and 49-kDa bands displayed maximal activity, and reappeared 15–30 min after elicitation. The kinase activities detected in the in-gel kinase assays showed many of the characteristics that have been reported in other systems (21.Ligterink W. Kroj T. zur Nieden U. Hirt H. Scheel D. Science. 1997; 276: 2054-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar,38.Lebrun-Garcia A. Ouaked F. Chiltz A. Pugin A. Plant J. 1998; 15: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). They could be blocked by the kinase inhibitor K-252a and activated in the absence of elicitors by the addition of the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (data not shown). One difference, however, was that valinomycin, an ionophore that evokes alkalinization of the culture medium to a similar degree as elicitors, does not induce MBP kinase activities in the in-gel assay (data not shown). This result indicates that ion fluxes alone are not sufficient to induce the kinase response, in contrast to what has been reported in other systems (26.Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar). The alkalinization of the medium is not necessary for AtMPK6 activation, since buffering, as performed in the in vivolabeling experiment (see below), has no effect on AtMPK6 phosphorylation and activation. In tobacco, SIPK was identified as a MAP kinase that is activated after treatment with salicylic acid and elicitors (22.Zhang S. Du H. Klessig D.F Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 435-449PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). AlthoughArabidopsis contains at least nine genes encoding MAP kinases, the SIPK sequence is most similar to ArabidopsisAtMPK6 (31.Mizoguchi T. Hayashida N. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Kamada H. Shinozaki K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether AtMPK6 was one of the proteins with elicitor-induced kinase activity inArabidopsis cells using immunoprecipitation followed by an in-gel assay for MBP kinase activity. The antibody employed, M23, was raised against the C-terminal seven amino acids of MMK1, an elicitor-induced MAP kinase in alfalfa.2 These seven amino acids are identical to the C terminus of AtMPK6 but not to any of the other known Arabidopsis MAP kinases. M23 immunoprecipitates of cell extracts taken 4 min after elicitation contain a kinase activity with an apparent molecular mass of 49 kDa, as seen in the in-gel kinase assay (Fig. 2). In the extract that has been immunodepleted of AtMPK6, the 49-kDa band is strongly reduced compared with an untreated sample, while the 45-kDa band remains unchanged. These results indicate that activated AtMPK6 is at least partially, if not entirely, responsible for the activity in the 49-kDa band of the in-gel assay. In tobacco, the activation of another kinase, WIPK, was reported after wounding (28.Seo S. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and in Avr9-treated tobacco cells expressing theCf9 gene (26.Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar). Our attempts to demonstrate activation of AtMPK3, the closest homologue of WIPK in Arabidopsis, were unsuccessful. Using assay conditions that allow detection of basal MBP kinase activity (28.Seo S. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), neither an antibody directed against the six C-terminal amino acids of MMK4, the alfalfa homologue of WIPK, nor an antibody against the 11 C-terminal amino acids of AtMPK3 precipitated any elicitor-induced kinase activity (data not shown). Therefore, our study focused on AtMPK6. Alkalinization of the culture medium represents one of the earliest responses observable in suspension cultures treated with microbial elicitors (40.Felix G. Grosskopf D.G. Regenass M. Boller T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 8831-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We examined the relative timing of changes in ion fluxes and MAPK activation by immunoprecipitating AtMPK6 from samples taken at intervals from cultured cells while the pH of the culture medium was continuously measured. Activity in these samples was measured as MBP-kinase activity using an in-solution assay. The time course of activation of AtMPK6 kinase activity (Fig. 3 A) was very similar to that of the in-gel activity bands shown in Fig. 1. A comparison of the phosphorylation of MBP with the change in the medium pH (Fig. 3 B) showed that both responses initiated after a lag phase of ∼2 min and increased almost simultaneously during the first 5 min after elicitation. After the first 5 min, AtMPK6 activity remained constant for 10 min and then slowly returned to its basal level, while the medium pH remained at a high level and did not decrease until several hours after elicitation (data not shown). In addition to the flg22 peptide of bacterial origin, at least three more elicitors derived from fungi and plants acted as elicitors of AtMPK6 activity and medium alkalinization (Fig. 4) inArabidopsis suspension-cultured cells. Pectic fragments (oligogalacturonides) elicited a particularly rapid and only transient activation of the MAP kinase, with a maximal activity around 3.5 min and a nearly complete return to basal activity after 15 min (Fig.4 A). Hexameric chitin fragments elicited AtMPK6 activity to a similar degree and with nearly identical kinetics as the flg22 peptide (Fig. 4 B). Xylanase from the fungusTrichoderma viride induced AtMPK6 activity more slowly than other elicitors (Fig. 4 C), with a maximum at 20 min. The activity decreased slowly thereafter but did not reach the basal level within 40 min. As was observed in the experiments with flg22, no increase in AtMPK6 activity was measured before the onset of the pH response. With xylanase and chitin, the increase in kinase activity typically paralleled the pH curve. During the oligogalacturonide treatment, however, kinase activation lagged slightly behind the pH response. To test whether responses in suspension-cultured cells are similar to those of cells within differentiated tissue, we examined if flg22 and chitin activated AtMPK6 in leaf tissue. To achieve rapid and even exposure, leaves of 5-week-old Arabidopsis plants were cut into 1–2-mm strips, incubated on water to allow the wound response to subside, and vacuum-infiltrated with elicitor solutions or water. After immunoprecipitation, a low basal level of AtMPK6 activity was detected in water-infiltrated tissue after 3 min, with a slight increase after 10 min. In similar cases, this has been attributed to physical stress (26.Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Suzuki K. Shinshi H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). After infiltration with flg22 or chitin fragments, however, AtMPK6 activity increased strongly within 3 min and further increased within 10 min (Fig. 5). These data demonstrate that differentiated plant tissue of A. thalianaresponds to general elicitors by activation of AtMPK6 in a similar way as suspension-cultured cells. In mammalian cells, activation of MAP kinases is correlated with their dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues within a TXY motif (2.Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Plant MAP kinases also contain this conserved phosphorylation motif as TEY or TDY. Therefore, a similar mode of activation has been inferred from Western blots and immunoprecipitations with antibodies against phosphotyrosine and/or active mammalian MAP kinases (26.Romeis T. Piedras P. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Hirt H. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Suzuki K. Shinshi H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 38.Lebrun-Garcia A. Ouaked F. Chiltz A. Pugin A. Plant J. 1998; 15: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and from inactivation of MBP kinase activity with tyrosine- and serine/threonine phosphatases (20.Àdam A.L. Pike S. Hoyos E. Stone J.M. Walker J.C. Novacky A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,27.Seo S. Okamoto M. Seto H. Ishizuka K. Sano H. Ohashi Y Science. 1995; 270: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In an in vitro assay, the Arabidopsis MAP kinases AtMPK1 and AtMPK2 can be phosphorylated by a XenopusMAPKK on threonine and tyrosine residues (39.Mizoguchi T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Hayashida N. Iwasaki T. Kamada H. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 1994; 5: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In our laboratory,in vivo pulse labeling of suspension-cultured cells has been established as a method to detect rapid changes in protein phosphorylation (40.Felix G. Grosskopf D.G. Regenass M.

https://openalex.org/W2125041118,"Ion channel targeting within neuronal and muscle membranes is an important determinant of electrical excitability. Recent evidence suggests that there exists within the membrane specialized microdomains commonly referred to as lipid rafts. These domains are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and concentrate a number of signal transduction proteins such as nitric-oxide synthase, ligand-gated receptors, and multiple protein kinases. Here, we demonstrate that the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv2.1, but not Kv4.2, targets to lipid rafts in both heterologous expression systems and rat brain. The Kv2.1 association with lipid rafts does not appear to involve caveolin. Depletion of cellular cholesterol alters the buoyancy of the Kv2.1 associated rafts and shifts the midpoint of Kv2.1 inactivation by nearly 40 mV without affecting peak current density or channel activation. The differential targeting of Kv channels to lipid rafts represents a novel mechanism both for the subcellular sorting of K+ channels to regions of the membrane rich in signaling complexes and for modulating channel properties via alterations in lipid content.

In cardiac and skeletal myocytes, ion channels show a differential surface distribution (1.Mays D.J. Foose J.M. Philipson L.H. Tamkun M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 2.Jorgensen A.O. Shen A.C. Arnold W. Leung A.T. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Within the brain, voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels often show not only polarized sorting to either axons or dendrites, but also isoform-specific localization within dendrites alone. Thus, there exists specific sorting mechanisms for restricting lateral distribution within a given membrane domain (3.Scannevin R.H. Murakoshi H. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1619-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). One physiological consequence for such specific localization is that it places various signal transduction molecules near their ion channel substrates (4.Jonas E.A. Kaczmarek L.K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Several families of intracellular proteins, PDZs and AKAPs, have been shown to cluster both ion channels and modulatory signaling enzymes. Indeed, great emphasis has been placed on the role of PDZ proteins such as PSD-95 in the targeting and localization of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors (5.Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of membrane lipids in differential targeting and integration of ion channels within the plane of the plasma membrane has not been addressed.Recent advances in the study of cell membrane structure have led to the emerging idea that microdomains exist within the fluid bilayer of the plasma membrane. These dynamic structures, termed lipid rafts, are rich in tightly packed sphingolipids and cholesterol (6.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). The rafts, which are present in both excitable and non-excitable cells, localize a number of membrane proteins, including multiple signal transduction molecules, while excluding others (7.Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Different types of rafts are likely to exist based on the presence of specific marker proteins and ultrastructure data (8.Volonte D. Galbiati F. Li S. Nishiyama K. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12702-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Caveolae represent one well studied subpopulation of lipid raft having an invaginated morphology and containing the scaffolding protein, caveolin, which interacts directly with several intracellular proteins (7.Harder T.

Biol. 1999; 16: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Kv2.1 K+ channels target to a non-caveolar lipid raft in both transfected cells and brain, whereas the Kv4.2 channel does not. In addition, cholesterol depletion dramatically alters Kv2.1 inactivation, while having no effect on Kv4.2. Thus, lipid raft association represents a new targeting mechanism for Kv channel localization that is based on protein-lipid interactions. The subcellular localization of ion channels is necessary for proper electrical signaling. In cardiac and skeletal myocytes, ion channels show a differential surface distribution (1.Mays D.J.

These dynamic structures, termed lipid rafts, are rich in tightly packed sphingolipids and cholesterol (6.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). The rafts, which are present in both excitable and non-excitable cells, localize a number of membrane proteins, including multiple signal transduction molecules, while excluding others (7.Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Different types of rafts are likely to exist based on the presence of specific marker proteins and ultrastructure data (8.Volonte D. Galbiati F. Li S. Nishiyama K. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12702-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Caveolae represent one well studied subpopulation of lipid raft having an invaginated morphology and containing the scaffolding protein, caveolin, which interacts directly with several intracellular proteins (7.Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 9.Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin.

Here, we demonstrate that Kv2.1 K+ channels target to a non-caveolar lipid raft in both transfected cells and brain, whereas the Kv4.2 channel does not. In addition, cholesterol depletion dramatically alters Kv2.1 inactivation, while having no effect on Kv4.2. Thus, lipid raft association represents a new targeting mechanism for Kv channel localization that is based on protein-lipid interactions. We thank Barbara Birks for technical assistance and Drs. Kurt Beam and Kathy Partin for review of this manuscript. Dr. Peter Backx kindly provided the Kv4.2 antibody."

We report the purification and molecular cloning of a cDNA for a 53-kDa β1,3-glucan-recognition protein from the tobacco hornworm,Manduca sexta. This protein is constitutively expressed in fat body and secreted into hemolymph. The protein contains a region with sequence similarity to several glucanases, but it lacks glucanase activity. It binds to the surface of and agglutinates yeast, as well as Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. β1,3-Glucan-recognition protein in the presence of laminarin, a soluble glucan, stimulated activation of prophenoloxidase in plasma, whereas laminarin alone did not. These results suggest that β1,3-glucan-recognition protein serves as a pattern recognition molecule for β1,3-glucan on the surface of fungal cell walls. After binding to β1,3-glucan, the protein may interact with a serine protease, leading to the activation of the prophenoloxidase cascade, a pathway in insects for defense against microbial infection.

Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They also play a crucial role in regulating the adaptive immune reactions carried out by vertebrate lymphocytes (2.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). Pattern recognition molecules bind to certain pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are not found in the host, such as lipopolysaccharide or peptidoglycan from bacterial cell walls and β1,3-glucan from fungal cell walls. Upon binding to the foreign invaders, pattern recognition proteins trigger defense pathways such as the complement system in vertebrates (2.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar) and the prophenoloxidase (PPO)1 activation pathway in insects and other arthropods (3.Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, New York1998: 135-172Google Scholar). The PPO activation pathway, like the complement system, involves a protease cascade. Determining the molecular mechanisms by which pattern recognition proteins differentiate nonself from self and transduce signals that stimulate defensive responses is a key to understanding the regulation of innate immune systems. Some pattern recognition proteins from mammals, such as the cellular receptor CD14, the mannose-binding protein, the first component of complement (C1q), and the macrophage mannose receptor and scavenger receptor have been well characterized (4.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Res. Immunol. 1996; 147: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recent investigations of pattern recognition molecules from insects have identified a group of C-type lectins, which bind bacterial lipopolysaccharides and stimulate antibacterial responses of hemocytes or activate the phenoloxidase pathway (5.Jomori T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13318-13323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Jomori T. Natori S.

A peptidoglycan recognition protein has also been discovered in the silkworm (9.Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 10.Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11854-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This 19-kDa hemolymph protein is constitutively expressed in the fat body, epithelial cells, and hemocytes of naive silkworms and can be induced by bacterial challenge. Binding of peptidoglycan to peptidoglycan recognition protein can trigger the PPO defense pathway (9.Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). A cDNA which encodes a similar bacteria-inducible peptidoglycan recognition protein has been cloned from the moth, Trichoplusia ni (11.Kang D. Liu G. Lundström A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Furthermore, proteins homologous to the insect peptidoglycan recognition proteins have been identified in human and mouse and are expressed in bone marrow and spleen (10.Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11854-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11.Kang D. Liu G. Lundström A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fungal infections can be recognized by proteins which bind to cell wall β1,3-glucans, a molecular pattern specific for fungi. A group of similar β1,3-glucan-binding proteins from crustaceans has been isolated, and a cDNA for one of them was cloned from the crayfish,Pacifastacus leniusculus (12.Duvic B. Söderhäll K. J.

The crayfish protein can induce spreading and degranulation of crayfish granular hemocytes when bound to β1,3-glucan (16.Barracco M.A. Duvic B. Söderhäll K. Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 266: 491-497Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An insect β1,3-glucan-recognition protein has been purified from the silkworm, Bombyx mori(17.Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of this 62-kDa protein with β1,3-glucan triggers the PPO pathway in plasma. Several β1,3-glucan-binding proteins have been purified from cockroach species (18.Söderhäll K. Rögener W. Söderhäll I. Newton R.P. Ratcliffe N.A. Insect Biochem. 1988; 18: 323-330Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19.Chen C. Rowley A.F. Ratcliffe N.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 721-731Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20.Chen C.

These proteins also enhance PPO activation triggered by soluble β1,3-glucan. However, so far no cDNA or amino acid sequence for an insect β1,3-glucan recognition protein has been reported. In this paper, we describe the purification and cDNA cloning of a β1,3-glucan-recognition protein (GRP) from the tobacco hornworm,M. sexta. It is synthesized in the fat body and secreted into hemolymph. The deduced amino acid sequence of GRP shows similarity with bacterial and sea urchin glucanases (21.Bachman E.S. McClay D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6808-6813Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), clotting factor G subunit α from a horseshoe crab (22.Seki N. Muta T. Oda T. Iwaki D. Kuma K. Miyata T.

A. 1996; 93: 7888-7893Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).M. sexta GRP at physiological concentration caused aggregation of yeast and bacteria. Finally, we report that GRP can trigger the activation of the PPO pathway upon binding to soluble β1,3-glucan. M. Sexta eggs were originally obtained from Carolina Biological Supply. Larvae were reared on an artificial diet as described by Dunn and Drake (25.Dunn P.E. Drake D. J. Inverteb. Pathol. 1983; 41: 77-85Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Hemolymph (100 ml) was collected from day 3 fifth instar M. sexta larvae. Cell-free hemolymph (plasma) was prepared by diluting the hemolymph 1:2 in anticoagulant buffer (4 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1.9 mm PIPES, 4.8 mm citric acid monohydrate, 13.6 mm sodium citrate, 4 mm EDTA, 5% sucrose, pH 6.8) and centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 15 min to remove hemocytes. The plasma (100 ml) was incubated with 0.5 g of curdlan (an insoluble β1,3-glucan preparation, Sigma) pre-equilibrated with PBS (0.01 m phosphate buffer, 0.0027m potassium chloride, and 0.137 m sodium chloride, pH 7.4, at 25 °C) at room temperature for 20 min with mixing and then centrifuged (12,000 × g, 5 min). The curdlan pellet was washed three times with 30 ml of PBS and then incubated with 5 ml of PBS and 1 ml of 6× SDS sample buffer (0.35m Tris, 10% (w/v) SDS, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 9.3% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.012% bromphenol blue) at 95 °C for 10 min. The sample was then centrifuged (12,000 × g, 5 min) and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The major band of 53 kDa was cut from the SDS-PAGE gel and used as an antigen for the production of a rabbit antiserum (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA). For immunoblot analysis of proteins after separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% dry skim milk, and then incubated with rabbit antiserum to GRP (1:1000 dilution). Antibody binding was visualized by a color reaction catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). To estimate the concentration of GRP in hemolymph, 1-μl samples of plasma were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting as described above. The immunoreactive bands were digitized using a Kodak DC120 digital camera, and band intensities were measured using one-dimensional Image Analysis Software (Kodak Digital Science). Lanes containing known concentrations of purified, native GRP were used to produce a standard curve, for determining GRP concentration in plasma samples. Plasma from larvae of several insect species including the Indian mealmoth Plodia interpunctella, the fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster, and the tobacco budwormHeliothis virescens (obtained from the Department of Entomology, Kansas State University) was collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, using antiserum to M. sexta GRP. One hundred and fifty ml of hemolymph were collected as described above, and then fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The 20–35% saturated ammonium sulfate fraction of the plasma proteins was dissolved in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight at 4 °C with several changes of buffer. Then the sample was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 15 min) before it was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) anion exchange column (3 × 10 cm). The column was washed with the same buffer until A 280 was less than 0.01 and then eluted at 2 ml/min with a gradient of 20 to 200 mm NaCl (200 ml total) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6. Finally, the column was eluted with 100 ml of 200 mmNaCl in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6. Fractions (5 ml) were collected and analyzed for absorbance at 280 nm and by Western blotting, using antibody to GRP. Fractions containing GRP were pooled and passed through a concanavalin A (ConA) affinity column (3 × 5 cm). The flow-through fractions, containing GRP, were pooled and applied to a hydroxyapatite column (3 × 3 cm) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The hydroxyapatite column was washed with the same buffer untilA 280 was less than 0.01 and then eluted at 0.1 ml/min with a gradient of 10 to 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8 (200 ml total). Finally, the column was eluted with 100 ml of 500 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Fractions (5 ml) containing GRP (detected by Western blot analysis) were pooled and analyzed by gel filtration HPLC using a Bio-Sil SEC250 column (300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad). The column was eluted with 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl at 1 ml/min, and fractions collected every 15 s were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The column was calibrated by separating a mixture of molecular mass standard proteins (Bio-Rad) containing thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa) to produce a standard curve for estimating the apparent mass of native GRP. GRP (2 μg) purified by affinity to curdlan was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad), and stained with Amido Black. The GRP band was cut from the membrane and subjected to automated Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems Model 473 Pulse-liquid Sequencer. To generate a peptide fragment used to obtain an internal sequence, purified GRP (100 μg) in 100 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer was dried using a Speed-Vac and dissolved in 100 μl of freshly prepared 70% formic acid (26.Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, the sample was dried using a Speed-Vac and dissolved in 20 μl of water. The hydrolyzed peptides were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using the O'Farrell System (27.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kinston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Amido Black. One peptide spot with mass of 25 kDa was cut from the membrane and subjected to automated Edman degradation. GRP purified from plasma (0.07 μg/μl, 100 μl) was mixed with 4 μl of 0.5 mEDTA, 1 μl of 10% SDS, 1 μl of β-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 100 °C for 3 min, then cooled to room temperature. Then 10 μl of 10% Triton X-100 and 10 μl of N-glycosidase F (0.2 units/μl, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The digested GRP and the untreated GRP were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry on a Lasermat 2000 instrument (Finnigan MAT). Protein samples were mixed with cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (1 mg/ml) as the matrix, and bovine serum albumin was used as an internal standard. Primers for PCR amplification of a cDNA fragment encoding GRP were designed based on amino acid sequences of the amino terminus and an internal fragment (Fig. 3). Three sense-strand degenerate primers were synthesized: P1, 5′-GA(A/G)GTICCIGA(T/C)GC(T/C/A/G)AA-3′; P2, 5′-GA(A/G)GCIAT(T/C/A)TA(T/C)CCIAA(A/G)GG-3′; and P3, 5′-CGAGTATCCAT(A/C/TC)C(A/C/G/T)GA(C/T)GA-3′, which encode LEVPDA, EAIYPKG, and RVSIPDD, respectively. Two antisense primers were synthesized: P6, 5′-GGTGGTACAAT(A/T)AT(A/C/G/T)GC(A/G)TC-3′ and P7, 5′-TTGATTTTGGC(A/C/G/T)GT(A/C/G/T)AC(A/T)AT-3′, which encode DAIIVPP and IVTAKIN, respectively. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from mRNA isolated from fat body of fifth instar larvae (collected 24 h after injection of 107 formalin-killedEscherichia coli) using the antisense primer 008 (5′-GGAGTACTCTAGAAGC(T)17-3′) (28.Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This cDNA template was amplified with primers 009 (5′-GGAGTACTCTAGAAGCTT-3′) and P1 (each at 1 μM) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μM dNTP, and 2 units of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Fisher Scientific). PCR was performed with denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles, using a DNA Thermal Cycler 480 (Perkin Elmer). The PCR product was used as a template to amplify again using primers P2 and P7 or P3 and P6 under the same conditions described above. A 700-base pair PCR product amplified using primers P2 and P7 was cloned into plasmid vector pGEM-T using a PCR cloning kit (Promega). A M. sexta larval fat body cDNA library in λ Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene) (28.Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was screened using the 700-base pair cloned cDNA PCR product, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (multiprime DNA labeling system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a probe. Plaques that hybridized to the probe were purified to homogeneity and subcloned by in vivo excission of pBluescipt plasmids. The positive clone with the longest cDNA insertion (1.6 kilobases) was sequenced from both strands by the DNA Sequencing Facility at Iowa State University, using vector primers and primers designed from previously determined sequences. Total RNA from day 3 fifth instarM. sexta larval fat body, hemocytes, or integument was extracted using the Rapid Total RNA Isolation Kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.). Samples of total RNA (20 μg) from these tissues were resolved by electrophoresis on an agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled GRP cDNA. To confirm equal mRNA loading in different samples, a duplicate blot was hybridized with a cDNA for M. sexta ribosomal protein S3 (29.Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as a control. To test whether GRP mRNA level is affected by microbial infection, M. sexta fifth instar day 3 larvae were injected with a mixture of killed E. coli (107cells) and yeast (107 cells). Control larvae were not injected. Total RNA from fat body was extracted 24 h after injection and analyzed by Northern blotting as described above. Band intensities were measured using one-dimensional Image Analysis Software (Kodak Digital Science), and the ratio of GRP mRNA to ribosomal protein S3 mRNA band intensity was calculated. Fat body from day 2 fifth instar M. sexta larvae was dissected, washed with PBS, and then incubated at 28 °C in 2 ml of EX-CELL 405 (JRH Biosciences) insect cell culture medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in wells of a 24-well plate with shaking at 100 rpm. At different times of incubation (0, 7, 11, 29, 40, and 64 h), 20 μl of the medium was removed and stored at −20 °C for later analysis. These samples were then analyzed for the presence of GRP by Western blotting using antibody to GRP as described above. Preliminary sequence editing and analysis was performed using IBI pustell programs. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA was used to search the nonredundant peptide sequence data base and the expressed sequence tag data base (National Center for Biotechnology Information) with the blast program (30.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69731) Google Scholar). The most similar protein sequences were retrieved and aligned with the GRP sequence using the pileup program from the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package 7.3.1 (31.Genetics Computer GroupProgram Manual for the GCG Package. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1991Google Scholar). PCR was used to generate a GRP cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 1–468, which was cloned into theNcoI and HindIII sites of E. coliexpression vector H6-pQE-60 (32.Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and used to transform E. coli strain XL1Blue. Expression of GRP in this vector yields a protein with an amino-terminal sequence of Met-(His)6-Ala-Met-Gly-Leu-Glu-Val. Maximum expression of the recombinant protein (0.1 mg/ml E. coli culture) was obtained from cultures in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, with shaking for 20 h at 37 °C. The bacteria from 100 ml of culture were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min and then resuspended in 10 ml of 8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 200 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer B) to lyse the bacteria. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was used for purification of recombinant GRP (H6GRP) by Ni2+-affinity chromatography. Approximately 5 mg of recombinant H6GRP was mixed with 5 ml of Ni-agarose resin (Qiagen) for 12 h at room temperature. This mixture was then packed in a column and washed with 15 ml of buffer B. Then the column was washed with a 60-ml gradient from 8 murea in Buffer B to 0 m urea in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mmglutathione, 0.02 mm oxidized glutathione, 10% glycerol (buffer C) at 1 ml/min. Finally, the column was eluted with 100 mm imidazole in buffer C. Three-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing purified H6GRP were stored at 4 °C. Immediately before use, samples were passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to change the buffer to 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. Purified H6GRP (1.6 mg) in 4 ml of 0.1m sodium carbonate, pH 9.0, was mixed with 14 mg of fluorescein isothiocyanate (Isomer I, on Celite, Sigma), stirred at room temperature for 4 h, and then centrifuged (10,000 ×g, 1 min). The FITC-H6GRP conjugate in the supernatant was separated from the unbound dye by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purity of the FITC-H6GRP was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. An aliquot of 50 μl of FITC-H6GRP (0.3 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol was mixed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5 × 107 cells), E. coli (5 × 107cells), or Micrococcus lysodeikticus (5 × 107 cells) at room temperature for 8 h and then at 4 °C overnight. The cells were then washed with 1 ml of TBS (0.137m NaCl, 0.003 m KCl, 0.025 mTris-HCl, pH 7.6) and resuspended in 1 ml of TBS. Binding of FITC-H6GRP was measured by subjecting the washed cells to flow cytometry analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. For each sample, fluorescence of 10,000 cells was determined. Untreated cells of each kind were used as controls to measure background fluorescence. To test the concentration dependence of FITC-H6GRP binding to S. cerevisiae orE. coli, aliquots of 20 μl of FITC-H6GRP (0 to 0.3 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl were mixed with 20 μl of S. cerevisiae or E. coli (5 × 107 cells/ml) suspended in TBS. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the cells were washed with TBS, resuspended in 1 ml of TBS, and subjected to flow cytometry as described above. An aliquot of 10 μl of H6GRP (0.1 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol was incubated with 10 μl of fluorescein-conjugated Staphylococcus aureus (2 × 109 cells/ml), E. coli (K-12 strain, 2 × 109 cells/ml), or S. cerevisiae (2 × 108 cells/ml) in TBS (all from Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 30 min. Samples of the cells were then applied to microscope slides, and the degree of aggregation of the cells was observed using an Olympus BH-2 fluorescence microscope. Twenty μl of H6GRP (0.2 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) was mixed with 20 μl of fresh plasma from day 3M. sexta larvae (diluted 1:2 in anticoagulant buffer) and 5 μl of laminarin (10 mg/ml or 1 mg/ml in TBS) in wells of a 96-well microplate. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, 20 μl of dopamine (16 mm in distilled water) as a phenoloxidase substrate, was added to each well. Phenoloxidase activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm at 1-min intervals using a PowerWave X 340 microplate scanning spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). Control samples lacked either H6GRP, laminarin, or both, which were replaced with appropriate buffers. To identify hemolymph proteins that can bind to β1,3-glucan, curdlan (an insoluble β1,3-glucan preparation) was used as an affinity matrix to purify proteins from M. sextalarval plasma. After incubating curdlan with plasma and washing the curdlan with buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by treatment with SDS and β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 10 min. When this sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, a major protein with a molecular mass of approximately 53 kDa was observed (Fig.1 A). This protein was later named β1,3-glucan-recognition protein (GRP). GRP accounted for more than 50% of the total protein eluted from curdlan. Several other weaker bands were also observed, including a band at ∼17 kDa. GRP bound so tightly to curdlan that it could not be eluted without denaturing in SDS. Treatments with acid (pH 1.5), high salt concentration (2 m NaCl), or 8 m urea did not elute GRP from curdlan. Approximately 3 mg of denatured GRP was obtained from 100 ml of hemolymph by this affinity method. GRP eluted from curdlan was further purified by SDS-PAGE, and the 53-kDa band on the gel was excised and injected into a rabbit to raise an antiserum. This antiserum recognized a single protein band of 53 kDa in Western blot analysis of M. sexta plasma (Fig.1 B). The sequence of the amino-terminal 23 residues of this protein was determined by Edman degradation (Fig. 3). The amino-terminal sequence (19 residues) of the protein in the 17-kDa band that bound to curdlan also was determined and found to be identical to that of the 53-kDa GRP. The 17-kDa protein thus appears to be an amino-terminal fragment of GRP. When plasma proteins bound to curdlan were eluted by SDS treatment in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol, the 17-kDa amino-terminal fragment of GRP was still observed by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown), suggesting that this fragment bound to curdlan by itself rather than through a disulfide link to the carboxyl-terminal fragment of GRP. To obtain nondenatured GRP for functional studies, GRP was purified from fifth instar larval plasma by a series of chromatographic steps that did not involve binding to curdlan. The purification procedure consisted of ammonium sulfate fractionation, followed by column chromatographic separations using Q-Sepharose, ConA, and hydroxyapatite (Fig.2). The 20–35% ammonium sulfate fraction contained about 50% of the total GRP in plasma. This step removed most of the storage proteins, which are present at high concentration in the plasma. GRP bound to Q-Sepharose at pH 7.6 in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris and 20 mm NaCl. When the column was eluted with a sodium chloride gradient from 20 to 200 mm at pH 7.6, GRP eluted at the end of the gradient (Fig. 2 A). No additional GRP was eluted when the column was washed with 1 m sodium chloride. Fractions from the Q-Sepharose column containing GRP were combined and applied to a ConA column. GRP did not bind to the ConA column and was present in the flow-through fractions. However, other glycoproteins that did bind to ConA were separated from GRP in this step. Pooled fractions from the ConA column were applied to a hydroxyapatite column pre-equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. GRP eluted near the end of a sodium phosphate gradient from 10 to 100 mm. When the fractions containing GRP were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, GRP appeared as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Analysis by MALDI mass spectrometry gave a mass of 53,583 Da for GRP. Approximately 0.3 mg of pure GRP was obtained from 100 ml of plasma. When this purified GRP was analyzed by gel filtration HPLC, it eluted as a single peak, with an"

The effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on the serine/threonine kinase activity of PKCδ, however, have been conflicting. Moreover, little information is available regarding the tyrosine kinases that directly phosphorylate PKCδ in cells. Recent work has demonstrated that the c-Abl tyrosine kinase phosphorylates and activates PKCδ in the response of cells to DNA damage (20.Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we show that treatment of cells with H2O2 induces binding of PKCδ and c-Abl. The results also show that PKCδ contributes to the activation of c-Abl in the oxidative stress response. COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Vectors expressing full-length FLAG-PKCδ and FLAG-PKCδRD (amino acids 1–330) were generated by subcloning polymerase chain reaction-generated PKCδ fragments into the FLAG tag pcDNA3 vector. FLAG-PKCδ(K378R; designated K-R) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The FLAG-PKCδRD vector was stably introduced into cells by SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) and selection in 800 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc). Transient cotransfections of FLAG-PKCδ or FLAG-PKCδ(K-R) with empty pSR, pSR/c-Abl, or pSR/c-Abl(K-R) vector (21.Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Goga A. Havilik M. Witte O. Cell. 1994; 77: 121-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) were performed by the calcium-phosphate method. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Soluble proteins were incubated with anti-c-Abl antibody (sc-23; Santa Cruz), anti-PKCδ antibody (sc-937; Santa Cruz), or anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (Sigma) for 1 h and precipitated with protein G- or A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz) for an additional 1 h. The immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose paper. The filters were incubated with anti-c-Abl, anti-PKCδ, anti-FLAG, anti-Tyr(P) (4G10; Upstate Biotechology Inc.) or anti-PCNA (sc-56; Santa Cruz). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). For c-Abl kinase assays, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl as described (22.Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The protein complexes were washed and incubated in kinase buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2) containing 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and GST-Crk-(120–225) for 20 min at 30 °C. PKCδ activity was assayed by incubating anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates in PKC kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 200 μg/ml histone H1 (17.Konishi H.

The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Kinase-active c-Abl prepared from baculovirus-infected insect cells (23.Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) was incubated with heat-inactivated purified PKCδ (Calbiochem) and [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer for 20 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. The PKCδ fragment encoding amino acids 473–537 was generated by polymerase chain reaction and ligated into the GST pGEX4T3 vector. The Tyr512 and Tyr523 sites were mutated to Phe by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The wild-type and mutant GST-PKCδ-(473–537) fusion proteins were incubated with kinase-active c-Abl and [γ-32P]ATP. The products were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Kinase-active PKCδ was incubated with kinase-active c-Abl, histone H1, and [γ-32P]ATP in PKC kinase buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Kinase-active PKCδ was incubated with heat-inactivated c-Abl and [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Kinase-active c-Abl was incubated with kinase-active PKCδ, GST-Crk-(120–225), and [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Previous work has demonstrated that c-Abl interacts with PKCδ in the cellular response to genotoxic stress (20.Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To assess whether the oxidative stress response involves an interaction between c-Abl and PKCδ, we cotransfected COS7 cells with FLAG-tagged PKCδ and c-Abl. Analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl demonstrated little association of PKCδ and c-Abl in control cells (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, treatment with H2O2 resulted in the coprecipitation of FLAG-PKCδ and c-Abl (Fig. 1 A). To confirm these findings, anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates from the transfected cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PKCδ. The results demonstrate that H2O2 treatment induces the binding of PKCδ and c-Abl (Fig. 1 B). Similar studies were performed on nontransfected cells to assess the interaction between endogenous PKCδ and c-Abl. Analysis of anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl demonstrated binding of PKCδ and c-Abl in H2O2-treated, but not untreated, cells (Fig. 1 C). Further support for H2O2-induced binding of PKCδ and c-Abl was obtained by immunoblot analysis of anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates with anti-PKCδ (Fig. 1 D). These results demonstrate that H2O2 induces the association of PKCδ and c-Abl. To determine whether the kinase functions of PKCδ or c-Abl are involved in H2O2-induced binding of these proteins, we cotransfected cells with c-Abl and kinase-active FLAG-PKCδ or kinase-inactive FLAG-PKCδ(K-R). The results demonstrate that, although H2O2 treatment is associated with binding of c-Abl to PKCδ, the interaction is substantially decreased with PKCδ(K-R) (Fig.2 A). Likewise, H2O2-induced binding of FLAG-PKCδ to wild-type c-Abl was greater than that found with kinase-inactive c-Abl(K-R) (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that activation of both PKCδ and c-Abl contributes to the association of these proteins in the response to H2O2. To determine whether H2O2 induces c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ, we cotransfected cells with FLAG-PKCδ and empty vector (pSR), wild-type c-Abl, or kinase-inactive c-Abl(K-R). Analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) demonstrated no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in the transfectants not exposed to H2O2(Fig. 2 C). Treatment with H2O2, however, was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ and this effect was increased in cells cotransfected with c-Abl, but not c-Abl(K-R) (Fig. 2 C). These results indicated that PKCδ is phosphorylated by c-Abl in H2O2-treated cells. As the findings support a role for c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation in the regulation of PKCδ, we asked if PKCδ can, in turn, phosphorylate c-Abl. Incubation of purified c-Abl with [γ-32P]ATP and analysis of the products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated c-Abl autophosphorylation (Fig.3 A). By contrast, there was no detectable phosphorylation observed with heat-inactivated c-Abl (Fig.3 A). Incubation of heat-inactivated c-Abl with kinase-active PKCδ was associated with autophosphorylation of PKCδ and phosphorylation of c-Abl (Fig. 3 A). These findings demonstrate that PKCδ phosphorylates c-Abl. As controls and in concert with findings in H2O2-treated cells, PKCδ served as a substrate for c-Abl (Fig. 3 A). Previous studies have demonstrated that H2O2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr512 and Tyr523in the PKCδ catalytic domain (17.Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11223-11237Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Incubation of kinase-active c-Abl with GST-PKCδ-(473–537) and [γ-32P]ATP was associated with PKCδ phosphorylation (data not shown). In addition, mutation of Tyr512, but not Tyr523, to Phe resulted in abrogation of c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation. To extend the analysis, kinase-active c-Abl and kinase-active PKCδ were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The results demonstrate that phosphorylation of both c-Abl and PKCδ was increased compared with that obtained with either alone (Fig. 3 B). As these results demonstrate that PKCδ phosphorylates and potentially activates c-Abl, we assayed c-Abl activity in the presence of PKCδ. Of note, the c-Abl substrate GST-Crk-(120–225) is not phosphorylated by PKCδ and the PKCδ substrate histone H1 is not phosphorylated by c-Abl (Fig. 3 C). Incubation of c-Abl and PKCδ resulted in increased phosphorylation of GST-Crk-(120–225) compared with that found with c-Abl alone (Fig. 3 D). In addition, phosphorylation of histone H1 was increased by incubating PKCδ with c-Abl compared with that obtained with PKCδ alone (Fig.3 D). These findings collectively support an interaction between c-Abl and PKCδ that involves activation of both kinases. To determine whether PKCδ activates c-Abl in vivo, we treated cells with H2O2 and asked if c-Abl is activated by a PKCδ-dependent mechanism. Analysis of anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of histone H1 demonstrated H2O2-induced increases in PKCδ activity (Fig. 4 A). In addition, analysis of anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of GST-Crk-(120–225) demonstrated that the constitutive level of c-Abl activity found in control cells is increased by H2O2 exposure (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether PKCδ contributes to the activation of c-Abl in the response to H2O2, cells were treated with the selective PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin (24.Gschwendt M. Muller H. Keilbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rinke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). While there was no effect of rottlerin on constitutive c-Abl activity, this agent inhibited H2O2-induced c-Abl activation (Fig.4 B). To further assess involvement of PKCδ in c-Abl activation, we prepared a vector to express a FLAG-tagged PKCδ regulatory domain (RD) (amino acids 1–330). Immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG demonstrated expression of FLAG-PKCδRD in the stably transfected cells and not in those expressing the empty vector (Fig.4 C). Analysis of anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of GST-Crk-(120–225) showed that c-Abl activity is induced to a similar extent by H2O2 in wild-type cells and those expressing the empty vector (Fig.4 D). By contrast, H2O2-induced c-Abl activity was attenuated in cells expressing PKCδRD (Fig.4 D). These results provide evidence for activation of c-Abl by a PKCδ-dependent mechanism in the response to H2O2. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis (25.Johnson T., Yu, Z. Ferrans V. Lowenstein R. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The intracellular signals that are activated by reactive oxygen species, however, are largely unknown. Certain insights have been made available from the finding that H2O2 treatment is associated with phosphorylation of PKCδ on tyrosine (17.Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11223-11237Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The present studies indicate that c-Abl is in part responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in the response to H2O2. In this context, H2O2 induces the binding c-Abl and PKCδ. In addition, H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ is attenuated in cells expressing the kinase-inactive c-Abl(K-R). The findings also demonstrate that c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of PKCδ activates the PKCδ kinase function and that this effect occurs in the absence of lipid cofactors. The phosphorylation of PKCδ on Tyr512 and Tyr523, has been shown to be important for H2O2-induced activation (17.Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11223-11237Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that c-Abl phosphorylates PKCδ on Tyr512, but not Tyr523. Taken together, these findings indicate that PKCδ is phosphorylated by c-Abl and at least one other tyrosine kinase. Previous studies have demonstrated that the c-Abl kinase is activated by DNA-damage (22.Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The present work demonstrates that c-Abl is also activated by H2O2 and that this response is dependent on the PKCδ kinase function. The results support a model in which c-Abl is activated by PKCδ in response to oxidative stress, and in a potential feedback loop, c-Abl phosphorylates and thereby further activates PKCδ. PKCδ, like c-Abl, has been linked to the induction of apoptosis in the response of cells to genotoxic stress (9.Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W.

A. 1997; 94: 1437-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that PKCδ is activated by serum stimulation and that phosphorylation of the PKCδ activation loop is mediated by PDK1 (28.Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Thus, PKCδ may be functional in both pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways. In this context, PKCδ could represent a switch that determines cell fate, such that PKCδ confers anti-apoptotic signals following PDK1-mediated phosphorylation and pro-apoptotic signals as a consequence of c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation."

The role of individual PKC isozymes as mediators of this effect has not been thoroughly examined to date. To study the involvement of the novel isozyme PKCδ, we used a replication-deficient adenovirus (PKCδAdV), which allowed for a tightly controlled expression of PKCδ in LNCaP cells. A significant reduction in cell number was observed after infection of LNCaP cells with PKCδAdV. Overexpression of PKCδ markedly enhanced the apoptotic effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in LNCaP cells. PKCδ-mediated apoptosis was substantially reduced by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD and by Bcl-2 overexpression. Importantly, and contrary to other cell types, PKCδ-mediated apoptosis does not involve its proteolytic cleavage by caspase-3, suggesting that allosteric activation of PKCδ is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in LNCaP cells. In addition, phorbol ester-induced apoptosis was blocked by a kinase-deficient mutant of PKCδ, supporting the concept that PKCδ plays an important role in the regulation of apoptotic cell death in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.

The multiplicity of effects of phorbol esters on biological systems is associated with the existence of various phorbol ester receptors, which include several PKC1 isozymes and novel non-kinase receptors (α- and β-chimaerins, unc-13, and Ras-GRP). The PKC family comprises at least 10 serine-threonine-kinases subject to different biochemical regulation (5.Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 6.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). PKC isozymes can be classified into three groups: calcium-dependent or “classical” (PKCs α, β1, β2, and γ), calcium-independent or “novel” (PKCs δ, ε, η, and θ), and “atypical” (PKCs ζ and λ/ι). Only the classical and novel PKC isozymes are receptors for phorbol esters and the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol. The existence of several PKC isozymes with unique cofactor requirements, intracellular localization, and cellular/tissue distribution suggests specialized roles for each isozyme in the control of cellular functions. An issue of relevance is that individual PKC isozymes may exhibit either similar or opposite biological effects. In NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, for example, PKCδ and PKCε promote opposite effects on proliferation: whereas PKCε induces cell proliferation and malignant transformation, PKCδ inhibits cell growth (7.Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second level of complexity involves the host cell: overexpression of PKCδ induces cell growth arrest in G2/M in Chinese hamster ovary cells and HL60 cells (8.Watanabe T. Ono Y. Taniyama Y.

Interestingly, and of particular relevance to the present study, PKCδ induces apoptosis after DNA damage in hemopoietic cells and keratinocytes, a process that involves its proteolytic cleavage and generation of an active catalytic fragment (12.Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 13.Denning M.F.

The aim of this study was to explore the role of PKCδ as a mediator of phorbol ester-mediated responses in LNCaP cells, a widely used model of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (14.Horoszewicz J.S.

Phorbol ester-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells may involve the lipid second messenger ceramide (20.Garzotto M. White-Jones M. Jiang Y. Ehleiter D. Liao W.-C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar). Powell et al. (16.Powell C.T. Brittis N.J. Stec D. Hug H. Heston W.D.W. Fair W.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar) reported a persistent translocation of PKCα in phorbol ester-induced apoptosis. The contribution of other PKC isozymes present in LNCaP cells as mediators of phorbol ester-mediated apoptosis, however, has not been examined to date. To evaluate the involvement of PKCδ in phorbol ester-induced apoptosis, we used a replication-deficient adenovirus for this novel PKC isozyme (PKCδAdV). The evidence presented in this study implicates PKCδ as a mediator of phorbol ester-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. Interestingly, and contrary to observations in other cell types, PKCδ-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP cells does not involve its proteolytic activation by caspase-3, suggesting that allosteric activation of the enzyme is sufficient to trigger an apoptotic response in these cells. The human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and U-937 human promonocytic leukemia cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). LNCaP and U-937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. LNCaP cells stably overexpressing Bcl-2 and the corresponding vector-transfected cells (21.Raffo A.J. Perlman H. Chen M.-W. Day M.L. Streitman J.S. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4438-4445PubMed Google Scholar) were a kind gift of Dr. L. Lothstein (University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN). AXhoI-MluI fragment comprising the full-length PKCδ cDNA (7.Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into pCA4-FLAG, a modified version of the vector pCA4 (Microbix Biosystems Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). pCA4-FLAG includes XhoI-MluI sites for subcloning, followed by a C-terminal FLAG tag and a stop codon in frame (22.Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A replication-deficient adenovirus for PKCδ (PKCδAdV) was generated by standard techniques using 293 packaging cells (22.Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell.

Recombinant adenoviruses were isolated from single plaques and amplified in 293 cells. Titers of viral stocks were normally higher than 1 × 10 9 pfu/cell. The absence of wild type adenovirus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using primers for the E1 region. An adenovirus for the LacZ gene was used as a control (22.Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K.

Generation of a dominant negative PKCδ adenovirus (DN-PKCδAdV) is described elsewhere (25.Ohba M. Ishino K. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S. Chida K. Huh N.-H. Kuroki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5199-5207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent LNCaP cells in six-well plates were infected with PKCδAdV for 14 h at different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) (1–300 pfu/cell) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. After removal of the virus, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In several experiments, PMA at different concentrations (0.3–100 nm) or vehicle (ethanol) was added for 1 h following the adenoviral infection, and cells were then grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for different times. For determination of cell number, cells were harvested by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution) and counted in a hemocytometer. PKC activity in total cellular lysates was determined by phosphorylation of the α-pseudosubstrate peptide, as described previously by Kazanietz et al. (26.Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in six-well plates were lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 100 nmPMA, 10 mm α-pseudosubstrate peptide, 25 mmATP, and 7.5 mm magnesium acetate. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, 25 μl of each reaction was spotted onto Whatman PE-81 paper. The paper was washed three times with 0.1 mphosphoric acid and once with acetone and air-dried, and radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. [3H]PDBu binding in cellular lysates was measured using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay (27.Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (26.Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol.

The assay was performed in a total volume of 250 μl, using 100 μg/ml phosphatydylserine, 1 mm EGTA, 15 nm[3H]PDBu, and 50 μl of cell lysate. Cells were harvested into lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.00125% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol and then lysed by sonication. Equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with one of the following antibodies: anti-PKCα (1:3000, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-PKCβ (1:1000, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-PKCδ (1:1000, Transduction Laboratories), anti-PKCε (1:1000, Life Technologies Inc.), anti-PKCζ (1:3000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz. CA), anti-PKCμ (1:1000, Transduction Laboratories), anti-FLAG (1:500, Sigma), anti-Bcl-2 (1:1000, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), or anti-caspase-3 (1:1000, Transduction Laboratories). Membranes were washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:3000, Bio-Rad). Bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). LNCaP cells were harvested into a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF), 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin and lysed by sonication. Separation of soluble and particular fractions was performed by ultracentrifugation as described previously (28.Caloca M.J. Fernandez N. Lewin N.E. Ching D. Modali R. Blumberg P.M. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26488-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cytosolic (soluble) fraction was obtained by collection of the supernatant after centrifugation of the total lysate (1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C). The remaining pellet represents the particulate fraction. Protein concentration of the total lysate and fractions was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein for each fraction (10 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently immunostained with anti-PKC antibodies, as described above. DNA laddering was measured using the Apoptotic DNA Ladder Kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. To assess morphological changes in chromatin structure of LNCaP cells undergoing apoptosis, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). Cells were trypsinized as described above, mounted on glass slides, and fixed in 70% ethanol. Cells were then stained for 20 min with 1 mg/ml DAPI and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis was characterized by chromatin condensation and fragmentation. The incidence of apoptosis in each preparation was analyzed by counting 500 cells and determining the percentage of apoptotic cells. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with propidium iodide (1 mg/ml). Cell cycle progression and apoptosis was analyzed in an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). For each treatment 7500 events were recorded. Caspase-3 activity was measured with the colorimetric assay kit from BioVision (Palo Alto, CA) that uses as a substrate the chromophorep-nitroanilide-DEVD. A recombinant adenovirus for PKCδ, PKCδAdV, was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The recombinant PKCδ was engineered to have a FLAG epitope-tag in frame at the C-terminal end. Infection of LNCaP cells with PKCδAdV at different MOIs resulted in a concentration-dependent expression of PKCδ, as determined by Western blotting with either anti-FLAG (Fig. 1 A, top panel) or anti-PKCδ antibodies (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). Immunofluorescence using the anti-FLAG antibody reveals an efficiency of infection higher than 90% at a MOI of 10 pfu/cell (data not shown). Expression of FLAG-tagged PKCδ was detected 6 h after infection. Maximum levels of expression were obtained after 24 h and lasted for at least 7 days (data not shown). Infection of LNCaP cells with PKCδAdV (MOI = 1–100 pfu/cell) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in PKC activity in cell extracts (Fig. 1 B), as determined by phosphorylation of α-peptide, a specific PKC substrate. The minimum MOI necessary to achieve a significant increase in total PKC activity in these cells was 10 pfu/cell. No significant changes in PKC activity were observed when LNCaP cells were infected with a LacZAdV (MOI = 100 pfu/cell). Next, we measured whether infection of LNCaP cells with PKCδAdV increases the level of phorbol ester binding, using [3H]PDBu as a radioligand. Elevated levels of phorbol ester binding were observed in cells infected with PKCδAdV but not in those infected with LacZAdV (Fig. 1 C). LNCaP cells infected with LacZAdV did not show any changes in endogenous PKCδ immunoreactivity but did show high levels of LacZ expression as detected with X-Gal staining (data not shown). For most of the experiments presented here, we have used MOIs in the range of 10–30 pfu/cell to avoid any potential nonspecific effects that might occur when PKCδ is overexpressed at high levels. At MOI = 10–30 pfu/cell, total cellular [3H]PDBu binding activity was elevated 3–8-fold over basal levels, respectively (see Fig. 1 C). It is well established that phorbol esters induce the redistribution of PKC isozymes from cytosolic to particulate fractions, a process known as PKC translocation. To confirm that the FLAG-tagged PKCδ was responsive to phorbol esters, we infected LNCaP cells with PKCδAdV (MOI = 10 pfu/cell) and subsequently incubated the cells with PMA for different times. As shown in Fig. 2, PMA induces translocation of FLAG-tagged PKCδ from the cytosolyc (soluble) to the particulate fraction. 4α-PMA, the inactive isomer of PMA, was completely inefficient at inducing translocation. Translocation of FLAG-tagged PKCδ followed a similar pattern to that observed for the endogenous phorbol ester-responsive isozymes PKCα and PKCε. As expected, the phorbol ester-unresponsive PKCζ is not translocated by PMA in LNCaP cells. From these data, we conclude that infection of LNCaP prostate cancer cells with PKCδAdV results in an efficient expression of a catalytically active, phorbol ester-responsive PKCδ. Incubation of LNCaP cells with PMA (0.3–100 nm, 1 h) results in a concentration-dependent decrease in cell number compared with control (vehicle-treated) cells, as judged by cell counting at 24, 48, and 72 h after PMA treatment. The corresponding inactive isomer, 4α-PMA (100 nm), was completely ineffective (Fig.3 A). We then infected LNCaP cells with PKCδAdV at MOIs ranging from 0.3 to 100 pfu/cell and determined the cell number every 24 h for a total period of 72 h. A concentration-dependent reduction in cell number was observed after infection with PKCδAdV but not with LacZAdV (MOI = 100 pfu/cell) (Fig. 3 B). The inhibitory effect of PMA was markedly enhanced in cells infected with PKCδAdV, suggesting that activation of PKCδ results in a decrease in cell count (Fig. 3 C). Morphological examination of LNCaP cells infected with PKCδAdV after PMA treatment revealed a large number of cells with characteristics distinctive of apoptosis, including cellular shrinkage and nuclear fragmentation. No signs of apoptosis were observed in either PKCδAdV- or LacZAdV-infected cells in the absence of PMA treatment (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of LNCaP cells with PMA induces a pattern of DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis, which can be visualized as a DNA ladder. DNA fragmentation was significantly higher in cells infected with PKCδAdV (MOI = 30 pfu/cell) after PMA treatment (Fig. 4 B). PMA treatment of PKCδAdV-infected cells also results in a large number of TUNEL-positive cells (data not shown). Flow cytometry analysis of PKCδAdV-infected cells after PMA treatment revealed a large number of cells with sub-G0/G1 DNA content, consistent with the presence of apoptotic cells. The PMA effect was lower in LNCaP cells infected with LacZAdV compared with PKCδAdV-infected cells (Fig. 4 C) or noninfected cells (data not shown). A dose-response analysis for the apoptotic effect of PMA is shown in Fig.5. Cells were infected with either PKCδAdV or LacZAdV (MOI = 30 pfu/cell) and treated with increasing concentrations of PMA (0.1–10 nm, 1 h). The results shown in Fig. 5 revealed a markedly higher apoptotic effect of PMA in LNCaP cells infected with PKCδAdV than in noninfected cells or cells infected with LacZAdV. These findings collectively suggest that activation of PKCδ induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells.Figure 5Concentration dependence analysis of PMA-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. Cells were infected with PKCδAdV or LacZAdV for 14 h (MOI = 30 pfu/cell), and 24 h later, PMA was added for 1 h at different concentrations. Cells were collected 48 h later and stained with DAPI. The incidence of apoptosis in each preparation was analyzed by counting 500 cells and determining the percentage of apoptotic cells. Results are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LNCaP cells express the classical PKCα, the novel PKCδ and PKCε, the atypical PKCζ and PKCλ, and PKCμ (Fig.6). Low levels of PKCη were also observed (data not shown). PKCβ, PKCγ, and PKCθ were not detected in LNCaP cells. These results agree with those previously reported by Powell et al. (16.Powell C.T. Brittis N.J. Stec D. Hug H. Heston W.D.W. Fair W.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar). Infection of LNCaP cells with PKCδAdV did not result in any significant change in the levels of PKCα, PKCε, PKCζ, PKCλ, or PKCμ. Only a reduction in the levels of PKCε was observed after PMA treatment, both in LacZAdV and PKCδAdV-infected cells. Pretreatment of LNCaP cells with the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I, 5 μm) completely blocked PMA-induced apoptosis in both noninfected and PKCδAdV-infected cells. We also used an unrelated antagonist of PKC, bryostatin I. Bryostatin I is an atypical inhibitor of PKC function: although it activates PKC isozymes in vitro and promotes few PKC-dependent effects, it fails to activate PKC-mediated responses in most cases. In those instances in which bryostatin 1 is unable to activate PKC, it blocks those responses mediated by PMA (1.Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar,29.Kazanietz M.G. Lewin N.E. Gao F. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 374-379PubMed Google Scholar). In LNCaP cells, bryostatin 1 (10 nm) was ineffective in inducing apoptosis. However, bryostatin 1 inhibited PMA-induced apoptosis in both noninfected and in PKCδAdV-infected cells (Fig.7 A). It is well established that caspases, a family of Asp-directed cysteine-proteases, play a pivotal role in transducing the apoptotic signal. Caspases can be specifically inhibited in cells by cell-permeable peptides (30.Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Treatment of LNCaP cells with the pan-caspase inhibitory peptide z-VAD markedly reduced PMA-induced apoptosis in PKCδAdV-infected cells (Fig. 7 B). Bcl-2 plays a central role in cell death signaling by forming heterodimers with pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad and inhibiting their function (31.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). In LNCaP cells, the apoptotic effect mediated by activation of PKCδ did not result in any noticeable changes in Bcl-2 levels (Fig. 7 C). The relationship between PKCδ-mediated apoptosis and Bcl-2 was further explored in LNCaP cells stably transfected with a Bcl-2 mammalian expression vector (LNCaP-Bcl-2), which express higher levels of Bcl-2 compared with control (vector-transfected) cells (21.Raffo A.J. Perlman H. Chen M.-W. Day M.L. Streitman J.S. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4438-4445PubMed Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing Bcl-2 showed a marked resistance to PMA induced apoptosis when infected with PKCδAdV compared with control cells (Fig. 7 D). To rule out the possibility that this effect is a consequence of differential sensitivity to PKCδAdV-infection, we determined PKC activity in control and Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. Similar levels in PKC activity were observed in both cases after infection with PKCδAdV infection (14.6 ± 0.2-fold versus 14.1 ± 0.3-fold increase over basal in cellular PKC activity after infection with PKCδAdV at 100 pfu/cell), suggesting a similar sensitivity to adenoviral infection in both cell lines. An emerging model postulates that activation of caspases leads to the proteolytic cleavage of kinases, which are either activated or inactivated during the apoptotic process. Recent studies have shown that PKCδ is proteolytically activated at the onset of apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents in hemopoietic cells and keratinocytes (12.Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G.

Wrone-Smith T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29995-30002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of PKCδ by caspase-3 at the V3 (hinge) domain of the enzyme releases a catalytically active fragment of approximately 40 kDa. In order to evaluate whether such cleavage occurs in LNCaP cells, cells were infected with PKCδAdV and then treated with PMA or vehicle. The presence of a catalytic fragment was evaluated by Western blot using either an anti-FLAG or an anti-PKCδ antibody in samples collected at different times, ranging from 15 min to 24 h. Either of these antibodies recognizes the C-terminal kinase domain of FLAG-tagged PKCδ. Interestingly, we could not detect the presence of PKCδ catalytic fragment either at short times or after several hours of PMA treatment (Fig.8 A). Very low levels of cleavage were detected 24 h after PMA treatment. Fig.8 B revealed, however, a significant apoptotic response after 6 and 12 h of PMA treatment that reached a maximum at 24 h. Thus, PKCδ-mediated apoptosis after PMA treatment does not correlate with the generation of a catalytically active fragment of the enzyme. These results prompted us to evaluate whether caspase-3 is activated during PMA-induced apoptosis in PKCδAdV-infected cells. Fig.8 C shows that no significant changes in caspase-3 activity were detected after PMA treatment. Likewise, we did not detect any cleavage of caspase-3 under similar experimental conditions (Fig.8 D). The unexpected lack of involvement of caspase-3 was confirmed by the inefficacy of a specific caspase-3 inhibitor, DEVD, to block PMA-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells infected with PKCδAdV (Table I). U-937 cells treated with the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin (4 μm) were used as positive controls for these experiments. In this case, a marked increase in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 8 C) and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 8 D) was observed, and DEVD markedly inhibited apoptosis (Table I).Table IEffect of the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVDCellApoptotic cellsLNCaPU-937%No inhibitor30.0 ± 1.8 (100)70.1 ± 4.5 (100)+DEVD28.9 ± 0.5 (96)26.3 ± 7.4 (38)+z-VAD4.5 ± 0.3 (15)NDApoptosis in LNCaP cells was induced by infection with PKCδAdV (MOI = 30 pfu/cell, 14 h) and subsequent treatment with PMA (100 nm, 1 h).

Although the normal physiological function of PrPC has remained enigmatic, the recent observation that the protein binds copper ions with micromolar affinity suggests a possible role in brain copper metabolism. In this study, we have used mice that express 0, 1, and 10 times the normal level of PrP to assess the effect of PrP expression level on the amount of brain copper and on the properties of two brain cuproenzymes. Using mass spectrometry, we find that the amount of ionic copper in subcellular fractions from brain is similar in all three lines of mice. In addition, the enzymatic activities of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase and cytochrome coxidase in brain extracts are similar in these groups of animals, as is the incorporation of 64Cu into Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase both in cultured cerebellar neurons and in vivo. Our results differ from those of another set of published studies, and they require a re-evaluation of the role of PrPC in copper metabolism.

A. (1999) Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 429–444Google Scholar). PrPSc, the primary component of prion particles, is rich in β-sheets and is protease-resistant and infectious. PrPC is a normal cellular glycoprotein that has minimal β-sheet structure and is protease-sensitive. Prion diseases arise from the posttranslational conversion of PrPC into PrPSc within the central nervous system. Although a great deal is known about the role of PrPSc in the disease process, the normal physiological function of PrPC has remained elusive. Several key observations have recently suggested a possible role for PrPC in copper metabolism. First, it has been found that purified recombinant PrP, as well as synthetic PrP peptides, bind copper ions with low micromolar affinity via a series of four histidine-containing peptide repeats that reside in the N-terminal half of the protein (3.Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 4.Stöckel J. Safar J. Wallace A.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B.

Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Binding is specific for copper over other transition metals and is pH-dependent, with affinity falling sharply below pH 6 (4.Stöckel J. Safar J. Wallace A.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 7.Miura T. Hori-i A. Mototani H. Takeuchi H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11560-11569Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Interestingly, copper binding causes conformational changes in the octapeptide repeats, raising the possibility that the metal may trigger some functional alteration in PrPC (3.Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8.Miura T. Hori-i A. Takeuchi H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A second major observation is the report by one group that there is a 10–15-fold reduction in the content of copper, but not of several other metals, in brain membranes from PrP-null mice compared with wild-type controls (6.Brown D.R. Qin K.F. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. Vonbohlen A. Schulzschaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This striking result suggests that PrPC could be a major copper-binding protein in brain. Finally, the same group has reported that the enzymatic activity and copper loading of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are 50% of normal in brain and cultured cerebellar neurons from PrP-null mice and that SOD1 activity and copper loading are elevated in mice that overexpress PrP (9.Brown D.R. Schulzschaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 10.Brown D.R. Besinger A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that PrP may play some role in delivery of copper to cuproenzymes such as SOD1. We undertook here to re-examine two of the critical pieces of evidence in favor of a role for PrPC in copper metabolism. Recently, a specific chaperone required for copper delivery to mammalian SOD1 has been identified and characterized (11.Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

We also carried out measurements using mass spectrometry of ionic copper in the brains of mice that express different amounts of PrP. Prn-p 0/0 mice (13.Büeler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Fluethmann H.

Wild-type mice were either C57BL/6J × 129 or CD-1 Swiss; results were identical with both strains.

Cultures were prepared from the cerebella of mice at postnatal day 7 as described (15.Miller T.M. Moulder K.L. Knudson C.M. Creedon D.J. Deshmukh M. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and were used 6–7 days after plating. Virtually all of the neurons in these cultures are granule cells, and non-neuronal contamination was 1–2%. All glassware and plasticware was soaked overnight in 10% nitric acid and then rinsed extensively in deionized water (≥18 megaohms) to minimize metal ion contamination. Brains were homogenized in 10 volumes of deionized water using a Teflon-glass homogenizer and were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to produce a P1 pellet. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to produce a P2 pellet. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to produce a P3 pellet and an S3 supernatant. A portion of the P2 pellet was washed by homogenization in deionized water followed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 20 min to produce a P2* pellet. This subcellular fractionation scheme is similar to ones used for separation of synaptosomes and organelles from brain (16.De Robertis E. Pellegrino de Iraldi A. Rodriguez de Lorez Arnaiz G. Salganicoff L. J. Neurochem. 1962; 9: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), with the exception that water rather than isotonic sucrose was used as the homogenization solution because we were concerned that concentrated sucrose could interfere with mass spectrometry analysis. This modification results in osmotic lysis of some membrane-bound structures, but synaptic membranes, where PrPC is concentrated (17.Herms J. Tings T. Gall S. Madlung A. Giese A. Siebert H. Schurmann P. Windl O. Brose N. Kretzschmar H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8866-8875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are still present in the P2 fraction. Brain fractions were subjected to hydrolysis in nitric acid (either 1% for 1 h at 25 °C or 70% for 1 h in a CEM 2100 microwave oven) and were then analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in a Finnigan MAT ELEMENT system. Some samples were analyzed in an instrument in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University and some in an instrument in the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University. Both instruments gave similar results, so the data were pooled in Table I. Copper, zinc, and iron concentrations were calculated from calibration curves, and values for a water blank were subtracted. Lysates were prepared from primary cerebellar cultures in a lysis buffer consisting of 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm EDTA, supplemented with 1 μm pepstatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 50 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted as described (18.Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A polyclonal anti-SOD1 antisera (12.Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D.

The secondary antibody was detected using the Hybond ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To assay activity in gels, samples prepared in lysis buffer (100 μg of protein) were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in the absence of SDS and reducing agent. The gel was stained as described (19.Flohe L. Otting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 275 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, 65 μg/ml riboflavin, and 3.2 μl/ml TEMED. After incubation for 30 min, the gel was developed by exposure to light. Staining representing SOD activity was absent at sites of O2 scavenging. For the xanthine-based spectrophotometric assay, samples prepared in lysis buffer were spun at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were subjected to freeze-thaw and were then spun again at 14,000 × g for 10 min. SOD activity in the supernatants was analyzed as described (20.Crapo J.D. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The amount of MnSOD activity was determined by addition of 10 μm potassium cyanide to inhibit SOD1. SOD3 activity was determined by analysis of total SOD activity in SOD1 knock-out mice and subtracting out the amount of MnSOD. The amount of MnSOD and SOD3 activity was subtracted from the total SOD activity value to obtain SOD1 activity, which was expressed in units/mg protein. SOD1 activity was also measured by following inhibition of pyrogallol autooxidation at 320 nm as described previously (21.Prohaska J.R. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Primary cerebellar cultures were labeled with 100 μCi of 64Cu per ml of medium for 16 h as described previously (22.Klomp L.W. Lin S.J. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and 65 μg of total protein was separated on a 10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. COX activity was measured by following loss of ferrocytochrome c at 550 nm as described (21.Prohaska J.R. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We first measured the total amount of ionic copper in brain fractions derived from mice with three different expression levels of PrP. We analyzed wild-type mice,Prn-p 0/0 mice in which the endogenous PrP gene has been ablated and which do not produce any PrP protein (13.Büeler H. Fischer M. Lang Y. Fluethmann H. Lipp H.-P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Nature. 1992; 356: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar), and Tga20 mice which carry a wild-type PrP transgene and express ∼10 times the normal level of PrP (14.Fischer M. Rülicke T. Raeber A. Sailer A. Moser M. Oesch B. Brandner S. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Brain tissue was fractionated by differential centrifugation to yield a series of membrane fractions (P1, P2, P3) and a soluble fraction (S3). Synaptic membranes in which PrPCis enriched (17.Herms J. Tings T. Gall S. Madlung A. Giese A. Siebert H. Schurmann P. Windl O. Brose N. Kretzschmar H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8866-8875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are present in the P2 fraction. To investigate the possibility that copper might be loosely bound to synaptic membranes, we subjected a portion of the P2 fraction to a single wash and recentrifugation (P2*). Metal ion content was determined by ICP-MS, a technique that has high sensitivity (100 pg/g) and selectivity (ability to distinguish ions with similar charge-to-mass ratios). No significant differences among mice of the three genotypes were found in the content of copper (Table I), zinc, or iron (not shown) in any of the brain fractions. The absolute values for total brain copper given in Table I are close to those reported by other investigators (23.Linder M.C. Goode C.A. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained by atomic absorption spectroscopy (not shown). We noted that washing the P2 membrane fraction caused a consistent but variable reduction in the copper content (see P2* entries in Table I), suggesting that a significant amount of the metal is weakly bound. Measurements of SOD1 activity in brain extracts from Prn-p 0/0 , wild-type, and Tga20 mice using two different spectrophotometric assays did not reveal any significant differences among the three groups of animals (Fig. 1). We also prepared primary cultures of cerebellar neurons fromPrn-p 0/0 , wild-type, and Tga20 mice. Western blot analysis revealed no differences in the amount of SOD1 protein in cultures from the three groups of animals (Fig.2 A), indicating that PrP does not affect the steady state level of this enzyme. When SOD1 activity was examined in the same samples by a non-denaturing gel assay using nitro blue tetrazolium, no differences were observed (Fig.2 B). The identity of the single band of activity in Fig.2 B was confirmed by its absence in extracts from SOD1-deficient mice (data not shown). We also failed to detect differences in SOD1 activity among cultures from the three lines of mice using the xanthine-based spectrophotometric assay (data not shown). To directly measure copper incorporation into SOD1, we metabolically labeled primary cerebellar cultures with 64Cu. When cell lysates were analyzed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, a single64Cu-labeled band, previously identified as dimeric SOD1 (11.Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), was observed (Fig. 2 C). There was no difference in the intensity of this band from mice of the three genotypes. To confirm our results on copper incorporation in vivo, we analyzed incorporation of radioactivity into SOD1 from the brains of animals given intrathecal injections of 500 μCi of 64Cu. As with the cell culture experiments, no differences in copper incorporation were seen among wild-type, Prn-p 0/0 , and Tga20 mice (data not shown). To examine a possible effect of PrP expression on a second cuproenzyme, we assayed the activity of COX, a ubiquitous mitochondrial enzyme. Prn-p 0/0 , wild-type, and Tga20 mice had brain COX activities of 0.650 ± 0.43, 0.612 ± 0.059, and 0.646 ± 0.022 μmol/min/mg protein, respectively (mean ± S.D., n = 4). Thus, as for SOD1, there was no difference in COX activity between mice with differing expression levels of PrP. We report here that the amount of copper in subcellular fractions of brain is not significantly different among mice that express 0, 1, and 10 times the normal level of PrP. We also failed to observe any effect of PrP expression level on the enzymatic activity and copper loading of SOD1 from brain or on the activity of a second cuproenzyme from brain, COX. Several of these findings differ markedly from those reported by Kretzschmar and colleagues. These investigators reported a 10–15-fold reduction of copper in crude membranes, synaptosomes, and endosomes from the same strain of Prn-p 0/0 mice as we utilized here (6.Brown D.R. Qin K.F. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. Vonbohlen A. Schulzschaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although in a subsequent publication a more modest 2-fold decrease was observed in synaptosomes (17.Herms J. Tings T. Gall S. Madlung A. Giese A. Siebert H. Schurmann P. Windl O. Brose N. Kretzschmar H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8866-8875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This group also reported that SOD1 activity in brain extracts and incorporation of64Cu into SOD1 from cultured cerebellar neurons was ∼50% of normal in Prn-p 0/0 mice (9.Brown D.R. Schulzschaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 10.Brown D.R. Besinger A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, SOD1 activity was found to be modestly elevated (∼20%) in Tga35 mice, which have a PrP expression level similar to that of Tga20 mice, and64Cu incorporation into SOD1 was increased by 250% (10.Brown D.R. Besinger A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).64Cu incorporation in these experiments was assessed by counting the amount of radioactivity immunoprecipitated by an anti-SOD1 antibody, so that the M r of the protein(s) to which the radioactivity was bound could not be confirmed, as in our experiments. It is not clear what other explanations might account for the discrepancies between our results and those of Kretzschmar and colleagues. The results reported here require a re-evaluation of the role of PrPC in brain copper metabolism. First, our ICP-MS copper measurements indicate that PrPC is unlikely to be a major copper-binding protein in brain membranes. This conclusion is also supported by calculations which demonstrate that the total amount of PrPC in brain (∼3 nmol/g (24.Safar J. Wille H. Itrri V. Groth D. Serban H. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar)) is insufficient to account for binding of more than a fraction of the total amount of copper found in membrane fractions (∼3 μg/g or 50 nmol/g, Table I). Given the relatively weak affinity of PrPC for copper (5–15 μm), it is possible that some copper bound to PrPC was released during the process of subcellular fractionation. In this case, however, the released metal would have been detected in other fractions which we analyzed. Our results also suggest that PrPC is not the primary carrier responsible for entry of copper into the brain via the blood-brain or blood-CSF barriers or for uptake of the metal into neurons from the extracellular space. If PrPC were an essential component of these global uptake mechanisms, then variations in PrP expression should be directly reflected in the copper content of brain fractions. Our studies also indicate that PrPC does not play a role in the specialized trafficking pathways involved in delivery of copper to SOD1 and COX in brain. In mammalian cells, copper transported across the plasma membrane is delivered to cuproproteins via specific chaperone molecules, which bind copper and transfer it to the target protein by physical association (25.Culotta V.C. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Klomp L.W. Casareno R.L. Gitlin J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 448: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This mechanism is necessary because, due to its extreme toxicity, free copper is kept at negligible concentrations in the cytoplasm (<1 ion per cell) by binding to copper-scavenging proteins such as metallothionein (26.Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Lys7p in yeast and CCS in mammals have been identified as the chaperones that transfer copper to SOD1 (11.Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 12.Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and copper chaperones for other cuproenzymes, including COX (27.Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), have also been described. Conceivably, PrPC could function in copper trafficking pathways upstream of such chaperones. If this is the case, however, the pathways involved are likely to be those that target cuproproteins other than SOD1 and COX. The strongest piece of evidence supporting a role for PrPCin copper biology is the fact (now established by a number of laboratories) that copper binds to PrPC and induces a conformational change in the octapeptide repeat region (3.Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 4.Stöckel J. Safar J. Wallace A.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B.

The results reported here therefore focus attention on other possible hypotheses about the connection between PrPC and copper. One possibility is that copper is an essential cofactor for a previously unidentified enzymatic activity of PrPC. Indeed, a recent report suggests that both bacterially produced and brain-derived PrPC has a copper-dependent superoxide dismutase activity (28.Brown D.R. Wong B.-S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Jones I.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). However, cuproenzymes such as SOD1 have much higher affinities for copper than PrPC(femtomolar versus micromolar), and these enzymes, unlike PrPC, usually require partial denaturation for removal of bound copper (26.Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 29.Lippard S.J. Science. 1999; 284: 748-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, they all contain copper centers characterized by metal bonding to sulfur atoms in methionine or cysteine residues, in addition to nitrogen atoms in histidine residues as for PrPC (30.Pena M.M. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). A much more likely function for PrPC is to serve as a reversible sink or carrier for copper ions. Consistent with this suggestion, the normal concentration of Cu2+ in plasma and CSF (1–10 μm) is similar to the estimatedK d for copper binding to PrPC, and the concentration of the metal in brain tissue is estimated to be even higher (100 μm) (31.Smith R.M. Dreosti I.E. Smith R.M. Neurobiology of the Trace Elements. 1. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1983: 1-40Google Scholar). Most extracellular copper is bound to ceruloplasmin in plasma and CSF, and the remainder is complexed with albumin, peptides, and amino acids (30.Pena M.M. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Because these non-ceruloplasmin species have copper dissociation constants in the low micromolar range (expressed in terms of total copper), they should be able to readily transfer copper to and from PrPC. Further work will be necessary to explore whether PrPC functions as an endocytic receptor for cellular uptake of copper ions, as we have previously speculated (32.Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), or whether it facilitates some other aspect of copper trafficking such as efflux from the cell or intracellular sequestration of the metal. Given the recent recognition that transition metals play a key role in a number of neurodegenerative disorders (33.Sayre L.M. Perry G. Smith M.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 34.Waggoner D.J. Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), the connection between PrP and copper metabolism will continue to be an important subject for future investigations.

TheLCB1/TSC2 and LCB2/TSC1 genes encode homologous proteins of the α-oxoamine synthase family required for serine palmitoyltransferase activity. The other α-oxoamine synthases are soluble homodimers, but serine palmitoyltransferase is a membrane-associated enzyme composed of at least two subunits, Lcb1p and Lcb2p. Here, we report the characterization of a third gene,TSC3, required for optimal 3-ketosphinganine synthesis inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae cells lacking theTSC3 gene have a temperature-sensitive lethal phenotype that is reversed by supplying 3-ketosphinganine, dihydrosphingosine, or phytosphingosine in the growth medium. The tsc3 mutant cells have severely reduced serine palmitoyltransferase activity. TheTSC3 gene encodes a novel 80-amino acid protein with a predominantly hydrophilic amino-terminal half and a hydrophobic carboxyl terminus that is membrane-associated. Tsc3p coimmunoprecipitates with Lcb1p and/or Lcb2p but does not bind as tightly as Lcb1p and Lcb2p bind to each other. Lcb1p and Lcb2p remain tightly associated with each other and localize to the membrane in cells lacking Tsc3p. However, Lcb2p is unstable in cells lacking Lcb1p and vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W2054675070,"The nature of the mechanism underlying store-mediated Ca2+ entry has been investigated in human platelets through a combination of cytoskeletal modifications. Inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D or latrunculin A had a biphasic time-dependent effect on Ca2+entry, showing an initial potentiation followed by inhibition of Ca2+ entry. Moreover, addition of these agents after induction of store-mediated Ca2+ entry inhibited the Ca2+ influx mechanism. Jasplakinolide, which reorganizes actin filaments into a tight cortical layer adjacent to the plasma membrane, prevented activation of store-mediated Ca2+ entry but did not modify this process after its activation. In addition, jasplakinolide prevented cytochalasin D-induced inhibition of store-mediated Ca2+ entry. Calyculin A, an inhibitor of protein serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2 which activates translocation of existing F-actin to the cell periphery without inducing actin polymerization, also prevented activation of store-mediated Ca2+ entry. Finally, inhibition of vesicular transport with brefeldin A inhibited activation of store-mediated Ca2+ entry but did not alter this mechanism once initiated. These data suggest that store-mediated Ca2+ entry in platelets may be mediated by a reversible trafficking and coupling of the endoplasmic reticulum with the plasma membrane, which shows close parallels to the events mediating secretion.

Reast R. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the filling state of stores is communicated to the PM remains unclear. Hypotheses have considered both indirect and direct coupling mechanisms. Indirect coupling assumes the existence of a diffusible messenger generated by the storage organelles such as cyclic GMP (2.Pandol S.J. Schoeffield-Payne M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12846-12853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cytochrome P-450 metabolites (3.Alvarez J. Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), tyrosine kinases (4.Vostal J.G. Jackson W.L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18151-18156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or release of a calcium influx factor from depleted stores (6.Radriamanpita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar); however, no messenger molecule has been identified. Alternatively, direct coupling (conformational coupling) proposes a physical interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the PM and considers that some calcium sensitivity may reside on the InsP3 receptor, which is thought to be responsible for transmitting information from the ER to the PM (7.Berridge B.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, some studies indicate that Ca2+ entry is closely localized to sites where InsP3 evokes emptying of the Ca2+ stores and that Ca2+ entry is unlikely to be activated by a diffusible molecule (8.Petersen C.C. Berridge M.J. Pflügers Arch. 1996; 432: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9.Pareck A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 10.Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A different model suggests that Ca2+channels or membrane- bound activator molecules are exocytotically incorporated into the PM upon store depletion (10.Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is compatible with the conformational coupling model only if it is assumed that the link between the ER and the PM is mechanically weak before store depletion and strong afterward. Recently, a secretion-like coupling model has been proposed by Patterson et al. (11.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This mechanism involves a physical but reversible interaction between the ER and the PM based on a physical trafficking of the ER toward the PM. In support of this hypothesis, small GTP-binding proteins, which modulate actin reorganization and vesicular trafficking, have been shown to be important for store-mediated Ca2+ entry (SMCE) in different cell types (e.g. 12, 13) including platelets (14.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 20-21Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that GTP, possibly through activation of a small GTP-binding protein, may activate a rapid and reversible interaction between membrane surfaces involving the formation of a prefusion pore through which Ca2+ ions can flow (15.Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 625-649Crossref Google Scholar, 16.Rys-Sikora K.E. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the secretion-like coupling model, the actin cytoskeleton close to the PM plays a key regulatory role in Ca2+ entry as it does in secretion. Redistribution of actin filaments into a tight layer subjacent to the PM prevents Ca2+ entry by acting as a barrier that blocks the coupling between ER and PM. This effect is reversed by disassembly of the cortical actin layer, thus providing the reestablishment of the coupling and Ca2+ entry (11.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The model suggested by Patterson et al. (11.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) is compatible with the hypothesis of Yao et al. (10.Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) because a model based on vesicular trafficking may support transport of the ER or Ca2+ channels toward the PM. In the present study we sought to expand our understanding of the mechanisms underlying SMCE in platelets. We have shown previously (14.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 20-21Google Scholar) that small GTP-binding proteins are required for the activation of Ca2+ entry after store depletion in platelets and that this mechanism may involve the actin cytoskeleton. We report here that modification of the actin cytoskeleton by stabilizing actin filaments prevents SMCE without affecting chemical coupling mediated by InsP3; however this modification has no effect once Ca2+ entry has been activated by depletion of the stores. These results suggest that under these conditions actin filaments act as a physical barrier that prevents a close interaction between the ER and the PM. Moreover, cytochalasin D (Cyt D) and latrunculin A, two agents that disrupt the actin filament network, can reverse Ca2+ entry after activation. This suggests that a direct interaction between the ER and the PM, which may need mechanical support, is more likely than the incorporation of channels into the PM by vesicle fusion. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) was from Texas Fluorescence (Austin, TX). Apyrase (grade V), aspirin, bovine serum albumin, paraformaldehyde, Nonidet P-40, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin and thapsigargin (TG) were from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, U. K.). Cyt D and brefeldin A were from Calbiochem (Nottingham, U. K.). Jasplakinolide and latrunculin A were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Calyculin A was from Alexis (Nottingham, U. K.). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Fura-2-loaded platelets were prepared as described previously (5.Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18151-18156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was obtained from healthy drug-free volunteers and mixed with one-sixth volume of acid/citrate dextrose anticoagulant containing (in mm) 85 sodium citrate, 78 citric acid and 111 d-glucose. Platelet-rich plasma was then prepared by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 ×g and 100 μm aspirin and 40 μg/ml apyrase were added. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated at 37 °C with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 45 min. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 350 × g for 20 min and resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline containing (in mm) 145 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 d-glucose, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, pH 7.45, and supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 40 μg/ml apyrase. Fluorescence was recorded from 1.5-ml aliquots of magnetically stirred platelet suspension (108 cells/ml) at 37 °C using a Cairn Research Spectrophotometer (Cairn Research Ltd., Sittingbourne, Kent, U. K.) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 500 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the fura-2 340/380 fluorescence ratio and calibrated according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (17.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ca2+influx in TG-induced store-depleted platelets was estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]ifor 2.5 min after the addition of CaCl2. Thrombin-evoked Ca2+ influx was measured as the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i above basal for 1 min after the addition of thrombin in the presence of external Ca2+, corrected by subtraction of the integral over the same period for stimulation in the absence of external Ca2+(with 1 mm EGTA). The F-actin content of resting and activated platelets was determined according to the modifications (18.Molony L. Ng-Sikorski J. Hellberg C. Andersson T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) of a previously published procedure (19.Hartwig J.H. Kung S. Kovacsovics T. Janmey P.A. Cantley L.C. Stossel T.P. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32986-32993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed platelets (2 × 108 cells/ml) were activated in HEPES-buffered saline. Samples of platelet suspension were transferred to 200 μl of ice-cold 3% (w/v) formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Fixed platelets were permeabilized by incubation for 10 min with 0.025% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 detergent dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. Platelets were then incubated for 30 min with 1 μm fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After incubation the platelets were collected by centrifugation in an MSE Micro-Centaur Centrifuge (MSE Scientific Instruments, Crawley, Sussex, U. K.) for 90 s at 3,000 ×g and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Staining of 2 × 107 cells/ml was measured using a Perkin-Elmer fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Samples were excited at 496 nm, and emission was at 516 nm. Because jasplakinolide (JP) binds to the same site as phalloidin (20.Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fixed platelets were incubated with 10 μm fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin, and JP was added at the same time as phalloidin in the control samples for JP experiments. Analysis of statistical significance was performed using Student's unpaired t test except for calyculin A Ca2+ entry data where Student's pairedt test was used. For multiple comparison, one-way analysis of variance combined with the Dunnett tests was used. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the addition of 200 nm TG to fura-2-loaded human platelets in stirred cuvettes at 37 °C evoked a prolonged elevation in [Ca2+]ibecause of the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. Subsequent addition of 300 μm Ca2+ to the external medium induced a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i indicative of SMCE (Fig.1, A and D). Pretreatment of human platelets with 10 μm Cyt D, a widely utilized membrane-permeant inhibitor of actin polymerization which binds to the barbed end of actin filaments (26.Fox J.E.B. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1981; 292: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), prevents TG-evoked actin filament formation in a time-dependent manner, reaching complete inhibition after 40 min of treatment (TableI). On the other hand, Cyt D had no effect on the actin filament content of unstimulated platelets when treated for up to 40 min (Table I). Similar results were obtained with latrunculin A, an agent that inhibits actin polymerization by binding to actin monomers (27.Spector I. Shochet N.R. Kashman Y. Groweiss A. Science. 1983; 219: 493-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Treatment of human platelets with 3 μm latrunculin A for 1 h at 37 °C abolished TG-induced actin filament formation without having any effect on the actin filament content of unstimulated cells (Table I). Treatment of platelets at 37 °C with 10 μm Cyt D for 40 min or 3 μm latrunculin A for 1 h reduced TG-evoked Ca2+ entry by 50 and 65%, respectively. In contrast, preincubation with these agents for 1 min increased TG-evoked SMCE (Fig. 1, A–F). Cyt D- or latrunculin A-treated platelets showed an identical release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores upon stimulation with TG compared with untreated cells, indicating that accumulation of Ca2+ in the internal stores was unaffected by inhibition of actin polymerization (Fig. 1,A-F).Table IEffects of Cyt D, latrunculin A, JP, or calyculin A on the F-actin content of unstimulated and TG-stimulated human plateletsStimulatory agentControlCyt DLatrunculin AJPCalyculin A1 min40 min1 min1 h% of basalNone100.0 ± 0.0100.4 ± 3.0100.1 ± 3.2100.5 ± 2.0100.4 ± 2.0179.7 ± 3.3*107.4 ± 4.1TG133.7 ± 4.6128.3 ± 3.898.9 ± 4.1**129.9 ± 4.099.7 ± 2.3**177.5 ± 4.4**109.8 ± 5.9**Human platelets were incubated with 10 μm cytochalasin D for 1 or 40 min, 3 μm latrunculin A for 1 min or 1 h, 10 μm jasplakinolide for 30 min, 100 nmcalyculin A for 2 min, or the vehicles for the same period as the controls.

JP, a cell-permeant peptide isolated from Jaspis johnstoni which induces polymerization and stabilization of actin filaments (20.Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a useful tool for studying further the role of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in SMCE. JP has been shown to elongate and organize actin filaments exclusively at the cell periphery, near the PM (11.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Treatment of human platelets with 10 μm JP for 30 min at 37 °C resulted in a significant enhancement of the F-actin content in unstimulated cells (n = 4; p < 0.001; Table I). In addition, no further increase in F-actin content was observed after stimulation with TG in JP-treated cells (TableI). Pretreatment of human platelets for 30 min at 37 °C with JP attenuates TG-evoked SMCE in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2,A–C). Ca2+ entry was reduced significantly by 48.9 ± 4.0 and 77.7 ± 5.4% after treatment for 30 min with 5 or 10 μm JP, respectively (n = 6;p < 0.001). In contrast, JP had no effect on resting cytosolic Ca2+ levels nor any effect on TG-evoked release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. As shown in Fig. 2 D, treatment of platelets with 10 μm JP for 30 min at 37 °C resulted in a substantial inhibition of the elevation in [Ca2+]i evoked by the physiological agonist thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) in medium containing 1 mm Ca2+. The initial peak [Ca2+]i elevation above basal after agonist was reduced significantly from 1,000 ± 60 to 328 ± 22 nm (n = 6; p< 0.001). In the absence of external Ca2+ (1 mm EGTA added), JP was without effect on the thrombin-evoked rise in [Ca2+]i. The initial peak elevation in [Ca2+]i above basal after agonist stimulation was 233 ± 12 nm in control cells and 233 ± 19 nm in JP-treated cells (Fig. 2 E;n = 6). If we consider the entry of Ca2+stimulated by thrombin (see “Experimental Procedures”), JP significantly reduced thrombin-evoked Ca2+ entry by 67.1 ± 1.8% (p < 0.001). As for the secretory pathway, where actin filaments in the cell periphery act as a barrier preventing exocytosis, the cortical actin cytoskeleton might prevent the interaction between ER and the PM necessary for activation of Ca2+ entry. To investigate whether the actin filament network is required for the maintenance of Ca2+ entry we studied the effects of Cyt D and JP on Ca2+ influx in platelets after SMCE had been stimulated using TG. Fig. 3 A shows the effect of adding Cyt D to store-depleted platelets. 10 μm Cyt D or the vehicle was added 3 min after TG. As shown in Fig. 3 A(control t = 3 min) Ca2+ entry was clearly stimulated at this point in time. Subsequent addition of Cyt D for 1 h blocked SMCE without having any effect in TG-evoked release of Ca2+ from the internal stores (Fig. 3 A;n = 4). Under these conditions Cyt D reversed the F-actin filament formation stimulated by TG (TableII; n = 6). These results were confirmed using latrunculin A. The addition of latrunculin A after SMCE has been stimulated with TG abolished Ca2+ entry (data not shown) as well as completely reversing the F-actin polymerization induced by TG (Table II; n = 4).Table IIEffect of the addition of latrunculin A and Cyt D with or without JP on the F-actin content of platelets in which store-mediated calcium entry had been preactivatedStimulatory agentControlLatrunculin ACyt DCyt D + JP% of basalNone100.0 ± 0.0100.0 ± 0.0100.0 ± 0.0100.0 ± 0.0TG132.6 ± 2.2100.6 ± 2.9*104.0 ± 4.4*194.7 ± 2.5*Human platelets were suspended in a Ca2+-free medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were then stimulated with 200 nm TG, and 3 min later 3 μm latrunculin A, 10 μm Cyt D, 10 μm Cyt D plus 10 μm JP, or the vehicle was added as described in the legend to Fig. 3.

On the other hand, JP, which induces polymerization and stabilization of actin filaments (20.Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not significantly modify Ca2+entry in platelets once SMCE has been activated by adding TG (Fig.3 B; p = 0.085, n = 4). Finally, experiments were carried out to test for reversal of the action of Cyt D by JP because the binding affinity of JP for F-actin (KD = 15 nm) (20.Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is greater than of Cyt D (KD = 50 nm) (21.Urbanik E. Ware B.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Simultaneous addition of both JP and Cyt D resulted in an increase in the F-actin content (Table II; n = 4) similar to that observed with JP alone (Table I; n = 4). In addition, JP prevented the inhibitory effect of Cyt D on activated SMCE (Fig.3 C; compare with Fig. 3 A, n = 4). To study further the involvement of the cytoskeleton in SMCE we used an independent means to check whether the cortical actin cytoskeleton could interfere with the communication between the ER and the PM. Recent studies have shown that phosphorylation of the moesin, ezrin, and radixin family of proteins is required for mediation of actin cross-linking to the PM (22.Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Tsuikita S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 53-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 23.Hishiya A. Ohnishi M. Tamura S. Nakamura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26705-26712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To induce phosphorylation-dependent association of the actin-binding proteins with the PM we treated human platelets with calyculin A, a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor that inhibits protein phosphatases 1 and 2 (11.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 23.Hishiya A. Ohnishi M. Tamura S. Nakamura F. J. Biol.

In many cells, including platelets, treatment with calyculin A results in a condensation of actin filaments at the PM (11.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L.

J. 1995; 307: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Treatment of human platelets for 2 min at 37 °C with calyculin A caused a concentration-dependent reduction of Ca2+ entry induced by TG (Fig.4). Calyculin A significantly reduced store-regulated Ca2+ entry by 26.8 ± 6.9, 55.1 ± 3.9, 67.2 ± 3.1, 69.3 ± 4.0, and 72.3 ± 1.3% (n = 6) at concentrations of 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 nm, respectively (p < 0.05) without having significant effects on Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores (data not shown). The effects of calyculin A on actin polymerization are shown in Table I. Exposure of platelets to 100 nm calyculin A for 2 min appeared to increase the F-actin content, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, pretreatment of platelets with 100 nm calyculin A significantly inhibited the increase of F-actin induced by thapsigargin (Table I; n = 6; p < 0.001). Brefeldin A, which specifically inhibits vesicular transport (28.Miller S.G. Carnell L. Moore H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 29.Dong J. Gao S. López J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31449-31454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was used to study the involvement of intracellular transport in SMCE. The results shown in Fig. 5,A and B, indicate that treatment of human platelets for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 μm brefeldin A inhibited TG-stimulated Ca2+entry by 78.2 ± 6.1% (n = 6; p< 0.01). Brefeldin A did not alter the resting cytosolic Ca2+ level, nor did it have any effect on TG-induced Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores, indicating that accumulation of Ca2+ in the internal stores was unaffected by preincubation with brefeldin A (Fig. 5, A andB). Because the effect of brefeldin A on the intracellular transport is reversible (30.Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bloom G.S. Kreis T.E. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), we examined whether SMCE might be reactivated after removal of brefeldin A. Human platelets were preincubated with 100 μm brefeldin A for 1 h at 37 °C followed by an incubation for a further 1 h in the absence of brefeldin A. The results indicated that, as for secretion, SMCE had been reactivated after this period in the absence of brefeldin A (Fig. 5C; n = 6). Treatment of cells for 1 h with 100 μm brefeldin A after SMCE had been activated by the addition of TG did not modify the entry of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 5 D; n = 4). This finding is compatible with a role for intracellular transport in the activation but not maintenance of SMCE and furthermore indicates that brefeldin A has no nonspecific effect as a Ca2+ chelator or a Ca2+ channel blocker. The activation of Ca2+ entry following the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores is a signaling process of great relevance. However, the mechanism by which the filling state of the Ca2+ stores activates such influx has remained unclear. Current hypotheses are centered on either a diffusible messenger released from the ER or a direct coupling mechanism involving physical interaction between the PM and the ER. Using different cytoskeletal modifications before and after activation of SMCE, our results provide new insights as to the nature of the coupling mechanism in human platelets. Cyt D, a widely used membrane-permeant inhibitor of actin polymerization, prevented TG-induced actin polymerization in human platelets in a time-dependent manner without having any effect on basal F-actin content (Table I). Similar effects were observed after treatment with latrunculin A, which inhibits actin polymerization by binding to monomeric G-actin in a 1:1 complex (27.Spector I. Shochet N.R. Kashman Y. Groweiss A. Science. 1983; 219: 493-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). These findings showed, in agreement with previous studies (26.Fox J.E.B. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1981; 292: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), that “treadmilling” in resting platelets is extremely slow. Interestingly, treatment of platelets with Cyt D or latrunculin A for different times has a biphasic effect on Ca2+ entry. A short preincubation (1 min) with these agents increases"

Kreil G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and determination of its three-dimensional structure (11.Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) has revealed important differences with group I and II sPLA2s, although the catalytic site is similar to that of vertebrate sPLA2s (13.Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sPLA2s similar to the bee venom enzyme were discovered in lizard venom (26.Sosa B.P. Alagon A.C. Martin B.M. Possani L.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2927-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27.Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.C. Vigneron L. Rathe J. Stievenart M. Christophe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), indicating that group III sPLA2s also exist in vertebrates and thus may occur in mammals as well. In the last 3 years, a systematic search for sPLA2 homologs in nucleic data bases has allowed us to clone four novel mammalian sPLA2s that belong to groups II and X (6.Cupillard L. Koumanov K.

Using the same strategy, we identified a human genomic sequence that displays significant homology with the bee venom group III sPLA2. We report here the cloning, genomic organization, chromosomal mapping, tissue distribution, and heterologous expression of the first human group III sPLA2. Searching for sPLA2 homologs in gene data bases stored at the National Center for Biotechnology using the tBLASTn sequence alignment program (28.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) resulted in the identification of a human genomic sequence (PAC clone DJ412A9, GenBankTM accession number AC005005) of 133,893 nucleotides containing several regions of homology to bee venom group III sPLA2. This suggested that this large genomic clone contains a gene with several exons and introns coding for a novel human group III sPLA2. The exon-intron boundaries of the human sPLA2 gene were deduced according to alignment with bee venom sPLA2 and exon-intron consensus sequences (29.Guthrie C. Science. 1991; 253: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) to provide a putative cDNA sequence. To demonstrate the presence of the putative cDNA sequence in human tissues, a first set of RT-PCR experiments (RT-PCR 1 in Fig. 1) was performed on different human cDNAs with primers flanking the Ca2+-binding loop and the active site domain of the novel sPLA2 (sense and antisense primers correspond to nucleotides 445 to 468 and 655 to 679, respectively, Fig. 1). A DNA product was amplified from human fetal lung cDNA and found to have a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the putative cDNA. This sequence was then used to clone the entire cDNA sequence by 5′ and 3′ RACE-PCR experiments as described previously (7.Valentin E. Koduri R.S. Scimeca J.-C. Carle G. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19152-19160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, human fetal lung poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg, CLONTECH) was reverse-transcribed, and double-stranded cDNA was ligated to adaptors containing sequences for the universal primers SP6 and KS. PCR reactions were performed using KS primer and a specific forward or reverse primer, for 3′ or 5′ RACE-PCR, respectively. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and colonies were screened using an internal32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. 3′ RACE-PCR experiments led to the cloning of a 1458-nucleotide sequence that contained in its 3′ end an in-frame extension of 304 amino acids, a stop codon, and a 3′-noncoding region of 546 nucleotides containing a putative polyadenylation site. Searching in EST data bases resulted in the identification of an EST sequence (GenBankTMAI282787), and full sequencing of this EST clone revealed a 193-nucleotide sequence containing a 166-nucleotide sequence identical in its 5′ end to the genomic clone and a 27-nucleotide poly(A) sequence. 5′ RACE-PCR experiments were performed with an antisense primer (nucleotides 518–545 in Fig. 1) and led to the cloning of a 158-nucleotide sequence, extending the 5′ end sequence of the RT-PCR 1 DNA fragment by 20 amino acid residues. In-frame with this 158-nucleotide sequence, an initiator methionine followed by a 19-amino acid sequence presenting the features of a signal peptide sequence (30.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar) was found in the upstream genomic sequence. A primer upstream of the putative initiator methionine (nucleotides −254 to −229 in Fig. 1) and an antisense primer (nucleotides 2205 to 2236 in Fig. 1) derived from the above EST sequence were designed and used to amplify the full-length hGIII cDNA sPLA2 (RT-PCR 2 in Fig. 1). This RT-PCR experiment was performed on the same human fetal lung cDNA using the proofreading Pwo DNA polymerase and led to the cloning of a cDNA fragment of 2564 nucleotides containing an open reading frame of 1530 nucleotides. To confirm that this long open reading frame resulted from a proper splicing of the hGIII sPLA2 gene, exon-trapping experiments were performed. For this purpose, a genomic fragment encompassing the putative hGIII gene was amplified with the Expand long template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), primers designed from the human PAC clone DJ412A9 (nucleotides 36143–36175 and 43062–43092 for sense and antisense primers, respectively), and human genomic DNA as template. An expected 6.95-kilobase pair genomic fragment was amplified and subcloned into the exon trapping pET01 vector (MoBiTech) and partially sequenced, and the resulting plasmid was transfected into COS cells. Three days after transfection, total RNA was prepared, reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT), and submitted to PCR with primers flanking the hGIII sPLA2 open reading frame. A PCR fragment of 1530 nucleotides was amplified, cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and found to encode for the full-length hGIII open reading frame. No amplification was observed with cDNA from COS cells transfected with the parent exon-trapping vector. A human Northern blot (CLONTECH Catalog No. 7780-1) was probed with a32P-labeled riboprobe corresponding to the nucleotide sequence 445 to 679 of hGIII sPLA2 (Fig. 1) in ULTRAHyb hybridization buffer (Ambion, Catalog No. 8670) for 18 h at 70 °C. High sensitivity strippable antisense riboprobe was synthesized using the Strip-EZ RNA Ambion kit (Catalog No. 1360). The blot was washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC (30 mmNaCl, 3 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7.0) in 0.1% SDS at 70 °C and exposed to Kodak Biomax MS films with a transcreen-HE intensifying screen. The full-length cDNA sequence coding for hGIII sPLA2 was subcloned into the expression vector pRc/CMVneo (Invitrogen), and a consensus Kozak sequence was added to enhance protein expression as described previously (6.Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The DNA construct was sequenced after subcloning and transiently transfected into COS cells using DEAE-dextran (7.Valentin E. Koduri R.S. Scimeca J.-C. Carle G. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19152-19160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Five days after transfection, cell medium was collected and partially purified on an anion exchange column. Briefly, COS cell culture medium (9 ml) was loaded at 1 ml/min onto a 10-ml column of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. After washing with equilibration buffer to remove unbound protein, the solvent program was started (10 min in equilibration buffer followed by a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m NaCl over 40 min). hGIII sPLA2 enzymatic activity was detected using the fluorimetric assay with 1-palmitoyl-2-(10-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphomethanol as described (8.Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The pool of hGIII-containing fractions was concentrated approximately 10-fold by centrifugal ultrafiltration (YM-10 membrane, Amicon) at 4 °C, and the concentrate was stored at −20 °C. Using this assay, no phospholipase A2 activity was detected in culture medium from COS cells transfected with the parent expression vector. Studies to measure the initial rate of hydrolysis of small unilamellar vesicles of phosphatidylglycerol (1-palmitoyl-2-[9,10-3H]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol at 50 Ci/mol) and phosphatidylcholine (1-palmitoyl-2-[9,10-3H]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 50 Ci/mol) were carried as described (8.Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) using Q-Sepharose-purified hGIII sPLA2. Initial rates were calculated from 3 time points in the linear portion of the product versus time curve. pH-rate profiles for the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine were obtained as described (8.Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ dependence of phospholipid hydrolysis was carried out with the fluorimetric assay (described above) with 10 μm EGTA (no Ca2+) or with CaCl2 in excess of EGTA to give 10–650 μm Ca2+. Screening of mammalian nucleic sequence data bases with various venom sPLA2s led us to identify a large human genomic fragment of 133,893 nucleotides presenting several regions of homology with bee venom group III sPLA2. This suggested that the genomic clone contains a complete gene with several exons and introns coding for a putative human group III (hGIII) sPLA2. A first set of sense and antisense primers was designed from the genomic sequences homologous to bee venom sPLA2 and used for RT-PCR experiments (RT-PCR 1 in Fig.1 A) on human cDNAs from brain, pancreas, spleen, skeletal muscle, and fetal lung. A DNA fragment was amplified from fetal lung cDNA, and its sequence was found to correspond to the expected spliced exons from the genomic sequence. 5′ and 3′ RACE-PCR experiments followed by a second round of RT-PCR (RT-PCR 2 in Fig. 1 A) on human fetal lung cDNA led to the cloning of a cDNA fragment of 2564 nucleotides containing a large open reading frame of 1530 nucleotides (see Fig. 1and “Experimental Procedures” for details). Screening of EST data bases resulted in the identification of a single human EST sequence (GenBankTMAI282787) of 193 nucleotides containing a poly(A) tail, suggesting that this EST sequence corresponds to the 3′ end of the hGIII sPLA2 mRNA (Fig. 1 A). Comparison of the 2564-nucleotide cDNA sequence with the PAC genomic sequence indicated that the hGIII sPLA2 gene is composed of at least 7 exons and 6 introns spanning about 7 kilobase pairs (Fig. 1 A). Exon-trapping experiments were performed and found to confirm the exon-intron structure and the sequence of the complete hGIII sPLA2 open reading frame of 1530 nucleotides (see “Experimental Procedures”). The PAC clone DJ412A9 (GenBankTMAC005005) containing the hGIII sPLA2gene was generated by the sequencing program of human chromosome 22 (31.Dunham I. Shimizu N. Roe B.A. Chissoe S. Hunt A.R. Collins J.E. Bruskiewich R. Beare D.M. Clamp M. Smink L.J. Ainscough R. Almeida J.P. Babbage A. Bagguley C. Bailey J. Barlow K. Bates K.N. Beasley O. Bird C.P. Blakey S. Bridgeman A.M. Buck D. Burgess J. Burrill W.D. O'Brien K.P. Nature. 1999; 402: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), indicating that the hGIII sPLA2 gene maps to this chromosome between the Genethon markers D22S1150 and D22S273. The location of the hGIII gene is thus distinct from those of genes for human group IB, IIA, IID, V, and X sPLA2s (8.Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,9.Ishizaki J. Suzuki N. Higashino K. Yokota Y. Ono T. Kawamoto K. Fujii N. Arita H. Hanasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24973-24979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similar to other mammalian sPLA2s, the open reading frame of hGIII sPLA2 begins with a signal peptide of 19 amino acids (30.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar), indicating that the novel enzyme could be secreted. In contrast to other mammalian sPLA2s (117 to 148 amino acids), the hGIII open reading frame codes for a much larger protein of 490 amino acids (calculated molecular mass 55.3 kDa, calculated pI 9.1) containing five putative N-glycosylation sites (Fig.1 B). This protein is made up of a central sPLA2domain (141 residues) flanked by N- and C-terminal regions (130 and 219 residues, respectively). Based on the alignment with venom group III sPLA2s (Fig. 2), the sPLA2 domain comprises 141 amino acids (calculated molecular mass 16 kDa, calculated pI 5.4) and displays the typical features of group III sPLA2s including the 10 cysteines specific for group III sPLA2s and the key residues of the Ca2+ loop and catalytic site. The sPLA2 domain contains 2 putative N-glycosylation sites that are not conserved with that of bee venom sPLA2 located at position 15 in Fig. 2. However, one of them is located only 4 residues downstream of the glycosylation site in bee venom sPLA2. Interestingly, the hGIII domain is more similar to venom group III sPLA2s identified from vertebrates. Indeed, higher levels of identity are found with the isoforms PA-2 and PA-5 (43 and 46%, respectively) purified from the lizard Gila monster (27.Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.C. Vigneron L. Rathe J. Stievenart M. Christophe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas lower levels are observed with venom group III sPLA2s from honey bee, bumble bee, and the scorpion Pandinus imperator (Fig.2). No protein data base entries with significant homology to the N- and C-terminal regions flanking the sPLA2 domain of the hGIII sPLA2 gene could be found. They are both basic (calculated pI 9.1 and 11.3 for N- and C-terminal regions, respectively) and contain 4 and 8 cysteines, suggesting that they may fold separately from the sPLA2 domain. The function of these two domains is completely unknown at present. One possibility is that these domains could be involved in the maturation of hGIII sPLA2 during or after its secretion from cells. Although the maturation processing of hGIII sPLA2 clearly remains to be elucidated, the presence of a basic doublet KR at the end of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1 B) suggests that this domain could serve as a long propeptide that can be cleaved by subtilisin-like protein convertase in the Golgi apparatus (32.Halban P.A. Irminger J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mature protein sequence of bee venom sPLA2 is preceded by an arginine residue (20.Kuchler K. Gmachl M. Sippl M.J. Kreil G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and a short propeptide sequence ending with an arginine doublet has been found in human group X sPLA2 (6.Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region also contains several basic residues including basic doublets, which may be involved in protein maturation as well. In addition, the C-terminal domain contains numerous prolines and a pentapeptide RRLAR similar to that found in Imperatoxin I from P. imperatorvenom (22.Zamudio F.Z. Conde R. Arevalo C. Becerril B. Martin B.M. Valdivia H.H. Possani L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11886-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is not yet clear whether some venom group III sPLA2s also have such large N- and C-terminal regions, because only mature protein sequences and partial cDNA sequences have been determined so far (20.Kuchler K. Gmachl M. Sippl M.J. Kreil G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 23.Hoffman D.R. Jacobson R.S. J. Allergy Clin.

Biochem. 1991; 196: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), except for theP. imperator venom sPLA2s (22.Zamudio F.Z. Conde R. Arevalo C. Becerril B. Martin B.M. Valdivia H.H. Possani L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11886-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24.Conde R. Zamudio F.Z. Becerril B. Possani L.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A second possibility may be that the N- and C-terminal domains are involved in sPLA2 dimerization, cell targeting, or interaction with cellular proteins, possibly including sPLA2 receptors (4.Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The last possibility may be that these domains play a role in regulating hGIII sPLA2 activity. Unlike group I and II sPLA2s, which contain a hydrogen bond network linking the N terminus to catalytic residues, the x-ray structure of bee venom sPLA2 shows that the N terminus does not form part of the active site structure (11.Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Indeed, recombinant bee venom sPLA2 expressed as an N-terminal fusion protein exhibits the same catalytic activity as the cleaved fusion or the native enzyme (33.Dudler T. Chen W.Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This suggests that the presence of the N-terminal extension (and presumably the C-terminal region, which is also not part of the catalytic site (11.Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar)) would not interfere with the catalytic activity of hGIII sPLA2. Full-length or partially cleaved hGIII sPLA2 may thus be catalytically active, and N-and C-terminal domains may participate to the hGIII enzymatic properties. Further studies are clearly needed to elucidate the maturation process of the hGIII sPLA2 protein and the role of these additional N- and C-terminal regions. The tissue distribution of hGIII sPLA2 was analyzed by hybridization at high stringency to a human Northern blot (Fig.3). The hGIII sPLA2 is expressed as a single transcript of 4.4 kilobases, which is abundant in kidney, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle, and is also present at low levels in placenta and peripheral blood leukocytes. Little, if any, expression was detected in brain, colon, thymus, spleen, small intestine, and lung. The pattern of expression of hGIII sPLA2 is distinct from that of other human sPLA2s, suggesting that this novel enzyme has specific function(s). Notably, hGIII sPLA2 is expressed in kidney although no expression was previously detected in this tissue for human group IB, IIA, IID, V, and X sPLA2s (6.Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 9.Ishizaki J. Suzuki N. Higashino K. Yokota Y. Ono T. Kawamoto K. Fujii N. Arita H. Hanasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24973-24979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). On the other hand, hGIII sPLA2 is co-expressed in heart with human group IIA and V sPLA2s and in liver and skeletal muscle with human group IIA sPLA2 (6.Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). When the hGIII sPLA2 cDNA was transiently transfected in COS cells, sPLA2 activity accumulated in the culture medium, indicating that the hGIII sPLA2 cDNA codes for a secreted active enzyme. The level of PLA2 activity measured after washing the cells with high salt buffer containing 1 m NaCl and in cell lysate was low, suggesting that hGIII sPLA2 is not tightly bound to the cell surface and is efficiently secreted. The hGIII sPLA2 was partially purified by chromatography on a Q-Sepharose fast flow column, and the eluted sPLA2 fraction was used to analyze the enzymatic properties. Like all mammalian sPLA2s that have been kinetically characterized (7.Valentin E. Koduri R.S. Scimeca J.-C. Carle G. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13203-13211Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), hGIII sPLA2 is considerably more active (11-fold based on initial velocities) on anionic phosphatidylglycerol vesicles versus zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine vesicles (not shown). Further studies with pure hGIII sPLA2 in larger quantities are required to determine if this rate difference is due to an increased fraction of enzyme bound to the anionic versus zwitterionic interface, a lower value of the interfacial K m for phosphatidylglycerolversus phosphatidylcholine, or both. As shown in Fig.4 A, the rate of phosphatidylmethanol vesicle hydrolysis by hGIII is completely Ca2+-dependent with a K d of 6 ± 0.8 μm. The K d for Ca2+ of 6 μm for the action of hGIII sPLA2 on phosphatidylmethanol vesicles is considerably lower than the submillimolar to millimolar values reported for other sPLA2s. However, the K d value measured in this study is an apparent value. For sPLA2s, phospholipid binding to the active site is Ca2+-dependent, and thus the observed apparentK d for Ca2+ depends on the affinity of the enzyme's active site for phospholipid substrate (36.Yu B.Z. Berg O.G. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6485-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).K d for Ca2+ is also modulated by the affinity of the enzyme for the vesicle interface because interfacial binding is a prerequisite for the binding of long chain phospholipids to the enzyme's active site. In this context, it may be noted that human group IIA sPLA2 binds Ca2+ with millimolar affinity in the absence of substrate (37.Franken P.A. Van den Berg L. Huang J. Gunyuzlu P. Lugtigheid R.B. Verheij H.M. De Haas G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 38.Bayburt T., Yu, B.Z. Lin H.K. Browning J. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but theK d for Ca2+ in the presence of phosphatidylglycerol (which supports tight interfacial and active site binding) is in the low micromolar range (39.Marshall L.A.

Once large amounts of recombinant hGIII sPLA2 are available, it will be possible to use spectroscopic methods to measure the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+ in the absence of substrate. As shown in Fig.4 B, hGIII sPLA2 is optimally active on phosphatidylcholine vesicles at pH 8. The pH-rate profile of hGIII is similar to most sPLA2s (12.Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Hanel A.M. Berg O.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The increase in rate up to pH 8 probably reflects deprotonation of the active site histidine so that it can function as a general base for the attack of a water molecule on the substrate ester carbonyl group (13.Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Over the past few years, the molecular biology approach has revealed the presence of a diversity of sPLA2s in mammals (5.Tischfield J.A. J. Biol.

The mammalian sPLA2family comprises eight members of 14–17 kDa including a group I, 5 group II, a group V, and a group X sPLA2s. It also includes otoconin-95, a major protein of the extracellular otoconial complex of inner ear, which consists of a large secreted protein of 469 residues containing two sPLA2-like domains (40.Wang Y. Kowalski P.E. Thalmann I. Ornitz D.M. Mager D.L. Thalmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15345-15350Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 41.Verpy E. Leibovici M. Petit C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All these sPLA2s have a conserved primary structure, have in common various disulfides, and several have a similar genomic organization. These sPLA2s are thus structurally related enzymes that fall within the same set of proteins, namely the I/II/V/X sPLA2 collection. It should be noted however that they all have distinct tissue distribution and function. The mammalian sPLA2 family now also comprises the human group III sPLA2, which does not belong to the I/II/V/X sPLA2 collection. hGIII sPLA2 has a distinct sPLA2 primary sequence from the above sPLA2s, contains extra N- and C-terminal regions, and has a different genomic organization. Together, this indicates that mammals can express sPLA2s of the group I/II/V/X collection and of the distinct group III collection. Interestingly, the same can be observed in reptiles, because sPLA2s found in snake venoms are group I or II enzymes whereas those found in lizard venoms belong to group III (15.Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 31: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In addition, as previously pointed out (15.Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 31: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), it is likely that a single snake species can express several sPLA2s from different groups that are present in various tissues other than the venom gland. Finally, while most sPLA2s reported so far in the venom of invertebrates appear to be group III enzymes (20.Kuchler K. Gmachl M. Sippl M.J. Kreil G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22.Zamudio F.Z. Conde R. Arevalo C. Becerril B. Martin B.M. Valdivia H.H. Possani L.D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 375: 456Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), scanning of nucleic data bases indicates that invertebrates also express sPLA2s from the group I/II/V/X collection in other tissues. In short, this makes likely that both vertebrates and invertebrates express a variety of sPLA2s of the group I/II/V/X collection and of group III and that these sPLA2s are present in various tissues to deserve specific functions. Lastly, based on the current sPLA2s found in mammals, it is tempting to speculate that vertebrates have “chosen” to generate a sPLA2 diversity from the group I/II/V/X collection and not from the group III collection. It remains however to determine if more than one group III sPLA2 is expressed in mammals, and if reptiles and invertebrates have made the same “choice” to make their own sPLA2 diversity. In conclusion, we cloned a novel human sPLA2 that clearly belongs to group III. This sPLA2 seems to have a number of distinct structural features compared with the known venom group III sPLA2s, suggesting that hGIII sPLA2 may not be the structural “equivalent” of these venom sPLA2s (4.Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Besides the evolutionary point of view, the biological role of hGIII sPLA2 is unknown. Its tissue distribution appears nonredundant with other human sPLA2s, suggesting particular function(s). Whether hGIII sPLA2 is involved in lipid metabolism, arachidonic acid release, binding to specific receptors, and/or defense mechanisms against bacteria and viruses like human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (42.Fenard D. Lambeau G. Valentin E. Lefebvre J.C. Lazdunski M. Doglio A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) remains to be analyzed. We thank Dr. E.

https://openalex.org/W2015739523,"The glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) inhibits glucokinase competitively with respect to glucose by forming a protein-protein complex with this enzyme. The physiological role of GKRP in controlling hepatic glucokinase activity was addressed using gene targeting to disrupt GKRP gene expression. Heterozygote and homozygote knockout mice have a substantial decrease in hepatic glucokinase expression and enzymatic activity as measured at saturating glucose concentrations when compared with wild-type mice, with no change in basal blood glucose levels. Interestingly, when assayed under conditions to promote the association between glucokinase and GKRP, liver glucokinase activity in wild-type and null mice displayed comparable glucose phosphorylation capacities at physiological glucose concentrations (5 mm). Thus, despite reduced hepatic glucokinase expression levels in the null mice, glucokinase activity in the liver homogenates was maintained at nearly normal levels due to the absence of the inhibitory effects of GKRP. However, following a glucose tolerance test, the homozygote knockout mice show impaired glucose clearance, indicating that they cannot recruit sufficient glucokinase due to the absence of a nuclear reserve. These data suggest both a regulatory and a stabilizing role for GKRP in maintaining adequate glucokinase in the liver. Furthermore, this study provides evidence for the important role GKRP plays in acutely regulating of hepatic glucose metabolism.

Furthermore, transgenic studies have shown that graded overexpression of liver GK is associated with a concomitant increase in glucose utilization and a reduction in blood glucose (8.Niswender K.D.

In liver, GK activity is acutely regulated by binding to the glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). Binding of these proteins results in competitive inhibition with respect to glucose (11.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 200: 545-551Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The affinity constant for rat liver GKRP is decreased ∼15-fold by fructose 6-phosphate, and its inhibitory effects can be antagonized by the presence of fructose 1-phosphate (F1P). Rat hepatocytes treated with F1P precursors led to increased GK activity, presumably by the binding of F1P to GKRP that induces a conformational change in GKRP that has less affinity for GK (13.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14.Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J.

Recently, we and others have shown that GKRP is necessary for the translocation of GK into the nucleus of hepatocytes (16.de la Iglesia N. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17.Shiota C. Coffey J. Grimsby J. Grippo J.F. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37125-37130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After binding to GKRP, GK is retained in the nucleus until it is released by changes in the metabolic milieu. It then exits the nucleus due to the presence of a nuclear export signal sequence in GK. Partitioning of GK appears to play a major role in activating glycogen synthesis, which occurs during translocation of GK into the cytosol (18.Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19.Agius L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 303-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether the hepatic GK translocation cycle in which GKRP is involved has any other physiological roles. Thus, to investigate the physiological effect of the absence of GKRP with respect to controlling the enzymatic activity of GK and its implications in glucose homeostasis, we have generated and characterized GKRP null mice. A replacement-type gene targeting vector was constructed in which coding exons 4 and 5 for the mouse GKRP gene were replaced with a neomycin gene cassette. Positive-negative selection was achieved by flanking the 3′-end of the targeting vector with a herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene. The mouse GKRP gene was disrupted by homologous recombination in 129/SvEv embryonic stem cells and chimeras generated as described previously (20.Wu C.-Y. Ferrante J. Gately M.K. Magram J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1658-1665PubMed Google Scholar). To generate heterozygous mutants for the GKRP gene, chimeric males were bred to C57BL/6J female mice and genotyped as described below. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on tail DNA using two independent pairs of oligonucleotides for detection of the neomycin resistance gene and GKRP exons 4 and 5. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used for detection of the neomycin resistance gene are 5′-GAAGCGGGAAGGGACTGGCTGCTA-3′ and 5′-CGGGAGCGGCGATACCGTAAAGC-3′. The sequences of the primers used for detecting GKRP exons 4 and 5 are 5′-TGCTGAGTGGAGGGGGCACC-3′ and 5′-CCTGCAATGAGGTATGTGTA-3′. Both sets of oligonucleotides generate a 0.4-kb polymerase chain reaction product. Animals were anesthetized with CO2 and then killed by decapitation. The livers were quickly removed and homogenized using a glass-Teflon homogenizer in 10 volumes of ice-cold 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, leupeptin (5 μg/ml), and aprotinin (5 μg/ml). A 100,000 × g supernatant was prepared by centrifugation of the homogenate. The supernatants were divided into aliquots and stored at −70 °C. Liver supernatants were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked by 2% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 45 min, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either a 1:10,000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to GKRP or a 1:5000 dilution of sheep polyclonal antibody to GK. The antibodies were diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 150 mm NaCl and 2% bovine serum albumin. After washing with PBS plus 0.5% Tween 20, membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with either a 1:5000 dilution of peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) or a 1:10,000 dilution or donkey anti-sheep antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) in PBS plus 0.5% Tween 20. Membranes were then washed in PBS plus 0.5% Tween 20 followed by a final wash in PBS. The immunoblots were developed by the enhanced chemluminescence method and exposed to film. The bands were scanned, and the intensity was determined by enhanced laser densitometry. Liver poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated, fractionated by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Northern hybridization as described (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.2-7.52Google Scholar). The transferred poly(A)+ mRNA was hybridized to a human GK cDNA probe and washed with 0.5× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 55 °C, and autoradiography was performed. The blot was stripped and hybridized to a mouse actin cDNA probe and washed with 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and autoradiography was performed. Glucose and insulin were measured using standard procedures from mice fed ad libitum. The lights were on a 12-h on/off cycle. Blood was taken 3 h after the dark cycle to determine the postabsorptive (basal) glucose and insulin concentrations. All data presented in this report were obtained using male mice. Female GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) mice displayed a similar phenotype compared with their male littermates. Each mouse was bled on four different occasions between 50 and 400 days of age (n = 59 for wild-type mice, 87 for heterozygote mice, and 55 for homozygote GKRP knockout male mice. Plasma glucose was measured using a YSI model 2700 Biochemistry Analyzer (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Plasma insulin was determined using a radioimmunoassay kit from Linco (St. Louis, MO). Islets were isolated from the pancreas by a collagenase procedure and were then cultured for 4–5 days as described previously (2.Liang Y. Najafi H. Smith R.M. Zimmerman E.C. Magnuson M.A. Tal M. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 792-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Islets were then tested as to function in a perifusion system with a glucose ramp design increasing the glucose by 0.8 mm/min (22.Sweet I.R. Li G. Najafi H. Berner D. Matschinsky F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E606-E625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin was assayed by radioimmunoassay (2.Liang Y. Najafi H. Smith R.M. Zimmerman E.C. Magnuson M.A. Tal M. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 792-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,22.Sweet I.R. Li G. Najafi H. Berner D. Matschinsky F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E606-E625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The method of Davidson and Arion was used with some modifications (23.Davidson A.L. Arion W.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 253: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In this assay, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is used to couple the production of glucose 6-phosphate to the generation of NADH. Briefly, the final incubation mixture contained 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 2 mm NAD, 4 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 50 mm glucose, and liver supernatant in a volume of 1 ml. Assays were performed using a Beckman DU-7 spectrophotometer equipped with a kinetic analysis accessory. The incubation mixture was equilibrated at 30 °C, and then the reaction was started by the addition of liver supernatant. Blank cuvettes contained all of the components of the assay mixture except glucose and ATP. The increase in A 340 was followed at 20-s intervals for 20 min, and the increase in A 340between 10 and 20 min was used to determine the rate. Hexokinase activity was measured under identical conditions except that the glucose concentration was decreased to 0.5 mm. A modification of the assay described by Stanley et al. (24.Stanley J.C. Dohm G.L. McManus B.S. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, the final incubation mixture contained 1 mm ATP, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 5 mm glucose including 0.5 μCi ofd-[14C]glucose (306 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and liver supernatant in a volume of 125 μl. Blank tubes contained all of the components of the complete reaction mixture except liver supernatant. The reaction was started by the addition of liver supernatant and was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of 250 μl of 3% methanol in 95% ethanol. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation, and then 20 μl of the methanol/ethanol extract was spotted on a 2.5-cm disc of Whatman DE 81 anion exchange paper. The disks were mounted in a vacuum manifold and were washed six times with 12 ml of water. The amount of phosphorylated product adsorbed to the disks was then determined by liquid scintillation counting. All results are reported as the mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to test for statistical significance. A targeting vector was designed to delete exons 4 and 5 in the GKRP gene and to replace this region with a neomycin resistance gene (Fig.1 A). Gene targeting in embryonic stem cells and generation of chimeric male mice were conducted as described by Wu et al. (20.Wu C.-Y. Ferrante J. Gately M.K. Magram J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1658-1665PubMed Google Scholar). Germ line transmission of the mutant allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1 B) and by the polymerase chain reaction (not shown). Intercrosses between heterozygotes generated mice with the expected 1:2:1 ratio of wild-type (GKRP(+/+)), heterozygote (GKRP(+/−)), and homozygote (GKRP(−/−)) animals. The GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) mice appeared normal and they were fertile. The body weights of knockout mice did not differ significantly from the body weights of wild-type animals up to 60 weeks of age. To determine whether or not disruption of the GKRP gene eliminated expression of GKRP protein, we performed Western blot analyses of the proteins in 100,000 × g liver supernatants. A 65-kDa signal (i.e. GKRP) was observed in supernatants from GKRP(+/+) and GKRP(+/−) mice but completely absent in supernatants from GKRP(−/−) mice (Fig.2 A). The signal intensity from the GKRP band on Western blots prepared with liver supernatants from GKRP(+/−) mice was reduced by approximately 50% as compared with the intensity on blots prepared with liver supernatants from GKRP(+/+) mice. This suggests a gene dosage effect. The livers of GKRP(−/−) mice contained no detectable GKRP mRNA as determined by Northern blot hybridization using a cDNA probe encoding mouse GKRP. The GKRP transcript was detected in GKRP(+/+) and GKRP(+/−) mice (data not shown). We investigated the effect of reduced GKRP expression on the expression levels of GK in livers from all three genotypes. Interestingly, densitometric analyses of Western blots from liver supernatants indicated that GK protein levels were decreased by 30 and 75% in GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) mice, respectively, as compared with the signal intensity from wild-type animals (Fig. 2 B). Western blot analysis of GKRP and GK using low speed supernatant fractions of liver extracts displayed similar results (data not shown). To determine if the reduction of GK expression levels in the livers of GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) mice was a consequence of a reduction in GK transcription, Northern blot hybridizations were performed with liver poly(A)+ RNA. Hybridization to a cDNA probe encoding mouse GK detected a 2.1- and 1.7-fold increase in the signal intensity for a 2.5-kb GK transcript in the livers of GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) mice, respectively, as compared with the livers of wild-type animals (Fig. 2 C). Rehybridization of the same Northern blot with a cDNA encoding mouse actin demonstrated that the RNA load was equivalent for all three genotypes (Fig. 2 D). Hepatic GK is predominantly localized in nucleus during metabolically quiescent conditions, where it interacts with the nuclear bound GKRP (16.de la Iglesia N. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19.Agius L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 303-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Under conditions of high glucose, such as after a carbohydrate-containing meal, hepatic GK translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, while the GKRP remains bound to the nucleus (16.de la Iglesia N. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3(top panel), GKRP was localized to the nucleus of livers from wild-type and heterozygote mice. The GKRP signal was completely absent from the nucleus of livers from GKRP(−/−) animals. Immunostaining for GK was localized to the nucleus in liver sections from nonfasted GKRP(+/+) and GKRP(+/−) mice (Fig. 3, middle panel). In contrast, GK staining was absent in the nucleus from GKRP(−/−) mice (Fig. 3, middle panel). If GKRP is the molecular anchor that partitions GK to the nucleus in wild-type animals, one would predict that GK would be localized exclusively in the cytoplasm of GKRP(−/−) mice. However, we were unable to visualize a cytoplasmic signal for GK in GKRP(−/−) mice above the background signal obtained with preimmune serum (Fig. 3,bottom panel) despite attempts to induce GK expression in GKRP(−/−) mice by acute administration with glucose (data not shown). Enzymatic activity of liver GK provided by mice from all three genotypes was determined under saturating glucose concentrations, and the data are reported in TableI. The specific activity of GK was decreased in liver supernatants from GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) animals (16 and 41%, respectively) as compared with the specific activity in liver supernatants from wild-type animals. The presence of GKRP in the liver supernatants from GKRP(+/+) mice and its absence or presence in a reduced amount in supernatants from GKRP(−/−) and GKRP(+/−) mice, respectively, could affect the “apparent” specific activity of GK. Since the inhibition of GK by the GKRP is competitive with respect to glucose, high glucose concentrations, such as 50 mm, should in principal reverse the inhibitory effects exerted by the GKRP. Therefore, the presence or absence of GKRP in the liver supernatants should have little effect on the measurement of total GK activity as reported in Table I. Hexokinase activity (i.e.glucose-phosphorylating activity at 0.5 mm glucose) was the same in liver supernatants from the three genotypes (Table I). GK activity in female GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) mice is also decreased in liver supernatants, which is in agreement with the results presented above, which were obtained in male mice.Table IGlucose phosphorylation capacity in GKRP knockout mouse liverGenotypeGlucokinaseHexokinasemilliunits/mg proteinWild type23.1 ± 1.963.2 ± 0.27Heterozygous19.3 ± 2.143.1 ± 0.34Homozygous13.7 ± 1.50ap < 0.01.3.7 ± 0.61Enzymatic activity of GK and HK were determined in 100,000 ×g liver supernatants using 50 mm and 0.5 mm glucose, respectively, in a spectrophotometric assay.

Open table in a new tab Enzymatic activity of GK and HK were determined in 100,000 ×g liver supernatants using 50 mm and 0.5 mm glucose, respectively, in a spectrophotometric assay. One unit is defined as 1 μmol/min product formed. Values are mean ± S.E. n = 4–5 per treatment group. As shown in Fig. 4, the activity of GK in liver supernatants from wild-type, GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) was measured at 5 mm glucose (Fig. 4). In the absence of supplemental sorbitol 6-phosphate (S6P) or fructose 1-phosphate, the measured specific activities of GK in liver supernatants from wild-type, GKRP(+/−), and GKRP(−/−) mice were essentially the same under these assay conditions (Fig. 4, control group). Interestingly, this occurred despite the fact that Western analyses (Fig.2 B) and measurements of GK activity at 50 mmglucose (Table I) clearly demonstrated that the liver supernatants from the GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) animals contain less GK protein and activity than do the wild-type animals. Therefore, it was of interest to determine the amount of GK inhibition exerted by GKRP using S6P and F1P to potentiate or inhibit, respectively, the interaction between GK and GKRP. The addition of S6P to the reaction mixture slightly decreased the specific activity of GK in liver supernatants prepared from wild-type and GKRP(+/−) animals while having no effect on the supernatants prepared from GKRP(−/−) animals, relative to the control groups (Fig. 4, compare control versus S6P group). The finding that the addition of S6P had little effect on the specific activity of GK in this experiment probably reflects the fact that fructose 6-phosphate levels are sufficiently high to activate GKRP due to the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate, which was added to the reaction to inhibit hexokinase I, to fructose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase. However, within the S6P treatment group the GK activity from the wild-type mice was significantly decreased as compared with GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) animals (Fig. 4, S6P group). This probably reflects the decreased GKRP levels in the supernatants from the GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) animals. The ability of F1P to increase the enzymatic activity for the wild-type and GKRP(+/−) animals relative to the control and S6P groups (Fig. 4, compare F1Pversus S6P and control groups) while having no significant effect in the GKRP(−/−) animals strongly suggests that the presence of GKRP in wild-type and GKRP(+/−) animals exerted an inhibitory effect on GK. In fact, in the presence of F1P the GKRP(−/−) animals showed a statistically significant reduction in the GK activity compared with the GKRP(+/−) and wild-type animals (Fig. 4, F1P group), which is in agreement with the decrease in activity determined at 50 mm glucose. Blood was collected from from ad libitum fed mice for measurement of glucose and insulin on four separate occasions over a 1-year period starting at an age of 60 days. The age at which blood was collected varied from animal to animal, yielding a continuum of ages during this experiment. There were no significant differences in the plasma glucose values among the three genotypes of either sex across all age groups examined (data not shown). Comparison of nonfasting insulin levels between the various genotypes showed a typical age-related increase in plasma insulin (Fig.5). There was no statistically significant difference in the plasma insulin levels found in GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) mice compared with controls (Fig. 5) for all age groups examined. A trend for decreased plasma insulin in the GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) is apparent for the older animals (Fig. 5,B–D). However, glucose-induced insulin release in islets isolated from GKRP(+/+) mice and cultured for 4–5 days in 10 mm glucose was not significantly different from GKRP(−/−) mice (Fig. 6), confirming that GKRP plays no role in islet cell glucose metabolism (26.Brown K.S.

Insulin release was measured in isolated cultured islets in response to glucose concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 mm, according to a ramp rate of 0.8 mm/min as described previously (22.Sweet I.R.

However, the GKRP(−/−) mice showed moderately impaired response in an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test relative to GKRP(+/+) animals (Fig.7). The response of GKRP(+/−) was indistinguishable from that of GKRP(+/+) mice (data not shown). Furthermore, there was no difference in the fasting blood glucose levels between GKRP(+/+) and GKRP(−/−) mice (Fig. 7) and between GKRP(+/+) and GKRP(+/−) mice at the onset of the glucose tolerance test. Gene targeting techniques were used to generate mice that lacked GKRP. Homozygous null mice not only lacked GKRP but also had reduced GK in the liver. Similar observations were made for mice carrying only one mutant allele, but the reduction in GK protein levels was not as great. Homozygous and heterozygous mice displayed an increase in GK transcript levels compared with wild-type mice, suggesting the difference in protein levels is due to posttranscriptional or posttranslational events. While the mechanisms remain to be studied, it is possible that GK is stabilized and protected from proteolytic degradation by forming a protein-protein complex with the regulatory protein as suggested by Brown et al. (26.Brown K.S. Kalinowski S.S. Megill J.R. Durham S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mice that lack GKRP displayed a 40% reduction of liver GK activity, whereas heterozygotes showed only a 16% reduction under saturating glucose concentrations. Despite such a marked decrease in liver GK protein levels and enzymatic activity, both heterozygote and homozygote mice were normoglycemic. This implies that GKRP-deficient mice are somehow able to compensate for the loss of GK protein levels. We have shown by in vitro assays that the liver GK enzymatic activity in homozygous mice is comparable with wild-type mice when the assay is designed to measure the inhibitory properties of GKRP (Fig.4). Furthermore, we have shown by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2) that GK is predominantly associated with nucleus in GKRP(+/+) and GKRP(+/−) mice, and the amount of GK in the cytoplasm, presumably the uninhibited state, is comparable with the amount of GK found in the cytoplasm of GKRP-deficient mice. The intracellular concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate are estimated to be high enough to promote the interaction between GK and GKRP, and we found no significant difference in liver fructose 6-phosphate concentrations among all three genotypes (data not shown). Furthermore, we have found that GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) mice show normal concentrations of liver glycogen and glucose 6-phosphate (data not shown). It has been well established that GK translocates from a nuclear location to the cytoplasm under conditions of high glucose (16.de la Iglesia N. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26.Brown K.S. Kalinowski S.S. Megill J.R. Durham S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). That GKRP(−/−) mice show a moderately impaired glucose tolerance test response may reflect a failure to efficiently recruit a pool of active GK molecules from the nucleus. Plasma insulin levels taken at various time points after the glucose tolerance test were not significantly different between GKRP(+/+) and GKRP(−/−) mice (data not shown). Liver-specific GK knockout mice with a nearly total elimination of GK activity displayed a marked reduction in glucose clearance rates and insulin release during hyperglycemic clamp studies (6.Postic C Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar), but basal blood glucose concentrations did not differ greatly from those of controls. In contrast, it has been shown that a β-cell-specific GK knockout is lethal due to marked hyperglycemia. Although the mechanism for reduction of hepatic GK is different between the GKRP and liver GK knockout mice, the major effect in common is a reduction in glucose clearance during hyperglycemic conditions. Moreover, the fact that F1P precursors increase the hepatic glucose uptake by the dog in vivo also provides additional evidence for the important role GKRP plays in acutely regulating glucose metabolism (28.Shiota M. Galassetti P. Monohan M. Neal D.W. Cherrington A.D. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Based on our observations that ablation of GKRP function in mice does not lead to a diabetic state, GKRP mutations, at least by themselves, probably do not play a major role in the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (29.Vionnet N. Hani E.H. Lesage S. Philippi A. Hager J. Varret M. Stoffel M. Tanizawa Y. Chiu K.C. Glaser B. Permutt M.A. Passa P. Demenais F. Froguel P. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, based on the normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated islets, GKRP does not appear to play a role in the pancreatic β-cell. In conclusion, mice that are deficient in GKRP show reduced GK protein levels and enzymatic activity, but because control by the regulatory protein is absent they maintain normal blood glucose levels. Plasma insulin levels in GKRP(+/−) and GKRP(−/−) mice show less variability over time and are decreased compared with wild-type animals. However, there is no significant difference in the glucose-induced insulin release in islets between wild-type and knockout mice. Mice deficient in GKRP show an impaired response to a bolus of injected glucose. We suggest that this is due to the inability to recruit GK from a nuclear reserve, where it is normally found associated with the regulatory protein. These results strongly suggest that the physiological role of the regulatory protein is to provide a functional reserve of GK that can be quickly released after a meal. It is interesting to speculate that mutations in GKRP that do not allow GK·GKRP complexes to form may play a minor role in the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance. Farrelly et al. (Farrelly, D., Brown, K. S., Tieman, A., Ren, J., Lira, S. A., Hagan, D., Gregg, R., Mookhtiar, K. A., and Hariharan, N. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 14511–14516) found that GKRP-deficient mice display a parallel loss of hepatic GK protein and activity relative to wild-type mice. In contrast to wild-type mice, the GKRP mutant mice displayed impaired glycemic control and were hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic after being on a high sucrose/high fat diet for 8 weeks.

Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), and it is likely that, like DNA-PK, ATM also behaves as a serine/threonine protein kinase. Indeed, several reports have shown that immunoprecipitates of ATM from whole cells have serine/threonine protein kinase activity toward PHAS-I and p53 in vitro (14.Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y.

In immunoprecipitation assays, ATM protein kinase activity was absolutely dependent on the presence of manganese, and activity toward p53 and PHAS-I was not stimulated by DNA (14.Banin S. Moyal L.

In contrast, others have reported that immunoprecipitated ATM has DNA-dependent kinase activity toward the 32-kDa subunit of single-stranded DNA-binding protein, RPA (16.Gately D.P. Hittle J.C. Chan G.K.T. Yen T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2361-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that, in crude extracts, ATM binds to DNA that has been damaged by irradiation with x-rays (17.Suzuki K. Kodama S. Watanabe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25571-25575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These sometimes conflicting results underscore the need for biochemical characterization of ATM. Although recombinant ATM protein has been expressed in baculovirus (18.Ziv Y. Bar-Shira A. Pecker I. Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 19.Scott S.P. Zhang N. Khanna K.K. Khromykh A. Hobson K. Watters D. Lavin M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cells that lack ATM are defective in their ability to activate DNA damage response pathways that result in cell cycle arrest at both G1/S and G2/M. ATM acts upstream of p53 and is required for the activation of p53 and the subsequent up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 (for review, see Refs. 1.Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 2.Canman C.E. Lim D.-S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3301-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 3.Nakamura Y. Nat.

Serine 15 of p53 is phosphorylatedin vivo in response to ionizing radiation (23.Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation at serine 15 plays an important role in the ionizing radiation-induced damage response pathway (for reviewed, see Refs. 24.Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholarand 25.Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of ATM in the activation of p53 remains to be determined. Serine 15 of p53, which occurs in the amino acid sequence PLSQE is also phosphorylated, in vitro, by DNA-PK (26.Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATM and DNA-PK recognize similar sequences in their target proteins. Here we describe the purification of ATM from normal human tissue. The final protein fraction contains a polypeptide of approximately 350 kDa which cross-reacts with various antibodies to ATM but not to DNA-PKcs. The ATM-containing fraction phosphorylates serine 15 of p53, Chk2, the 32-kDa subunit of RPA, and PHAS-I in a strictly manganese-dependent manner. The protein kinase activity of purified ATM toward p53, PHAS-I, and Chk2 was not stimulated by double-stranded DNA or by Ku. Phosphorylation of RPA was stimulated by calf thymus DNA and calf thymus DNA in the presence of M13 single-stranded circular plasmid DNA, but not by irradiated plasmid DNA. We also show that the related protein, DNA-PKcs, is active in the presence of manganese in the absence of Ku, suggesting that a requirement for manganese may be characteristic of the PI-3 kinase family of enzymes. ATM was purified from human placenta following a similar procedure to that described previously for DNA-PKcs and Ku (9.Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All steps utilizing low pressure chromatography were performed at 4 °C. Chromatographic steps using the Biologic Protein Purification system (Bio-Rad) were performed at room temperature. All buffers (except buffer E, below) contained 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mm DTT. The presence of ATM and DNA-PKcs was monitored at all stages of purification by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to ATM, 4BA (22.Khanna K.K. Keating K.E. Kozlov S. Scott S.

Human placenta was obtained from the Foothills Hospital, Calgary, in accordance with the safety and ethical requirements of the university. Freshly obtained human placenta was homogenized in buffer containing 0.5 msalt buffer and 10 mm magnesium chloride as described previously (9.Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and ATM was precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 40% saturation. After dialysis into buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA) containing 100 mm KCl, the sample was applied to a 5 × 30-cm column of DEAE-Fast Flow Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with buffer B containing 1 m KCl. In preliminary preparations, the protein sample was dialyzed into buffer B containing 100 mmKCl and applied to a 5 × 15-cm column of SP-Fast Flow Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). However, subsequently, this step was replaced by a 5 × 15-cm column of phenyl-Sepharose, Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in buffer B containing 1m KCl. ATM was eluted with buffer B containing 50 mm KCl. This column provided better yields of ATM protein than the SP-Sepharose column because of higher binding capacity for ATM. Also, ATM was separated from the majority of the DNA-PK because under these conditions, DNA-PKcs and Ku70/80 did not bind to the phenyl-Sepharose column. The ATM-containing fractions from the phenyl-Sepharose column were dialyzed into buffer B containing 100 mm KCl, applied to a 5 × 5-cm column of MacroPrep DEAE (Bio-Rad), and eluted with buffer B containing 100 mmKCl and 100 mm magnesium chloride. A similar step involving elution of DEAE-anion exchange resin using magnesium chloride was used for the purification of DNA-PKcs and Ku from HeLa cells (28.Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and placenta (9.Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fractions containing ATM were then dialyzed into buffer B containing 100 mm KCl and passed over single-stranded DNA-cellulose (Sigma), either in batch mode or by column chromatography (1.5 × 4-cm column). Unlike DNA-PKcs and Ku, in our hands, ATM did not bind to either single-stranded DNA-cellulose or double-stranded DNA-cellulose. ATM from the flow-through fractions of the DNA-cellulose column was then applied to a 5-ml heparin HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in buffer B containing 100 mm KCl and 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20. This and all subsequent steps were performed on a Biologic Protein Purification system. ATM was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B containing 100 mmKCl and 0.02% Tween 20, to buffer B containing 1m KCl and 0.02% Tween 20 over 75 min. 1-ml fractions were collected. ATM eluted at approximately 200 mm KCl, whereas DNA-PKcs applied to the same column under the same conditions eluted at approximately 300–400 mm KCl. ATM-containing fractions from the heparin HiTrap column were pooled and dialyzed into buffer C (10 mmsodium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.2). The sample was applied to an Econo-Pac hydroxyapatite cartridge (Bio-Rad) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The column was washed with buffer C before applying a 32-ml linear gradient of increasing buffer D (400 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, pH 6.8). ATM eluted at approximately 20% buffer D, corresponding to approximately 90 mm sodium phosphate. Fractions containing ATM were pooled and dialyzed into buffer B containing 100 mm KCl and 0.02% Tween 20 and applied to Mono Q HR5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography column that had been equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B containing 100 mm KCl, 0.02% Tween 20, and MgCl2 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The magnesium concentration was increased at 1 mm/min. ATM eluted off the Mono Q column between 22 and 30 mm MgCl2. In preliminary preparations, ATM-containing fractions off the Mono Q column were applied to ATP-Sepharose, gamma-phosphate linked (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) that had been equilibrated in buffer E (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 60 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 150 mm NaCl and eluted with buffer E containing 1m NaCl. In subsequent preparations ATM from the Mono Q step was dialyzed into buffer F (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, without EDTA) containing 100 mm NaCl and applied to a 5-ml HiTrap chelation Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been loaded with nickel sulfate according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The column was equilibrated in buffer F containing 100 mm NaCl and after sample loading was washed sequentially with 15 ml of buffer F containing 100 mm NaCl followed by 15 ml of buffer F containing 500 mm NaCl. ATM was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer F containing 500 mm NaCl to buffer F containing 500 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole, and 150 mm ammonium chloride at 1.5 mm imidazole and ammonium chloride per minute. ATM-containing fractions were dialyzed and applied onto a Mono Q HR5/5 column that had been equilibrated in buffer B containing 100 KCl and 0.02% Tween-20 and eluted with a gradient of buffer B containing 1m KCl and 0.02% Tween 20. ATM-containing fractions were desalted and concentrated on a Centricon 100 microconcentrator (Amicon), washed with buffer B containing 100 mm KCl, 0.02% Tween 20, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. ATM kinase assays contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm cold ATP, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.25–0.5 μg of PHAS-I (Stratagene) or other substrate as indicated, and 2–4 ng of purified ATM. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, stopped with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% acrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained extensively, dried, and exposed to Fuji x-ray film with intensifying screen at −80 °C. DNA-PK was purified and assayed as described previously (9.Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 40.Chan D.W.

Sonicated calf thymus DNA was prepared as described previously (28.Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Irradiated pUC18 plasmid DNA was prepared as described previously (29.Weinfeld M. Chaudry M.A. D'Amours D. Pelletier J.D. Poirier G.G. Povirk L.F. Lees-Miller S.P. Radiat. Res. 1997; 148: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Single-stranded M13 circular plasmid DNA was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Amino acids 1–40 of p53 were expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein, purified over glutathione Sepharose, and dialyzed into buffer B containing 100 mm KCl before use. The amino-terminal 222 amino acids of human Chk2 were expressed in pGEX-5X-1 as a GST fusion, and protein was expressed and purified as for p53. A GST fusion protein expressing amino acids 58–222 of Chk2 (Chk2(D57N)) was created by deleting the first 174 base pairs from the Chk2 coding sequence. The protein was expressed and purified as above. A plasmid expressing His-tagged RPA32 and 14-kDa subunits was a kind gift from Dr. Aled Edwards (Ontario Cancer Institute). ATM and DNA-PKcs were analyzed on 8% SDS-acrylamide gels, as described previously (9.Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The antibodies used for detection of ATM were a rabbit polyclonal to the Rad3 domain of ATM, 4BA (22.Khanna K.K. Keating K.E. Kozlov S. Scott S. Gatei M. Hobson K. Taya Y. Gabrielli B. Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Lavin M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to amino acids 819–894 of ATM (Oncogene Scientific, ATM Ab-3, PC116) was also used. The p53 monoclonal antibody, DO1, was obtained from Oncogene Scientific. The rabbit polyclonal antibody to DNA-PKcs (DPK1) was as described previously (8.Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M.W. Day III., R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for serine 15 of p53 was as described previously (22.Khanna K.K. Keating K.E. Kozlov S. Scott S. Gatei M. Hobson K. Taya Y. Gabrielli B. Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Lavin M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence of ATM predicts a polypeptide of approximately 350 kDa with amino acid similarity to the PI-3 kinase family of proteins in the carboxyl-terminal domain. Attempts to express active ATM in baculovirus have not been very successful, probably because of the large size of the protein. To date, most of the information regarding the properties of ATM has been obtained from immunoprecipitates. Because immunoprecipitates may contain contaminating or interacting proteins and because antibody binding could interfere with the biochemical properties of the putative protein, we considered it important to purify the protein by biochemical means to characterize the biochemical properties of ATM fully. Here we have used conventional biochemical techniques to purify ATM from human placenta. We previously described a procedure to purify the related protein DNA-PK from the same source (9.Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and therefore used these procedures as a guide to purify ATM. Because immunoprecipitates of ATM phosphorylate p53 on serine 15 and because the same residue is phosphorylated by DNA-PK in vitro, it was important to separate DNA-PK from ATM completely during the purification procedure. The presence of ATM and DNA-PKcs was determined by Western blot at each stage of the purification, and fractions containing ATM were judiciously pooled. ATM was precipitated by 40% ammonium sulfate and bound to DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange matrix. DNA-PKcs and Ku proteins were also found in the same fractions. However, most of the DNA-PKcs and Ku was removed from ATM by binding to phenyl-Sepharose in buffer B containing 1m KCl. Under these conditions, most of the DNA-PKcs and Ku did not bind to the column, whereas ATM bound and was eluted with buffer B containing 50 mm salt. Partially purified ATM that was eluted from DEAE by magnesium-containing buffer did not bind to either double-stranded or single-stranded DNA-cellulose resins. In contrast, DNA-PKcs and Ku bound tightly to both resins, again providing a means for separation of DNA-PK from ATM. ATM and DNA-PKcs also eluted at different salt conditions on heparin HiTrap chromatography, again providing for maximum separation of the two proteins. In preliminary preparations, the final step of the purification of ATM was binding to ATP-Sepharose (gamma-phosphate linked). However, very little ATM was recovered from this column, and despite various elution strategies, the majority of the protein remained bound to the ATP-Sepharose beads. 2D. W. Chan, P. Douglas, and S. P. Lees-Miller, unpublished observations. Preliminary experiments indicated that ATM bound to chelation Sepharose resin that had been loaded with nickel, copper, or zinc but not with magnesium or manganese. 3W. Block and S. P. Lees-Miller, unpublished observations. Chelation Sepharose was therefore used in place of the ATP-Sepharose column. ATM-containing fractions were applied to a nickel-loaded HiTrap chelation Sepharose column and eluted with a gradient of ammonium chloride and imidazole in buffer B containing 500 mm NaCl. Two polypeptides of approximately 350 and 300 kDa were observed on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig.1 A, upper arrow andlower arrow, respectively). ATM was detected by Western blotting in fractions 3–21 (Fig. 1 B). The upper band in the Western blot (Fig. 1 B) comigrated with the upper band in the silver stained gel (Fig. 1 A, upper arrow). The lower band in the Western blot ran slightly ahead of the 200-kDa marker and is likely a breakdown product of ATM. The ATM-containing fractions were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate PHAS-I, a substrate that has been shown previously to be phosphorylated by immunoprecipitates of ATM in the presence of manganese (14.Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reis Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 15.Canman C.E.

Manganese-dependent phosphorylation of PHAS-I was observed in the ATM-containing fractions (Fig. 1 C). ATM-containing fractions were pooled and applied to a Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography column and eluted with a salt gradient. The ATM-containing fractions were concentrated and desalted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The final yield of ATM was estimated by comparison with known amounts of DNA-PKcs on silver-stained gels (Fig. 1 D). The major band in the sample migrated at 350 kDa, coincident with ATM in Western blots. The polypeptide at approximately 300 kDa comigrated with the ATM breakdown product on Western blot. We estimate that approximately 2 μg of highly purified ATM was obtained from one placenta (TableI). In contrast, up to 500 μg of DNA-PKcs and 1 mg of Ku70/80 heterodimer could be purified from the same amount of starting material, suggesting that ATM is present in far less abundance than DNA-PKcs in human tissues. In preliminary studies, we examined rat liver and bovine testis as potential sources of ATM; however, poor antibody recognition and/or low abundance made purification of ATM from non-human sources impractical. 4W.

The highly purified ATM fraction was next assayed for its ability to phosphorylate a number of protein substrates in the presence of either magnesium or manganese as metal ion. ATM activity was also assayed in the presence of the PI-3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Because the kinase activity of the related protein, DNA-PKcs, is modulated by DNA and the Ku70/80 heterodimer, ATM was also assayed in the presence of both sonicated calf thymus DNA and Ku. Phosphorylation of PHAS-I was completely dependent on the presence of manganese (Fig.2 A) and was inhibited by wortmannin (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) with an IC50 of approximately 100 nm (data not shown).

Biophysical analyses have revealed the presence of both high mannose and complex-type N-glycans in murine zona pellucida. The predominant high mannose-type glycan had the composition Man5GlcNAc2, but larger oligosaccharides of this type were also detected. Biantennary, triantennary, and tetraantennary complex-type N-glycans were found to be terminated with the following antennae: Galβ1–4GlcNAc, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc, NeuGcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc, the Sda antigen (NeuAcα2–3[GalNAcβ1–4]Galβ1–4GlcNAc, NeuGcα2–3[GalNAcβ1–4]Galβ1–4GlcNAc), and terminal GlcNAc. Polylactosamine-type sequence was also detected on a subset of the antennae. Analysis of the O-glycans indicated that the majority were core 2-type (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6[Galβ1–3]GalNAc). The β1–6-linked branches attached to these O-glycans were terminated with the same sequences as the N-glycans, except for terminal GlcNAc. Glycans bearing Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6 branches have previously been suggested to mediate initial murine gamete binding. Oligosaccharides terminated with GalNAcβ1–4Gal have been implicated in the secondary binding interaction that occurs following the acrosome reaction.

Murine sperm begin this process by binding to the specialized extracellular matrix of the egg known as the mZP1 (1.Wassarman P.M. Development. 1990; 108: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This matrix has been shown to be composed of three major glycoproteins (designated mZP1, mZP2, and mZP3) (2.Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 185-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence to suggest that binding occurs via the interaction of mZP3-associated glycans with lectin-like proteins on the sperm surface (3.Florman H.M. Bechtol K.B. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1984; 106: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 4.Florman H.M. Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) that in turn induce a signal transduction event known as the acrosome reaction (5.Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1983; 95: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). During this reaction, the plasma membrane of the sperm fuses with the outer membrane of a lysosome-like organelle known as the acrosome lying just beneath the surface of the sperm. The resulting membrane complex then blebs off to expose the inner acrosomal membrane. In the mouse model, this inner acrosomal membrane then undergoes secondary binding to mZP2. Sperm move through the mZP and fuse with the egg, thus completing the process of fertilization. Initial studies performed by Wassarman and co-workers (3.Florman H.M. Bechtol K.B. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1984; 106: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) indicate that either Pronase glycopeptides (3.Florman H.M. Bechtol K.B. Wassarman P.M. Dev.

Several major models for the initial murine gamete binding interaction have subsequently been proposed that are based upon specific carbohydrate recognition (6.Shur B.D. Hall N.G. J.

A recent study involving recombinant mZP3 synthesized in murine F9 embryonal carcinoma cells suggests that vicinal presentation of O-linked oligosaccharides within a specific region of mZP3 is necessary for initial sperm-egg binding (10.Chen J. Litscher E.S. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6193-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). mZP2 has been proposed to be the glycoprotein that mediates the secondary binding interaction involving binding to the inner acrosomal membrane (11.Bleil J.D. Greve J.M. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This binding event has also been postulated to rely upon carbohydrate-mediated interactions (12.Cahova M. Draber P. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1992; 21: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of mZP2 and mZP3-associated glycans has previously been performed using radioactive (13.Nagdas S.K. Araki Y. Chayko C.A. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Tulsiani D.R. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and fluorescent (14.Noguchi S. Nakano M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1158: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) detection methods. However, precise compositional and linkage data related to these oligosaccharides could not be obtained by employing such techniques. The present study was undertaken to obtain this information using high sensitivity mass spectrometric techniques. We report evidence for the presence of the Sda antigen in both theN- and O-linked oligosaccharides derived from murine ZP. The O-glycans detected in this analysis are primarily of the core 2 glycan type. Potential structure-function relationships emerging from this new structural information will be discussed in depth. The method that was employed for zona purification was a modification of an existing procedure kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Bleil. 2J. Bleil, personal communication. Flash-frozen mouse ovaries were obtained from Harlan Bioproducts for Science (Indianapolis, IN) and stored at −80 °C until processed. The total number of ovaries used in this study was 4,000, processed in batches of 40–50 ovaries each. Each batch was thawed and suspended in 6 ml of ice-cold triethylamine-NaCl buffer (25 mm triethylamine, pH 8.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3). Turkey egg white trypsin inhibitor, DNase I, and hyaluronidase (Sigma) were added to this solution to give final concentrations of 1, 0.1, and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. The solution was homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer until the ovaries were particulate. The mixture was adjusted to 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 by the addition of a 20% solution of this detergent in triethylamine-NaCl buffer. The solution was treated briefly with the Polytron homogenizer and then transferred to a Dounce homogenizer. The solution was further homogenized until liquified and adjusted to a 1% concentration of deoxycholate by the addition of a 20% solution of this detergent in triethylamine-NaCl buffer. The solution was further homogenized until the mixture became opalescent. 3.8 mls of 90% Percoll in triethylamine-NaCl buffer was added to a 10-ml sealable Ultracentrifuge tube. The homogenate was carefully layered on the Percoll solution without mixing. A solution of 35% Percoll in triethylamine-NaCl buffer was carefully layered on top of the homogenate. The tube was centrifuged in Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 19,000 rpm for 60 min at 18 °C. An identical sham tube containing the same solutions was prepared and supplemented with Percoll gradient indicator beads. The length and/or the speed of the run was adjusted so that the top blue bands of beads (specific gravity = 1.018) migrated at least 2/3 of the way to the top of the gradient. The position of the blue beads matched the migration of the zonae in the Percoll gradient. The zonae (4,000–5,000) were carefully removed with a syringe in a volume of roughly 0.5 ml. A small aliquot (5–10 μl) of each preparation was subjected to visual inspection under an Olympus phase contrast microscope to confirm the presence of zonae. The purity of the preparation was also confirmed using the same criteria established in the original isolation procedure published by Bleil and Wassarman (2.Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 185-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The purified zona preparation was transferred to a 15-ml centrifuge tube that was adjusted to a volume of 13 ml with phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.02% NaN3). After gentle mixing, the solution was centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min to pellet the zonae. This step had to be repeated 12 more times to remove all residual detergent that could interfere with the biophysical analysis of the zona glycans. The zonae were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −20 °C until subjected to further analysis. Suspensions of murine ZP were centrifuged at 2600 × g for 30 min to precipitate this extracellular matrix. The ZP pellet was resuspended in 800 μl of 50 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 8.5. This ZP suspension was digested with 20 μg of trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4, Sigma) for 5 h at 37 °C. 20 μg of trypsin was added, and the digestion was allowed to proceed at 37 οC for 16 h. The sample was placed in boiling water for 2 min to terminate the reaction and lyophilized. The tryptic digest was dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 8.5, and incubated with PNGase F (EC 3.5.1.52, Roche) at 37 °C overnight to release N-linked oligosaccharides. The products were lyophilized and subjected to reverse phase chromatography on a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge exactly as described previously (15.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar) to separate released oligosaccharides from peptides andO-glycopeptides. The 20% and 40% 1-propanol Sep-Pak fractions obtained from the purification of the PNGase F digestion were dissolved in 200 μl of a solution of sodium borohydride (10 mg/ml) in 0.05 m NaOH and incubated at 45 °C for 16 h. The reactions were terminated by the addition of glacial acetic acid. Released O-glycans were purified by Dowex as described previously (15.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Permethylation was performed using the sodium hydroxide/methyl iodide procedure exactly as established previously (15.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). The permethylated N- andO-glycans were purified by Sep-Pak chromatography using an established method (15.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Preparation of partially methylated alditol acetates was performed as described (16.Albersheim P. Nevins D.J. English P.D. Karr A. Carbohydr. Res. 1967; 5: 340-345Crossref Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). The purified N-glycans were subjected to digestion with specific glycosidases to discern relevant structural features. Digestion with endo-β-galactosidase from Bacteroides fragilis (EC 3.2.1.103, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was performed with 10 milliunits of enzyme in 200 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, for 24 h at 37 °C. Terminal Galα1–3Gal sequences were hydrolyzed by treatment with 10 milliunits of α-galactosidase from green coffee beans (EC 3.2.1.22, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 200 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, for 24 h at 37 °C. Jack bean α-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (0.5 units) digestion was performed under conditions identical to those used for endo-β-galactosidase digestion. The α-sialidase fromArthrobacter ureafaciens (EC 3.2.1.18, Glyko, Inc.) (0.2 units) was incubated with the glycans in 200 μl of 100 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 48 h. Digestion withStreptomyces plicatus β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (recombinant fusion protein, New England BioLabs) was performed with 50 units of enzyme in 200 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5, at 37 °C for 24 h. FAB mass spectra of permethylated oligosaccharides were acquired using a ZAB-2S.E.-2FPD double-focusing mass spectrometer fitted with a cesium ion gun operating at 30 kV. Data analysis was performed using VG Analytical Opus®software. Solvent and matrices were as described previously (15.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). GC-MS analysis was performed on a Fisons Instruments MD800 machine. Separation was achieved using an RTX-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, Restek Corp). Partially methylated alditol acetates were dissolved in hexanes and loaded directly onto the column at 65 °C. The column was held at 65 °C for 1 min and then increased to 290 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min. Murine ZP were isolated by a modification of an original procedure (2.Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 185-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) provided to us by Dr. Jeffrey Bleil (Scripts Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Visual analysis of the preparation indicated the presence of individual zonae exactly as was observed in the original isolation. SDS-gel electrophoresis of the isolated ZP using the same conditions employed in this earlier study indicated the presence of three major diffuse bands consistent with molecular weights of mZP1, mZP2, and mZP3 proposed earlier (2.Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 185-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Based on these criteria, the isolated zonae were subjected to carbohydrate structural analysis. Purified ZP were digested with trypsin and incubated with PNGase F to releaseN-glycans. The oligosaccharides were separated from peptides and glycopeptides via reverse phase chromatography on a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge. The N-glycans were permethylated and separated from other reactants and products by a second step of Sep-Pak reverse phase purification (15.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). The permethylated glycans were subjected to FAB-MS analysis using an established method (15.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). The data indicated the presence of a range ofN-glycans of both the high mannose and complex-types (Fig.1, TableI). The following structural features were evident. (i) The most abundant component was the high mannose structure Hex5HexNAc2 indicated by the molecular ion at m/z 1580. Lower levels of larger high mannose-type glycans (Hex6–9HexNAc2) were also indicated by the presence of molecular ions atm/z 1784, 1988, 2192, and 2396 (ii) Complex-type biantennary N-glycans decorated with fucose andN-acetylneuraminic acid were also found (Hex5HexNAc4Fuc at m/z2244; NeuAcHex5HexNAc4 atm/z 2432, NeuAc2Hex5HexNAc4Fuc atm/z 2966). (iii) Some of these biantennary glycans contain N-glycolylneuraminic acid, as indicated by signals consistent with NeuGcHex5HexNAc4(m/z 2462), NeuGcHex5HexNAc4Fuc (m/z2636), and NeuGc2Hex5HexNAc4Fuc (m/z 3027). The presence ofN-glycolylneuraminic acid was also confirmed by the detection of A-type fragment ions at m/z 855 (NeuGcHexHexNAc+) and m/z 406 (NeuGc+). (iv) Both N-acetylneuraminic acid andN-glycolylneuraminic acid can be located on the sameN-glycan, as indicated by the molecular ion atm/z 2996, consistent with NeuAcNeuGcHex5HexNAc4. (v) Minor amounts of lactosamine repeats are present, as indicated by the ion atm/z 913 (Hex2HexNAc2+). (vi) A fragment ion at m/z 668 (Hex2HexNAc+) is consistent with the presence of terminal Galα1–3Gal. (vii) The presence of A-type ions at m/z 1070 andm/z 1100 suggest unusual terminal epitopes with the compositions NeuAcHexHexNAc2+ and NeuGcHexHexNAc2+, respectively.Table IAssignments of FAB-MS peaks observed for the molecular and fragment ions of the permethylated N-glycans released from murine zona pellucidaSignalAssignmentm/zHigh mass region 1580Hex5HexNAc2 + Na+ 1784Hex6HexNAc2 + Na+ 1836Hex3HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 1988Hex7HexNAc2 + Na+ 2040Hex4HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2081Hex3HexNAc5Fuc + Na+ 2192Hex8HexNAc2 + Na+ 2244Hex5HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2285Hex4HexNAc5Fuc + Na+ 2396Hex9HexNAc2 + Na+ 2432NeuAcHex5HexNAc4 + Na+ 2462NeuGcHex5HexNAc4 + Na+ 2490Hex5HexNAc5Fuc + Na+ 2606NeuAcHex5HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2636NeuGcHex5HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2810NeuAcHex6HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2840NeuGcHex6HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2852NeuGc2Hex5HexNAc4 + Na+ 2966NeuAc2Hex5HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2996NeuAcNeuGcHex5HexNAc4 + Na+ 3027NeuGc2Hex5HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 3243NeuAc2Hex6HexNAc5 + Na+ 3417NeuAc2Hex6HexNAc5Fuc + Na+ 3808NeuAc2NeuGcHex6HexNAc5Fuc + Na+Low mass region 260HexNAc+ 344Loss of methanol from m/z 376 374Loss of methanol from m/z 406 376NeuAc+ 406NeuGc+ 432Loss of methanol fromm/z 464 464HexHexNAc+ 505HexNAc2+ 636Loss of methanol from m/z 668 668Hex2HexNAc+ 793Loss of methanol from m/z 825 823Loss of methanol from m/z 855 825NeuAcHexHexNAc+ 855NeuGcHexHexNAc+ 913Hex2HexNAc2+ 1070NeuAcHexHexNAc2+ 1100NeuGcHexHexNAc2+ Open table in a new tab Permethylated N-glycans were acid-hydrolyzed, deuteroreduced, and peracetylated. The resulting partially methylated alditol acetates were analyzed by GC-MS (TableII). Notable features of the methylation analysis were the presence of 3,4-disubstituted galactose and terminalN-acetylgalactosamine. The detection of 2 (major)-, 2,4 (minor)-, and 2,6 (minor)-linked mannose indicated that tri- and tetraantennary structures were present in addition to the major biantennary structures. Bisected-type glycan structures also exist, as shown by the presence of 3,4,6-linked mannose, albeit as very minor components.Table IIGC-MS analysis of the partially methylated alditol acetates obtained from the N-glycans of murine zona pellucidaElution timeCharacteristic fragment ionsAssignmentmin17.23115, 118, 131, 175Terminal fucose18.83102, 118, 129, 145, 161, 162, 205Terminal mannose19.13aSignals increased after treatment ofN-glycans with A. ureafaciens sialidase.102, 118, 129, 145, 161, 162, 205Terminal galactose20.05129, 139, 161, 1902-Linked mannose20.36bSignals reduced or absent after treatment ofN-glycans.118, 129, 161, 2343-Linked galactose20.93bSignals reduced or absent after treatment ofN-glycans.99, 102, 118, 129, 161, 162, 189, 2336-Linked galactose21.07bSignals reduced or absent after treatment ofN-glycans.118, 129, 143, 185, 203, 232, 3053,4-Linked galactose21.32130, 190, 2332,4-Linked mannose21.75129, 130, 189, 1902,6-Linked mannose21.93118, 129, 189, 2343,6-Linked mannose22.13118, 129, 189, 2343,6-Linked galactose22.40118, 3333,4,6-Linked mannose22.97117, 159, 203, 205Terminal GlcNAc23.45117, 159, 203, 205Terminal GalNAc23.89117, 159, 2334-Linked GlcNAc25.29117, 159, 2614,6-Linked GlcNAca Signals increased after treatment ofN-glycans with A. ureafaciens sialidase.b Signals reduced or absent after treatment ofN-glycans. Open table in a new tab To analyze the terminal structures of the minor polylactosamine-containing N-glycans, PNGase F-releasedN-linked oligosaccharides were digested with endo-β-galactosidase. After digestion, a fraction of the reaction products was permethylated, separated from contaminants by reverse phase separation on a Sep-Pak cartridge, and analyzed by FAB-MS. The data (Fig. 2, TableIII) indicate the presence of several components not observed before digestion. These components represent the antennae of complex N-glycans bearing a range of different terminal structures. The high mannose-type structures and shorter complex structures were unaffected by this enzyme treatment. Because of the specificity of the enzyme, the oligosaccharides released from the nonreducing termini of polylactosamine-containing antennae all have a reducing Gal residue. Thus, significant signals were observed atm/z 926 (Hex2HexNAc1-Gal), which likely represents structures terminating in α-linked galactose,m/z 1328 (NeuAcHex1HexNAc2-Gal), and itsN-glycolylneuraminic acid counterpart atm/z 1358 (NeuGcHex1HexNAc2-Gal). The large signal atm/z 518 represents the disaccharide GlcNAc-Gal, the major product expected after endo-β-galactosidase of polylactosamine-type chains.Table IIIAssignments of the molecular ions observed in the FAB mass spectra of murine zona pellucida N-glycans following digestion with endo-β-galactosidase and permethylationSignalAssignmentm/z35% acetonitrile fraction 518HexNAcHex + Na+ 700Hex2HexNAc + H+ 722Hex2HexNAc + Na+ 904Hex3HexNAc + H+ 926Hex3HexNAc + Na+ 1083NeuAcHex2HexNAc + Na+ 1113NeuGcHex2HexNAc + Na+ 1306NeuAcHex2HexNAc2 + H+ 1328NeuAcHex2HexNAc2 + Na+ 1336NeuGcHex2HexNAc2 + H+ 1358NeuGcHex2HexNAc2 + Na+50% acetonitrile fraction 1580Hex5HexNAc2 + Na+ 1784Hex6HexNAc2 + Na+ 1988Hex7HexNAc2 + Na+ 2040Hex4HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2081Hex3HexNAc5Fuc + Na+ 2192Hex8HexNAc2 + Na+ 2244Hex5HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2285Hex4HexNAc5Fuc + Na+ 2396Hex9HexNAc2 + Na+ 2490Hex5HexNAc5Fuc + Na+ 2531Hex4HexNAc6Fuc + Na+ 2606NeuAcHex5HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2636NeuGcHex5HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2735Hex5HexNAc6Fuc + Na+ 2852NeuGc2Hex5HexNAc4 + Na+ 2922NeuGcHex4HexNAc6Fuc + Na+ 3126NeuGcHex5HexNAc6Fuc + Na+ 3517NeuGc2Hex5HexNAc6Fuc + Na+ Open table in a new tab The products of endo-β-galactosidase digestion were further digested with α-galactosidase, permethylated, and analyzed by FAB-MS. The signal at m/z 926 (Fig. 2) was absent after α-galactosidase digestion (data not shown), demonstrating that it contained α-linked galactose. Another aliquot of the endo-β-galactosidase-treatedN-glycans was digested with α-mannosidase. The products of the digestion were analyzed by FAB-MS after permethylation. All signals corresponding to the high mannose-type sequences were absent, but those of the complex structures were still detected (Fig.3). This result is consistent with the presence of high mannose-type sequences in this mixture. The A-type fragment ions atm/z 1070 and m/z 1100 observed in the N-glycan mapping experiment have compositions consistent with the Sda determinant (GalNAcβ1–4(NeuAcα2–3)Galβ14GlcNAc) and itsN-glycolylneuraminic acid counterpart. In addition, the results of the linkage analysis and endo-β-galactosidase experiments support the presence of this epitope (see above). Further information on the structures of these epitopes was obtained from the following experiments. FAB-MS of the permethylated reaction products of α-sialidase digestion of the PNGase F-released murine ZPN-glycans showed the release of bothN-acetylneuraminic acid and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Fig. 4, TableIV). Thus the fragment ions attributable to NeuAc-containing structures originally detected in the undigestedN-glycans at m/z 376,m/z 825, and m/z 1070 were absent after digestion. The NeuGc-containing structures showed differing susceptibilities to the sialidase. The linear structure NeuGcHexHexNAc+ was fully digested as shown by the absence of m/z 855, but the potentially branched sequence, NeuGc[HexNAc]HexHexNAc, which is detected as an A-type ion at m/z 1100, was still present after digestion. A new fragment ion was present at m/z 709, corresponding to HexHexNAc2+, the expected ion produced after the removal of N-acetylneuraminic orN-glycolylneuraminic acid from the Sdadeterminant. The small signal present at m/z 1362 demonstrated the presence of low levels of polylactosamine repeats. This signal was not observed before sialidase digestion, demonstrating that the polylactosamine repeats are capped withN-acetylneuraminic acid or N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Linkage analysis of the products of digestion confirmed the reduction in abundance of 3,4-linked galactose and an increase in 4-linked galactose.Table IVAssignment of the molecular and fragment ions observed in the FAB mass spectrum of murine zona pellucida N-glycans following digestion with α-sialidase and permethylationSignalAssignmentm/zHigh mass region 1558Hex5HexNAc2 + H+ 1580Hex5HexNAc2 + Na+ 1762Hex6HexNAc2 + H+ 1784Hex6HexNAc2 + Na+ 1966Hex7HexNAc2 + H+ 1988Hex7HexNAc2 + Na+ 2040Hex4HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2070Hex5HexNAc4 + Na+ 2192Hex8HexNAc2 + Na+ 2222Hex5HexNAc4Fuc + H+ 2244Hex5HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2285Hex4HexNAc5Fuc + Na+ 2396Hex9HexNAc2 + Na+ 2448Hex6HexNAc4Fuc + Na+ 2490Hex5HexNAc5Fuc + Na+ 2694Hex6HexNAc5Fuc + Na+ 3143Hex7HexNAc6Fuc + Na+ 3592Hex8HexNAc7Fuc + Na+Low mass region 432Loss of methanol from m/z 464 464HexHexNAc+ 505HexNAc2+ 636Loss of methanol from m/z 668 668Hex2HexNAc+ 677Loss of methanol from m/z 709 709HexHexNAc2+ 881Loss of methanol from m/z 913 913Hex2HexNAc2+ 1100NeuGcHexHexNAc2+ 1362Hex3HexNAc3+ Open table in a new tab To provide further evidence for the putative Sda structure, an aliquot of the endo-β-galactosidase-treated murine ZPN-glycans was digested with α-sialidase. A portion of this reaction mixture was permethylated and analyzed by FAB-MS (Fig.5 a). The data indicated thatN-acetylneuraminic acid had been removed (loss ofm/z 1328), the signal atm/z 1358 (NeuGcHex1HexNAc2-Gal) had been reduced in intensity, and a new signal had appeared at m/z967, corresponding to Hex1HexNAc2-Gal+Na+. The remainder of the α-sialidase-treated fraction was further digested with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. An aliquot was removed for permethylation and FAB-MS analysis (Fig. 5 b). The data showed significant reduction of the signal atm/z 967 (Hex1HexNAc2-Gal+Na+) and the loss of the signal at 518 (GlcNAc-Gal+Na+). The new minor signal at m/z 1171 (Hex3HexNAc2+Na+) is due to the loss of N-acetylglucosamine from truncated complex structures. To confirm that N-acetylgalactosamine was removed, linkage analysis was performed on the α-sialidase-treatedN-glycans and on the α-sialidase plus β-N-acetylhexosaminidase-treated glycans. Comparison of the data indicated that terminal N-acetylgalactosamine was present before β-N-acetylhexosaminidase digestion but was absent afterward. N-Acetylglucosamine continued to be detected after β-N-acetylhexosaminidase digestion, data that are consistent with the assignments of structures present in the FAB-MS spectrum after this full range of enzyme digests. Taken together, the above data provide convincing evidence for the presence of the Sda epitope and its N-glycolylneuraminic acid counterpart on polylactosamine antennae of complex-typeN-glycans in the murine ZP. Taking into account all the above data, the major N-glycans in the murine ZP preparation are assigned the structures in Fig.6. Murine ZP were digested with trypsin and subjected to N-glycanase digestion. After separation of released N-glycans from peptides and glycopeptides on a Sep Pak C18 cartridge, the glycopeptides eluting in 20% and 40% n-propanol were subjected to reductive elimination, Dowex purification, borate removal, permethylation, reverse phase separation, and FAB-MS analysis. The data obtained (Fig.7, Table V) were consistent with the following structural assignments: (i) the presence of a range of reduced O-glycans, the majority of which are composed of from 3 to 6 monosaccharide residues; (ii) pairs of molecular ions separated by 30 mass units whose compositions are consistent with the presence of both N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-glycoly"
https://openalex.org/W1988807053,"Recent evidence indicates that nerve growth factor (NGF) produces its effects through signaling contributions from both TrkA and the p75 receptor. In contrast to its trophic actions through TrkA, NGF binding to p75 has been shown to activate programmed cell death through a mechanism involving the stress kinase JNK. However, this receptor also activates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), the role of which has yet to be determined. We investigated the function of p75-mediated NF-κB stimulation in regulating cell survival in the rat schwannoma cell line RN22, which expresses p75, but not TrkA. Gel shift assays demonstrated activation of NF-κB in response to NGF within 30 min and lasting at least 4 h. NGF also stimulated JNK in the cells (detected by in vitro kinase assays) with a similar time course. Preventing activation of NF-κB with the specific inhibitor SN50 resulted in NGF-induced cell loss. Similarly, transfection of the cells with a mutant form of the endogenous NF-κB inhibitor (IκBαΔN), which cannot be degraded and therefore remains bound to NF-κB, preventing its activation, resulted in a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells following NGF treatment. These results suggest that NGF activation of NF-κB through the p75 receptor promotes survival, counterbalancing the pro-apoptotic signal.

Barde Y.A. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to their well established pro-survival activity, a number of recent studies have suggested that NGF and other members of the neurotrophin family can promote programmed cell death in specific cell types.Although the survival activity of the neurotrophins has been shown to be mediated primarily by the Trk proteins, a family of tyrosine kinase receptors, the p75 receptor has been linked to neurotrophin-induced apoptosis. Sequence homology between p75 and members of the TNF receptor superfamily has led to speculation that this NGF receptor may signal analogously, including stimulation of cell death.

Landreth G.E. Estus S. Mattson M.P. Estus S. Rangnekar V.M. Programmed Cell Death: Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1999Google Scholar). Furthermore, a specific inhibitor of this kinase protected the oligodendrocytes from the effects of NGF (3.Yoon S.O. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

This led to the finding that in cultured Schwann cells expressing p75, but not TrkA, NGF treatment activated NF-κB (13.Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm- Matthaei R.

Currently, the role of NF-κB activation in the nervous system is not known; it has been suggested to have both pro-apoptotic (16.Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A. Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and anti-apoptotic (17.Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10356-10365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) properties, depending on the cell type. Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that activation of NF-κB by the TNF receptor promotes survival in lymphoid cells and fibroblasts (19.Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 20.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Thus, the TNF receptor activates a bifurcating pathway, with one component being anti-apoptotic through the activation of NF-κB and the other leading to induction of apoptosis. A similar dichotomous signal may originate from the p75 neurotrophin receptor. This may explain how p75 can facilitate a TrkA pro-survival signal when coexpressed in neurons (23.Chao M. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chittka A. Kong H. Yoon S.O. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but also induce apoptosis when activated independently.Here we have investigated the role of NGF activation of NF-κB in the balance between cell survival and death in response to p75 signaling. To delineate p75 signaling independent of TrkA, we used a rat schwannoma cell line (RN22) expressing p75, but not TrkA. Inhibition of NF-κB activity resulted in apoptosis in response to NGF, suggesting that this transcription factor provides a survival signal counterbalancing the cell death signal activated by p75.DISCUSSIONRecently, several reports have suggested that the p75 neurotrophin receptor can induce programmed cell death in a variety of neuronal and glial cell types under specific conditions (see above and reviewed in Ref. 23.Chao M. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chittka A. Kong H. Yoon S.O. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the majority of cells expressing this receptor do not undergo apoptosis in response to NGF. p75 is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily that was initially classified based on sequence homology in its extracellular domain and more recently by a region in its intracellular domain with both sequence homology as well as structural characteristics similar to the death domain motif described for other members of this family (27.Liepinsh E. Ilag L.L. Otting G. Ibañez C.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The death domain in the TNF receptor acquired its nomenclature based on its necessity for the well established ability of TNF to induce apoptosis. However, the TNF receptor also activates NF-κB, and this signal was demonstrated to functionally oppose the apoptotic signal since inhibiting its activation facilitated or enhanced TNF-induced death (19.Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 20.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 21.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

Hence, the TNF receptor activates a bifurcating signal pathway, resulting in both initiation of caspase-dependent cell death and transcriptional activation of pro-survival genes. NGF has also been shown to activate the transcription factor NF-κB in both neuronal cells (4.Kuner P. Hertel C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18.Maggirwar S.B. Sarmiere P.D. Dewhurst S. Freeman R.S. J.

Carter B. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm- Matthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.A.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the biological role of this signal is not known. Therefore, we hypothesized that the activation of NF-κB by NGF binding to p75 could be anti-apoptotic, in opposition to the p75 pro-death signal.The physiological function of NF-κB in the nervous system is not well understood. In specific regions of the cortex and hippocampus, constitutive NF-κB activity has been observed; and in several cell culture systems, the activation of NF-κB has been shown to promote neuronal survival (17.Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 18.Maggirwar S.B. Sarmiere P.D. Dewhurst S. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10356-10365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Taglialatela G. Robinson R. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast, this transcription factor has also been suggested to be pro-apoptotic. It was shown to be induced following seizure (30.Rong Y. Baudry M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or ischemic injury (16.Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A. Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the neuronal loss following a focal ischemic injury was significantly reduced in mice lacking the p50 subunit of NF-κB (16.Schneider A. Martin-Villalba A. Weih F. Vogel J. Wirth T. Schwaninger M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that the effects observed in vivo are a result of activation of NF-κB in microglia, which can release neurotoxins (31.Kim W.K. Ko K.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains to be determined whether activation of this transcription factor is neuroprotective or lethal.Here we have shown that NGF binding to p75 activates a dual signaling pathway in schwannoma cells, stimulating both NF-κB (Fig. 2) and JNK (Fig. 5). Similar to what has been reported for the TNF receptor, the subunits of NF-κB activated by p75 include p65 and p50. Treatment of the cells with the specific NF-κB inhibitors SN50 and IκBΔN had no significant effect on cell survival alone and did not activate JNK, but did render the cells sensitive to NGF killing. These findings suggest that NGF activation of NF-κB can serve as an anti-apoptotic signal. It has been demonstrated that TNF activation of NF-κB can up-regulate the anti-apoptotic genes c-IAP1and c-IAP2 (26.Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 94: 10057-10062Crossref Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 32.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which p75 activation of NF-κB promotes survival remains to be determined.In neurons, the p75 receptor is usually expressed with one of the Trk proteins, the tyrosine kinase neurotrophin receptors, which are well established as transducers of survival signals. Expression of p75 has been shown to facilitate Trk signaling (23.Chao M. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chittka A. Kong H. Yoon S.O. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), suggesting that these receptors can collaborate to promote survival. Supporting this notion, it was demonstrated in terminally differentiated oligodendrocytes that although activation of p75 alone promoted apoptosis, when TrkA was coexpressed, the death signal was suppressed. The presence of TrkA in the oligodendrocytes suppressed the activation of JNK by p75, but NGF remained capable of activating NF-κB (3.Yoon S.O. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured sympathetic neurons and the neural cell line PC12, which both coexpress Trk and p75, NGF has been shown to stimulate NF-κB (18.Maggirwar S.B. Sarmiere P.D. Dewhurst S. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10356-10365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Wood J.N. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 192: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibiting the activation of NF-κB in PC12 cells (29.Taglialatela G. Robinson R. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or in sympathetic neurons (18.Maggirwar S.B. Sarmiere P.D. Dewhurst S. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10356-10365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in apoptosis, suggesting NF-κB activity is anti-apoptotic. However, since these cells express both NGF receptors, the mechanism by which NGF stimulates NF-κB in neural cells remains to be determined.Although NGF binding to Trk activates neuronal survival pathways such as the kinase Akt, the activation of NF-κB may work in concert under normal conditions and become more essential during stress conditions. It is interesting to consider the observation of Cheng and Mattson (33.Cheng B. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) in this context. These authors observed that NGF could protect hippocampal neurons from death induced by glucose deprivation. These neurons do not express TrkA, the NGF tyrosine kinase receptor, but do express high levels of p75 under conditions of stress such as when dissociated in culture. 2H. Highfield and B. D. Carter, unpublished observations. Thus, one may speculate that NGF is protecting these neurons from glucose deprivation by activating NF-κB, although how the death signal of p75 is repressed is not clear.A physiological role for p75 activation of NF-κB in stress or injury situations is particularly relevant in Schwann cells. Under normal conditions in adult animals, Schwann cells do not express appreciable levels of p75. However, in culture or following nerve injury, p75 expression is strongly increased in the distal Schwann cells (34.Taniuchi M. Clark H.B. Johnson Jr., E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4094-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 35.Heumann R. Lindholm D. Bandtlow C. Meyer M. Radeke M.J.M. Shooter E. Thoenen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8735-8739Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Interestingly, not only does p75 and NGF expression increase in peripheral nerves following an insult (35.Heumann R. Lindholm D. Bandtlow C. Meyer M. Radeke M.J.M. Shooter E. Thoenen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8735-8739Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), but recent findings suggest that NF-κB is activated in distal Schwann cells following sciatic nerve crush. 3S. Kanwal and B. D. Carter, unpublished observations. Following such an insult in adult animals, there is no Schwann cell apoptosis in the distal nerve stump (36.Grinspan J.B. Marchionni M.A. Reeves M. Coulaloglou M. Scherer S.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6107-6118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been suggested that mature Schwann cells possess an autocrine survival loop that prevents massive apoptosis following loss of axonal contact (37.Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. J. Anat. 1997; 191: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine if NGF activation of NF-κB could, in part, account for this survival. In contrast to adult nerves, during development, there is extensive apoptosis of promyelinating Schwann cells (36.Grinspan J.B. Marchionni M.A. Reeves M. Coulaloglou M. Scherer S.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6107-6118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells require contact with an axon for trophic support, and failure to make contact is the most likely explanation for the cell death. However, the promyelinating cells also express p75, which may play a role in facilitating their death. In support of this, Soilu-Hanninenet al. (7.Soilu-Hanninen M. Ekert P. Bucci T. Syroid D. Bartlett P.F. Kilpatrick T.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4828-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) measured cell death induced by trophic factor withdrawal in isolated Schwann cells from postnatal day 2 mouse pups, a time when many of the Schwann cells would be in the promyelinating stage. They observed that when these early Schwann cells were exposed to NGF, there was a significant increase in apoptosis, which did not occur in p75−/− mice. Therefore, one can envision a role for the dual signaling of p75 in regulating the number of Schwann cells such that cells in the adult distal nerve stump, deprived of trophic support from the axon, will survive via activation of NF-κB through NGF binding to p75. In contrast, during development, the promyelinating cells that do not contact their axon may be susceptible to NGF-induced apoptosis via p75. How the NF-κB and cell death pathways are regulated under such conditions remains to be determined.In summary, our results provide evidence that NGF activation of p75 in RN22 cells leads to a bifurcating signal pathway, resulting in activation of both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic branches. Blocking NF-κB activation resulted in the cells becoming susceptible to p75-induced cell death in response to NGF. Thus, p75-activated NF-κB may act as a survival factor in Schwann cells, and this may serve a physiological role in response to nerve injury.Note Added in ProofWhile this manuscript was under review, similar findings were reported in sensory neurons (39.Hamanoue M. Middleton G. Wyatt S. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Davies A.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Neuronal survival during vertebrate development is dependent on a family of trophic factors referred to as the neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF),1brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3–6 (1.Lewin G.R. Barde Y.A. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to their well established pro-survival activity, a number of recent studies have suggested that NGF and other members of the neurotrophin family can promote programmed cell death in specific cell types. Although the survival activity of the neurotrophins has been shown to be mediated primarily by the Trk proteins, a family of tyrosine kinase receptors, the p75 receptor has been linked to neurotrophin-induced apoptosis. Sequence homology between p75 and members of the TNF receptor superfamily has led to speculation that this NGF receptor may signal analogously, including stimulation of cell death. Recent findings by several groups have demonstrated that neurotrophin binding to p75 can induce programmed cell death in cultured rat oligodendrocytes (2.Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4828-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent in vivo data also support a role for p75-mediated apoptosis during the development of embryonic chick (8.Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and mouse (9.Frade J.M. Barde Y.A.

https://openalex.org/W2086659557,"Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 monomeric GTPases are well known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and phosphoinositide metabolism and have been implicated in hormone secretion in endocrine cells. Here, we examine their possible implication in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitters. Using subcellular fractionation procedures, we found that RhoA, RhoB, Rac1, and Cdc42 are present in rat brain synaptosomes; however, only Rac1 was associated with highly purified synaptic vesicles. To determine the synaptic function of these GTPases, toxins that impair Rho-related proteins were microinjected into Aplysia neurons. We used lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii, which inactivates Rac; toxin B from Clostridium difficile, which inactivates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42; and C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 from Escherichia coli, which mainly affect Rho. Analysis of the toxin effects on evoked acetylcholine release revealed that a member of the Rho family, most likely Rac1, was implicated in the control of neurotransmitter release. Strikingly, blockage of acetylcholine release by lethal toxin and toxin B could be completely removed in <1 s by high frequency stimulation of nerve terminals. Further characterization of the inhibitory action produced by lethal toxin suggests that Rac1 protein regulates a late step in Ca2+-dependent neuroexocytosis. Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 monomeric GTPases are well known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and phosphoinositide metabolism and have been implicated in hormone secretion in endocrine cells. Here, we examine their possible implication in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitters.

In mammals, Rho GTPases comprise Rho (A to H isoforms), Rac (Rac1 and Rac2 isoforms), Cdc42 (Cdc42Hs and G25K isoforms), and more distant members. Like other monomeric GTPases of the Ras family, Rho proteins act as molecular switches: upon receiving upstream signals, they are converted into an active GTP-bound form that is able to interact with downstream effectors. These comprise protein kinase N, Rho kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase, and the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (for review, see Ref. 1.Symons M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar).In fine, the activation of Rho-related GTPases leads mainly to a rearrangement of the actin-based cytoskeleton and/or to a regulation of phosphoinositide levels. Rho proteins have been implicated in a large variety of cellular functions, including chemotaxis, cell cycle progression, axonal guidance. and endocytosis (for review, see Refs. 1.Symons M.

Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release and hormone secretion are closely related mechanisms that involve proteins common to both neurons and secretory cells. For example, synaptobrevin, syntaxin, 25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein, synaptotagmin, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, and solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attached proteins act in concert to ensure docking and/or fusion in both dense-core granule and synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Consistent with the implication of Rab proteins in vesicle trafficking, the small GTPase Rab3 has been shown to regulate both neurotransmitter and hormone secretion (for review, see Refs. 4.Martin T.F Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5.Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 6.Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol.

On the other hand, despite the similarities between the release of the content of synaptic vesicles and large dense-core granules, several recent studies have revealed mechanistic differences between these two exocytotic processes (for review, see Refs. 7.Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 11.Edwards R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 883-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In endocrine cells, members of the Rho family have been proposed to regulate exocytosis. Indeed, Cdc42 and Rac control regulated secretion in pancreatic beta cells (12.Kowluru A. Li G. Rabaglia M.E. Segu V.B. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Metz S.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), basophilic leukemia cells (13.Prepens U. Just I. von Eichel-Streiber C. Aktories K. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In chromaffin cells, RhoA localized on secretory granules controls subplasmalemmal actin and exocytosis by regulating a granule-associated phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (15.Gasman S.

Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20564-20571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rho-like GTPases have been implicated in actin filament dynamics and organelle movement in growth cones (for review, see Ref. 17.Luo L. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The aim of our study was to probe the presence of Rho proteins in nerve terminals and to determine their possible implication in neurotransmitter release. We found that Rac1, RhoA, RhoB, and Cdc42 are present in nerve terminals, with Rac1 selectively associated with purified synaptic vesicles. The role played by these small GTPases in neurotransmission was addressed by monitoring acetylcholine (ACh)1 release from identified cholinergic neurons in the Aplysia buccal ganglion. The function of Rho-related GTPases was impaired by presynaptic microinjection of bacterial toxins known to selectively activate or inactivate subgroups of Rho proteins (for review, see Ref.18.Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that a Rho-related protein, most likely Rac1, plays a major role in neurotransmission by controlling a yet undefined Ca2+-dependent late step of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Lethal toxin (LT) from Clostridium sordellii strain IP82 was purified as described previously (19.Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 35-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant C3 exoenzyme was expressed in Escherichia colistrain Sure (Stratagene) from pMRP143, consisting of the DNA fragment coding for the mature C3 protein (20.Popoff M.R. Hauser D. Boquet P. Eklund M.W. Gill D.M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3673-3679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under the control of the iota toxin gene promoter in vector pJIR750 (21.Marvaud J.C. Gibert M. Inoue K. Fujinaga Y. Oguma K. Popoff M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After sonicating bacterial cells in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), the extract was clarified by centrifugation, treated with protamine sulfate (2 mg/ml; Merck) for 30 min at 40 °C, and centrifuged again. The supernatant was loaded onto a QAE-Sepharose A50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The flow-through containing the purified C3 enzyme showed a single band of 25 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), a 110-kDa protein toxin from pathogenic E. colistrains, was purified as described previously (22.Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 23.Fiorentini C. Fabbri A. Flatau G. Donelli G. Matarrese P. Lemichez E. Falzano L. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19532-19537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Stock solutions (20 μm) were prepared in 50 μm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm NaCl. A recombinant C-terminal 14.8–31.5 kDa peptide corresponding to the catalytic region of CNF1 was produced as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. It was purified according to a previously described procedure (24.Lemichez E. Flatau G. Bruzzone M. Boquet P. Gauthier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A stock solution (20 μm) was prepared in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing reduced glutathione (20 mm). All toxins were stored at −80 °C in 3–5-μl aliquots. The various buffers used for storage of the toxins had no effect on evoked ACh release. The biological activity of each batch of toxin was verified by the ability to induce morphological changes and cytoskeletal modifications (C3, ToxB, and LT: cell rounding and disruption of stress fibers; and CNF1: cell spreading and increase in stress fibers), visualized by staining of HeLa or Vero cells with fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin (22.Flatau G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The activity of C3 was further determined by its ability to induce [32P]ADP-ribosylation of membrane-bound RhoA present in purified chromaffin granule preparations (15.Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Hubert P. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16913-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of CNF1 on recombinant RhoA (22.Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) or chromaffin granule-associated RhoA (data not shown) was demonstrated by an increase in the apparent molecular mass of the molecule on SDS gels. Synaptic vesicles were prepared from rat brains according to Huttner et al. (26.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Briefly, 14 rat brains were placed in ice-cold buffered sucrose (320 mm sucrose and 4 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4)). From this point on, the material was kept at 4 °C. Cerebral cortices were dissected free of cerebellum, brainstem, and most of the midbrain and homogenized in the same buffer containing 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml pepstatin in a Teflon/glass homogenizer. The homogenate was then centrifuged for 10 min at 1100 × g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 15 min at 9200 ×g, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffered sucrose/brain and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,500 ×g. The resulting pellet (synaptosomes) was resuspended in buffered sucrose, diluted with 9 volumes of ice-cold H2O (hypotonic lysis of synaptosomes), and immediately homogenized. Protease inhibitors (pepstatin and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1m Hepes (pH 7.4) at a final concentration of 7.5 mm were added, and the homogenate was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 20 min at 25,500 × g. The pellet containing synaptosomal membranes (i.e. plasma membrane, mitochondria, and granules) was saved. The supernatant was centrifuged for 2 h at 48,000 rpm in a Ti-60 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The resulting supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g and saved (cytosol). The pellet (crude synaptic vesicles) was resuspended in 4 ml of 30 mm sucrose and 4 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), homogenized, passed five times back and forth through a 25-gauge needle, loaded on a continuous gradient of 50–800 mm sucrose in 4 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and centrifuged for 5 h at 26,000 rpm in an SW 28 rotor (Beckman Instruments). After centrifugation, 2-ml fractions were collected. Fractions in the 200–400 mm sucrose region were pooled and chromatographed on a glyceryl-coated controlled-pore glass bead column (GLY 03000B, Electro-Nucleonics Inc.) to obtain highly purified synaptic vesicles (26.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Protein content of the various fractions was analyzed by the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 12% acrylamide gels in Tris/glycine buffer (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, and blots were developed with secondary antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma); immunoreactive bands were detected with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.15 mg/ml) and nitro blue tetrazolium (0.3 mg/ml) in 40 mm sodium carbonate and 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 9.8). In some experiments, blots were developed with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and immunoreactive bands were revealed with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Rac1 (Transduction Laboratories) were used at 1:500 dilution. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:50 dilution. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against RhoB and Cdc42 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:50 and 1:100 dilutions, respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-synaptotagmin antibodies against the C2A domain (clone 1D12), a generous gift from Dr. Masami Takahashi (Mitsubishi Kasei Institute, Tokyo, Japan), were diluted 1:1000. Rabbit antibodies against the cytosolic epitope EQEGYQPNYGQ of synaptophysin (28.Taubenblatt P. Dedieu J.C. Gulik-Krzywicki T. Morel N. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3559-3567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Nicolas Morel (Laboratoire de Neurobiologie Cellulaire, CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France) and utilized at 1:1000 and 1:2000 dilutions. Experiments were performed at identified cholinergic synapses (29.Gardner D. Science. 1971; 173: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) in buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica(70–120 g of body weight; Marinus Inc., CA) according to previously published procedures (30.Johannes L. Doussau F. Clabecq A. Henry J.-P. Darchen F. Poulain B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2875-2884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Doussau F. Clabecq A. Henry J.-P. Darchen F. Poulain B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3147-3157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two presynaptic cholinergic interneurons (100–150 μm in diameter) and one postsynaptic neuron (150–200 μm in diameter) in the buccal ganglion were impaled with two glass microelectrodes (3 m KCl and Ag/AgCl2, 2–10 megaohms). ACh release from a presynaptic neuron was monitored by evoking an action potential at 40-s intervals. In several experiments, 1- or 2-s trains of stimuli were generated by using supraliminar depolarizing pulses of 5 ms separated by a repolarizing phase of adequate duration (SMP-311 pulse generator, Bio-Logic S. A., Grenoble, France). ACh release was estimated by measuring the amplitude of the evoked postsynaptic current (at these synapses, it is a Cl−current) using a conventional two-electrode voltage-clamp technique and subsequently converting it to an apparent membrane conductance by taking into account the null potential for Cl−(i.e. the reversal potential of the postsynaptic response). The holding potential of the postsynaptic neuron was maintained at 30 mV above E Cl−. Dissected buccal ganglia were maintained at 22 °C using a Peltier plate system and superfused continuously (50 ml/h) with a physiological control medium containing NaCl (460 mm), KCl (10 mm), CaCl2 (33 mm), MgCl2 (50 mm), and MgSO4 (28 mm) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). This dication-rich medium has a high [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratio (0.42) to minimize fluctuations in evoked ACh release due to spontaneous neuron firing activity. To modify the extracellular CaCl2 concentration, the respective concentrations of CaCl2 and MgCl2 were calculated according to the following equations: [CaCl2] (mm) = Q(83 + [MgSO4])/(Q + 1) and [MgCl2] (mm) = 83 − [CaCl2], whereQ is the [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratio. When CdCl2 (Sigma) was used, it was added directly to the control medium. To reduce the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions, EGTA was applied intraneuronally by pressure injection (see below). Possible intracellular pH changes were avoided by preparing EGTA in Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with a 2.2-fold excess of Tris base. To limit the toxin action to a given neuron without modifying ACh release by a change in the ACh receptor efficiency, toxins were microinjected into presynaptic neurons. The sample to be injected was mixed with a vital dye (10% (v/v) fast green; Sigma). The samples were air pressure-injected under visual and electrophysiological monitoring. The injected volume was in the range of 1% of the cell body volume. Following intracellular injection, only neurons with membrane potentials of −60 to −45 mV and with no alterations in the action potentials were utilized. Unless indicated, data are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance of the data was calculated by paired or unpaired t tests. The intracellular distribution of Rho proteins in presynaptic terminals was investigated in synaptosomes prepared from rat brains since the amount of neuronal tissue that can be collected from Aplysia does not allow subcellular fractionation. Fig.1 shows a Western blot analysis of the soluble and membrane-bound fractions obtained from purified synaptosomes by hypotonic lysis. Using specific antibodies raised against various members of the Rho family, we found that RhoA, RhoB, Rac1, and Cdc42 were present in the presynaptic terminals. In contrast to RhoA, which was largely cytosolic, and Cdc42, which was present in both cytosolic and membrane-bound fractions, RhoB and Rac1 were mostly detected in the particulate fraction containing synaptosomal plasma membrane, mitochondria, large dense-core particles, and a huge amount of synaptic vesicles. To probe the direct association of Rho proteins with the membrane of synaptic vesicles, crude synaptic vesicles obtained by high speed centrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”) were further fractionated on a 50–800 mmsucrose velocity gradient. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of two synaptic vesicle marker proteins estimated by immunoreplica analysis in the fractions collected from the sucrose gradient. Synaptic vesicles were distributed in fractions 7–18 as revealed by the immunosignal for synaptophysin and synaptotagmin. Fractions 7–18 were also labeled with anti-RhoB and anti-Rac1 antibodies (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that RhoB and Rac1 may associate with the membrane of synaptic vesicles. Accordingly, previous reports suggested the presence of several low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins in brain synaptic vesicles (32.Matsuoka I. Dolly J.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1026: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and cholinergic vesicles from the electric organ of marine ray (33.Ngsee J.K. Elferink L.A. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2675-2680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note that RhoB and, to a certain extent, Rac1 were present in larger amounts in fractions 15–18 (Fig. 2 B). These higher density fractions also displayed some immunoreactivity with antibodies raised against RhoA and Cdc42, thereby revealing some heterogeneity of the vesicle population with respect to the presence of Rho GTPases. Therefore, the association of monomeric GTPases on synaptic vesicles was further probed in vesicle preparations obtained by controlled-pore glass chromatography (26.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2 C, we detected an immunosignal only for Rac1 in highly purified synaptic vesicles, indicating that Rac1 is the sole member of the Rho family associated with the membrane of synaptic vesicles.Figure 2Rac1 is associated with purified synaptic vesicles.

Thus, ACh release from presynaptic neurons can be monitored by measuring the amplitude of the evoked transmembrane current in the postsynaptic neuron. To probe the role of Rho-related GTPases in neurotransmitter release, we used ToxB, which specifically glucosylates Rac, Cdc42, and Rho (34.Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar); LT, which glucosylates Rac, but has no effect on Rho and Cdc42 (25.Popoff M.R. Chaves-Orlate E.

Glucosylation or ADP-ribosylation in the effector domain of the various Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 isoforms disrupts their interaction with downstream effectors and thereby inactivates the intracellular pathways controlled by these GTPases. ToxB, LT, or C3 was pressure-injected into one presynaptic neuron, and the second presynaptic neuron was injected with the buffer used for toxin injection. In this way, we had an internal control for the stability of evoked neuroexocytosis for the duration of the experiments (up to 24 h). As shown in Fig. 3, all three toxins inhibited ACh release. More important, neither the action potential that triggers ACh release at nerve terminals nor the transmembrane resting potential and the membrane resistance of the injected neurons were significantly modified after injection of the toxins (data not shown). Therefore, the inhibition of ACh release induced by LT, ToxB, or C3 is not due to a modification of membrane excitability. The mean inhibition induced by the three toxins, calculated 3 and 20 h after injection, is shown in Fig.3 B. The three toxins induced an almost complete inhibition of neurotransmitter release 20 h after injection (Fig.3 B). Note, however, that high doses of C3 (2 μm final intraneuronal concentration) were required to abolish neurotransmission (Fig. 3 B). Collectively, these results suggest that Rac is the most likely candidate to regulate a rate-limiting step of exocytosis in neurons since it is the sole GTPase inhibited by LT, ToxB, and high concentrations of C3. Rho isoforms can be constitutively activated by CNF1, which catalyzes the deamidation of glutamine 63. This residue is conserved in RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, andAplysia Rho. Transformation of glutamine 63 to glutamic acid leads to inhibition of both intrinsic and Rho GTPase-activating protein-stimulated GTPase activity of Rho proteins (22.Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 40.Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Thus, the CNF1 action on Rho is equivalent to the amino acid substitution used to generate dominant-positive Rho mutants. Cdc42 can also be activated by a high concentration of this enzyme (22.Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P.

To further evaluate the implication of Rho and Cdc42 in neuroexocytosis, dichainal CNF1 (200 nm final intraneuronal concentration) or a CNF1 recombinant catalytic moiety (data not shown) was microinjected into presynaptic neurons. As illustrated in Fig.4 A, no significant modification of ACh release was observed for at least 150 min. In longer experiments, CNF1 induced an alteration of membrane excitability. We also examined whether Rho activation by CNF1 would be able to restore ACh release previously inhibited by LT. LT (50 nm final concentration) was first injected into a presynaptic neuron, and after ACh release had stabilized, CNF1 (200 nm final concentration) was injected into the same neuron. As illustrated in Fig. 4 B, CNF1 was unable to rescue the ACh release inhibited by LT treatment. These experiments suggest that neither Rho nor Cdc42 plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release. To further define the step in neurotransmitter release that is controlled by Rac, we examined the effect of high frequency stimulation on LT-induced blockage of ACh release. Trains of stimuli were elicited at 50 Hz for 1 or 2 s. Under control conditions, after a brief facilitation (31.Doussau F. Clabecq A. Henry J.-P. Darchen F. Poulain B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3147-3157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ACh release declined slightly during a train stimulus (Fig.5 A, open circles), probably due to an imbalance between the replenishment of the readily releasable pool of vesicles and the number of vesicles that undergo exocytosis. In LT-injected neurons, the time course of ACh release evoked by a 50-Hz stimulation train was greatly modified (Fig.5 A, closed circles): ACh release stabilized for ∼400 ms (404 ± 70 ms, n = 46) and then increased to reach within 1 s a level that was similar to that observed before LT injection (Fig. 5 A, compareopen and closed circles). This indicates that LT-induced inhibition of AC"

Recombinant VWF A1 domain (residues Glu497-Pro705 of VWF) bound stoichiometrically to a GPIbα-calmodulin fusion protein (residues His1-Val289 of GPIbα; GPIbα-CaM) immobilized on W-7-agarose with a K d of 3.3 μm. The variant VWF A1(R545A) bound to GPIbα-CaM 20-fold more tightly, mainly because the association rate constantk on increased from 1,100 to 8,800m−1 s−1. The GPIbα mutations G233V and M239V cause platelet-type pseudo-von Willebrand disease, and VWF A1 bound to GPIbα(G233V)-CaM and GPIbα(M239V)-CaM with aK d of 1.0 and 0.63 μm, respectively. The increased affinity of VWF A1 for GPIbα(M239V)-CaM was explained by an increase in k on to 4,500m−1 s−1. GPIbα-CaM bound with similar affinity to recombinant VWF A1, to multimeric plasma VWF, and to a fragment of dispase-digested plasma VWF (residues Leu480/Val481-Gly718). VWF A1 and A1(R545A) bound to platelets with affinities and rate constants similar to those for binding to GPIbα-CaM, and botrocetin had the expected positively cooperative effect on the binding of VWF A1 to GPIbα-CaM. Therefore, allosteric regulation by botrocetin of VWF A1 binding to GPIbα, and the increased binding affinity caused by mutations in VWF or GPIbα, are reproduced by isolated structural domains. The substantial increase in k on caused by mutations in either A1 or GPIbα suggests that productive interaction requires rate-limiting conformational changes in both binding sites. The exceptionally slow k on andk off provide important new constraints on models for rapid platelet tethering at high wall shear rates.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Platelet adhesion requires the binding of VWF to the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex. This interaction is essential for normal hemostasis (2.Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1987; 70: 895-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can contribute to the development of arterial thrombosis (3.Nichols T.C. Samama C.M. Bellinger D.A. Roussi J. Reddick R.L. Bonneau M.

The GPIb-IX complex consists of up to four gene products as follows: GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPIX, and possibly GPV (6.Du X. Beutler L. Ruan C. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding site for VWF is in the N-terminal 293 residues of GPIbα, and optimal interaction requires sulfation of tyrosine residues at positions 276, 278, and 279 (8.Marchese P. Murata M.

Multimeric normal VWF does not bind appreciably to platelets in the circulation. Once VWF is immobilized in the extracellular matrix, however, platelets bind and adhere tightly to it. This apparent induction of GPIbα binding in vivo is associated with VWF binding to collagen (9.Pareti F.I. Niiya K. McPherson J.M. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1995; 117: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). High affinity binding of VWF to GPIbα is induced in vitro by certain exogenous modulators, including the antibiotic ristocetin (13.Howard M.A. Firkin B.G. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1971; 26: 362-369PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Scott J.P. Montgomery R.R. Retzinger G.S. J. Biol.

Blood. 1989; 74: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These phenomena suggest that induced conformational changes modulate the affinity of VWF-GPIbα binding. A role for conformational change is supported indirectly by the effects of mutations on the binding affinity and structure of VWF A domains. Gain-of-function mutations in the VWF A1 domain promote spontaneous binding to GPIbα and cause a bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD) type 2B (reviewed in Ref. 16.Sadler J.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 3269-3287Google Scholar). The VWD type 2B mutation I546V was shown to cause a significant change in the crystal structure of recombinant VWF domain A1, altering the positions of residues proposed to bind GPIbα (17.Ruggeri, Z. M., Celikel, R., Ware, J., and Varughese, K. I. (1999) Thromb. Haemostasis (suppl.) 682Google Scholar). The relevance of conformational changes within domain A1 to the normal hemostatic function of VWF remains controversial (1.Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 18.Tsuji S. Sugimoto M. Kuwahara M. Nishio K. Takahashi Y. Fujimura Y. Ikeda Y. Yoshioka A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3854-3861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters of VWF-GPIb interactions are central to the mechanism by which VWF mediates platelet adhesion under conditions of high wall shear stress (19.Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 20.Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Binding of platelet GPIbα to VWF facilitates the initial transient tethering of platelets to the vessel wall that is visualized as rolling or slow translocation by video microscopy (19.Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 20.Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Subsequently, integrin-ligand interactions can mediate stable platelet adhesion. The high efficiency of platelet tethering has suggested that the kinetics of VWF-GPIb binding must be fast and that rapid tethering facilitates the formation of much tighter integrin-dependent bonds that require more time to form (19.Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 21.Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To date, however, direct measurements of the kinetics of VWF A1-GPIbα binding have not been reported. To investigate the mechanism of VWF-platelet binding, we have studied the interactions between recombinant VWF domain A1 and the N-terminal domain of platelet GPIbα. The behavior of these isolated domains was similar to that of plasma VWF and the GPIb-IX complex in situ on platelets. In the absence of exogenous modulators of binding, the association rate constant for VWF A1-GPIbα-(1–289) binding was only 1,100 m−1 s−1but was increased substantially by gain-of-function mutations in either the VWF A1 domain or GPIbα-(1–289). The exceptionally slow rate of binding and the acceleration caused by mutations are consistent with a model in which rate-limiting conformational changes in both proteins are necessary for productive VWF-GPIbα binding. The slow rate constants for binding provide new constraints on models for how VWF mediates rapid platelet tethering under conditions of high wall shear stress in vivo. Plasmid pGEM-4ZNae contains an 1140-base pair NgoMI-KpnI fragment of human VWF cDNA that encodes amino acid residues 442–821 of the mature VWF subunit (22.Dong Z. Thoma R.S. Crimmins D.L. McCourt D.W. Tuley E.A. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6753-6758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pGEM-4ZNaeR545A is similar but encodes the substitution R545A (23.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Fragments of these plasmids were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primers 5′-acc act ctg catatg gag gac atc-3′ (sense, NdeI site underlined) and 5′-gtc ggg gggatccta aga agg agg-3′ (antisense, BamHI site underlined). PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into pET-11b (Stratagene), and their sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pET-VWF497–705 or pET-VWF497–705(R545A) encode a methionine followed by amino acid residues Glu497-Pro705 of mature VWF without or with the substitution R545A, respectively. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene) containing pET plasmids were grown in 1 liter of LB/ampicillin medium at 37 °C to an absorbance OD (600 nm) of 0.7. 2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) was added, and incubation was continued for 5 h. The cell pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA-Na, 0.1% Triton X-100 and sonicated on ice. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, then washed three times by resuspension, and centrifuged in 60 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, containing 2.5, 0.5, and 0% Triton X-100, respectively. Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 10 ml of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.6, 1 mm EDTA-Na, 6 m guanidine HCl, and 150 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. VWF A1 proteins were dialyzed and refolded as described previously for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (24.Kohnert U. Rudolph R. Verheijen J.H. Weening-Verhoeff E.J.D. Stern A. Opitz U. Martin U. Lill H. Prinz H. Lechner M. Kresse G.-B. Buckel P. Fischer S. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) with modifications (25.Lu D. Fütterer K. Korolev S. Zheng X. Tan K. Waksman G. Sadler J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The final solution in refolding buffer was stirred for 24 h at room temperature followed by 24 h at 4 °C and then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS). Refolded VWF A1 domains were purified by adsorption onto a 5-ml HiTrap-heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBS, followed by elution with a linear gradient of 150–500 mm NaCl in TBS (60 ml, 2 ml/min). Fractions containing VWF were pooled and applied to a 5-ml column of Thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove any remaining reduced species. Fractions containing purified VWF fragments were dialyzed against TBS, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep-10 and Centricon-10; Amicon, Beverly, MA), and stored at −70 °C. Plasmid pDXα containing the full-length GPIbα cDNA sequence (26.Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR amplification with primers 5′-ta ctcgagatg cct ctc ctc ctc ttg ctg ctc ct-3′ (sense XhoI site underlined) and 5′-ta gcggccgccacc tta tcg ccc tca gtg tcc tct tct-3′ (antisense, NotI site underlined). The PCR product was digested with XhoI andNotI and ligated into pDN162, which contains the calmodulin (CaM) gene (kindly provided by Dr. Dario Neri). A fragment containing the GPIbα sequence and the CaM gene was obtained by digestion withXhoI and EcoRI and ligated into pAcSG2 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), a baculovirus vector, to give plasmid pWIbαwt. The sequence of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pWIbαwt encodes a chimeric protein (GPIbα-CaM) consisting of amino acid residues His1-Val289 of GPIbα, two Ala residues, and calmodulin. Mutations G233V, M239V, or both were introduced into plasmid pWIbαwt using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) and suitable primers. Plasmids pWIbα233V, pWIbα239V, and pWIbα233V239V encode proteins similar to GPIbα-CaM but with the corresponding mutations (GPIbαG233V-CaM, GPIbαM239V-CaM, and GPIbα233V239V-CaM). Constructs pWIbαwt, pWIbα233V, pWIbα239V, and pWIbα233V239V were cotransfected with BacVector-3000 (Novagen, Madison, WI) into Sf9 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsland, CA), and high titer recombinant baculovirus stocks were prepared by repeated infection. For large scale expression, a 1-liter shaker flask was seeded with 500 ml of High Five cells (Invitrogen) in Insect Express Media (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml, infected with 10% volume of high titer virus stock, and incubated 4 days at 27 °C with constant stirring at 100 rpm. The medium was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to gently pellet the cells and prevent the release of proteases. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. N-(6-Aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7; Sigma) coupled to agarose was prepared as described previously (27.Endo T. Tanaka T. Isobe T. Kasai H. Okuyama T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12485-12489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Medium (400 ml) containing GPIbα-CaM (or variant) was adjusted to 20 mm CaCl2 and applied to a column of W-7-agarose (50 ml) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, and GPIbα-CaM was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EGTA. After dialysis against TBS, the GPIbα-CaM was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep-30, Amicon, Beverly, MA) and stored at −80 °C. Purified human plasma VWF was kindly provided by Dr. Claudine Mazurier (CRTS, Lillie, France). Residual human serum albumin was removed by gel filtration chromatography on a column (1 × 30 cm) of Superose 12 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Botrocetin (28.Fujimura Y. Titani K. Usami Y. Suzuki M. Oyama R. Matsui T. Fukui H. Sugimoto M. Ruggeri Z.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was purified as described previously. The p39/34 fragment of dispase-digested plasma VWF was purified as described previously (5.Andrews R.K. Gorman J.J. Booth W.J. Corino G.L. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8326-8336Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and corresponds to amino acid residues Leu480/Val481-Gly718. W-7- agarose was resuspended in 1 volume of TBS. W-7-agarose suspension (50-μl total volume, 25-μl beads) was added to 7.8 μg (0.14 nmol) of GPIbα-CaM in 100 μl of TBS containing 20 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed once with TBS, blocked with 50 μl of TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature, and washed again with TBS. Unbound GPIbα-CaM was quantitated by protein assay (Micro BCA, Pierce) and indicated that 5.5 μg (0.1 nmol) was bound. The beads were resuspended in 330 μl of TBS, giving a concentration of 300 nm GPIbα-CaM in the bead suspension. Immobilized variants of GPIbα-CaM were prepared similarly. Botrocetin (1 mg/ml, 500 μl) was dialyzed against 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, mixed on ice with 500 μl of 1 mg/ml EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in water, incubated on ice for 2 h, and dialyzed against TBS. Biotinylated botrocetin (0.5 μg) in 100 μl of TBS was incubated with 25 μl of TBS-washed streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were washed with TBS, blocked with 50 μl of TBS containing 3% BSA for 30 min at room temperature, washed again with TBS, and resuspended in a total volume of 330 μl of TBS. All of the biotinylated botrocetin was bound, and the concentration of botrocetin in the bead suspension was 56 nm. VWF fragments were radiolabeled using IODO-GEN (29.Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) (Pierce) to a specific radioactivity of 3–5 × 109cpm/μmol. 125I-Labeled A1 or A1(R545A) at varying concentrations was incubated at room temperature with wild-type or mutant GPIbα-CaM-agarose (final concentration 20 nmGPIbα-CaM for assays in the absence of botrocetin or 3 nmfor assays in the presence of botrocetin) and 1.5% BSA in a total volume 100 μl of TBS with or without 1 μm botrocetin. After 1 h, the reaction mixture was layered over 300 μl of 20% sucrose in a 500-μl microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm to separate bound and free ligand. Radioactivity associated with the bead pellet was quantitated by γ radiation counting. Nonspecific binding was estimated in a mixture containing the same reagents and either 400 μm unlabeled VWF A1 or 60 μm unlabeled VWF A1(R545A). Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. Dissociation constants and stoichiometry of binding were determined by Scatchard analysis. The time course of binding was investigated with an identical assay design except that the time of incubation was varied. To obtain rate constants for the reaction, the time course data were fitted to a bimolecular binding mechanism (A + B =AB) with the program KINSIM (30.Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), and the dissociation constants were determined by equilibrium binding and Scatchard analysis as described above. 125I-Labeled VWF A1 or125I-labeled VWF(R545A) at varying concentrations was added to 28 nm biotinylated botrocetin-agarose in 100 μl of TBS containing 1.5% BSA. After 1 h at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged through 20% sucrose as described above, and the radioactivity bound to streptavidin-agarose was determined by γ radiation counting. Nonspecific binding was estimated in similar reactions containing 1 μm unlabeled VWF A1 or VWF A1(R545A). 125I-Labeled VWF A1 at varying concentrations was incubated at room temperature with formalin-fixed platelets (1 × 108/ml) and 3% BSA in a total volume of 100 μl of TBS. After 1 h, the reaction mixture was layered over 300 μl of 20% sucrose in a 500-μl microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm. Radioactivity associated with the platelet pellet was quantitated by γ radiation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined similarly but in the presence of 400 μm unlabeled VWF A1. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. For competitive inhibition assays of the VWF-GPIbα interaction, a fixed concentration of 2.5 μm or 10 nm125I-labeled VWF A1 was used in the absence or presence, respectively, of 1 μm botrocetin. For competitive inhibition assays of VWF-botrocetin interaction, a fixed concentration of 25 nm125I-labeled VWF A1 was used. Nonspecific binding was estimated with the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled A1 fragment and was always <15% of total binding; the corresponding values were subtracted from all data points. Binding was expressed as a percentage of maximal specific binding (100%) and was used to calculate the concentration of VWF fragments required to inhibit 50% of specific 125I-labeled A1 binding to recombinant GPIbα-CaM fusion protein (EC50) by fitting to the equation B = EC50/(EC50 + [I]). Microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml VWF in TBS (50 μl/well), blocked with 3% BSA in TBS for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). NMC-4 (0.2 μg/ml) and varying concentrations (0.6–300 nm) of VWF A1, VWF A1(R545A), dispase-digested fragment, or VWF were added to each well. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, plates were washed three times with PBST and incubated with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep F(ab′)2 fragment (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. After washing three times with PBST, 50 μl of 0.8 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine was added to each well. The reaction was stopped after 3 min with 3 m H2SO4, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Nonspecific binding was estimated in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml VWF and was 5% of total binding. The corresponding values were subtracted from all data points. NMC-4 binding was expressed as a percentage of maximal specific binding, and the concentration of each competitive ligand required to inhibit 50% of specific NMC-4 binding (EC50) was determined. Amino acid sequencing was performed by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory of the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston), with an Applied Biosystems 494/HT PROCISE Sequencing System and model 477A pulsed-liquid sequencer, with a model 120A phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer controlled by a 610 Data Analysis System. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed with a Finnegan LCQ spectrometer (Finnegan, San Jose, CA). SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed as described (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Plasma VWF is multivalent, and this feature complicates the study of reactions between individual binding sites on VWF and platelet GPIbα. To address this limitation, monomeric recombinant VWF A1 proteins were expressed in E. coli and refolded by a method developed previously for the renaturation of tissue-type plasminogen activator (24.Kohnert U. Rudolph R. Verheijen J.H. Weening-Verhoeff E.J.D. Stern A. Opitz U. Martin U. Lill H. Prinz H. Lechner M. Kresse G.-B. Buckel P. Fischer S. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Both wild-type VWF A1 and the high affinity variant A1(R545A) (23.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were prepared to determine the effect of the mutation on the affinity and the rate constants for binding. The products were purified by chromatography on heparin-agarose and thiol-agarose. Both proteins appeared to be homogeneous upon gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A), with apparent masses of 23.5 kDa that increased to 24 kDa upon reduction. The reduced and oxidized forms were distinguished easily by analytical reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1 C), and the final preparations were free of reduced precursor proteins. Both proteins were soluble at ≥20 mg/ml in TBS, pH 7.4, and gave single peaks upon gel filtration chromatography that are consistent with monomers (Fig.1 B). Amino acid sequencing of VWF A1 gave the expected N-terminal sequence Met-Glu-Asp-Ile-Ser-Glu-Pro-Pro-Leu-His. By electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, VWF A1 had a molecular mass of 24,004 Da compared with the calculated mass of 24,012.8 Da. The concentration of each fragment was determined by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis, allowing the determination of an extinction coefficient (280 nm) of 18,084m−1cm−1. This experimental value is similar to the calculated extinction coefficient of 16,180m−1cm−1 based on amino acid composition (32.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). To facilitate both purification and binding studies, chimeric proteins were designed containing the VWF binding domain of GPIbα fused to the N terminus of calmodulin. Calmodulin binds tightly to the immobilized phenothiazine derivative W-7 in the presence of calcium ions (33.Moore P.B. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9663-9667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin retains this binding activity in the construct GPIbα-CaM and does not dissociate significantly from W-7-agarose during use. Mutations that increase the affinity of binding to VWF and cause platelet-type pseudo-VWD were introduced into GPIbα-CaM. All of the GPIbα-CaM proteins gave a single major band on gel electrophoresis, with an apparent mass of 55 kDa (Fig.2).Figure 2Gel electrophoresis of GPIbα-CaM proteins. Samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels under non-reducing (NR) and reducing (R) conditions. The molecular masses in kDa of standard proteins (lane 1) are indicated at the left. Samples include GPIbα-CaM (lane 2), GPIbα(G233V)-CaM (lane 3), GPIbα(M239V)-CaM (lane 4), and GPIbα(G233V/M239V)-CaM (lane 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding of VWF A1 to GPIbα-CaM proteins reached equilibrium within 15 min and was reversed completely within 10 min by the addition of excess unlabeled ligand (data not shown). Radiolabeled VWF A1 fragments bound saturably to the various immobilized GPIbα-CaM proteins (Fig.3), and Scatchard analysis was consistent with binding to a single class of sites at a stoichiometry of 1:1. Introduction of the mutation R545A into VWF A1 increased the affinity of binding to GPIbα-CaM 20-fold (TableI); the value for K ddecreased from 3.3 μm to 160 nm. Mutations of GPIbα that cause platelet-type pseudo-VWD produced a smaller 3-fold (G233V) or 6-fold (M239V) increase in the affinity of VWF A1 binding. Combining the two GPIbα mutations in a single construct did not increase the affinity of binding further. The value forK d was 0.6 μm for the interaction of wild-type VWF A1 with either GPIbα(M239V)-CaM or GPIbα(G233V/M239V)-CaM (Table I). Also, A1(R545A) bound with similar affinity to wild-type GPIbα-CaM and to GPIbα(M239V)-CaM. Thus, the effects of these high affinity mutations were not additive.Table IDissociation constants for binding of recombinant VWF A1 and GPIbαVWF A1GPIbα-CaMPlatelets (2)wt (5)G233V (3)M239V (2)G233V/M239V (3)Kd (μm)wt3.3 ± 0.51.0 ± 0.10.63 ± 0.10.59 ± 0.44.7aThis value is based on a single experiment.R545A0.16 ± 0.030.18 ± 0.010.20 ± 0.060.14 ± 0.010.11 ± 0.01Binding of 125I-labeled A1 domains to GPIbα-CaM proteins immobilized on W-7-agarose or to formalin-fixed platelets was determined by Scatchard analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative data are shown in Fig. 3.

https://openalex.org/W2146240095,"Proteoglycan-binding peptides were designed based on consensus sequences in heparin-binding proteins: XBBXBXand XBBBXXBX, where X and B are hydropathic and basic residues, respectively. Initial peptide constructs included (AKKARA)n and (ARKKAAKA)n(n = 1–6). Affinity coelectrophoresis revealed that low M r peptides (600–1300) had no affinities for low M r heparin, but higherM r peptides (2000–3500) exhibited significant affinities (K d ≅ 50–150 nm), which increased with peptide M r. Affinity was strongest when sequence arrays were contiguous and alanines and arginines occupied hydropathic and basic positions, but inclusion of prolines was disruptive. A peptide including a single consensus sequence of the serglycin proteoglycan core protein bound heparin strongly (K d ≅ 200 nm), likely owing to dimerization through cysteine-cysteine linkages. Circular dichroism showed that high affinity heparin-binding peptides converted from a charged coil to an α-helix upon heparin addition, whereas weak heparin-binding peptides did not. Higher M rpeptides exhibited high affinities for total endothelial cell proteoglycans (K d ≅ 300 nm), and ∼4-fold weaker affinities for their free glycosaminoglycan chains. Thus, peptides including concatamers of heparin-binding consensus sequences may exhibit strong affinities for heparin and proteoglycans. Such peptides may be applicable in promoting cell-substratum adhesion or in the design of drugs targeted to proteoglycan-containing cell surfaces and extracellular matrices.

PGs are ubiquitous components of cell surfaces and the extracellular matrix, and their GAG chains contribute to myriad biological functions, such as modulation of enzyme activities, regulation of cell growth, and control of assembly of the extracellular matrix (1.Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). PGs are thus potential targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, heparin antagonists are needed to take the place of protamine, a heterogeneous, sometimes toxic protein mixture commonly used to neutralize the anticoagulant activity of heparin in humans (2.Racanelli A. Fareed J. Walenga J.M. Coyne E. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1985; 11: 176-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3.DeLucia A. Wakefield T.W. Andrews P.C. Nichol B.J. Kadell A.M. Wrobleski S.K. Downing L.J. Stanley J.C. J. Vasc. Surg. 1993; 18: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); in the design of drugs to be targeted to PG-rich tissues, such as cartilage (4.Hascall V.C. Heinegard D.K. Wight T.N. Hay E.B. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Press, New York1991: 149-172Crossref Google Scholar); and to be used to promote cell adhesion in a variety of situations, e.g. by promoting binding of cells that express abundant amounts of PGs, such as endothelial cells (5.Vargas F.F. Osorio H.M. Basilio C. De Jesus M. Ryan U.S. Membr. Biochem. 1990; 9: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), to synthetic vascular graft surfaces. To develop a rationale for the design of such reagents, it is useful to examine known features of protein structure required for high affinity interactions with GAGs. Thus, analysis of the structural features of many known heparin- and heparan sulfate (HS)-binding proteins has revealed the presence of conserved motifs, through which GAG binding has been postulated to occur. Cardin and Weintraub (6.Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified two clusters of basic charge in known heparin-binding proteins in which amino acids tend to be arranged in the patterns XBBXBX orXBBBXXBX, where B represents an amino acid with basic charge, usually arginine or lysine, and X represents an uncharged or hydrophobic amino acid. Molecular modeling of these consensus sites predicts the arrangement of amino acids into either α-helices or β-strands. This allows for the clustering of noncontiguous basic amino acids on one side of the helix, thus forming a charged domain to which GAGs could bind. Indeed, for some but not all of the heparin-binding proteins, disruption of the heparin-binding consensus sequences hinders heparin binding. For example, chemical modification of the heparin-binding consensus site in thrombospondin (7.Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) or site-directed mutagenesis of a heparin-binding sequence in fibronectin (8.Barkalow F.J.B. Schwartzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7812-7818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) eliminates or diminishes heparin binding affinity. Others have proposed a necessary distance of approximately 20 Å between basic amino acids for heparin binding, regardless of protein tertiary structure (9.Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, few attempts have been made to use these concepts regarding the structural specificities of GAG-protein interactions to develop families of high affinity GAG- or PG-binding peptides. Thus, here we describe the design and characterization of high affinity heparin- and EC PG-binding peptides that were modeled from the proposed heparin-binding consensus sequences of native heparin-binding proteins. Peptides were synthesized and purified by the University of Virginia Biomolecular Research Facility (Charlottesville, VA) or by Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). Peptides were synthesized by standard solid phase synthesis using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Peptide molecular weight was verified by mass spectroscopy, and purity (>70%) was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography. Whole heparin from pig intestinal mucosa (Sigma) was tyramine end-labeled and radiolabeled with Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to an average specific activity of ∼1.0 × 107 cpm/μg as described (10.San Antonio J.D. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled heparin was fractionated on Sephadex G-100 (Bio-Rad), and the final ∼12% of material to elute was retained as the low M r material of ≤6000 (11.Jordan R. Beeler D. Rosenberg R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2902-2913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Laurent T.C. Tengblad A. Thunberg L. Hook M. Lindhal U. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Binding of radiolabeled heparin and HUVEC PGs to peptides was studied by ACE as detailed elsewhere (13.Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), because the heparin-protein binding affinities revealed by ACE match reasonably well with those obtained by other well established quantitative techniques for measuring binding interactions,e.g. (14.San Antonio J.D. Lander A.D. Karnovsky M.J. Slayter H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15.San Antonio J.D. Karnovsky M.J. Gay S. Sanderson R.D. Lander A.D.

Chem. 1988; 263: 19112-19118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were dissolved in 1× ACE running buffer, 50 mm MOPSO (Sigma)/125 mmsodium acetate, pH 7.0, and serially diluted in running buffer at 2× concentrations. Peptides were then mixed 1:1 with 2% agarose/1% CHAPS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and loaded into wells of a 1% agarose gel. Radiolabeled heparin or HUVEC PGs were then loaded in a slot on the anode side of the gel and electrophoresed through the peptide-containing wells, toward the cathode. Gels were dried, and PG mobility was measured with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) by scanning each protein lane and determining the relative radioactivity content per 88-μm pixel through the length of the lane. Retardation coefficient (R) measurements, binding isotherm curve fittings, and apparent K d value determinations were calculated as detailed previously (10.San Antonio J.D. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13.Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Some peptides were also analyzed by ACE for heparin binding under reducing conditions. Thus, after serial peptide dilution, β-mercaptoethanol was added at 5% to each peptide sample, and these were mixed 1:1 with 2% agarose/1% CHAPS/5% β-mercaptoethanol and added to the ACE gel sample wells as usual. Binding analysis of peptides to enzymatically or chemically degraded PGs (see below) was carried out by ACE as detailed, except that PG samples included 6 m urea to denature any residual enzymes. HUVEC were isolated as detailed elsewhere (18.Gimbrone M.A. Collen B.S. Progress in Hematology and Thrombosis. III. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1976: 1-28Google Scholar) and were used up to passage seven. Cells were cultured on 0.2% gelatin-coated tissue culture flasks in normal culture medium composed of medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech Inc.), 80 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement isolated from bovine hypothalami as described (19.Maciag T. Cerundolo J. Ilsley S. Kelley P.R. Forand R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5674-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), 50 μg/ml heparin (porcine intestinal mucosa, grade 1A, Sigma) 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.1% fungizone. Exponentially growing, subconfluent HUVECs were labeled with 35 μCi/ml [35S]Na2SO4 (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) in normal culture medium minus heparin for 12 h. Culture medium and cell layers were harvested separately. After removal of the medium, cells were washed with 2.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline plus Ca2+-Mg2+. Medium and rinses were pooled and brought to 6 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 50 mm6-aminocaproic acid, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. Samples were stirred for 15 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min to remove insoluble materials. To the cell layer was added 2.0 ml of extraction solution, 6m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and protease inhibitors as described above. Cells were scraped off the dishes, and the extracts were pooled and stirred for 5 min at room temperature and then centrifuged as described above. Samples were concentrated on DEAE columns (DEAE Bio-Gel A agarose, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with low salt buffer, 0.1 m NaCl, 6m urea, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Columns were rinsed with 10 ml of low salt buffer; flow-through was discarded. Bound PGs/GAGs were eluted with 3 ml of high salt buffer, 1.5m NaCl, 6 m urea, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0. Eluted samples were dialyzed against distilled water, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C until binding analysis. The contributions of PG GAG chain components to peptide binding affinities were assessed by selective enzymatic degradation of GAG chains prior to ACE analysis. [35S]Na2SO4-labeled HUVEC PGs were digested with chondroitinase ABC or heparatinase I (Seikagaku America, Ijamsville, MD). PG samples were resuspended in 100 μl of enzyme buffer (chondroitinase buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm pepstatin A, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm EDTA; heparatinase buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were digested with 0.05 units/ml chondroitinase ABC at 37 °C for 3 h. Fresh enzyme was then added to the same concentration, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. Heparatinase I was added to samples at 0.01 units/ml. Samples were incubated for 3 h at 43 °C, fresh enzyme was then added to the same concentration, and incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. All samples were then stored at −20 °C until binding analysis. The contributions of PG GAG chain components to peptide binding affinities were further assessed by selective chemical degradation. Total secreted HUVEC PGs were subjected to nitrous acid degradation as detailed (20.Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), which selectively degrades HS GAG chains. Binding analysis to peptides was then measured by ACE. GAG chains were released from PG core proteins by alkaline borohydride reduction as detailed in Ref.21.Iozzo R.V. Muller-Glauser W. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5677-5687PubMed Google Scholar. CD spectra were recorded at 22 °C using a JASCO J-500C spectropolarimeter interfaced to a 486 PC. The path length of the CD cells was 0.5 mm, and the CD was expressed in terms of ellipticity [Θ] in degree·cm2·dmol−1. Samples were initially dialyzed to water to remove residual synthesis contaminants, lyophilized, and resuspended in water at 1 mg/ml, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. Peptide concentrations of 0.1 or 0.2 mg/ml were analyzed. Typically, two scans were averaged for each spectrum. CD spectra of peptides in α-helical conformations were recorded in the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE), which served as a positive control of peptides in α-helical conformations. To determine the effects of heparin on peptide conformation, solutions containing peptide plus heparin were prepared at various peptide:heparin ratios (w/w). Concentrations of peptides used in CD were verified by one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy based on an internal 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonate standard. NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker AMX 600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm broadband inverse probe, using the XwinNMR 2.1 software package run on a Silicon Graphics INDY work station. One-dimensional proton spectra were acquired at 303 K using a 4 s relaxation delay and were processed with 0.5 Hz exponential line broadening. 250 μl of a 1 mg/ml peptide solution (as determined by weight) was lyophilized and dissolved in 405 μl of D2O containing 0.123 mm 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonate. The degenerate arginine δCH2 resonances at 3.2 ppm, ascertained by a total correlation spectroscopy experiment, were integrated and compared with the internal standard. Simple random walk statistics, neglecting contributions due to swelling, charge, and self-avoidance, were assumed to apply to peptides of type (AKKARA)n and (ARKKAAKA)n, where n = 1–6, and used to calculate the average spatial separation of terminal amino acids and to estimate overall peptide size. Peptide size was calculated using the average end-to-end separation using the equation, 〈r〉2=nlo21−cosθ1+cosθ1−cosφ¯1+cosφ¯Equation 1 where <r> = average end-to-end distance, n = number of amino acid residues, l o = average bond length, θ = average bond angle, and φ = rotation angle (22.Hiemenz P.C. Polymer Chemistry: The Basic Concepts. Jwang Yuan Publishing Co., New York1984Google Scholar). The rotation angle was taken to equal either 0° for a fully extended molecule or 120° for bond rotation leading to a coiled structure. A perfect α-helix was assumed subsequent to binding with heparin, such that helical wheel diagrams, representing an 18/5 (residues/rotation) α-helix (23.Wunderlich B. Macromolecular Physics 1. Academic Press, New York1973Google Scholar), could be constructed to visualize the position of and calculate the spacing for basic amino acids along the helix. To design small peptides that exhibit high affinities for heparin and for the GAG components of PGs, peptide sequences were modeled after proposed heparin-binding consensus sequence motifs. Thus, a collection of peptides containing one of two consensus sequence motifs, either XBBXBX orXBBBXXBX, as well as various modifications of these, were synthesized (Table I). As peptides containing a single heparin-binding sequence often show little or no affinity for heparin (24.Conrad H.E. Heparin-Binding Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar), a strategy used here was to include consensus sequences in multiple copies within peptides. In initial studies, we selected for synthesis the sequences (AKKARA)n or (ARKKAAKA)n, where n = 1–6. Alanine was included in the hydropathic positions because of its stabilizing activity on α-helices (25.Ferran D.S. Sobel M. Harris R.B. Biochem. 1992; 31: 5010-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the basic amino acids were chosen to represent those with the highest probability of occurrence in each basic position in the heparin-binding consensus sequences of native heparin-binding proteins (6.Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When single copies of either sequence were tested for heparin binding by ACE, no affinities were detected. In contrast, peptides containing two copies of the consensus sequence exhibited weak but detectable affinities for heparin (<6 μm), and peptides of higher molecular weight containing 4–6 copies of a consensus sequence showed a marked increase in heparin binding affinity (40–150 nm) (Fig.1). The heparin binding affinity of both the 6-mer and 8-mer tandem repeat peptides reached a plateau as peptide length approached 30 amino acids ((AKKARA)5,K d ≅ 90 nm; (ARKKAAKA)4,K d ≅ 40 nm). Larger peptides ((AKKARA)6 and (ARKKAAKA)5) displayed similar affinities (K d ≅ 100 and 50 nm,respectively; Table I).Table IHeparin binding affinity of peptides containing heparin-binding consensus sequencesPeptide sequenceM rK d ± S.D.nmXBBXBX tandem repeats AKKARA644Not detectable (AKKARA)2127040,000 ± 18,000 (AKKARA)318951,900 ± 210ap < 0.01 versus(AKKARA)4.

K d represents an average of data obtained for all trials ± S.D. To define the sequence and conformational features of the tandem repeat peptides that confer their high affinity heparin binding characteristics, peptides containing variants of one of the consensus sequences first tested, (ARKKAAKA)3, were synthesized. These included those in which alanines were replaced by other hydropathic residues, the spacings between consensus sequences were altered by removal or addition of alanine residues, or the potential of the peptides to form stable α-helices was inhibited by including proline residues at various positions. It was found that peptide affinity for heparin was decreased when alanine was replaced by glycine in all the hydropathic positions ((ARKKAAKA)3,K d ≅ 135 nm; (GRKKGGKG)3,K d ≅ 200 nm; p < 0.01); less conservative substitutions had varying effects on heparin binding affinity, i.e. for (LRKKLGKR)3,K d ≅ 105 nm, affinity was unaffected; for (TRKKLGKI)3, K d ≅ 740 nm (p < 0.01), affinity was decreased (Table I). Two peptides were synthesized in which the spacings between adjacent consensus sequences were altered. Both increasing (ARKKAAKA-AAAA-ARKKAAKA-AAAA-ARKKAA-KA) and decreasing (ARKKAAKA-RKKAAKA-RKKAAKA) the distance between consensus sequences resulted in decreased heparin binding affinity (K d≅ 250 and 450 nm, respectively). Inclusion of prolines also decreased the heparin binding affinity, the degree of which was influenced by their position and number. Thus, the heparin binding affinity decreased to 360 nm when prolines were present in each tandem repeat in place of an alanine ((ARKKPAKA)3); however, a weaker affinity was obtained when a single proline was substituted in the center of a series of three heparin-binding consensus sequences (ARKKAAKA-ARKKPAKA-ARKKAAKA, K d≅ 730 nm; Table I). Other peptides synthesized and studied include sequences native to the mouse (YPARRARYQWVRCKP) and human (YPTQRARYQWVRCNP) serglycin (SG) core proteins, which contain a single and a partial consensus sequence, respectively. These showed significant affinities for heparin (K d ≅ 200–900 nm; Table I and Fig.2), despite their small sizes (about 2000 Da). To elucidate the basis for the strong heparin binding features of these peptides, the ability of the basic residues to sustain high affinity binding was tested by studying a peptide that contained all of the basic residues of the mouse sequence in their native positions but in which all other residues were changed to alanines (AAARRARAAAARAKA). A 350-fold decrease in heparin binding affinity (K d≅ 72 μm) for this peptide indicated that the number and arrangement of basic residues in the mouse sequence was not sufficient for high affinity binding and suggests the importance of one or more of the other nonbasic residues (Fig. 2). We next tested whether the C-terminal cysteine in the mouse SG peptide may promote peptide dimer formation, thereby influencing heparin binding affinity. Thus, heparin binding was tested by ACE under reducing conditions, and it was found that this treatment yielded negligible heparin binding. Likewise, when the cysteine residue was replaced by an alanine in the native mouse SG sequence, YPARRARYQWVRAKP, heparin binding affinity was again negligible; both results are consistent with the potential cross-linking function of the cysteine residues (Fig. 2). The intrinsic structural properties of the peptides were explored using CD spectroscopy. Short peptides of known heparin-binding proteins containing heparin-binding consensus sequences have previously been shown to fold into α-helical conformations. In doing so, the basic amino acids locate to one face of the helix and thus are potentially exposed for binding. Peptides that displayed weak ((AKKARA)2), moderate ((AKKARA)4), and strong ((AKKARA)5 and (AKKARA)6) heparin binding affinities were analyzed by CD to characterize their degree of α-helical contents and propensities to form an α-helix. All peptides exhibit very similar spectra with peaks at 195 and 216 nm and a crossover at 210 nm (for example, see Fig.3, (AKKARA)6, 1:0 (●), and Fig. 4, (AKKARA)2, 1:0 (●)). These spectra are indicative of an extended charged coil conformation that was previously reported for charged poly-l-lysines and poly-l-arginines (26.Gelman R.A. Rippon W.B. Blackwell J. Biopolymers. 1973; 12: 541-558Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Figure 4CD spectroscopy of (AKKARA)2 in the presence or absence of low M rheparin. The CD spectra measurements of (AKKARA)2 in the absence of heparin (1:0 (●)) indicate a charged coil conformation (peaks at 195 and 216 nm, crossover at 210 nm). However, in contrast to the heparin-induced conformational change seen for the high affinity heparin-binding peptide (AKKARA)6, (AKKARA)2, which binds heparin weakly, remains a charged coil in the presence of heparin (1:0.25 (○), 1:0.50 (×), 1:0.75 (▪), and 1:1 (■)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Intrinsic CD of the peptides shows that they do not adopt α-helical conformations. To explore the conformational repertoire of the peptides and to record CD spectra for the α-helical conformations, peptides were analyzed by CD in the presence of the nonpolar solvent TFE. Nonpolar solvents are known to increase the degree of α-helicity of a peptide in solution by enhancing hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions (27.Adler A.J. Fasman G.D. J. Phys. Chem. 1971; 75: 1516-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CD of (AKKARA)6 at 0.1 mg/ml containing 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% TFE (v/v) was measured. At TFE concentrations >30%, with an apparent maximal effect induced at 40% TFE, the peptide assumes an α-helical conformation, with classic α-helical peaks at 206 and 220 nm and a crossover at 197 nm (data not shown). The CD spectra of (AKKARA)6 recorded in the presence of increasing amounts of heparin (Fig. 3) demonstrate that a change from a charged coil conformation displayed in the absence of heparin (1:0) occurs upon heparin addition (1:0.25, 1:0.50, and 1:1). Heparin induces a similar α-helical conformation at a 1:1 peptide:heparin ratio that was obtained in the presence of >30% TFE, with classic α-helical peaks at 190, 207, and 222 nm. At higher heparin concentrations (1:2 or 1:4) the α-helical form is lost, and the spectrum resembles that of a random coil structure. This ability of excess GAG to disrupt the α-helical conformation of a polypeptide in solution has been reported previously (26.Gelman R.A. Rippon W.B. Blackwell J. Biopolymers. 1973; 12: 541-558Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This same heparin effect is not obtained for the weak heparin-binding peptide (AKKARA)2 (Fig. 4). In the absence of heparin (1:0), the peptide assumes a similar charged coil conformation as that observed for (AKKARA)6 but fails to display α-helical character in the presence of heparin (1:0.25, 1:0.50, 1:0.075, or 1:1). The interactions between consensus sequence peptides and PGs were also examined. For these experiments, total PGs were isolated from HUVEC cultures, because HUVECs have been shown to express a variety of types of HS and CS PGs, including, for example, syndecans, perlecan, glypican, and biglycan (28.Mertens G.

Thus, cell layer-associated and secreted [35S]SO4-radiolabeled PGs were purified by extraction with urea, and those PGs retained on DEAE after a 0.1m NaCl rinse were studied for their binding to (ARKKAAKA)4 by ACE (Fig.5 A, EC PGs).

However, how ligands interact with αIIbβ3 has been controversial. Ligand-mimetic anti-αIIbβ3 antibodies (PAC-1, LJ-CP3, and OP-G2) contain the RGD-like RYD sequence in their CDR3 in the heavy chain and have structural and functional similarities to native ligands. We have located binding sites for ligand-mimetic antibodies in αIIb and β3 using human-to-mouse chimeras, which we expect to maintain functional integrity of αIIbβ3. Here we report that these antibodies recognize several discontinuous binding sites in both the αIIb and β3 subunits; these binding sites are located in residues 156–162 and 229–230 of αIIb and residues 179–183 of β3. In contrast, several nonligand-mimetic antibodies (e.g. 7E3) recognize single epitopes in either subunit. Thus, binding to several discontinuous sites in both subunits is unique to ligand-mimetic antibodies. Interestingly, these binding sites overlap with several (but not all) of the sequences that have been reported to be critical for fibrinogen binding (e.g. N-terminal repeats 2–3 but not repeats 4–7, of αIIb). These results suggest that ligand-mimetic antibodies and probably native ligands may make direct contact with these discontinuous binding sites in both subunits, which may constitute a ligand-binding pocket."

These domains also couple to the βγ subunits of GTP binding proteins (G proteins), but whether this association transmits allosteric information to the catalytic core is unclear. To address this question, we constructed protein chimeras in which the PH domain of phospholipase C-β2 (PLC-β2), which is regulated by Gβγ, replaces the PH domain of PLC-δ1 which binds to, but is not regulated by, Gβγ. We found that attachment of the PH domain of PLC-β2 onto PLC-δ1 not only causes the membrane-binding properties of PLC-δ1 to become similar to those of PLC-β2, but also results in a Gβγ-regulated enzyme. Thus, PH domains are more than simple tethering devices and mediate regulatory signals to the host protein.

Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). PH domains have been identified in over 100 diverse proteins involved in cell signaling and/or membrane/cytoskeletal interactions. While it is generally agreed that PH domains help tether their host proteins to membrane surfaces, some PH domains, such as that of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (2.Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Touhara K. Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

PLCs are soluble enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of a minor component in membranes, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), releasing the two second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (for review, see Refs. 4.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar and 5.Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharm. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These enzymes have a multidomain structure (Fig. 1) containing, besides the N-terminal PH domain, four elongation factor (EF) hands, a catalytic X-Y domain with an insertion of varying length, and a C2 domain (6.Williams R.L. Katan M. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 1387-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). There are three known families of mammalian PLCs (β, γ, and δ), each with a distinct set of protein regulators. PLC-β isoenzymes are activated by αq and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins (G proteins). PLC-γ enzymes are regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases. Protein regulators of PLC-δ enzymes are unknown although RhoGAP and transglutaminase have been implicated (7.Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 8.Feng J.F. Rhee S.G. Im M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).PLCs must associate with membranes during catalysis, and their PH domain plays a key role in membrane attachment. The PH domain of PLC-γ binds specifically to membranes containing PI(3,4,5)P3 (9.Falasca M. Logan S. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and the PH domain of PLC-δ binds strongly to membranes containing PI(4,5)P2 (10.Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 11.Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In contrast, the PH domain of PLC-β binds strongly and nonspecifically to membranes which helps to promote its lateral association with G protein subunits, and it has been found that the isolated PH domain of PLC-β2 binds to G-βγ on membranes with a similar strong affinity as that of its full-length native enzyme (12.Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PLC-δ1, which is not activated by Gβγ, and its isolated PH domain bind to Gβγ with about a quarter to a tenth the affinity of the PH domain of PLC-β2 (12.Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, PLC-β2 must contain additional determinants that confer activation by Gβγ. Although previous studies using small peptides suggest that these determinants lie in the catalytic domain, we present evidence here using PLC chimeras that these regions are located within the PH domain (13.Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14.Tall E. Dorman G. Garcia P. Runnels L. Shah S. Chen J. Profit A. Gu Q.M. Chaudhary A. Prestwich G.D. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7239-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo clearly define the role of the PH domain of PLC-β2 in its activation by Gβγ subunits, we have constructed two chimeric proteins in which the PH domain of PLC-β2 is used to replace that of PLC-δ1(Fig. 1). The first of these (β2PH/δ1) swapped only the PH domain as defined by the sequence and crystallographic data (17.Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The second (β2PH-L/δ1) swapped the PH domain along with a short linker region to the EF hands, which has been used in our previous work (12.Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This longer construct was based on studies by Lefkowitz and co-workers showing that a 20-residue extension of the C terminus of the PH domain of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase played a critical role in Gβγ activation (2.Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Touhara K. Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Similar results were obtained for both constructs, indicating that the linker region between the PH domain and the EF hands has little effect on Gβγ regulation.The β2/δ1 chimeric proteins associate with membranes with a specificity identical to PLC-β2 and distinct from PLC-δ1 (Fig.2, TableI). The apparent binding affinity to membranes containing PI(4,5)P2 is strong and similar to the affinity to membranes with negatively charged or electrically neutral head groups in direct contrast to PLC-δ1, which only binds strongly to membranes containing PI(4,5)P2 and does not associate with membranes with electrically neutral surfaces (10.Garcia P.

These results unambiguously show that the PH domains of PLCs are responsible for directing phospholipid membrane interactions.Figure 2Binding of PLC -β2 (●), PLC -δ1 (▪), and β2PH-L/δ1(▾) to electrically neutral 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) membranes. Membrane binding in this study was measured by preparing POPC large, unilamellar vesicles by extrusion and doping with 0.1 mol % of Laurodan (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and following the increase in emission intensity (λex = 350 nm) and shift to higher emission energy scanning from 380–560 nm (see Ref. 12.Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The apparent affinities were obtained by averaging 2–4 independent lipid titration curves and fitting the curves assuming that the proteins simply partition onto the membrane rather than forming specific 1:1 lipid complexes. The apparent affinities reported here represent the lipid concentration required to bind 50% of the protein. Fitting errors are reported. ND is not determined. Open table in a new tab We compared the specific enzymatic activities of PLC-β2and -δ1 and the chimeras using PI(4,5)P2substrate dispersed in neutral dodecyl maltoside micelles under previously described conditions (15.Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15563-15574Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The k cat(apparent) of PLC-δ1 is 140 s−1compared with 2 s−1 for PLC-β2 and for the β2/δ1 chimeric proteins. These results are consistent with previous work showing that deletion of the PH domain of PLC-δ1 reduces catalytic activity and that the presence of the PLC-δ PH domain, or mutations in this region, enhances the activity of the catalytic core (19.Cifuentes M.E. Honkanen L. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11586-11593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Chuang T.T. Pompili E. Paolucci L. Sallese M. Degioia L. Salmona M. Deblasi A. Eur. J.

The results in Fig.3 show that the enzymatic activities of PLC-β2 and β2/δ1 are enhanced identically by Gβγ, while PLC-δ1 activity remains unchanged.Figure 3The effect of Gβγ on β2/δ1, PLC -β2, and PLC -δ1 enzymatic activity with Gβγ. Activity measurements were performed using 4 nm PLC-β2, 4 nm β2/δ1 chimeras for 2 min, and 2 nm PLC-δ1 for 20 s on sonicated bilayers composed of POPE:POPS:PI(4,5)P2 (31:66:2) doped with 3[H]PI(4,5)P2 and containing varying amounts of recombinant Gβ1γ2 as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see Ref. 15.Runnels L.W.

The short assay time used for PLC-δ1 was because of its much higherk cat (apparent) in the absence of Gβ1γ2 (140 s−1) as compared with those of PLC-β2 and the chimeras (2 s−1). The level and activation and the potency of the response was the same within error for both chimeras β2PH/δ1 (●), β2PH-L/δ1 (■), and PLC-β2 (▾). Activation of PLC-δ1 was not observed (▪).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The relationship between activation and the strength of lateral association of the PLCs with Gβγ was determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, in which Gβγ was covalently labeled with a fluorescence energy transfer donor and reconstituted on lipid bilayers, and PLC labeled with a non-fluorescent acceptor was added under conditions where the protein would be completely membrane bound similar to our previous work (15.Runnels L.W.

We note that other groups have demonstrated the association of the PH domains of other Gβγ effectors using column-based methods (e.g. Ref. 22.Mahadevan D. Thanki N. Singh J. McPhie P. Zangrilli D.

The data in Fig. 4 show that PLC-β2 and β2/δ1 have comparable Gβγ binding affinities, both of which are stronger than PLC-δ1. However, it is clear when comparing the data in Figs. 3 and 4 that the activation of PLC-β2 and β2/δ1 by Gβγ is not simply a function of the affinity between the interacting species.Figure 4Lateral association of the full-length PLC -β2 and the chimeras to Gβγ on membrane surfaces.Gβγ subunits were labeled with the fluorescence energy transfer donor 7-methoxycoumarin succinyl ester (see Ref. 16.Runnels L.W.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”), and β2PH-L/δ1(▴), PLC-β2 (●), and PLC-δ1 (▪) were labeled with the non-fluorescent energy transfer acceptor, 4-(dimethylamino)phenylazophenyl-4-sulfonyl chloride succinyl ester. Association between the proteins on membrane surfaces generally results in an ∼15% loss in donor fluorescence because of transfer after correcting for dilution. In this series of studies, 10 nm7-methoxycoumarin-Gβγ was reconstituted onto extruded bilayers, 350 μm POPC:POPS:POPE (1:1:1) with 2% PI(4,5)P2added to ensure complete binding of PLC-δ1, at 50:1 lipid:protein ratio. The apparent bimolecular association curve, which was determined from the decrease in integrated spectral area as the acceptor labeled-proteins are added, was calculated assuming that the maximum loss in fluorescence represents the maximum extent of formation of the 1:1 complex. Control studies substituted labeled PLCs for unlabeled protein, or only buffer. For comparative purposes, data were taken at identical lipid concentrations, but note that the apparent affinities will depend on the concentration of lipid. Treatment of the quasi-two-dimensional affinities can be found elsewhere (15.Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15563-15574Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe results of this study show that the PH domain of PLC-β2 is responsible for the low basal activity, the nonspecific membrane binding behavior, and the Gβγ-dependent activation of full-length native PLC β2. We propose a model in which activation of PLC results from contacts between the PH domain and the catalytic core. In the case of PLC-β or the chimeras, these contacts are produced by re-positioning of the PH domain upon lateral association to Gβγ subunits. In the case of PLC-δ, these contacts are produced by re-positioning of the PH domain upon its specific association to PI(4,5)P2 which is based on the observation that binding of the PH domain of PLC-δ to PIP(4,5)P2 induces activation (23.Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.F. Wang L.P. Kuan Y. Liu S. Fesik S.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25316-25326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Taken together, we have found that introducing the PH domain of PLC-β2 into PLC-δ1 enzyme yields a Gβγ-regulated PLC isoform. Our results show that PH domains may not simply function to tether or dock the host protein to a binding partner but may directly mediate activation of the catalytic core. Although this study focuses on PLC-β2, several physiological responses are mediated through Gβγ-effector activation. The dramatic changes in PLC-δ1 activity, membrane binding, and Gβγ activation by replacement with a homologous region of a closely related protein module may lead to the design of constructs with specific and individual characteristics, or to the design of peptide and small molecules inhibitors. Pleckstrin homology (PH)1 domains are ∼100 amino acid structural modules which, despite low amino acid sequence homology (i.e. only one conserved residue), appear to have the same overall spatial topology of a barrel-like structure formed from seven β-sheets with one side closed off by a C-terminal α-helix (for review, see Ref. 1.Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). PH domains have been identified in over 100 diverse proteins involved in cell signaling and/or membrane/cytoskeletal interactions. While it is generally agreed that PH domains help tether their host proteins to membrane surfaces, some PH domains, such as that of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (2.Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Touhara K. Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17000-17005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), have also been implicated as binding sites for Gβγ subunits. All mammalian inositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes contain a PH domain at their N terminus. PLCs are soluble enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of a minor component in membranes, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), releasing the two second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (for review, see Refs. 4.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar and 5.Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharm. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These enzymes have a multidomain structure (Fig. 1) containing, besides the N-terminal PH domain, four elongation factor (EF) hands, a catalytic X-Y domain with an insertion of varying length, and a C2 domain (6.Williams R.L. Katan M. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 1387-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). There are three known families of mammalian PLCs (β, γ, and δ), each with a distinct set of protein regulators. PLC-β isoenzymes are activated by αq and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins (G proteins). PLC-γ enzymes are regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases. Protein regulators of PLC-δ enzymes are unknown although RhoGAP and transglutaminase have been implicated (7.Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 8.Feng J.F. Rhee S.G. Im M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). PLCs must associate with membranes during catalysis, and their PH domain plays a key role in membrane attachment. The PH domain of PLC-γ binds specifically to membranes containing PI(3,4,5)P3 (9.Falasca M. Logan S. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and the PH domain of PLC-δ binds strongly to membranes containing PI(4,5)P2 (10.Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 11.Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In contrast, the PH domain of PLC-β binds strongly and nonspecifically to membranes which helps to promote its lateral association with G protein subunits, and it has been found that the isolated PH domain of PLC-β2 binds to G-βγ on membranes with a similar strong affinity as that of its full-length native enzyme (12.Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PLC-δ1, which is not activated by Gβγ, and its isolated PH domain bind to Gβγ with about a quarter to a tenth the affinity of the PH domain of PLC-β2 (12.Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, PLC-β2 must contain additional determinants that confer activation by Gβγ. Although previous studies using small peptides suggest that these determinants lie in the catalytic domain, we present evidence here using PLC chimeras that these regions are located within the PH domain (13.Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14.Tall E. Dorman G. Garcia P. Runnels L. Shah S. Chen J. Profit A. Gu Q.M. Chaudhary A. Prestwich G.D. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7239-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RESULTSTo clearly define the role of the PH domain of PLC-β2 in its activation by Gβγ subunits, we have constructed two chimeric proteins in which the PH domain of PLC-β2 is used to replace that of PLC-δ1(Fig. 1). The first of these (β2PH/δ1) swapped only the PH domain as defined by the sequence and crystallographic data (17.Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The second (β2PH-L/δ1) swapped the PH domain along with a short linker region to the EF hands, which has been used in our previous work (12.Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This longer construct was based on studies by Lefkowitz and co-workers showing that a 20-residue extension of the C terminus of the PH domain of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase played a critical role in Gβγ activation (2.Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Touhara K. Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for both constructs, indicating that the linker region between the PH domain and the EF hands has little effect on Gβγ regulation.The β2/δ1 chimeric proteins associate with membranes with a specificity identical to PLC-β2 and distinct from PLC-δ1 (Fig.2, TableI). The apparent binding affinity to membranes containing PI(4,5)P2 is strong and similar to the affinity to membranes with negatively charged or electrically neutral head groups in direct contrast to PLC-δ1, which only binds strongly to membranes containing PI(4,5)P2 and does not associate with membranes with electrically neutral surfaces (10.Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These results unambiguously show that the PH domains of PLCs are responsible for directing phospholipid membrane interactions.Table IComparison of the apparent membrane binding affinities of PLC-β2, PLC-δ1 and β2/δ1chimeras (in μm)POPCPOPC:POPS (1:2)POPC: 2% PI(4,5)P2PLC-β292 ± 857 ± 772 ± 9PLC-δ1>1000>100029 ± 9β2PH-L/δ162 ± 1298 ± 1870 ± 10β2PH/δ1ND69 ± 11NDMembrane binding was assessed by either labeling the proteins (1:1) with coumarin succinyl ester and following the large increase in intensity of the coumarin label as the protein binds to unlabeled membranes or by doping the preformed membranes with a fluorescent detergent (Laurodan) and following the change emission as unlabeled protein binds (see Refs. 12.Wang T.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The apparent affinities were obtained by averaging 2–4 independent lipid titration curves and fitting the curves assuming that the proteins simply partition onto the membrane rather than forming specific 1:1 lipid complexes. The apparent affinities reported here represent the lipid concentration required to bind 50% of the protein. Fitting errors are reported. ND is not determined. Open table in a new tab We compared the specific enzymatic activities of PLC-β2and -δ1 and the chimeras using PI(4,5)P2substrate dispersed in neutral dodecyl maltoside micelles under previously described conditions (15.Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15563-15574Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The k cat(apparent) of PLC-δ1 is 140 s−1compared with 2 s−1 for PLC-β2 and for the β2/δ1 chimeric proteins. These results are consistent with previous work showing that deletion of the PH domain of PLC-δ1 reduces catalytic activity and that the presence of the PLC-δ PH domain, or mutations in this region, enhances the activity of the catalytic core (19.Cifuentes M.E. Honkanen L. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11586-11593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Chuang T.T. Pompili E. Paolucci L. Sallese M. Degioia L. Salmona M. Deblasi A. Eur. J.

The results in Fig.3 show that the enzymatic activities of PLC-β2 and β2/δ1 are enhanced identically by Gβγ, while PLC-δ1 activity remains unchanged.Figure 3The effect of Gβγ on β2/δ1, PLC -β2, and PLC -δ1 enzymatic activity with Gβγ. Activity measurements were performed using 4 nm PLC-β2, 4 nm β2/δ1 chimeras for 2 min, and 2 nm PLC-δ1 for 20 s on sonicated bilayers composed of POPE:POPS:PI(4,5)P2 (31:66:2) doped with 3[H]PI(4,5)P2 and containing varying amounts of recombinant Gβ1γ2 as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see Ref. 15.Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15563-15574Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) where (n = 7). The short assay time used for PLC-δ1 was because of its much higherk cat (apparent) in the absence of Gβ1γ2 (140 s−1) as compared with those of PLC-β2 and the chimeras (2 s−1). The level and activation and the potency of the response was the same within error for both chimeras β2PH/δ1 (●), β2PH-L/δ1 (■), and PLC-β2 (▾). Activation of PLC-δ1 was not observed (▪).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The relationship between activation and the strength of lateral association of the PLCs with Gβγ was determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, in which Gβγ was covalently labeled with a fluorescence energy transfer donor and reconstituted on lipid bilayers, and PLC labeled with a non-fluorescent acceptor was added under conditions where the protein would be completely membrane bound similar to our previous work (15.Runnels L.W.

We note that other groups have demonstrated the association of the PH domains of other Gβγ effectors using column-based methods (e.g. Ref. 22.Mahadevan D. Thanki N. Singh J. McPhie P. Zangrilli D.

The data in Fig. 4 show that PLC-β2 and β2/δ1 have comparable Gβγ binding affinities, both of which are stronger than PLC-δ1. However, it is clear when comparing the data in Figs. 3 and 4 that the activation of PLC-β2 and β2/δ1 by Gβγ is not simply a function of the affinity between the interacting species.Figure 4Lateral association of the full-length PLC -β2 and the chimeras to Gβγ on membrane surfaces.Gβγ subunits were labeled with the fluorescence energy transfer donor 7-methoxycoumarin succinyl ester (see Ref. 16.Runnels L.W. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”), and β2PH-L/δ1(▴), PLC-β2 (●), and PLC-δ1 (▪) were labeled with the non-fluorescent energy transfer acceptor, 4-(dimethylamino)phenylazophenyl-4-sulfonyl chloride succinyl ester. Association between the proteins on membrane surfaces generally results in an ∼15% loss in donor fluorescence because of transfer after correcting for dilution.

DISCUSSIONThe results of this study show that the PH domain of PLC-β2 is responsible for the low basal activity, the nonspecific membrane binding behavior, and the Gβγ-dependent activation of full-length native PLC β2. We propose a model in which activation of PLC results from contacts between the PH domain and the catalytic core. In the case of PLC-β or the chimeras, these contacts are produced by re-positioning of the PH domain upon lateral association to Gβγ subunits. In the case of PLC-δ, these contacts are produced by re-positioning of the PH domain upon its specific association to PI(4,5)P2 which is based on the observation that binding of the PH domain of PLC-δ to PIP(4,5)P2 induces activation (23.Lomasney J.W.

https://openalex.org/W1974771633,"Caveolin-1 is the major coat protein of caveolae and has been reported to interact with various intracellular signaling molecules including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. To investigate the involvement of caveolin-1 in EGF receptor action, we used mouse B82L fibroblasts transfected with (a) wild type EGF receptor, (b) a C-terminally truncated EGF receptor at residue 1022, (c) a C-terminally truncated EGF receptor at residue 973, or (d) a kinase-inactive EGF receptor (K721M). Following EGF treatment, there was a distinct electrophoretic mobility shift of the caveolin-1 present in cells expressing the truncated forms of the EGF receptor, but this shift was not detectable in cells bearing either normal levels of the wild type EGF receptor or a kinase-inactive receptor. This mobility shift was also not observed following the addition of other cell stimuli, such as platelet-derived growth factor, insulin, basic fibroblast growth factor, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Analysis of caveolin-1 immunoprecipitates from EGF-stimulated or nonstimulated cells demonstrated that the EGF-induced mobility shift of caveolin-1 was associated with its tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing truncated EGF receptors. Maximal caveolin-1 phosphorylation was achieved within 5 min after exposure to 10 nm EGF and remained elevated for at least 2 h. Additionally, several distinct phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (60, 45, 29, 24, and 20 kDa) were co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-1 in an EGF-dependent manner. Furthermore, the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP1, does not affect autophosphorylation of the receptor, but it does inhibit the EGF-induced mobility shift and phosphorylation of caveolin-1. Conversely, the MEK inhibitors PD98059 and UO126 could attenuate EGF-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, they do not affect the EGF-induced mobility shift of caveolin-1. Because truncation and overexpression of the EGF receptor have been linked to cell transformation, these results provide the first evidence that the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 occurs via an EGF-sensitive signaling pathway that can be potentiated by an aberrant activity or expression of various forms of the EGF receptor. Caveolin-1 is the major coat protein of caveolae and has been reported to interact with various intracellular signaling molecules including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. To investigate the involvement of caveolin-1 in EGF receptor action, we used mouse B82L fibroblasts transfected with (a) wild type EGF receptor, (b) a C-terminally truncated EGF receptor at residue 1022, (c) a C-terminally truncated EGF receptor at residue 973, or (d) a kinase-inactive EGF receptor (K721M). Following EGF treatment, there was a distinct electrophoretic mobility shift of the caveolin-1 present in cells expressing the truncated forms of the EGF receptor, but this shift was not detectable in cells bearing either normal levels of the wild type EGF receptor or a kinase-inactive receptor. This mobility shift was also not observed following the addition of other cell stimuli, such as platelet-derived growth factor, insulin, basic fibroblast growth factor, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Analysis of caveolin-1 immunoprecipitates from EGF-stimulated or nonstimulated cells demonstrated that the EGF-induced mobility shift of caveolin-1 was associated with its tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing truncated EGF receptors. Maximal caveolin-1 phosphorylation was achieved within 5 min after exposure to 10 nm EGF and remained elevated for at least 2 h. Additionally, several distinct phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (60, 45, 29, 24, and 20 kDa) were co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-1 in an EGF-dependent manner. Furthermore, the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP1, does not affect autophosphorylation of the receptor, but it does inhibit the EGF-induced mobility shift and phosphorylation of caveolin-1. Conversely, the MEK inhibitors PD98059 and UO126 could attenuate EGF-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, they do not affect the EGF-induced mobility shift of caveolin-1. Because truncation and overexpression of the EGF receptor have been linked to cell transformation, these results provide the first evidence that the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 occurs via an EGF-sensitive signaling pathway that can be potentiated by an aberrant activity or expression of various forms of the EGF receptor. epidermal growth factor platelet-derived growth factor phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate basic fibroblast growth factor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase Upon ligand binding, the activated epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 receptor mediates a number of important biological responses, including the stimulation of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (1.Ullrich A.

The EGF receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein that consists of an extracellular EGF binding domain in its amino terminus, a transmembrane spanning region, and a cytoplasmic EGF-stimulated protein-tyrosine kinase domain in its C terminus. The C terminus of the EGF receptor is critical for its kinase activity and substrate specificity. For example, the C terminus of the EGF receptor contains five sites of EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (tyrosines 992, 1068, 1086, 1148, and 1173) (1.Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar, 2.Boonstra J. Rijken P. Humbel B. Cremers F. Verkleij A. van Bergen en Henegouwen P. Cell Biol. Int. 1995; 19: 413-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and these residues have been proposed to serve an autoinhibitory function that can be attenuated by autophosphorylation or truncation (4.Bertics P.J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 3610-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, removal of the C-terminal 195 or 213 amino acids from the receptor deletes these autophosphorylation sites but allows for an enhanced and/or altered EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of protein substrates in vivo (6.Walton G.M. Chen W.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transforming protein of the avian erythroblastosis virus, v-erbB, differs from the EGF receptor in that it is constitutively active and lacks most of the extracellular ligand binding domain as well as much of the cytoplasmic autophosphorylation region of the EGF receptor (7.Downward J. Yarden Y. Mayes E. Scrace G. Totty N. Stockwell P. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar, 8.Maihle N.J. Kung H.-J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 287-304Google Scholar). Successive truncation at the C terminus of v-erb B increases the capacity of the virus to induce sarcomas and decreases its ability to cause erythroblastosis, suggesting that changes in the C terminus may affect cellular substrate specificity (8.Maihle N.J. Kung H.-J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 287-304Google Scholar, 9.Khazaie K. Dull T.J. Graf T. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Beug H. Vennstrom B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3061-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation sites in the EGF receptor C terminus have also been reported to be the major binding regions for signal transducers that contain Src homology type 2 domain or phosphotyrosine-binding domain, such as phospholipase C-γ1, Grb2, and Shc, which are effectors that are directly affected by the EGF receptor (1.Ullrich A.

Although the association of phosphorylated wild type EGF receptors with these proteins provides a mechanism for triggering downstream signals, truncated receptors that lack the five C-terminal autophosphorylation sites can also activate gene transcription and induce mitogenesis and cell transformation (11.Gotoh N. Tojo A. Muroya K. Hahsimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Yashio Y. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12.Sasaoka T.

These studies suggest that truncated receptors have a sufficient or altered specificity for target proteins and thus establish appropriate and/or unique signaling pathways without direct association of Src homology type 2 domain-containing signaling molecules to receptor phosphotyrosines. Caveolae are specialized, Triton X-insoluble microdomains in the plasma membrane that are thought to be present in most cell types (15.Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Although they were originally implicated in cellular transport processes, recent evidence suggests that they may participate in signal transduction-related events (16.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Relative to the rest of the plasma membrane, caveolae membrane fractions are enriched in various signaling molecules, receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, and lipids known to be intermediates in cell signaling (15.Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 17.Couet J. Li S.W. Okamoto T. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc.

Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar). Of specific interest is the observation that caveolae have been identified as sites that are enriched in the EGF receptor and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, and both EGF and PDGF stimulate the recruitment of multiple signaling molecules to caveolae (20.Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 21.Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). This information suggests that caveolae can play an important role in the signal transduction processes induced by receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, such as the EGF receptor. Caveolin-1 is a 21–24-kDa integral protein that acts as the coat protein of caveolae, and both its N-terminal and C-terminal domains are cytoplasmically oriented (16.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 22.Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a cytosolic N-terminal juxtamembrane domain (residue 82–101) known as the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain can interact directly with certain lipid-modified signaling molecules such as heterotrimeric G-proteins, Src family tyrosine kinases, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, and Ha-Ras through a common motif found within these signaling molecules (16.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). These interactions are believed to sequester the proteins within caveolae and to modulate or suppress their catalytic activities (16.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar,23.Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 was first identified as one of the major v-Src substrates in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells, and the linkage of caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation with v-Src-induced cell transformation suggests that caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation may be a critical process during cell transformation (24.Glenney Jr., J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 25.Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, caveolin-1 expression has been shown to be reduced in human mammary carcinoma cells and in cells transformed by activated oncogenes (26.Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar,27.Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbell D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Furthermore, re-expression of caveolin-1 in oncogenically transformed cells and in human breast cancer cells has been found to inhibit cell growth, implicating caveolin-1 in the regulation of the proliferation of numerous cell types (27.Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbell D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 28.Engelman J.A. Wykoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the EGF receptor/kinase population in the Triton X-insoluble fraction of murine B82L fibroblasts and human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells exhibits an increased EGF-stimulated specific kinase activity, suggesting that the association of the EGF receptor with a Triton X-insoluble component(s) can affect kinase activity (29.Benlimame N. Le P.U. Nabi I.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1773-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30.Gronowski A.M. Bertics P.J.

Caveolin-1 is a marker protein of the Triton X-insoluble plasma membrane and has been shown to interact with the EGF receptor and to inhibit receptor kinase activity in vitro (23.Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In addition, EGF receptors lacking 164 amino acids at its C terminus have an altered substrate specificity, indicating that C-terminal domain is instrumental in defining the substrate specificity of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (32.Li X.

Given that overexpression and/or truncation of the EGF receptor has been found to be oncogenic (34.Dickson R.B. Johnson M.D. el-Ashry D. Shi Y.E. Bano M. Zugmaier G. Ziff B. Lippman M.E.

Micro BCA protein assay reagents were purchased from Pierce. Chemiluminescent reagents were obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Murine B82L parental fibroblasts were grown on 10-cm plastic tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% Cosmic calf serum. B82L cells transfected with wild type or mutated EGF receptors were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% Cosmic calf serum and 10 μm methotrexate (because a mutant dihydrofolate reductase gene was used as a selectable marker) (38.Simonsen C.C. Levinson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2485-2499Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 3 days to approximately 70% confluence and were serum-starved overnight using 0.1% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before treatment. Cells were trypsinized and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH, 7.4, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 145 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA) containing 1% Cosmic calf serum. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were stained for 30 min with either monoclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody (528) or IgG isotype control (1 μg of antibody/2–3 × 105cell in 100 μl). The cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min with anti-mouse IgG-R-phycoerythrin conjugate (1 μg antibody/2 × 105 cell in 100 μl) for 30 min. Cells were subsequently washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed on the same day using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). All antibody incubations and washing steps were carried out at 4 °C. For the EGF receptor and caveolin-1 expression assay, 5 × 106 cells expressing various EGF receptor constructs were lysed with 1 ml of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0). For assays of extracellularly regulated kinase (ERK1/ERK2) activation, caveolin-1 electrophoretic mobility shift, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of total cellular proteins, nearly confluent (70%) serum-starved cells were treated with control buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) or with 50 nm EGF, and the cells were lysed with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer at the indicated times. The protein level of each sample was determined by the Micro BCA assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein (30–50 μg) were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to immunoblotting. Serum-starved cells expressing various EGF receptor constructs were treated with control buffer or with EGF (0.1–100 nm), and the cells were then lysed in immunoprecipitation assay (IPA) buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatants were precleared by incubating with protein A-conjugated agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 1 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatants were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using 2 μg of either polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody, polyclonal anti-Src antibody, polyclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody, nonspecific rabbit IgG, or monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20) and an overnight incubation at 4 °C followed by an incubation with protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads three times with ice-cold IPA buffer with detergent and three times with IPA buffer without detergent, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. Serum-starved cells expressing various EGF receptor constructs were pretreated with vehicle (0.5% Me2SO) for 15 min, with PD98059 (50 or 100 nm) for 1 h, or with UO126 (10 or 50 nm) for 15 min, or with PP1 (1 or 3 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C. After pretreatment, the cells were stimulated with control buffer or with EGF and were lysed using either 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer or IPA buffer (for immunoprecipitation experiment). Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were processed via SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. In these experiments, caveolin-1 immunoprecipitates from EGF-stimulated cells were prepared as described above and then washed twice with dephosphorylation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm benzamidine). The beads were then resuspended in 0.2 ml of dephosphorylation buffer, and 50 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were added in the absence or presence of 1 mm Na3VO4for 20 min at 37 °C. Beads were then washed twice with ice-cold IPA buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described by Bates et al. (39.Bates M.E. Busse W.W. Bertics P.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked in 0.25% gelatin/TBST overnight at 4 °C and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with antibodies against phosphotyrosine (a mixture of 2 μg of 4G10 and 2 μg of PY-20 in 5 ml of 0.25% gelatin/TBST). For immunoblotting analysis using other antibodies, the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk/TBST overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with 2 μg of primary antibodies in 5% nonfat dried milk/TBST for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the membrane was washed three times in TBST, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed in TBST three times. The labeled proteins were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. For subsequent probing of the same membrane, the membrane was incubated in a stripping buffer (62.5 mmTris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol) at 70 °C for 30 min, washed extensively, reblocked with 5% nonfat milk, and reprobed with other antibodies. To investigate the involvement of caveolin-1 in EGF receptor signaling, mouse B82L fibroblast cells (B82L parental) that lack detectable endogenous EGF receptors were transfected with constructs encoding either the wild type human EGF receptor (WT), C-terminally truncated receptors at residues 1022 or 973 (ct1022, ct973, and ct973*), or a kinase-inactive receptor (K721M) as diagrammed in Fig. 1 A. The ct973* EGF receptor differs from ct973 in that a tag, NPVYRRPQSKLGSL, has been fused to the C terminus of ct973, and both ct973 and ct973* receptors have been known to behave similarly in various studies, such as those examining EGF-induced receptor endocytosis (40.Chang C.P.

Expression levels of wild type and mutant EGF receptors were assessed by anti-EGF receptor immunoblotting using extracts prepared from same number of cells (9 × 104 cells/lane) as shown in Fig. 1 B. Two separate populations of B82L cells expressing the wild type EGF receptors were used in these studies. WT-L cells have been characterized to have 1–2 × 105 EGF receptors/cell (14.Chen W.S.

To examine the cell surface expression of the various forms of the EGF receptor, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed (Fig. 1 D). Similar to the results shown in Fig. 1 B, these experiments revealed that WT-L cells contain lower levels of cell surface EGF receptor than the other transfectants. In addition, the fluorescent intensities for cells expressing either the ct973 or ct973 tag receptors were higher than that for cells containing the ct1022 receptor. It has been reported that the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by various activated oncogenes and the expression of a temperature sensitive v-Src in Rat-1 cells at the permissive temperature lead to a general reduction of caveolin-1 expression and the number of caveolae (26.Koleske A.J.

To determine whether the expression of the wild type or mutant EGF receptors affects caveolin-1 expression, we evaluated caveolin-1 expression level in each transfectant by immunoblotting with anti-caveolin-1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 C, there appeared to be no correlation between caveolin-1 expression and the level of different forms of the EGF receptor. Because the C terminus of the EGF receptor is known to regulate its kinase activity and substrate specificity (6.Walton G.M. Chen W.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol.

Serum-starved cells were stimulated with or without EGF, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was assessed by immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies.

However, as with other Gram-positive bacterial species, the nature of the attachment between the GBS capsular polysaccharide and the bacterial cell is incompletely understood. In Gram-negative bacteria, the capsular polysaccharide is linked via a lipid moiety to the bacterial outer membrane (31.Gotschlich E.C. Fraser B.A. Nishimura O. Robbins J.B. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol.

By contrast, evidence from studies of S. pneumoniae,Staphylococcus aureus, and GBS suggest that the capsular polysaccharide of each of these Gram-positive pathogens is covalently attached to the bacterial cell wall (17.deCueninck B.J. Shockman G.D. Swenson R.M. Infect. Immun. 1982; 35: 572-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Yeung M.K. Mattingly S.J. Curr.

Treatment of the bacterial cells with enzymes that cleave peptidoglycan releases the capsular polysaccharide from the cell, suggesting a direct or indirect linkage of capsule to cell wall peptidoglycan. deCueninck et al. (17.deCueninck B.J. Shockman G.D. Swenson R.M. Infect. Immun. 1982; 35: 572-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that mutanolysin treatment of type III GBS cell walls yielded soluble complexes that contained constituents of peptidoglycan, group B carbohydrate, and capsular polysaccharide. The complexes could be cleaved by base treatment to release capsular polysaccharide free of peptidoglycan. In similar experiments, Yeung and Mattingly (18.Yeung M.K. Mattingly S.J. Curr. Microbiol. 1986; 14: 205-211Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) analyzed capsular polysaccharide released by base treatment and detected alanine, lysine, and glutamic acid in addition to the constituent sugars of the type III polysaccharide. On the basis of this evidence, they suggested that the capsular polysaccharide was attached to the peptide cross-bridges of GBS peptidoglycan.In the present study, we confirmed the hypothesis suggested by earlier reports that both the capsular polysaccharide and the group B carbohydrate are covalently bound to the cell wall. Insoluble cell wall complexes isolated from type III GBS were found to contain immunoreactive type III polysaccharide and to contain sugars characteristic of both type III capsular polysaccharide and group B carbohydrate in addition to the expected sugars and amino acids of GBS peptidoglycan. Treatment of the insoluble cell wall complexes with the endo-N-acetylmuramidase mutanolysin released soluble complexes that contained both capsular polysaccharide and group B carbohydrate. Covalent attachment of the two polysaccharides was suggested by their coelution on both ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and by their comigration in electrophoresis. Separation of the capsular polysaccharide and group B carbohydrate was achieved by treatment with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, an enzyme that cleaves the glycosidic bond of the β-d-GlcNAc(1→4)β-d-MurNAc disaccharide that is the product of complete mutanolysin digestion of the glycan backbone of GBS peptidoglycan. Analysis of the separated polysaccharides revealed that the group B carbohydrate was linked to muramic acid directly or via a cross-linking peptide, while the capsular polysaccharide was linked via a phosphodiester bond and a linking oligosaccharide to N-acetylglucosamine.In general, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase cleaves the glycosidic bond of a terminal residue ofN-acetylglucosamine. However, in the present study, enzyme treatment of the capsular polysaccharide-group B carbohydrate complex produced products of M r ∼10,000 to >100,000, a result that implies cleavage of internal linkages within the complex. Several pieces of evidence suggest the site of action of the enzyme is the β-d-GlcNAc(1→4)β-d-MurNAc bond in polysaccharide-substituted disaccharide fragments of peptidoglycan produced by mutanolysin digestion. 1) Sequential treatment of purified GBS peptidoglycan with mutanolysin followed by β-N-acetylglucosaminidase resulted in the release of freeN-acetylglucosamine (data not shown), a result that confirms susceptibility of the β-d-GlcNAc(1→4)β-d-MurNAc bond to β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (the released freeN-acetylglucosamine presumably represents residues that were unsubstituted in the native state or residues from which the capsular polysaccharide was cleaved during purification of the peptidoglycan). 2) The capsular polysaccharide was released from insoluble cell wall complexes by β-N-acetylglucosaminidase only after digestion of the peptidoglycan with mutanolysin, which exposesN-acetylglucosamine residues. 3) β-N-Acetylglucosaminidase digestion of the complexes separated capsular polysaccharide from group B carbohydrate, an observation that implies the enzyme acts on a moiety that links the two polysaccharides. 4) Muramic acid remained with the group B carbohydrate after β-N-acetylglucosaminidase treatment, while reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues were detected in the capsular polysaccharide fraction. Thus, evidence from several different experimental approaches indicates that β-N-acetylglucosaminidase cleaves the glycosidic linkage to muramic acid of (polysaccharide-substituted)N-acetylglucosamine residues exposed by mutanolysin digestion of peptidoglycan.Our results do not support the earlier suggestion that the capsular polysaccharide is attached to the peptide cross-bridges of peptidoglycan (18.Yeung M.K. Mattingly S.J. Curr. Microbiol. 1986; 14: 205-211Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Rather, the data indicate that the capsule is linked to N-acetylglucosamine residues of the glycan backbone. Potentially available sites on N-acetylglucosamine residues of the GBS peptidoglycan are at C-3 and C-6. Substitution at C-6 may be more compatible with the observed sensitivity in our studies of the GBS capsular polysaccharide-peptidoglycan fragment complex to digestion with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. We speculate that substitution at C-6 is more likely to permit β-N-acetylglucosaminidase to act on a (substituted) β-linked N-acetylglucosamine residue, since a substituent at the 6-position is separated from the pyranose ring by an additional C–C bond compared with a substituent at the 3- or 4-position. The additional C–C bond separating C-6 from the pyranose ring not only places the substituent group at a greater distance from the ring structure but also probably confers greater flexibility to the portion of the molecule bearing the substituent. These effects may permit more efficient utilization by β-N-acetylglucosaminidase of a β-linked N-acetylglucosamine substituted at C-6 than one substituted at C-3. In a separate experiment, we found that the β-N-acetylglucosaminidase preparation used in our studies cleaved 4-methylumbelliferyl-7-(6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside), albeit more slowly than the standard fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (data not shown), indicating that the enzyme can cleave β-linkedN-acetylglucosamine residues bearing a substituent group at C-6.Others have reported evidence of attachment of accessory polysaccharides to the glycan portion of peptidoglycan in several Gram-positive organisms. Examples include teichoic acid ofBacillus subtilis, teichuronic acid of Micrococcus luteus, and arabinogalactan of mycobacteria (35.Munson R.S. Glaser L. Ginsburg V. Robbins P. Biology of Carbohydrates. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 91-122Google Scholar, 36.Gassner G.T. Dickie J.P. Hamerski D.A. Magnuson J.K. Anderson J.S. J.

Where it has been examined, linkage of these polymers appears to be to C-6 of theN-acetylmuramic acid residues in contrast to the linkage of the GBS capsular polysaccharide to N-acetylglucosamine residues. In the case of GBS, N-acetylmuramic acid residues may be unavailable or energetically less favorable for attachment of the capsular polysaccharide because the group B carbohydrate is linked at this site. These results indicate that the capsular polysaccharide is distinctive among GBS accessory polysaccharides not only in its central role in virulence but also in its mode of attachment to the bacterial cell. It remains to be determined whether linkage of the capsular polysaccharide to N-acetylglucosamine residues of peptidoglycan is a feature unique to GBS or a general property of encapsulated Gram-positive bacteria.Results of these studies provide direct evidence that both the capsular polysaccharide and group B carbohydrate are covalently bound to peptidoglycan of the GBS cell wall. They indicate further that the two polysaccharides are attached independently and at separate sites. The general features of this model of the GBS cell surface are likely to apply generally to other encapsulated Gram-positive bacteria. These data represent strong evidence that the mechanism and site of attachment of capsular polysaccharides to the Gram-positive cell surface is fundamentally different from that in Gram-negative bacteria and from the linkage of other accessory cell wall polysaccharides in Gram-positives. Characterization of the site of attachment and of the nature of the linkage between the capsular polysaccharide and the GBS cell wall provides new insight into the basic structure of this important pathogen and may suggest potential targets for novel antimicrobial drug design for this and other encapsulated Gram-positive bacteria.

On the basis of this evidence, they suggested that the capsular polysaccharide was attached to the peptide cross-bridges of GBS peptidoglycan.In the present study, we confirmed the hypothesis suggested by earlier reports that both the capsular polysaccharide and the group B carbohydrate are covalently bound to the cell wall. Insoluble cell wall complexes isolated from type III GBS were found to contain immunoreactive type III polysaccharide and to contain sugars characteristic of both type III capsular polysaccharide and group B carbohydrate in addition to the expected sugars and amino acids of GBS peptidoglycan. Treatment of the insoluble cell wall complexes with the endo-N-acetylmuramidase mutanolysin released soluble complexes that contained both capsular polysaccharide and group B carbohydrate. Covalent attachment of the two polysaccharides was suggested by their coelution on both ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and by their comigration in electrophoresis. Separation of the capsular polysaccharide and group B carbohydrate was achieved by treatment with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, an enzyme that cleaves the glycosidic bond of the β-d-GlcNAc(1→4)β-d-MurNAc disaccharide that is the product of complete mutanolysin digestion of the glycan backbone of GBS peptidoglycan. Analysis of the separated polysaccharides revealed that the group B carbohydrate was linked to muramic acid directly or via a cross-linking peptide, while the capsular polysaccharide was linked via a phosphodiester bond and a linking oligosaccharide to N-acetylglucosamine.In general, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase cleaves the glycosidic bond of a terminal residue ofN-acetylglucosamine. However, in the present study, enzyme treatment of the capsular polysaccharide-group B carbohydrate complex produced products of M r ∼10,000 to >100,000, a result that implies cleavage of internal linkages within the complex. Several pieces of evidence suggest the site of action of the enzyme is the β-d-GlcNAc(1→4)β-d-MurNAc bond in polysaccharide-substituted disaccharide fragments of peptidoglycan produced by mutanolysin digestion. 1) Sequential treatment of purified GBS peptidoglycan with mutanolysin followed by β-N-acetylglucosaminidase resulted in the release of freeN-acetylglucosamine (data not shown), a result that confirms susceptibility of the β-d-GlcNAc(1→4)β-d-MurNAc bond to β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (the released freeN-acetylglucosamine presumably represents residues that were unsubstituted in the native state or residues from which the capsular polysaccharide was cleaved during purification of the peptidoglycan). 2) The capsular polysaccharide was released from insoluble cell wall complexes by β-N-acetylglucosaminidase only after digestion of the peptidoglycan with mutanolysin, which exposesN-acetylglucosamine residues. 3) β-N-Acetylglucosaminidase digestion of the complexes separated capsular polysaccharide from group B carbohydrate, an observation that implies the enzyme acts on a moiety that links the two polysaccharides. 4) Muramic acid remained with the group B carbohydrate after β-N-acetylglucosaminidase treatment, while reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues were detected in the capsular polysaccharide fraction. Thus, evidence from several different experimental approaches indicates that β-N-acetylglucosaminidase cleaves the glycosidic linkage to muramic acid of (polysaccharide-substituted)N-acetylglucosamine residues exposed by mutanolysin digestion of peptidoglycan.Our results do not support the earlier suggestion that the capsular polysaccharide is attached to the peptide cross-bridges of peptidoglycan (18.Yeung M.K. Mattingly S.J. Curr. Microbiol. 1986; 14: 205-211Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Rather, the data indicate that the capsule is linked to N-acetylglucosamine residues of the glycan backbone. Potentially available sites on N-acetylglucosamine residues of the GBS peptidoglycan are at C-3 and C-6. Substitution at C-6 may be more compatible with the observed sensitivity in our studies of the GBS capsular polysaccharide-peptidoglycan fragment complex to digestion with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. We speculate that substitution at C-6 is more likely to permit β-N-acetylglucosaminidase to act on a (substituted) β-linked N-acetylglucosamine residue, since a substituent at the 6-position is separated from the pyranose ring by an additional C–C bond compared with a substituent at the 3- or 4-position. The additional C–C bond separating C-6 from the pyranose ring not only places the substituent group at a greater distance from the ring structure but also probably confers greater flexibility to the portion of the molecule bearing the substituent. These effects may permit more efficient utilization by β-N-acetylglucosaminidase of a β-linked N-acetylglucosamine substituted at C-6 than one substituted at C-3. In a separate experiment, we found that the β-N-acetylglucosaminidase preparation used in our studies cleaved 4-methylumbelliferyl-7-(6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside), albeit more slowly than the standard fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (data not shown), indicating that the enzyme can cleave β-linkedN-acetylglucosamine residues bearing a substituent group at C-6.Others have reported evidence of attachment of accessory polysaccharides to the glycan portion of peptidoglycan in several Gram-positive organisms. Examples include teichoic acid ofBacillus subtilis, teichuronic acid of Micrococcus luteus, and arabinogalactan of mycobacteria (35.Munson R.S. Glaser L. Ginsburg V. Robbins P.

Where it has been examined, linkage of these polymers appears to be to C-6 of theN-acetylmuramic acid residues in contrast to the linkage of the GBS capsular polysaccharide to N-acetylglucosamine residues. In the case of GBS, N-acetylmuramic acid residues may be unavailable or energetically less favorable for attachment of the capsular polysaccharide because the group B carbohydrate is linked at this site. These results indicate that the capsular polysaccharide is distinctive among GBS accessory polysaccharides not only in its central role in virulence but also in its mode of attachment to the bacterial cell. It remains to be determined whether linkage of the capsular polysaccharide to N-acetylglucosamine residues of peptidoglycan is a feature unique to GBS or a general property of encapsulated Gram-positive bacteria.Results of these studies provide direct evidence that both the capsular polysaccharide and group B carbohydrate are covalently bound to peptidoglycan of the GBS cell wall. They indicate further that the two polysaccharides are attached independently and at separate sites. The general features of this model of the GBS cell surface are likely to apply generally to other encapsulated Gram-positive bacteria. These data represent strong evidence that the mechanism and site of attachment of capsular polysaccharides to the Gram-positive cell surface is fundamentally different from that in Gram-negative bacteria and from the linkage of other accessory cell wall polysaccharides in Gram-positives. Characterization of the site of attachment and of the nature of the linkage between the capsular polysaccharide and the GBS cell wall provides new insight into the basic structure of this important pathogen and may suggest potential targets for novel antimicrobial drug design for this and other encapsulated Gram-positive bacteria. The capsular polysaccharide is a major surface structure of GBS isolates associated with human infection. However, as with other Gram-positive bacterial species, the nature of the attachment between the GBS capsular polysaccharide and the bacterial cell is incompletely understood. In Gram-negative bacteria, the capsular polysaccharide is linked via a lipid moiety to the bacterial outer membrane (31.Gotschlich E.C. Fraser B.A. Nishimura O. Robbins J.B. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol.

By contrast, evidence from studies of S. pneumoniae,Staphylococcus aureus, and GBS suggest that the capsular polysaccharide of each of these Gram-positive pathogens is covalently attached to the bacterial cell wall (17.deCueninck B.J.

Treatment of the bacterial cells with enzymes that cleave peptidoglycan releases the capsular polysaccharide from the cell, suggesting a direct or indirect linkage of capsule to cell wall peptidoglycan. deCueninck et al. (17.deCueninck B.J. Shockman G.D. Swenson R.M. Infect. Immun. 1982; 35: 572-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that mutanolysin treatment of type III GBS cell walls yielded soluble complexes that contained constituents of peptidoglycan, group B carbohydrate, and capsular polysaccharide.

Because reduced expression of CaSR may result in insufficient suppression of parathyroid hormone secretion, the elucidation of regulatory mechanisms of CaSR expression is indispensable for understanding the pathogenesis of parathyroid adenomas. Two cDNA clones for human CaSR with different 5′-untranslated regions have been isolated. However, the structure of the promoter region of human CaSR and the mechanisms of production of multiple CaSR mRNAs are unknown. We have cloned promoter regions of human CaSR by screening a genomic library. The human CaSR gene has two promoters and two 5′-untranslated exons (exons 1A and 1B), and alternative usage of these exons leads to production of multiple CaSR mRNAs. The upstream promoter has TATA and CAAT boxes, and the downstream promoter is GC-rich. Northern blot analysis showed that expression levels of exon 1A in parathyroid adenomas are significantly less than those in normal glands. However, expression of exon 1B was not different between adenomas and normal glands. Thus, specific reduction of the transcript driven by the upstream promoter was observed in parathyroid adenomas.

Derangements of this negative feedback system between serum calcium and PTH secretion change the set point of PTH secretion and serum calcium levels. In some hypercalcemic diseases, the elevation of the set point of PTH secretion has been reported. For example, inactivating mutations of CaSR result in inadequate suppression of PTH secretion and inappropriately high serum levels of PTH in patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (3.Pollak M.R.

However, it has been shown by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization that the expression of CaSR is decreased in parathyroid adenomas (9.Gogusev J. Duchambon P. Hory B. Giovannini M.

Because reduced expression of CaSR may also result in insufficient suppression of PTH secretion, the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of CaSR expression is indispensable for understanding the pathogenesis of parathyroid adenomas. The coding region of human CaSR is coded by six exons. In addition, two cDNA clones for human CaSR with different 5′-untranslated regions have been isolated from parathyroid adenoma (2.Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12919-12925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that the translation start site of CaSR is in exon 2, and there is at least one 5′-untranslated exon in the human CaSR gene (6.Pearce S.H. Trump D. Wooding C. Besser G.M.

However, the structure of the promoter region of human CaSR and the mechanism of the production of multiple CaSR mRNAs are unknown. In this study, we have identified and characterized the promoter regions of human CaSR by screening a genomic library. The expression levels of multiple mRNAs in normal and adenomatous parathyroid glands were also analyzed. The results indicate that the human CaSR gene has at least two promoters and that alternative usage of 5′-untranslated exons leads to the production of multiple CaSR mRNAs. In addition, the expression of CaSR mRNA produced by one of the two promoters of the CaSR gene is specifically reduced in parathyroid adenomas. Parathyroid adenoma tissues were obtained from patients who underwent surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism after informed consents were obtained. All these patients had grossly abnormal single adenomas. Normal parathyroid glands were also obtained from some of these patients because of associated thyroid diseases. The tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen as soon as possible and stored at −80 °C until use. The Megaprime DNA labeling system, [α-32P]dCTP, and Hybond-N were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Tokyo). The human genomic library was provided by the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank.Taq and LA Taq polymerases were purchased from TaKaRa (Otsu, Japan). The TA cloning kit and pcDNA3 were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). pBluescript II SK was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The dual luciferase reporter assay system and the pGL3-basic vector were from Promega (Madison, WI). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes as described (12.Chikatsu N. Fukumoto S. Suzawa M. Tanaka Y. Takeuchi Y. Takeda S. Tamura Y. Matsumoto T. Fujita T. Clin. Endocrinol. 1999; 50: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PCR using genomic DNA and LA Taqpolymerase was conducted to clarify the relationship between exons in the 5′-region of the CaSR gene. As shown in Fig. 1, the forward primers 5′-GCTGCAGCCAGGAAGGACCG-3′ and 5′-CTGCTGTGGCCGGACCCGAA-3′ and the reverse primers 5′-TTCTGCAAGACTCAGGTCAAGCGTTG-3′ and 5′-CCAGGGCTCCCTCGCACAGAG-3′, corresponding to clones A and B, respectively, were used. PCR conditions using LA Taqpolymerase were as follows: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s and 70 °C for 1 min, and final elongation at 70 °C for 5 min. The PCR product generated by the forward primer in clone A and the reverse primer in clone B was cloned by TA cloning and sequenced as described below. The insert was cut out byEcoRI and used as a probe for screening the genomic library. The human genomic library was screened by the standard plaque hybridization method. A positive clone was isolated and purified using the polyethylene glycol precipitation method. The phage insert was mapped by restriction digestion and Southern blot analysis. A fragment of 4 kb containing the 5′-region of the CaSR gene was subcloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript II SK and sequenced. Sequencing indicated that the 5′-regions of the two different CaSR clones (clones A and B) are derived from two untranslated exons (exons 1A and 1B). In addition, to clarify the DNA sequence of the upstream region of a coding exon containing the translation start site (exon 2), PCR using a phage library was employed (13.Fukumoto S. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Matsumoto T. Kato S. Fujita T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 141: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A reverse primer in an exon containing the translation start site (5′-CCAAAATGAATAGGAAAGAGCCCCCCA-3′) (see Fig. 2) and a primer corresponding to the left arm of the phage (5′-TTATGCCCGAGAAGATGTTGAGCAAACTTATCG-3′) were used. The conditions for PCR were one cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles at 98 °C for 20 s and 70 °C for 5 min, and one cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was subcloned by TA cloning and sequence by the same primers. The samples were sequenced using the PRISM Ready-Reaction dye deoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Model 373S-36 autosequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Chiba, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was prepared from each tissue by the acid/guanidium/phenol/chloroform method as described previously (14.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). 5′-RACE was carried out using a 5′-RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, total RNA (0.9 μg), isolated from human parathyroid, was reverse-transcribed, and the first-strand cDNA was purified using GlassMAX DNA isolation spin cartridges. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase tailing of the first-strand cDNA was carried out, and the tailed cDNA was amplified by PCR using Taq polymerase. PCR conditions were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 57 °C for 45 s, and 68 °C for 30 s; and final elongation at 68 °C for 5 min. The antisense primers used were 5′-CATACTCCTTTGGGTGGGCAAT-3′ for exon 1A and 5′-AAACCCGGGCTCCACGAGGATGAGCTCTGGT-3′ for exon 1B (see Fig. 2). PCR products were then cloned by TA cloning, and seven cDNA clones isolated for exon 1A and five clones for exon 1B were sequenced. Sequencing and Southern blot analysis showed that there are restriction sites for KpnI andPstI in the 5′-flanking region and in exon 1A, respectively (see Fig. 2). Therefore, to test the promoter activity of the CaSR gene, pBluescript II containing the screened 4.0-kb fragment was digested with KpnI and PstI, and the resulting 2.0-kb fragment was subcloned into pGL3-basic cut with KpnI and PstI (A-2.0). The B-0.5 vector was also constructed by inserting a 530-bp PCR fragment corresponding to the 5′-upstream region of exon 1B. The PCR product was generated using two primers with restriction sites on their ends (5′-AAAGAGCTCTGGGCACGCGATTTGTATTTA -3′ and 5′-AAACCCGGGCTCCACGAGGATGAGCTCTGGT-3′) (see Fig. 2), cut withHindIII and XbaI, and inserted in front of the coding sequence of luciferase in pGL3-basic. The MCF-7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DNA-liposome complex was prepared by mixing 0.25 μg of DNA with 1 μl of LipofectAMINE in 50 μl of serum-free medium, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then diluted with 950 μl of serum-free medium and added to cells plated in each well of six-well plates. After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, an equivalent amount of medium with 20% fetal bovine serum was added, and luciferase reporter assay for cell extracts was performed 29 h after the start of transfection. Promoter activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system and a MiniLumat LB9506 luminometer (Berthold, Osaka, Japan). Cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of each reporter recombinant along with 12.5 ng of Renilla luciferase vector (pRL-TK) as an internal control. Each luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by the Renillaluciferase assay. 6 μg of total RNA from normal parathyroid glands and 15 μg from adenoma tissues were electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-containing 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N. Each sample was electrophoresed twice, and two Hybond-N membranes containing the same samples were prepared. Initial hybridization was conducted using a DNA probe for the full-length coding region of CaSR generated by the Megaprime DNA labeling system (12.Chikatsu N. Fukumoto S. Suzawa M. Tanaka Y. Takeuchi Y. Takeda S. Tamura Y. Matsumoto T. Fujita T. Clin. Endocrinol. 1999; 50: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To examine the expression levels of exons 1A and 1B separately, PCR products corresponding to exons 1A and 1B were cloned by TA cloning. The primers used were 5′-GCTGCAGCCAGGAAGGACCG-3 and 5′-TTCTGCAAGACTCAGGTCAAGCGTTG-3′ for exon 1A and 5′-CTGCTGTGGCCGGACCCGAA-3′ and 5′-CCAGGGCTCCCTCGCACAGAG-3′ for exon 1B (see Fig. 1). After confirming the orientation of the insert by DNA sequencing, these plasmids were cut with XbaI, and T7 RNA polymerase-driven [α-32P]UTP-labeled antisense riboprobes were prepared using a Maxiscript kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Each membrane was hybridized with a probe for either exon 1A or 1B, respectively. The filters were washed to the high stringency of 0.1× SSC at 65 °C and exposed to X-Omat AR (Eastman Kodak Co.). The filters were then stripped and rehybridized with a cDNA probe for GAPDH. The amount of mRNA in each lane was quantified using a densitometer and normalized by the expression level of GAPDH. Statistical significance was analyzed either by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's method for comparison of multiple means or by Student's t test. An unadjusted p value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. Two previously reported CaSR cDNA clones (clones A and B) have the same sequence back to −242 bp from the translation start site, but their 5′-upstream regions have completely different sequences (Fig. 1) (2.Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12919-12925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These results indicate that 5′-regions of clones A and B are derived from different exons. To clarify the relationship between these exons in the 5′-region of human CaSR, we conducted PCR using genomic DNA as a template. PCR using the forward primer in clone A and the reverse primer in clone B produced a PCR product of ∼800 bp (data not shown). However, no PCR product was observed by PCR using the forward primer in clone B and the reverse primer in clone A (data not shown). These results indicate that the exon forming the 5′-region of clone A is in the 5′-position to the exon forming the 5′-region of clone B. To isolate the promoter region of human CaSR, we labeled the 800-bp PCR product described above and screened a human genomic library. A phage clone containing the 5′-flanking region of the human CaSR gene was cloned and purified using the polyethylene glycol precipitation method. A fragment of 4 kb was subcloned into pBluescript II SK. DNA sequencing of this plasmid showed that the 5′-regions of clones A and B are derived from two different untranslated exons (exons 1A and 1B) (Fig.2). In addition, exon 1B was not connected to the exon containing the translation start site (exon 2). However, because exon 2 was not included in the phage clone, the length of the intron between exons 1B and 2 was not evident. The DNA sequence of the upstream region of exon 2 was determined by PCR using the phage library as s template as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sequencing indicated that the intron between exons 1B and 2 is a U2-type GT-AG intron (15.Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 875-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). There are TATA and CAAT boxes in the upstream region of exon 1A (Fig. 2). In contrast, the region between exons 1A and 1B is GC-rich, but has no TATA box (Fig. 2). Therefore, the human CaSR gene has at least two 5′-untranslated exons, and alternate usage of these exons produces multiple CaSR mRNAs. The DNA sequences of exons 1A and 1B in Fig. 2 are the longest ones identified by 5′-RACE. 5′-RACE for clone B using mRNA from parathyroid tissue showed that clone B is at least 50 bp longer in its 5′-end than originally described (2.Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12919-12925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). 5′-RACE for clone A also showed that clone A is at least 430 bp longer than the originally described clone (2.Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12919-12925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Before examining the promoter activity of the human CaSR gene, we searched for cell lines that express CaSR. We found by Northern and Western blot analyses that MCF-7 cells express CaSR (data not shown). Therefore, we used this cell line for analyses of promoter activities. When transiently expressed in MCF-7 cells, a 4.3-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed by A-2.0 compared with that by the control vector pGL3 (Fig. 3). B-0.5 also showed a 8.2-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the human CaSR gene has at least two promoters. Hybridization with a probe for the full-coding region of CaSR identified main transcripts of ∼5.4 and ∼4–4.2 kb and a minor band of ∼10 kb in both normal and adenoma tissues (Fig. 4) as already reported (2.Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12919-12925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). We used riboprobes to distinguish the expression levels of exons 1A and 1B. Analyses by the exon 1A-specific riboprobe identified 5.4-, ∼4–4.2-, and 10-kb transcripts, suggesting the existence of alternative splicing in 3′-untranslated exons (Fig. 4). In contrast, the exon 1B-specific riboprobe showed only a ∼4–4.2-kb band (Fig.4). Although detailed mechanisms of the production of multiple transcripts from the human CaSR gene are not clear at the moment, these results indicate that 5.4- and 10-kb transcripts are specific for exon 1A. The expression levels of exon 1A were evaluated by the exon 1A-specific riboprobe, and those of the 5.4-kb band were quantified and normalized by GAPDH expression. The expression levels of this transcript in adenomas were ∼60% of and significantly less than those in normal parathyroid glands (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the expression levels of exon 1B were not different between nine adenomas and three normal glands (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that the reduction of the expression of CaSR in parathyroid adenomas is specific for mRNA containing exon 1A. We have shown that the human CaSR gene has at least two promoters and 5′-untranslated exons and produces multiple mRNAs. The coding region of human CaSR is 3234 bp, and the 5′-untranslated region that is common to both clones A and B is 242 bp long (2.Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12919-12925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Two 3′-untranslated sequences of ∼180 bp and 1300 bp have also been reported (2.Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12919-12925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). We have shown here that exon 1A for human CaSR is ∼560 bp. Therefore, using two 3′-untranslated regions, CaSR mRNAs containing exon 1A seem to be ∼4.2 and 5.4 kb. The mechanism of the production of 10-kb CaSR mRNA is not clear. However, mRNA of a similar size has also been reported in a human medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line and in other species including mouse (16.Freichel M. Zink-Lorenz A. Holloschi A. Hafner M. Flockerzi V. Raue F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3842-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17.Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O. Butters Jr., R. Sugimoto T. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1530-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 18.Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Kifor O. Brown E.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On the other hand, exon 1B is ∼250 bp long. If the short 3′-untranslated region is used, mRNA containing exon 1B is calculated to be ∼3.9 kb. The absence of larger transcripts by the exon 1B-specific probe indicates that only the short 3′-untranslated sequence is used. Although the mechanism of selective usage of the 3′-untranslated exon is unclear at the moment, probes specific for these two 3′-untranslated regions may be useful to further characterize multiple CaSR mRNAs. Human CaSR has at least two promoters. The upstream promoter has TATA and CAAT boxes, and the downstream promoter is a GC-rich promoter without a TATA box. The presence of multiple promoters is reported in many other genes, including PTH/PTH-related protein receptor and PTH-related protein (19.McCuaig K.A. Lee H.S. Clarke J.C. Assar H. Horsford J. White J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1948-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20.Joun H. Lanske B. Karperien M. Qian F. Defize L. Abou-Samra A. McCuaig K.A. Lee H.S. Clarke J.C.

Because the structure of the two promoter regions of human CaSR is different, it is likely that the regulation of promoter activity is promoter-specific. It is also likely that these two promoters are regulated in a tissue-dependent manner. Further study employing other tissues is necessary to address these issues. Although these two promoters are active in both normal human parathyroid glands and parathyroid adenomas, the expression of the transcript driven by the upstream promoter and containing exon 1A is decreased in adenomas, whereas that driven by the downstream promoter is not altered. These results suggest that the upstream promoter activity is reduced in parathyroid adenomas. Although normal parathyroid glands were obtained from patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in our study, the expression levels of CaSR in normal parathyroid glands from patients with primary hyperparathyroidism were shown to be the same as those from eucalcemic normal controls (11.Farnebo F. Enberg U. Grimelius L. Backdahl M. Schalling M. Larsson C. Farnebo L.O. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Previous study using immunohistochemistry orin situ hybridization indicated that the expression of CaSR in parathyroid adenomas was reduced to ∼60% of that in normal glands (10.Kifor O. Moore Jr., F. Wang P. Goldstein M. Vassilev P. Kifor I. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Farnebo F. Enberg U. Grimelius L. Backdahl M. Schalling M. Larsson C. Farnebo L.O. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Our results show that the expression level of CaSR mRNA containing exon 1A in adenomas is ∼60% of that in normal parathyroid glands. It is difficult to precisely analyze the relative amount of CaSR mRNAs containing exons 1A and 1B because the specific activities of probes for exons 1A and 1B are not the same. However, since both transcripts containing exons 1A and 1B are evident by Northern blot analysis, our results indicate that the difference in the expression level of CaSR between adenomas and normal parathyroid is less than that in previous reports. This may be due to the difference of methods employed. Because the expression of CaSR is not uniform in parathyroid adenomas (23.Kaneko C. Mizunashi K. Tanaka M. Uzuki M. Kikuchi M. Sawai T. Goto M.M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1999; 64: 271-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), Northern blot analysis shows the average expression level of CaSR in whole adenomas. In contrast, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization would be suitable for investigating the expression pattern of CaSR in different part of adenomas. The reduced expression of CaSR may contribute to less efficient intracellular signal transduction at a given calcium level. This leads to less suppression of PTH secretion and hence higher PTH levels. Because calcimimetics suppresses proliferation of parathyroid cells (24.Wada M. Furuya Y. Sakiyama J. Kobayashi N. Miyata S. Ishii H. Nagano N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2977-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), it is possible that the reduction of CaSR expression also has stimulatory effects on parathyroid cell growth. Thus, derangement of CaSR expression may explain the two main characteristics of parathyroid adenoma, a higher set point for PTH secretion and enhancement of cell proliferation. However, it is not clear at the moment whether the reduction of CaSR expression can explain all the abnormalities of adenoma cells because the reduction is not prominent. Since no mutation in CaSR was reported in parathyroid adenomas (8.Hosokawa Y. Pollak M.R. Brown E.M. Arnold A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 3107-3110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), derangement of post-receptor signal transduction is another possibility. Furthermore, it is not known whether the reduction of CaSR expression is a direct cause of parathyroid adenoma or, conversely, the results of tumorigenesis. For example, it is possible that hypercalcemia and/or high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism affect expression of CaSR. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that neither hypercalcemia nor 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has an effect on the promoter activities of the human CaSR gene (data not shown). Further study is necessary to clarify the effect of systemic factors on CaSR expression because we cannot exclude the possibility that a region farther upstream has some effects on CaSR expression. In conclusion, the human CaSR gene has two promoters and produces multiple mRNAs. Specific reduction of the expression levels of transcript driven by the upstream promoter underlies the pathogenesis of parathyroid adenomas. Further analyses of the factors that modulate the activity of the upstream promoter of CaSR will be necessary to clarify the mechanisms of reduced expression of CaSR in parathyroid adenomas."

Unique to this system, the activity of TraR is negatively modulated by an antiactivator called TraM. Analyses from yeast two-hybrid studies suggest that TraM directly interacts with the activator, but the conditions under which these components interact and the region of TraR responsible for this interaction are not known. Induction of traM in a strain in which TraR was activating transcription of a reporter system led to rapid cessation of gene expression. As assessed by a genetic assay that measures AAI-dependent DNA binding, TraM inhibited TraR function before and after the transcription factor had bound to its DNA recognition site. Consistent with this observation, in gel retardation assays, purified TraM abolished the DNA binding activity of TraR in a concentration-dependent manner. Such inhibition occurred independent of the order of addition of the reactants. As assessed by far Western analyses TraM interacts with TraR by directly binding the activator. TraM in its native form interacted with native TraR and also with heat-treated TraR but only when SDS was included with the denatured protein. TraM interacted with TraR on blots prepared with total lysates of cells grown in the presence and absence of AAI. Far Western analysis of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants localized a domain of TraR contributing to TraM binding to the C-terminal portion of the activator protein. Random mutagenesis by hydroxylamine treatment and error-prone polymerase chain reaction identified several residues in this region of TraR important for interacting with TraM as well as for transcriptional activation or/and DNA binding.

Quorum sensing is dependent upon a diffusible signal molecule called the autoinducer, which in Gram-negative bacteria often is an acylated homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL1). The signal, which the bacteria produce themselves, accumulates in the environment as the cells grow (1.Fuqua W.C. Winans S.C. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar, 2.Fuqua C. Winans S.C. Greenberg E.P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 727-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). At a certain threshold concentration that corresponds to a critical cell density, the autoinducer interacts with its cognate receptor, resulting in expression of the target genes. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the transcriptional activator TraR and its ligand Agrobacterium autoinducer (AAI,1 N-3-oxooctanoyl-l-homoserine lactone) regulate in a quorum-dependent manner the expression of the three operons responsible for conjugal transfer of the Ti plasmids (3.Fuqua W.C.

This system, in turn, is controlled by a hierarchical cascade in which the expression of traR itself is regulated by opines, metabolites produced by the plant tumors induced by the bacteria (4.Farrand S.K.

In the nopaline-type Ti plasmid pTiC58, traR is part of the arc operon, a group of five genes that is regulated by AccR, the repressor that responds to agrocinopines A and B (8.Piper R.K. Beck von Bodman S. Hwang I. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1077-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9.Beck von Bodman S. Hayman G.T. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Purified TraR from the octopine-type Ti plasmid pTiR10 binds specifically to a cis-acting recognition site, the 18-base pair tra box, adjacent to promoters of genes regulated by quorum sensing (10.Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). That such activity was dependent upon growth of the cells with AAI suggested that the signal is required for TraR to bind DNA. Consistent with this, in a genetic assay that measures DNA binding, TraR from the nopaline-type Ti plasmid pTiC58 bound thetra box only when the cells were cultured with AAI (11.Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition to opine regulation, transcriptional activation by TraR is negatively modulated by the product of traM (12.Hwang I. Cook D.M. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 449-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Fuqua C. Burbea M. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a component critical for quorum sensing but not for TraR-mediated autoinduction of the tra and trb operons (14.Piper K.R. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1080-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All identified traM genes encode an 11.2-kDa protein with a highly hydrophobic region located at the C terminus. Null mutations intraM result in constitutive conjugation even at low population density (14.Piper K.R. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1080-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Addition of excess exogenous AAI does not overcome the inhibitory effect of TraM on TraR function under normal conditions (12.Hwang I. Cook D.M. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 449-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Zhang L.H. Kerr A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1867-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, inhibition of TraR activity by TraM is dependent upon the relative levels of these two proteins (12.Hwang I. Cook D.M. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 449-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TraM does not directly affect expression of traR or the tra andtrb genes (12.Hwang I. Cook D.M. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 449-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led Hwang et al. (12.Hwang I. Cook D.M. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 449-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to propose that TraM exerts its effect by directly interacting with TraR. Genetic analyses using the yeast two-hybrid system are consistent with this model (16.Hwang I. Smyth A. Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that TraM functions as an antiactivator, a class of regulatory proteins that exert their inhibitory effect by interacting with and deactivating their corresponding transcription factor. However, several aspects concerning the interactions between TraM and TraR remain to be determined. First, there is no physical evidence supporting the hypothesis that these two proteins interact with each other. Second, it is not known whether TraM exerts its inhibitory effect before TraR binds DNA or if it can actively interfere with transcriptional initiation. Third, the direct consequence on TraR upon interaction with TraM remains obscure. Finally, it is not clear what role, if any, AAI plays in the interaction between TraR and TraM. In this paper, we have combined genetic analyses with biochemical tests to assess the influence of TraM on TraR activity and to analyze interactions between TraR and this antiactivator. We show that TraM negatively influences the DNA binding activity of TraR and that the antiactivator exerts its influence irrespective of whether TraR has bound to its target DNA site. Furthermore, by far Western analysis, we show that TraM binds TraR and that binding is independent of AAI. Finally, using a combination of genetic and biochemical analyses, we show that TraM binds the C terminus of TraR and that amino acid residues of TraR involved in interacting with TraM are critical for DNA binding and perhaps also for transcriptional activation. Unless otherwise specified, Escherichia coli strains DH5α, BL21(DE3)(pLysS) (Novagen), and their derivatives were grown at 37 °C in L broth (LB), on L agar plates, or in A medium (17.Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar).A. tumefaciens strain NT1 and its derivatives were grown at 28 °C in LB, MG/L (18.Cangelosi G.A. Best E.A. Marinetti G. Nester E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 384-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), or ABM minimal medium (19.Chilton M.D. Currier T.C. Farrand S.K. Bendich A.J. Gordon M.P. Nester E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3672-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Plasmids were maintained by including the appropriate antibiotics in the media at concentrations specified previously (20.Luo Z.Q. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 618-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When necessary, cell growth was monitored by Klett colorimetry (red filter) or by measuring optical density at 600 nm (OD 600) using a Spectronic 20. To induce expression from P BAD or P trc, arabinose or IPTG was added at a final concentration of 0.4% or 200 μm, respectively. Unless otherwise specified, synthetic AAI, prepared as described previously (21.Shaw P.D. Ping G. Daly S.L. Cha C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rinehart K.L. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6036-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), was added to a final concentration of 25 nm. X-Gal was included in agar medium at 40 μg/ml to monitor for the production of β-galactosidase. Plasmids that allow independent induction of TraR and TraM were constructed by cloning the open reading frames of these two genes into expression vectors pKK38-I (22.Oger P. Kim K.S. Sackett R.L. Piper K.R. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and pDLB4 (20.Luo Z.Q. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 618-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pKKTR2-I and pDLB4-M. Expression of these two genes is inducible by IPTG and arabinose, respectively. Precise deletions were constructed by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and traRcloned in pZLQR (11.Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as template. For N-terminal deletions, primer 5′-attcGAATTCAGATCAGCTTTCTTCT-3′ that contains the native translational stop codon (underlined antiparallel strand) was coupled with N-terminal primers containing an in-frame ATG as part of anNdeI site to amplify fragments coding for versions of TraR initiating at successively later positions. For C-terminal deletions, primer 5′-atcgcgCATATG CAGCACTGGCTGGAC-3′ that contains the native ATG (italicized) in the form of an NdeI site (underlined) was coupled with C-terminal primers containing a TGA stop codon placed to give versions of TraR terminating at successively earlier positions. In all cases, PCR products were cloned into the expression vector pZLQ (11.Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as NdeI/EcoRI fragments, and the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. To reconstitute the N terminus of TraM-insensitive mutants of TraRΔN2–4, mutated regions of pZLQ derivatives were isolated by digesting with NotI, a restriction enzyme that recognizes two sites, one located in the middle of traR and the other in the vector distal to the 3′ end of the gene. The recovered DNA fragments were cloned into a vector harboring the 5′ end through theNotI site of wild-type traR. Clones with the 3′ mutant half of traR inserted in the correct orientation were identified by restriction analysis. A similar strategy was used to place the 3′-half of several C-terminal deletion and missense mutants of traR into traRΔN2–4. The N-terminal deletion mutant traRΔN2–4 (11.Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was subjected to chemical and error-prone PCR-mediated random mutagenesis according to previously described protocols (23.Slock J. VanRiet D. Kolibachuk D. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Zhou Y.H. Zhang X.P. Ebright R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 11: 6052Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). PCR products were cloned into pZLQ as NdeI/EcoRI fragments. Random 5′ deletion mutagenesis of traR was carried out on pDLR1, a derivative of pDSK519 (25.Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) carrying a copy of traRdownstream from several restriction sites suitable for conductingExoIII-mediated unidirectional digestion (26.Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar). Deletions were produced using the Erase-a-Base system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Native active TraR was purified from E. coliBL21(DE3)(pLysS) harboring pETR, a derivative of pET17-b (Novagen) containing traR, the expression of which is under the control of the T7 promoter. This strain was grown at 28 °C in 1 liter of A medium (17.Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) containing 100 nm AAI, 200 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. When the OD600 of the culture reached 0.3–0.4, expression of TraR was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 200 μm. Cells were harvested following overnight induction and were stored at −80 °C. Approximately 4 g of cells were thawed, resuspended in 20 ml of TEDGT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.15 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10 units/ml DNase, and were broken by two passages through a French press at 10,000 pounds/square inch. Active TraR was purified from the lysate essentially as described by Zhu and Winans (10.Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Samples first were chromatographed on a heparin-Sepharose affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 16 mm × 20 cm). TraR was eluted from the column with 100 ml of a linear gradient of NaCl, from 0.15 to 1.0 m in TEDGT buffer. Fractions containing TraR, as detected by anti-TraR antibodies raised against affinity-purified His-tagged activator protein, were pooled and desalted by ultrafiltration (Amicon). The protein was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Mono-S column (HR 5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TraR was eluted from the column with 30 ml of a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.15 to 1m in TEDGT buffer. (His)6-TraM was purified from BL21(DE3)(pLysS, pMA2) (16.Hwang I. Smyth A. Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) according to the protocol of the Ni2+ resin manufacturer (Novagen). The two proteins were better than 95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Purified TraR and (His)6-TraM were stored at −20 °C in TEDGT buffer containing 50% glycerol. E. coli strain DH5α(pPBL1, pKKTR2-I, pDBL4-M) was constructed to analyze the effect of TraM on AAI-dependent DNA binding activity of TraR. Plasmid pPBL1 reports the AAI-dependent repressor activity of TraR (11.Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and pKKTR2-I and pDLB4-M harbor traR and traM inducible by IPTG and arabinose, respectively. An overnight culture was diluted 1:200 into fresh A medium, and the culture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Synthetic AAI was added after taking the first sample (t 0), and the culture was incubated as above. After the OD600 of the culture reached about 0.05, the culture was divided into the necessary number of subcultures, and inducers for traR and traM expression were added at appropriate times. Cultures were incubated as before; growth was monitored, and samples were taken at different time intervals following addition of the inducers. A. tumefaciens strain NT1(pRKLH4I41, pDLB4-M) was used to examine the effect of TraM on activation of transcription by TraR. Plasmid pRKLH4I41 contains a copy of constitutively expressed wild-typetraR and a traG::lacZ fusion, the expression of which is dependent upon TraR and exogenous AAI (11.Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of this strain was diluted 1:50 into ABM medium, and the new culture was incubated at 28 °C with shaking. When the culture density reached an OD600 of about 0.05 (It0), a sample was removed, and synthetic AAI was added to a final concentration of 25 nm. The culture was divided into the appropriate number of subcultures; incubation was continued as above, and arabinose was added at the indicated times to induce expression of traM from pDLB4-M. Samples were withdrawn at set time intervals, and the expression level of thetraG::lacZ reporter was determined. The 251-base pair traA-traC intergenic region of pTiC58 (27.Farrand S.K. Hwang I. Cook D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4233-4247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified from pZLB251 (11.Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) by PCR using primers 5′-GGGTGATCAGAACGTCGTTCGTCGGGAGCGGTGAGG-3′ and 5′-TCACCCGGGTCGCATCTCCCTGGAAATCCTGCGGC-3′. This region contains the entire TraR-AAI dependent divergent trapromoter system (27.Farrand S.K. Hwang I. Cook D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4233-4247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Fuqua C. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 435-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified PCR product was labeled at the 3′ ends with digoxigenin-11-ddUTP and terminal transferase using protocols provided by the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For the DNA binding reaction, purified TraR was incubated with the digoxigenin-3′-end-labeled DNA fragment (2 ng) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm KCl, 30 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 20 μg/ml BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, and 10% glycerol in a total volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After adding 5 μl of loading buffer, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis at 4 °C on a native 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer (1× TBE: 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Following electrophoresis, DNA and protein-DNA complexes were electroblotted onto positively charged nitrocellulose membranes and visualized by chemiluminescence detection as described by the manufacturer's protocols (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Three approaches were used to test the effect of TraM on the DNA binding activity of TraR. As described above, all reactions were performed in a volume of 20 μl. In the first, labeled DNA was added to reaction mixtures containing 1 pmol of TraR (final concentration of 50 nm) and 10–240 pmol of TraM (final concentration of 1–12 μm TraM) and incubated for 20 min. In the second, DNA was added to reaction mixtures containing 100 pmol of TraM (final concentration of 5 μm) and 0.5 pmol of TraR (final concentration of 25 nm) that had been coincubated for 1–20 min. In the third, 100 pmol of TraM (final concentration of 5 μm) was added to reaction mixtures in which 0.5 pmol of TraR (final concentration of 25 nm) and DNA had been coincubated for 1–20 min. All reactions were incubated at room temperature for an additional 20 min, subjected to electrophoresis, and analyzed by electroblotting and chemiluminescence as described above. Immunoblots were carried out using murine anti-(His)6-TraR antibodies. To prepare cell lysates for such assays, overnight cultures in MG/L medium (18.Cangelosi G.A. Best E.A. Marinetti G. Nester E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 384-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were diluted 1:15 into fresh MG/L, and the cultures were incubated at the appropriate temperature with shaking. When the OD600 of the culture reached about 0.3, IPTG was added; incubation was continued, and cells were harvested when the OD600 reached about 1.0. When needed, AAI was added at the same time as IPTG. Cells were resuspended in one-tenth of the culture volume of SDS loading buffer (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.64-18.73Google Scholar), and the cell suspension was boiled for 5 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C) in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (Centrifuge 5402), and 18 μl of supernatant was loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Following electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. After 1 h blocking using PBS buffer (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.64-18.73Google Scholar) containing 5% non-fat milk, membranes were incubated for 2 h in the same buffer containing anti-TraR antibodies. Antibody-protein complexes were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-murine second antibody (Sigma) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Life Technologies, Inc.) as substrates. All incubations and reactions were conducted at room temperature. Native or heat-denatured (95 °C, 5 min) TraR in TEDGT buffer was spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the samples were allowed to dry in air. After blocking for 30 min using PBS buffer (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.64-18.73Google Scholar) containing 5% nonfat milk, the membranes were incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer containing native or heat-denatured (His)6-TraM at a final concentration of 45 nm. Following three washes with PBS buffer (1 ml/cm2, 10 min each), the membranes were incubated for 2 h in blocking buffer containing anti-TraM antibodies (16.Hwang I. Smyth A. Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reacting complexes were detected as described above for Western blots. Purified (His)6-TraM, TraR, or cell lysates containing TraR or its mutant derivatives were resolved by electrophoresis in 15% SDS-PAGE gels, and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. To analyze TraR and its derivatives present in cell lysates, samples for electrophoresis were prepared as described for Western blots. In some cases, following electroblotting the membranes were incubated in HYB buffer (30.Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31381-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) for 16 h at 4 °C in an attempt to allow renaturation of the proteins. The membranes were incubated with TraM or TraR, the respective antisera, and processed all as described for the dot blots. β-Galactosidase activity, expressed as units/ml culture or as units/109 colony-forming units (cfu) was measured as described previously (12.Hwang I. Cook D.M. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 449-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Mutations were identified by double strand DNA sequence analysis conducted by the Genetic Engineering Facility at the University of Illinois. By using a genetic assay that measures gene repression as an indicator of AAI-dependent DNA binding ability of TraR (11.Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we examined the characteristics and in vivo kinetics of TraM inhibition of TraR activity. With the reporter strain DH5α(pPBL1, pKKTR2-I, pDLB4-M), expression of traR is inducible by IPTG, whereas expression of traM is inducible by arabinose. In a subculture to which no inducer was added, the reporter gene expressed constitutively, leading to the accumulation of β-galactosidase (Fig. 1, panel A). When only traR was induced, the expression of the reporter was strongly repressed (Fig. 1, panel A). However, when traR and traM were induced simultaneously or when traM was induced before traR, no repression was observed (Fig. 1, panel A). Moreover, in a culture in which traR had been induced previously, induction oftraM led to the derepression of the reporter gene within 30 min (Fig. 1, panel A). Induction of traM alone had no effect on the expression of the reporter gene, indicating that the antiactivator has no repressor activity of its own (Fig. 1,panel A). The ability of TraM to abolish repression by TraR suggested that in an activation assay induction of TraM would prevent further expression of genes activated by TraR. Such was the case; in a strain that contains a traG::lacZ reporter fusion, and a plasmid coding for constitutively expressed traR andtraM expressed from P BAD, the antiactivator significantly inhibited the TraR-dependent expression of the reporter gene within 1 h after induction by addition of arabinose (Fig. 1, panel B). Results from thesein vivo tests predicted that TraM could abolish binding between TraR and its DNA recognition site. We examined this hypothesis by determining the effect of TraM on the DNA binding activity of TraR using a gel retardation assay. As shown in Fig.2, panel A, when mixed with target DNA, TraR caused a retardation in the mobility of the DNA probe presumably by forming a protein-DNA complex. Addition of TraM to the binding reactions prevented the activator from forming these complexes. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of TraM on the formation of such complexes was dependent upon the relative amounts of these two proteins. Under our experimental conditions, a ratio of TraM to TraR of 20:1 detectably reduced the formation of TraR-DNA complexes (Fig. 2,panel A). As the ratio was increased to 80:1, TraR-DNA complexes became undetectable (Fig. 2, panel A). In reactions in which labeled DNA was added into mixtures containing TraR and TraM that had been coincubated for 1–20 min, no detectable TraR-DNA complex was observed (Fig. 2, panel B).

The checkpoints help maintain genomic integrity by preventing replication of damaged DNA and inhibiting cell division before the generation of two genome complements. Conceptually, DNA damage checkpoints have three components, damage sensors, signal transducers, and effecter molecules. Genetic studies in Schizosaccharomyces pombe have identified six checkpoint Rad proteins (Rad1, Rad3, Rad9, Rad17, Rad26, and Hus1), which are required to regulate both the DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoints (3.Russell P.

The human ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia andrad3+ -related) proteins, which are phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinases, are considered to be the functional homologs of the S. pombe Rad3 protein (5.Savitsky K.

In the present study, we have investigated the enzymatic properties of hRAD9. Surprisingly, we find that hRAD9, which does not have sequence motifs indicative of its function, possesses a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity. We suggest that this activity may be important in the damage sensing and signal transduction steps of the DNA damage checkpoint response reaction. The plasmid pcDNA3-AU1-hRAD9 (11.Volkmer E.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Larry M. Karnitz (Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN). The hRAD9 gene was amplified from this plasmid by PCR using the primers 5′-CCGAGCTCGAGAATGAAGTGCCTGGTC and 5′-GATGCAAGCTTTCAGACTTCACCCTCA. The PCR product was digested withXhoI and HindIII and inserted into pRSET(b) from Invitrogen to obtain the His-tagged hRAD9 expression vector pRSET-hRAD9. Then, the BamHI-HindIII fragment carrying hRAD9 was isolated from pRSET-hRAD9 and inserted into pMalc-2 (New England Biolabs) to obtain the pMal-hRAD9 plasmid, which expresses the maltose-binding protein (MBP)-hRAD9 fusion protein. The various deletion derivatives of hRAD9 were generated from pMal-hRAD9 by PCR. To purify MBP-hRAD9, cell extract from DR153/pMal-hRAD9 was loaded onto an amylose affinity column, and after extensive washing, as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs), MBP-hRAD9 was eluted with 10 mm maltose. The protein was further purified by loading onto a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer R (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) and eluting with a salt gradient of 50 mm to 400 mm KCl in buffer R. MBP-hRAD9 came off the column at around 160 mm KCl. The peak fractions were combined, dialyzed against buffer R containing 50 mm KCl, and then subjected to a second round of DEAE chromatography as described above. The peak fractions were dialyzed against buffer R and stored at −80 °C. The deletion derivatives of hRAD9 in the form of MBP fusion were purified by an amylose affinity column followed by chromatography on DEAE and phenyl-Sepharose. For phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, the MBP-hRAD9 fractions from the DEAE column were dialyzed against buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 1m ammonium sulfate and then loaded onto the phenyl-Sepharose column. After washing with buffer C containing 0.5m ammonium sulfate, the proteins were eluted by a gradient of 0.5 m ammonium sulfate in buffer C to 30% ethylene glycol in buffer C. MBP-hRAD9 deletion derivatives came off the column at about 30% ethylene glycol. After dialysis against buffer R, the proteins were stored at −80 °C. To establish that the exonuclease activity detected in MBP-hRAD9 was intrinsic to hRAD9, the purified MBP-hRAD9 was subjected to a variety of treatments. First, to obtain hRAD9 free of tag, 5 μg of MBP-hRAD9 was digested with 5 μg of Factor Xa in buffer R at 23 °C for 2 h. Then, 50 μl of amylose resin was added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C, the resin and bound proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used as the “hRAD9 fraction.” Second, to remove MBP-hRAD9 fusion protein from the MBP-hRAD9 preparations, 5 μg of the purified fusion protein was mixed with 50 μl of amylose resin for 2 h at 4 °C, the resin and bound material were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used as the “MBP-hRAD9 depleted fraction.” Finally, the amylose resin-MBP-hRAD9 isolated in the previous procedure was resuspended in 25 μl of R buffer and digested with 5 μg of Factor Xa. The resin was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used as the “hRAD9 recovered fraction.” In all of the Factor Xa treatments only about 50% of MBP-hRAD9 was cleaved as determined by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The substrate used for most of our experiments was a 30-mer oligodeoxynucleotide, 5′-TCAGGGTGGCCAGCTGGCGCAGATCTGGCT-3′. The oligomer was labeled at the 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase and at the 3′ terminus using [α-32P]ddATP and deoxynucleotidyl terminal transferase. To prepare a 3′-end-labeled substrate with a 3′-OH terminus, the oligomer was annealed to a complementary oligomer with a 34-nt extension in which the first non-complementary base was a G residue. Then, the 3′ end was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment for extension. The extended oligomer (31-mer) was purified on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. For double-stranded oligomer substrate, the 31-mer was annealed with a complementary oligomer. In addition to these substrates, M13 single- and double-stranded forms were used to test for endonuclease activity. The standard reaction mixture contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.3 pmol substrate, and 12 pmol (1 μg) of MBP-hRAD9. The reactions were performed at 37 °C and terminated by adding EDTA to 20 mm. Reaction products were separated on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Quantitative analyses of the data were conducted with a Storm 850 scanner and a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The sequence of hRAD9 does not contain any sequence motif indicative of an enzymatic activity. However, genetic analyses in S. pombe implicate its homolog in the “damage-sensing” step of the DNA damage checkpoint response (4.Brondello J.M. Boddy M.N. Furnari B. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4262-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11.Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to investigate the interaction of this protein with DNA. In preliminary experiments, we noticed that DNA incubated with hRAD9 preparations was degraded and decided to characterize this activity in more detail. hRAD9 was expressed in Escherichia coli either in the form of (His)6-hRAD9 or MBP-hRAD9. Both forms were overproduced at reasonable levels and were soluble. The nuclease activity was detected with both the His- and MBP-tagged forms. However, even after a four-column purification procedure including a nickel affinity column, the (His)6-hRAD9 form contained minor contaminants (data not shown). Hence, we conducted most of our experiments with the MBP-hRAD9 recombinant protein. The protein was purified through an amylose affinity column and two ion exchange columns, and the peak fractions from the final step contained virtually pure MBP-hRAD9 as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig.1). When the purified protein was incubated with a 30-nt-long single-stranded DNA, the DNA was degraded exonucleolytically. With 5′-end-labeled substrate, the products were oligomers of gradually decreasing sizes (Fig. 2, lane 2), whereas with 3′-end-labeled DNA, the label was released in the form of a mononucleotide (Fig. 2, lane 4) indicating that hRAD9 is a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease. Because E. coli contains several 3′ to 5′ exonucleases, including exonuclease I, exonuclease VII, and RecJ, capable of degrading single-stranded DNA (15.Berlyn M.K.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 814-984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that the exonuclease activity in our MBP-hRAD9 preparation might be due to a contaminant. To demonstrate that the activity was intrinsic to hRAD9, we analyzed the individual fractions from the last purification column for protein composition and nuclease activity. As seen in Fig. 3 the MBP-hRAD9 protein (panel A) co-elutes with the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity tested with either 5′-end-labeled (panel B) or 3′-end-labeled (panel C) substrates. These data do not unambiguously prove, but strongly indicate, that hRAD9 is a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease. This conclusion was further strengthened by the following series of experiments.Figure 33′ to 5′ exonuclease activity co-purifies with MBP-hRAD9. Column fractions from the second DEAE column were analyzed for protein composition and exonuclease activity.A, fractions analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and silver staining.B and C, exonuclease activity with 5′ (B)- and 3′ (C)-end-labeled substrates.

The nuclease activity was released from this resin by treating the bound proteins with Factor Xa, which cleaves at the junction of MBP and hRAD9 (Fig. 4,lane 5). Second, if the purified protein was treated with Factor Xa and then amylose-bound material was removed, the released protein showed the exonuclease activity (Fig. 4, lane 4). These data, taken together, show that the exonuclease binds to the amylose resin and can be released from the resin by Factor Xa. Since the possibility of an E. coli exonuclease binding to amylose and being released by Factor Xa is remote, we consider the data in Fig.4 as very strong evidence for hRAD9 being a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease. The sequence of hRAD9 does not show an obvious homology to any known nuclease, hence the active site could not be assigned to a specific region by sequence inspection. To locate the active site, we generated N- and C-terminal deletions of hRAD9 and tested them for nuclease activity. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The hRAD9(1–91) fragment and other C-terminal deletion derivatives containing this region are nearly as active as the full-length protein. Analysis of N-terminal deletion derivatives confirmed this conclusion and helped narrow down further the nuclease active site; hRAD9(92–391) lacked nuclease activity as expected, whereas hRAD9(52–391) was active. Thus, the results from hRAD9(1–91) combined with that obtained with hRAD9(52–391) places the nuclease active site within a stretch of 40 amino acids spanning amino acids 52 through 91. The reaction conditions affecting the hRAD9 exonuclease are summarized in TableI.The enzyme is 2.5-fold more active on single-stranded DNA than on double-stranded DNA and has no endonuclease activity as tested by nicking assay using plasmid DNA. The nuclease requires a divalent cation for activity, with the Mn2+being 2.5-fold more efficient than Mg2+. The activity is strongly reduced by moderate (100 mm) salt concentrations and product inhibited by high concentrations of a mononucleotide. Interestingly, the enzyme works more efficiently on substrates with 3′-OH termini than on substrates with 3′-dideoxy termini (Fig.2 B and Table I).Table ICharacterization of the nuclease activity of hRAD9Activity%Substrate Single-stranded 30-mer (3′-OH)100 Single-stranded 30-mer (ddAMP)40 Double-stranded 31-mer40 Single-stranded circular DNA<5 Double-stranded circular DNA<5Reaction conditions 10 mm MnCl2100 10 mm MgCl240 10 mmCaCl2<1 100 mm NaCl16 100 mm KCl13 20 mm EDTA<1 5 mm AMP2All values are expressed relative to the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity observed with 30-mer with 3′-OH terminus with 20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mmEDTA, and 10% glycerol (v/v).

Immunoprecipitation analyses show that the hRAD1, hRAD9, and hHUS1 proteins make a radioresponsive checkpoint complex (11.Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12.St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol.

At present the precise role of this complex in damage sensing, damage processing, and signal transduction in the DNA damage checkpoint response is not known. Genetic analyses in both S. pombe and S. cerevisiae suggest that the complex functions in the early stages of the DNA damage checkpoint response (4.Brondello J.M. Boddy M.N. Furnari B. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4262-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13.Kondo T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell.

However, direct biochemical evidence for such a role has been lacking. Our finding that hRAD9 has an intrinsic 3′ to 5′ exonuclease function constitutes strong biochemical evidence that the complex interacts with DNA and hence most likely plays a role in the damage sensing step of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Further work with hRAD1 and hHUS1 and with the ternary translationally modified hRAD9 will help define more precisely the roles of the individual components as well as of the complex in the DNA damage checkpoint response in humans."

As we previously showed that the activation of AP-1, a nuclear transcription factor was indispensable to ceramide-induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells (Sawai, H., Okazaki, T., Yamamoto, H., Okano, H., Takeda, Y., Tashima, M., Sawada, H., Okuma, M., Ishikura, H., Umehara, H., and Domae, N. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 27326–27331), the role and mechanism of heat shock (HS)-increased c-jun expression in apoptosis was here investigated. HS increased morphological changes compatible with apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells, and induced ceramide generation and sphingomyelin hydrolysis with an increase of neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase activity. When HS failed to induce apoptosis in HS-resistant HL-60 cells, ceramide generation was not detected, suggesting that ceramide was involved in downstream signals required for HS-induced apoptosis. Both HS and N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) increased the expression of c-jun/c-fos mRNAs with the peak 2 h after treatment. When we examined whether the inhibition of c-jun expression by its antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS) blocked HS- or C2-ceramide-induced apoptosis, AS of c-jun gene inhibited apoptotic morphological changes and DNA fragmentation whereas did not sense oligodeoxynucleotides. Moreover, a synthetic tetrapeptide, acetyl-Asp-Met-Gln-Asp-aldehyde (DMQD-CHO), which inhibited the formation of active form of caspase-3 more efficiently than those of caspase-4, -6, -7, and -8, blocked both caspase-3 like activity, c-jun expression and apoptosis induced by HS or C2-ceramide, although DMQD-CHO did not affect HS-induced ceramide generation. These results suggested that the ceramide was generated through sphingomyelin hydrolysis by HS-activated neutral, magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase and that subsequent c-jun expression through activation of caspase-3 played a role in HS-induced HL-60 cell apoptosis.

Shah V. Lanks K.W. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3341-3343PubMed Google Scholar), and the execution of apoptosis is proposed as a mechanism by which HS induces cell death (2.Chant I.D. Rose P.E. Morris A.G.

HS induces many kinds of proteins named HS proteins (HSPs), which are known to play a protective role for cell apoptosis owing to its function as a chaperon (4.Amin V. Cumming D.V. Coffin R.S. Latchman D.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For example, the overexpression of genes for HSP-70 and -27 protected the cells from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and Fas-induced apoptosis, respectively (5.Jaattela M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 6.Mehlen P. Schulze Osthoff K. Arrigo A.P. J. Biol.

Thus, HSPs seem to function as an anti-apoptotic system to protect the cells from HS-induced apoptosis. It remains, however, to be clarified what the intracellular signaling molecules to mediate pro-apoptotic signals in HS-induced apoptosis are. Since we reported that ceramide was generated by a hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) through the pathway named “SM cycle” in 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced human leukemia HL-60 cell differentiation (8.Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

A diverse array of inducers such as TNF-α, Fas cross-linkage, irradiation, and 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine as well as HS were reported to increase the intracellular ceramide levels in induction of apoptosis (13.Yang Z.

Although several pathways related to serine/threonine kinase and phosphatase, Raf-1 kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and NF-κB are proposed as downstream signals of ceramide (17.Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), it is controversial what the indispensable mechanisms for ceramide-mediated apoptosis are. We previously showed that a nuclear transcription factor, AP-1, plays a crucial role in ceramide-induced apoptosis (9.Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide increased mRNA levels of c-jun and DNA binding activity of AP-1, and antisense deoxyoligonucleotides (AS) of c-jun inhibited ceramide-induced apoptotic cell death (9.Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although HS was reported to increase c-jun mRNA, its mechanism and implications in the induction of HL-60 cell apoptosis are unknown. Caspases are a family of cysteine protein proteases, which consist of more than 10 enzymes and cleave aspartate residue of apoptosis-related proteins including interleukin-1β-converting enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, lamin B, and protein kinase C δ (18.Thornberry N.A.

Group I containing caspase-1, -4, and -5 prefers the tetrapeptide sequence WEHD for autocleavage and activation, and is believed to play a role in cytokine secretion and inflammation. Groups II (caspase-2, -3, and -7) and III (caspase-6, -8, and -9) recognize DEXD and EXD as an optimal cleaving sequence, respectively, and were reported to be involved in initiation and execution of apoptosis. Among those caspase-3 seems to be of the most importance for the process of apoptosis because only caspase-3 knock out mice showed disregulation of brain apoptosis (23.Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S.

In summary, ceramide-induced c-jun expression and caspase-3 activation seem to be the candidates for pro-apoptotic downstream signals in HS-induced apoptosis, but there were no data showing HS increased caspase-3 so far as we know. Moreover, it remains to be clarified how ceramide-induced c-jun expression and caspase-3 are involved in HS-induced apoptosis. We, therefore, investigated the mechanisms of ceramide generation by HS and examined whether HS- and ceramide-increased c-jun expression via caspase-3 activation is required to the induction of apoptosis by using a specific tetrapeptide caspase-3 inhibitor, acetyl-Asp-Met-Gln-Asp-aldehyde (DMQD-CHO) and antisense (AS) oligodeoxynucleotides of c-jun. Human leukemia HL-60 cells were a kind gift from Dr. M. Saito (Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan). C2-Ceramide was obtained from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). DMQD-CHO was purchased from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Murine monoclonal antibody VJ-41 (IgM) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Iwamori (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Human leukemia HL-60 cells and a subline named HL-60/HS, which were resistant to HS-induced apoptosis, were grown in RPMI 1640 (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, JRH Biosciences) and kanamycin sulfate (80 ng/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cell numbers were counted by a hemocytometer, and the viability was always greater than 95% in all experiments as assayed by 0.025% trypan blue dye exclusion method. Before the experiments, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated overnight in the RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% FCS if not described particularly. HL-60 cells were resuspended into the culture tubes at 5 × 105 cells/ml with a preheated medium, immersed in the water bath (Thermominder Mini-80; Aitec, Saitama, Japan) at various temperatures for the indicated durations, and then returned to incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After HS treatment, the viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion method. The cells were treated with HS at the indicated temperatures for the different durations or with 5 μmC2-ceramide, harvested, and then stained with May-Giemsa or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining method. At least 200 cells were counted under light microscope, and the cells with nuclear condensation and fragmentation were judged as apoptotic cells. For DNA fragmentation assay, the extraction of DNA was performed using G NOME DNA isolation kit (BIO 101) according to the manufacturer's protocol with a little modification. Briefly, the cells (1 × 106) were washed once in PBS and resuspended in 185 μl of Cell Suspension Solution. After addition of 5 μl of RNase Mixx and 10 μl of Cell Lysis/Denaturing Solution, the cell lysate was incubated at 55 °C for 15 min. Then 3 μl of Protease Mixx was added to the lysate, and the mixture was further incubated for 2 h. After addition of 50 μl of “Salt Out” mixture, the mixture was cooled on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100s ultracentrifuge. Then 1 ml of 80% ethanol diluted with TE buffer (pH 8.0) was added to the supernatant, stored at −20 °C for 2 h, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The DNA pellet was dissolved in TE buffer (pH 8.0). The concentration of DNA was calculated by determining the optical density at 260 nm. Electrophoresis was carried out through 3% NuSieve agarose (FMC BioProducts) mini-gel in 1× TAE buffer at 50 V for 1.5 h. DNA was visualized under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide. The cells were washed with PBS, seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in 2% FCS RPMI medium with [14C]choline chloride (0.1 μCi/ml) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 36 h. The labeled cells were treated with HS as described above and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 h. After harvesting the cells, the lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (10.Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27326-27331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The samples were dried down by N2 gas and dissolved in 100 μl of chloroform. Twenty μl was applied on a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate (Merck), and 40 μl were used to measure phospholipid phosphate. TLC plate was developed in the solvent containing chloroform/methanol/2n NH4OH (60: 35: 5), and then spots corresponding to SM were scraped and counted by using a scintillation counter. Radioactivity corresponding to SM was corrected by the amount of phospholipids in each sample. After HS treatment, the cells (1 × 107) were harvested and lipids were extracted from the cells by the method of Bligh and Dyer (10.Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27326-27331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and developed with a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water (60: 35: 8, by vol) on a plastic TLC plate (catalog no. 805013, Sigma) with standard sphingomyelin. For TLC immunostaining, the plastic TLC plate was incubated with the blocking buffer containing 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1% ovalbumin, and 0.02% NaN3 in PBS at 4 °C overnight, and then was reacted with 1 μg/ml murine monoclonal antibody VJ-41 (IgM), which preferentially reacted with SM (28.Iwamori M. Hirota K. Utsuki T. Momoeda K. Ono K. Tsuchida Y. Okumura K. Hanaoka K. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), in 3% polyvinylpyrrolidone in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing the plate five times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, the plate was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM antibody (Cappel Laboratories, Cochraville, PA), diluted 1:1000, at 37 °C for 1 h, and washed five times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. The antibody bound on the TLC plate was detected using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The spots corresponding to SM were scraped, lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method, and then inorganic phosphate in extract was measured by ammonium molybdate/ascorbic acid method (10.Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27326-27331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) to calculate SM content. The cells were washed with PBS, seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free medium containing 10 μCi/ml l-[U-14C]serine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2for 24 h. The labeled cells were treated with HS for 30 min at 42 °C, and then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 h. After harvesting the cells, lipids extracted from the cells by the method of Bligh and Dyer were separated on TLC plates with a solvent of methyl acetate, propanol-1, chloroform, methanol, 0.25% KCl (25:25:25:10:9 by volume), the spots corresponding to ceramide were visualized, and the relative radioactivity was determined by using a BAS 2000 Image Analyzer (Fuji), corrected by the amount of phospholipids in each sample. After extracting the lipids according to the Bligh and Dyer method, ceramide levels were enzymatically measured by using Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase, which converts ceramide to ceramide 1-phosphate, and corrected by phospholipid phosphate as described before (9.Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No changes of diacylglycerol kinase activity during the procedure were confirmed to add 40 nmol of C2-ceramide to the reaction mixture as an internal standard, and the amount of phospholipid phosphate paralleled viable cell numbers as described in the text. After each treatment, HL60 cells (1 × 107) were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and homogenized in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as an enzyme source. The assay mixture for the measurement of magnesium-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase contained 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 nmol of [methyl- 14C]sphingomyelin (specific activity = 1.74 GBq/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 200 μg of enzyme in a final volume of 0.1 ml. For magnesium-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase, MgCl2 was removed from the reaction mixture. For acid sphingomyelinase, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was used instead of Tris-HCl. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1). Then 0.2 ml of double-distilled water was added to the tubes and vortexed. The tubes were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to separate the two phases. The clear upper phase (0.4 ml) was removed, placed in a glass scintillation vial, and counted with a scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 20 μg of total RNA was used for the Northern blotting analysis as described previously (10.Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27326-27331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, human c-jun and c-fos oligonucleotide probes (Oncogene Science) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a multiprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After electrophoresis and transferring RNA to Immobilon S membrane, hybridizations with labeled c-jun/c-fos probes were performed at 42 °C for 24 h and the membranes were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS (1× SSC containing 0.15 m NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate) at room temperature for 30 min and at 50 °C for 20 min. The membranes were exposed to Fuji x-ray films with the intensifying screens at −80 °C and calculated by BAS imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co, Minaiasigara, Kanagawa, Japan). Equal loading of RNA was confirmed by methylene blue staining or the amount of β-actin mRNA in each sample. The oligodeoxynucleotides of c-jun sense (5′-ACTGCAAAGATGGAAACG-3′), c-jun antisense (5′-CGTTTCCATCTTTGCAGT-3′), c-fos sense (5′-TTCTCGGGCTTCAACGCA-3′), and c-fos antisense (5′-TGCGTTGAAGCCCGAGAA-3′) were synthesized. The nucleotide sequences were to the first 18 bases following the AUG sequences of human c-jun (29.Smith M.J. Prochownik E.V. Blood. 1992; 79: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and c-fos (30.Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Hoffman L.B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with c-fos/c-jun sense or antisense (50 μg/ml) at the concentration of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS for 1 day before heat shock treatment at 42 °C for 30 min or C2-ceramide addition. The cells after each treatment were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 10 mmHEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm pepstatin, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min. The supernatant was collected as an enzyme source and added to the reaction mixture (10% sucrose, 10 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 μm DEVD-MCA), which was followed by incubation at 25 °C for 60 min. Fluorescence was measured by a microplate reader (MTP-100F, Corona Electric, Katsuda, Japan) using 360 nm excitation and 450 nm emission filters. Concentrations of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin liberated as a result of cleavage were calculated comparing with standard 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin solutions. When human leukemia HL-60 cells were treated with HS at 37, 40, 42, and 44 °C for 30 min, the viable cell numbers decreased in a temperature- and time-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). The morphologically apoptotic changes such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation without a membrane rupture were measured under light microscope after staining with May-Giemsa dye. The percents of apoptotic cells induced by 30 min of HS at 37, 40, 42, and 44 °C were 2 ± 2%, 20 ± 5%, 44 ± 10%, and 68 ± 4%, respectively, 4 h after cessation of treatment, while their viable cell numbers did not change significantly (Fig. 1, A and B). By HS treatment at more than 46 °C, the cells died of necrosis without showing any changes compatible with apoptosis (data not shown). The biochemical mechanism of ceramide generation by HS treatment was not investigated in mammalian cells, even though the activation of ceramide synthase has recently been reported to involved in HS-induced ceramide generation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (31.Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7235-7243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We first examined SM turnover and ceramide generation at the various temperatures after HS treatment in HL-60 cells. The levels of SM labeled with [14C]choline decreased to 84 ± 3% of the control level 2 h after 30 min treatment at 44 °C (Fig.2 A). In contrast, HS-induced ceramide generation measured by DGK assay increased in a temperature-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). Two hours after HS treatment at 44 °C increased ceramide levels to 172 ± 5% (8.6 ± 0.5 pmol/nmol phospholipid) as compared with the control levels (5.0 ± 0.2 pmol/nmol phospholipid). In addition, we examined the time course of ceramide generation after HS. In these experiments, we generalized DGK activity by adding known amount of C2-ceramide to each reaction mixture as an internal standard and measured phospholipids phosphate in the same numbers of living cells after HS treatment. As shown in Fig.3, the levels of ceramide, which were measured by phosphorylating ceramide to ceramide 1-phosphate, significantly increased as compared with the levels of phosphorylated internal standard (40 nmol of C2-ceramide). Ceramide generation started immediately after cessation of HS treatment and peaked with approximately 155% increase 2 h after treatment. The levels of phospholipids phosphate after HS treatment did not change if the cell number in each sample was same. Similar increase of ceramide after HS treatment was obtained by a different method from DGK assay. As shown in Fig. 4 (A andB), ceramide contents after HS treatment increased by approximately 180% as compared with the control when the cells were labeled by [14C]serine, and labeled ceramide was separated on TLC plate and measured by BAS system.Figure 3Time course of ceramide increase by HS. The cells were treated with HS for 30 min at 42 °C at the initial concentration of 5.0 × 105 cells/ml, resuspended at 37 °C, and then harvested after the indicated times. Contents of intracellular ceramide and exogenous C2-ceramide (40 nmol) were measured by DGK assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Contents of phospholipids phosphate were measured by ammonium molybdate/ascorbic acid method as described elsewhere. The results are shown as changes relative to the cells treated without HS and were obtained from three different experiments.

The cells were labeled with [14C]serine for 24 h in serum-free medium, harvested, and treated with or without HS for 30 min at 42 °C. Two hours after HS treatment, the lipids were extracted by Bligh and Dyer method and separated on TLC plates with standard lipids such as ceramide, glucosylceramide (GlcCer), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and sphingomyelin (SM) (A). After autoradiography, ceramide changes were measured by BAS system as described under “Experimental Procedures” (B). The results are shown as changes relative to the cells treated without HS and were obtained from three different experiments. The barsindicate 1 S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined changes of sphingomyelinase activity after HS, because neutral and/or acid sphingomyelinase were involved in ceramide generation induced by many kinds of stresses. As shown in Fig.5 A, the activity of neutral, magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase significantly increased from 1.3 to 1.6 nmol/h/mg protein 2 h after HS treatment. Acid and neutral-magnesium-independent sphingomyelinase did not increase after HS treatment (data not shown). To confirm the involvement of sphingomyelinase in ceramide generation by HS, we also examined whether mass of ceramide generation was compatible with that of decreased SM. The amounts of SM changed from 43.8 ± 3.2 to 33.4 ± 3.4 pmol/106 cells 2 h after HS, whereas ceramide increased from 11.3 ± 0.6 to 18.1 ± 1.2 pmol/106 cells (Fig. 5 B). The decrease in SM (10.4 ± 3.9 pmol/106 cells) was fairly close to 6.8 ± 1.1 pmol/106 cells increase of ceramide in HS-treated cells. These result"

Friedreich's ataxia is a lethal disorder affecting the nervous system and heart. The disorder is due to a triplet expansion in the first intron of the Frataxin gene that results in decreased levels of Frataxin mRNA (1.Campuzano V. Montermini L. Lutz Y. Cova L. Hindelang C. Jiralerspong S. Trottier Y. Kish S.J. Faucheux B. Trouillas P. Authier F.J. Durr A. Mandel J.L. Vescovi A. Pandolfo M. Koenig M. Hum. Mol.

Genet. 1997; 16: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Insight into the function of Frataxin resulted from studies on theSaccharomyces cerevisiae gene, yeastFrataxin homologue (YFH1), which is an orthologue of mammalian Frataxin. In the absence of Yfh1p, iron accumulates within mitochondria, leading to a loss of respiratory activity through the generation of mitochondrial DNA mutations. It is thought that decreased respiratory activity is a consequence of iron-induced oxygen radicals (3.Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 4.Wilson R.B. Roof D.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).

Sci. 1980; 7: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and the finding of increased iron in mitochondria of Friedreich's ataxia fibroblasts (6.Delatycki M.B. Camakaris J. Brooks H.

Cortopassi G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) indicate that the yeast model may be an accurate reflection of the pathophysiology of Friedreich's ataxia. We initiated a search for genes that could suppress the respiratory deficit in yeast lacking Yfh1p. Here we report that CCC1,previously characterized as a putative Golgi Ca2+/Mn2+ transporter (8.Fu D. Beeler T. Dunn T. Yeast. 1994; 10: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9.Lapinskas P.J. Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), allowedΔyfh1 cells to maintain respiratory activity by preventing the toxic accumulation of mitochondrial iron. The restriction on mitochondrial iron accumulation resulted from reduced mitochondrial iron uptake rather than increased mitochondrial iron efflux. The observation that respiratory activity as well as leucine biosynthesis was unaffected in Δyfh1 cells overexpressingCCC1 implies that Yfh1p is not significantly involved in the biosynthesis, assembly or export of iron-sulfur clusters. Overexpression of CCC1 in wild type cells activated the iron-dependent transcription factor Aft1p, resulting in an increase in iron uptake and cytosolic iron accumulation. Activation of Aft1p suggests that cells sense that cytosolic iron is low, indicating that much of the cytosolic iron was not bioavailable. This reduced concentration of “free” iron did not affect the growth ofΔyfh1 cells but did prevent excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation. These studies demonstrate that toxic mitochondrial iron levels resulting from the loss of Yfh1p may only occur when cytosolic free iron levels are high. DY150 (MATa ura3–52, leu2–3, 112, trp1–1, his3–11, 15, ade2–1, can1–100(oc)), 1457 (MATα ura3–52, leu2–3, 112, trp1–1, his3–11, ade6, can1–100(oc)), Δaft1 (MATα trp1-Δ63, leu2–3, 112 gcn4–101, his3–609, ura3–52 aft1::LEU2,) and Δfet3 (MATα ura3–52, leu2–3, 112, trp1–1, ade2–1, can1–100(oc), fet3::HIS3) were all isogenic to the W303 strain of S. cerevisiae. METYFH1 was generated by crossing Δyfh1 (MATa ura3–52, leu2–3, 112, trp1–1, 15, ade2–1, can1–100(oc),yfh1::HIS3) strain with 1457, as described previously (10.Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The resulting diploid was transformed with a plasmid containing a methionine-regulated YFH1 in pTF63, an episomal plasmid bearing the URA3 marker (pMetYFH1). Expression of Yfh1p is regulated by the MET3 promoter, aHindIII/EcoRV fragment of m2265 clone containing the MET3 promoter. In the presence of methionine, theYFH1 transcription is suppressed, whereas in the absence of methionine, YFH1 is transcribed. The transformed diploid was sporulated and further dissected on synthetic medium lacking methionine and uracil. A haploid Δyfh1 strain with respiratory activity, maintained by the pMetYFH1, was identified and is designated METYFH1 (Δyfh1, pMetYFH1). The respiratory competence of METYFH1 was maintained by growth in medium lacking methionine and uracil. All growth media used in this study were described previously (10.Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain used for transformation was DH5α (F-, endA1, hsd-R17(rk-, mk+), supE44, thi-1, λ-, recA1, gyrA96, relA1, Δ(laczya-argF)U169, ϕ80dlacZΔM15deoR). The yeast genomic library used for the suppressor screen was obtained from American Type Culture Collection ATCC), ATCC 37323 (S. cerevisiae genomic library in YEp13, an episomal plasmid DNA bearing LEU2 marker). The genomic library was amplified in DH5α. DNA transformations ofE. coli and S. cerevisiae were performed by standard procedures (11.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 12.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A genomic library was transformed into METYFH1, and 30,000 LEU +, URA + transformants were selected on plates lacking uracil, leucine, and methionine. The transformants were replicated to uracil-supplemented plates, followed by replica-plating to 5′-fluoroorotic acid plates to select against URA3 cells. Suppressor candidates were identified by their growth on glycerol-ethanol plates. To exclude false positives, cells that still carried a functional YFH1 gene, polymerase chain reaction using primers specific to 5′ and 3′ end of YFH1 was performed. The two primers were 5REV, 5′-CGA GAT ATC TAG AGT GTA GCA ATG ATT AA-3′, and 3NTS1, 5′-CCC GAG CTC TTA AGC GGC CGC ACC TCC TTG GCT TTT AGA AAT GGC CT-3′. Cells showing a polymerase chain reaction product at 2.2 kilobases, but not 0.55 kilobases, the size of an intactYFH1 gene, were chosen for further study. Plasmids were rescued from candidate clones by electroporation into DH5α. DNA sequence analysis of the rescued plasmids utilized primers specific to the region upstream and downstream of BamHI site of YEp13. The sequencing primers were 026, 5′-CCA CTA TCG ACT ACG CGA-3′ and 027- 5′-ATG TCG GCG ATA TCA GGC G-3′. Sequence analysis revealed a single open reading frame,CCC1, shared by four library clones. One of the library clones, pS222, contained a genomic 4823-base pair segment consisting ofCCC1 and two other open reading frames: YLR219w and YLR218c. From this library clone, CCC1 was subcloned by removing a 1923-base pair EagI fragment that contained the two other open reading frames in part (YLR219w) and in whole (YLR218c) and part of the TET gene (tetracycline-resistant gene) in the vector. The remaining large EagI fragment (13562 base pair) that encompassed the sequence of 2243 base pair upstream and 252 base pair down stream of CCC1 was gel-purified and religated to construct pSCCC1. A plasmid containing a methionine-regulated CCC1-FLAG gene (pMetCCC1) was constructed using the MET3 promoter. A carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope (underlined)-tagged CCC1 was generated by the polymerase chain reaction. The two primers were 035, 5′-TCC CCC GGG CAC AAA TAT TAT GTC CAT AGC AC-3′, and 037, 5′-TCC CCG CGG TTA CTT GTC ATC GTC ATC CTT GTA ATC GCC GCC ACC CAG TAA CTT AAC AAA GAA CCA-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withSmaI and SacII. The MET3 promoter and digested polymerase chain reaction product were cloned intoHindIII and SacII sites of pTF62 (YEp181 with replacement of Bluescript II polylinker), an episomal plasmid bearingLEU2 as a selectable marker. Methionine-dependent expression of Ccc1p-FLAG was confirmed by Western blot using a mouse monoclonal antibody against FLAG epitope. The FLAG epitope did not influence the ability of CCC1 to maintain respiratory activity in Δyfh1 cells. The METCCC1 strain was generated by transforming METYFH1 strain with pMetCCC1. The transformed cells were “cured” of the pMetYFH1 plasmid by growth on uracil-containing medium. A plasmid containing YFH1 and a LEU2 gene as a selectable marker was constructed using polymerase chain reaction. Two primers were designed to amplify the up-stream 500 base pairs of YFH1. They are 028, 5′-CGC GGA TCC CTT ACC AGT CGC TGA TGC-3′, and 029, 5′-AA CTG CAG TCC CCC GGG TGC TAC ACT CTA TCT TCT CGC TTA G-3′. Another two primers were designed to amplify the open reading frame of YFH1 fused with FLAG sequence at 3′ end. They are 030, 5′-AA CTG CAG TCC CCC GGG ATG ATT AAG CGG TCT CTC GC-3′, and 031, 5′-CCC AAG CTT TTA CTT GTC ATC GTC ATC CTT GTA ATC GCC GCC TTG GCT TTT AGA AAT GGC CT-3′. The two amplified products were digested, purified, and ligated into pTF62 vector at BamHI and HindIII site. ASmaI site was inserted upstream of start codon ATG. Complementation analysis showed the FLAG epitope tag did not interfere with the protein function. An AFT1 up clone was generously provided by Dr. Dennis Winge. The original construct in a pRS313 vector, bearing aHIS3 gene, was digested with SpeI andSacI to release the AFT1 up fragment, which was cloned into pRS314, bearing the TRP1 marker. METYFH1 transformed with vector only or pSCCC1 was selected on medium lacking uracil, leucine, and methionine. 2 × 104 cells grown in the selective medium were inoculated into 5.0 ml of liquid medium supplemented with methionine at 330 mg/liter and specified concentrations of iron (ferrous ammonium sulfate). After 18 h, cell number was determined, and about 100 colony-forming units were plated on medium lacking uracil, leucine, and methionine and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. The incidence of petite colonies was determined by replica-plating to plates with 2% glycerol and 2% ethanol as a carbon source. Iron transport assays was performed as described (13.Davis-Kaplan S.R. Askwith C.C. Bengtzen A.C. Radisky D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13641-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In a 0.5-ml reaction, 5 × 106 cells were mixed with 59Fe (FeCl3; Dupont) at 0.5 μm in EDTA buffer with or without 1.0 mmascorbate. Cells were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and then washed on filters with EDTA-containing buffer to remove unincorporated iron. The filter was air-dried, and radioactivity was determined. The uptake activity was expressed as fmol of 59Fe/min/106cells. Exponentially growing cultures were harvested and washed three times with cold Lim-EDTA. 1 × 109 cells were incubated with 59Fe at 0.5 μm in the presence of ascorbate in 100 ml of Lim-EDTA at 30 °C for 10 min. Cells were harvested, washed three times with cold EDTA-containing buffer, and then incubated with 50 μm FeCl3and 1 mm ascorbate in the same culture medium for 2 h. Cells were harvested, spheroplasts were prepared, and subcellular organelles were recovered by centrifugation of a post-nuclear supernatant at 12,000 × g for 30 min as described by Radisky et al. (10.Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The membrane pellet was layered onto a 0–25% iodixanol gradient, which was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 2 h. The gradient was fractionated, and radioactivity in each fraction was determined. The location of organelles was determined by Western blot analysis using an antibody against mitochondrial porin, vacuolar alkaline phosphatase (Molecular Probes), and Pep12p (a generous gift from Dr. Scott Emr). To detect porin or Pep12p, 0.05-ml samples from each gradient fraction were applied to gel electrophoresis and then Western-blotted. To detect alkaline phosphatase, 0.75-ml samples from each fraction were precipitated with trchloroacetic acid before gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The data is plotted as the radioactivity in each gradient fraction expressed as a fraction of the total radioactivity in the post-nuclear supernatant. Since Δyfh1 cells are respiratory-deficient, we used a plasmid shuttle approach to identify high copy suppressors that could rescue Δyfh1 cells from respiratory deficit (Fig. 1). A diploid heterozygous for chromosomal deletion of YFH1 was transformed with aURA3 plasmid in which YFH1 was placed under the control of the MET3 promoter (pMetYFH1). Diploids were sporulated in the absence of methionine, which permittedYFH1 gene expression and maintained respiratory competence as shown by growth on glycerol-ethanol. These haploids, designated METYFH1 (Δyfh1, pMetYFH1), were transformed with a high copy (YEp) genomic library that contained the LEU2 gene as a selectable marker. Transformants were selected on plates lacking leucine, uracil, and methionine. The cells were then plated under conditions that promoted the loss of the YFH1-containingURA3 plasmid: growth on medium lacking leucine but containing methionine and uracil followed by replica-plating to medium lacking leucine but containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. Cells capable of growth on glycerol-ethanol medium were examined for the presence or absence of an intact YFH1 gene by the polymerase chain reaction using YFH1-specific primers. Cells that did not contain an intact YFH1 gene and were capable of growth on glycerol-ethanol were selected for further study. Screening of 30,000 transformants resulted in five colonies that could grow on glycerol-ethanol plates but did not contain an intact YFH1. To demonstrate that growth on glycerol-ethanol required theLEU2 library plasmid, cells were grown in leucine-containing medium to permit plasmid loss. All cells that showed a leucine auxotroph were also found to be respiratory-incompetent. Plasmids were able to be rescued from transformed cells and, when re-transformed into the METYFH1 strain, permitted growth on respiratory substrates. Four of the five library clones contained overlapping regions of yeast chromosome XII. The only open reading frame in common was a previously identified gene CCC1 (8.Fu D. Beeler T. Dunn T. Yeast. 1994; 10: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (9.Lapinskas P.J. Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This gene was subcloned from one of the library clones and, when placed in a high copy vector, was able to support the growth of a Δyfh1 strain in glycerol-ethanol medium (Fig.2 A). Cells lackingYFH1 are viable but grow poorly in glucose medium, particularly in the presence of high levels of iron (10.Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CCC1 markedly enhanced growth in glucose-containing medium in the presence of high levels of iron (Fig.2 B). It is possible that overexpression of CCC1 is not sufficient for respiratory competence, as the selection system may have resulted in the generation of obligate endogenous suppressors. Additional mutations may have occurred during the process of selecting for cells that lost the pMetYFH1 plasmid. To test this possibility we took advantage of the ability to regulate YFH1 expression through the MET3 promoter. The addition of methionine repressedYFH1 expression, resulting in an iron concentration-dependent increase inrho − cells. Cells overexpressing CCC1 maintained respiratory activity, even in the face of high iron levels (Fig. 3 A). If cells resistant to 500 μm iron were allowed to lose the CCC1plasmid through growth on leucine-containing medium, they also lost the ability to grow on glycerol-ethanol medium, becoming petite in an iron concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that growth of Δyfh1 cells on glycerol-ethanol is solely dependent on the CCC1 plasmid. The suppression of iron-dependent petite formation by overexpression of CCC1 demonstrates that CCC1 is both necessary and sufficient for maintaining respiratory activity ofΔyfh1 cells. Our previous studies indicated that mitochondrial iron accumulation was the proximal cause of respiratory incompetence in Δyfh1 cells (10.Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). IfCCC1 maintains respiratory competence in Δyfh1cells, it could do so by either increasing antioxidant defenses or by limiting mitochondrial iron accumulation. Growth of cells in medium containing H2O2 showed that CCC1overexpression had at best a marginal protective effect. This effect was seen with the plasmid that contained just CCC1 (pSCCC1) but not with the original library clone (pS222). Yet both plasmids could maintain the respiratory activity of Δyfh1 cells. These results suggest that it is unlikely that the respiratory sparing ability of CCC1 is due to increased antioxidant defenses (Fig. 2 C). We then examined the effect of CCC1overexpression on mitochondrial iron accumulation. When METYFH1 cells were grown in the presence of methionine (Yfh1p “off”), there was a 10-fold increase in the total amount of cell-associated59Fe, and more than 50% of that was localized in mitochondria (Fig. 4). The accumulation of mitochondrial iron was not seen if cells were grown in the absence of methionine (Yfh1p “on”). In CCC1-overexpressing METYFH1 cells, the amount of cell-associated 59Fe was similar in the presence or absence of methionine (see below). Yet regardless of whether Yfh1p was expressed or not,CCC1-overexpressing cells did not accumulate mitochondrial iron. The inability of CCC1-overexpressing cells to accumulate mitochondrial iron could reflect a restriction on mitochondrial iron import or an acceleration of mitochondrial iron export. We took advantage of the ability to regulate CCC1 expression to distinguish between these possibilities. A strain, METCCC1 (Δyfh1, pMetCCC1), was constructed that had a chromosomal deletion of YFH1 and contained a high copy plasmid ofCCC1 under the control of the MET3 promoter. Cells grown in the presence of methionine overnight did not show evidence of CCC1 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Maximal levels of CCC1 mRNA, however, were reached within 2 h of methionine removal (data not shown). To examine the effect ofCCC1 on mitochondrial iron efflux, METCCC1 cells were grown in the presence of methionine overnight to turn off expression of Ccc1p. The cells were washed with assay buffer, incubated for 10 min with 59Fe2+, washed, and then incubated for 2 h in the same medium containing methionine but without radioactive iron. At the end of this incubation, the cells were divided into two aliquots, one aliquot was again incubated in the same methionine-containing medium (Ccc1p off), and the other was incubated in the medium lacking methionine (Ccc1p on). Cells were harvested at specific times, spheroplasted, and homogenized, and organelles were applied to an iodixanol gradient. The amount of cell-associated iron was similar in Δyfh1 cells regardless of whether they synthesized Ccc1p. Yet cells grown in the absence of methionine (Ccc1p on) had less than 20% cell associated iron within mitochondria compared with greater than 60% cell-associated iron in mitochondria of cells grown in the presence of methionine (Ccc1p off). Once iron had accumulated within mitochondria, re-expression of Ccc1p did not promote the loss of that accumulated iron (Fig.5, A and B). In contrast, re-expression of Yfh1p in Δyfh1 cells resulted in an acceleration of mitochondrial iron egress (Fig. 5, Cand D). These results indicate that, unlike YFH1,CCC1 is not involved in mitochondrial iron efflux, suggesting that Ccc1p limits iron entry into mitochondria. CCC1 was originally identified as a Mn2+/Ca2+Golgi transporter, and it is possible that it may transport iron as well. One explanation for the decrease in mitochondrial iron may be that Ccc1p transports iron out of the cytosol. Decreased cytosolic iron may limit iron entry into mitochondria. Analysis of the distribution of59Fe within cells, however, did not provide evidence thatCCC1 overexpression led to accumulation of iron in any membranous compartment (Figs. 4 and 5). A representative gradient of subcellular organelles is shown in Fig. 4 B. We did not detect any accumulation of iron within vacuoles, prevacuoles, or Golgi vesicles. Our fractionation procedure resulted in less than 5.0% release of vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y to the cytosolic fraction (data not shown). Greater than 75% of accumulated iron was found to be cytosolic in both wild type and Δyfh1 cells overexpressingCCC1 (data not shown). We also considered the possibility that CCC1 overexpression resulted in the appearance of Ccc1p on the cell surface, where it might act as an efflux channel. Pulse-chase experiments, however, provided no evidence that Ccc1p overexpression resulted in efflux of cellular iron (data not shown). Cells with aYFH1 deletion show increased expression of genes regulated by the iron-dependent transcription factor Aft1p (3.Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). This increased expression results from sequestration of iron within mitochondria, resulting in a decreased cytosolic iron concentration. Overexpression of CCC1 did not prevent the increased rate of iron uptake in Δyfh1 cells and resulted in increased iron transport in wild type cells (Fig.6 A). Increased iron uptake was mediated by the high affinity iron transport system, as deletion ofFET3 resulted in no iron transport inCCC1-overexpressing cells. No increased uptake activity was seen in a CCC1-overexpressing Δaft1 strain, indicating that the effect of CCC1 required the iron transcription factor Aft1p. CCC1-overexpressing cells had a higher iron content than wild type cells, as measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (control cells, 60.8 fmol of iron/106 cells; pSCCC1-transformed cells, 99.0 fmol iron/106 cells). The increase in iron content was similar to that seen in Δyfh1 cells grown in the same medium but was less than expected, based on the measurement of iron transporter activity. The high affinity iron transport system is regulated primarily by iron through Aft1p. Ferrireductase activity, which is required to convert ferric iron to ferrous iron (the substrate for the high affinity transport system) is regulated by several factors including iron (Aft1p), copper (Mac1p), and cyclic AMP (14.Lesuisse E. Horion B. Labbe P. Hilger F. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). That ferrireductase activity was rate-limiting was shown by measuring iron transport in the presence and absence of ascorbate (Fig.6 B). In the absence of ascorbate, which bypasses the need for a reductase, CCC1-overexpressing cells took up more iron than control cells (vector only) but much less iron than in the presence of ascorbate. A similar pattern of iron transport was observed for cells that had increased expression of the high affinity iron transport system through the action of a constitutive allele ofAFT1 (AFT1 up ). The finding that overexpression of CCC1 results in induction of at least some iron-regulated genes leads to the question of whether activation of the iron regulon will suppress the respiratory phenotype of Δyfh1. Introduction of theAFT1 up allele into wild type cells resulted in an increase in high affinity iron transport to the same extent asCCC1 overexpression (Fig. 6 B), yetAFT1 up did not prevent iron-dependent petite formation in Δyfh1 cells (Fig. 7). A genetic screen revealed that CCC1 is a high copy suppressor of the respiratory deficit of Δyfh1 cells. High copy plasmid expression of CCC1 prevented Δyfh1from becoming petite, even in the presence of high iron concentrations.CCC1 overexpression does not prevent cellular iron uptake but does prevent the increased mitochondrial iron accumulation expected of a Δyfh1 strain. This result confirms previous studies demonstrating that the respiratory defect in Δyfh1 cells is due to excessive accumulation of iron within mitochondria (10.Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Heart biopsies from patients with Friedreich's ataxia have shown a selective defect in the activity of mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins (15.Rotig A. de Lonlay P. Chretien D. Foury F. Koenig M. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). A recent report indicated that in the absence of Yfh1p, even in low iron conditions, there was a decrease in aconitase activity, suggesting that Yfh1p was involved in regulating formation of iron-sulfur clusters (16.Foury F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A caveat to those experiments is that aconitase protein levels were not measured. In our strain of yeast, however, deletion of YFH1 does not result in significant loss of iron-sulfur-containing enzyme activities, as determined by biologic function. For the studies reported here, we employedΔyfh1 cells that had a deletion in the LEU2gene. These cells could be converted to leucine prototroph by aLEU2-containing plasmid. Leucine biosynthesis requires the activity of Leu1p, a cytosolic enzyme that relies on iron-sulfur clusters for catalytic activity (17.Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Deletion of YFH1 does not confer leucine auxotroph, implying that Yfh1p is not required for the formation of cytosolic iron-sulfur clusters. Respiration also requires the activity of iron-sulfur cluster proteins, andCCC1 can preserve respiratory activity in aΔyfh1 strain. These observations suggest thatYFH1 may not be significantly involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation. Overexpression of CCC1 preserves respiratory activity by preventing mitochondrial iron accumulation. We determined that Ccc1p does not accelerate the loss of iron from mitochondria. Thus, Ccc1p prevents or limits iron transported into mitochondria. The limitation on mitochondrial iron accumulation is clearly not absolute, as enough iron enters the mitochondria for the synthesis of heme and iron-sulfur clusters. The mechanism by which Ccc1p limits mitochondrial iron uptake is not clear. Ccc1p was characterized as a Mn2+/Ca2+ transporter, based on genetic studies (8.Fu D. Beeler T. Dunn T. Yeast. 1994; 10: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9.Lapinskas P.J. Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Examination of the data base reveals homologous genes in plants, bacteria, and the archea. No homologues have been identified in either invertebrates (Caenorhabditis elegans) or vertebrates. It is possible that Ccc1p may transport iron, as most Fe2+ transporters are capable of transporting other divalent transition metals, particularly Mn2+ (18.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V.

A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We have shown that Ccc1p does not lead to iron export from cells or sequestration of iron in membranous compartments. Our results indicate that iron accumulates in cytosol and is not recognized by the iron-sensing transcription factor Aft1p. We do not know the form or species (Fe2+ or Fe3+) of this stored iron. Cells overexpressing Ccc1p perceive an apparent “low” iron content and increase the transcription of the iron regulon, resulting in increased activity of the high affinity iron transport system. Increased activity of the high affinity iron transport inCCC1-overexpressing cells is an indication that cells “sense” low iron levels. Expression of the high affinity iron transport system, however, does not necessarily result in iron-limited growth; the activities of a number of essential iron-containing proteins, such as methyl sterol oxidase, Δ9-fatty acid desaturase, are unaffected as shown by robust rates of cell growth. The mechanism by which mitochondria can adjust iron accumulation with respect to cytosolic iron levels is unknown. Restriction of cytosolic “free iron” either by environmental iron restriction (10.Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

However, it is unclear whether FAK also participates in the regulation of growth factor-elicited cellular functions. In this study, we have demonstrated that although overexpression of FAK in Madin-Dardy canine kidney cells did not alter their growth property or ability to form tubules within collagen gel upon hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation, it apparently enhanced HGF-induced cell scattering. This enhancement was largely because of an increase in the third phase (i.e. cell migration) of cell scattering rather than the first two phases (i.e. cell spreading and cell-cell dissociation). Conversely, the expression of FAK-related nonkinase significantly (∼60%) inhibited HGF-induced cell migration. Moreover, we have found that the effect of FAK on promoting HGF-induced cell motility was greatly dependent on cell-matrix interactions. We showed that HGF treatment selectively increased the expression of integrins α2 and, to a lesser extent, α3 in Madin-Dardy canine kidney cells and that a monoclonal antibody against integrin α2 efficiently blocked HGF-enhanced cell migration on collagen. In our efforts to determine the mechanism by which FAK promotes HGF-induced cell migration, we found that FAK mutants deficient in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or p130Cas binding failed to promote HGF-induced cell migration. Interestingly, cells expressing a FAK mutant defective in Grb2 binding exhibited a rate of migration ∼50% lower than that of cells expressing wild type FAK in response to HGF stimulation. Taken together, our results suggest a link between HGF-increased integrin expression, FAK activation, and enhanced cell motility and implicate a role for FAK in the facilitation of growth factor-induced cell motility.

The proline-rich sequence region of FAK (residues 712–718) has been identified as the major binding site for the SH3 domain of p130Cas (14.Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), creating a binding site for the complex of Grb2 and Sos. Because Sos functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras (21.Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that FAK may link integrin-initiated signals to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (13.Schlaepfer D.D.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor, is a multifunctional growth factor that elicits mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic activities in various cell types (23.Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1177-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The diverse biological effects of HGF are transmitted through activation of its transmembrane receptor encoded by the c-met proto-oncogene (24.Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M.-L.

The Met receptor is a heterodimer composed of a 45-kDa α chain that remains entirely extracellular and a 145-kDa β chain that traverses the plasma membrane and contains the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (26.Gonzatti-Haces M.

Upon HGF binding, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of the receptor is activated resulting in autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues in the β chain (30.Naldini L. Vigna E. Narsimhan R.P. Gaudino G. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.A. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 501-504PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Ferracini R. Longati P. Naldini L. Vigna E. Comoglio J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19558-19564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues can then associate with molecules containing Src homology 2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains that act to transduce extracellular signals to the cell interior (32.Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that HGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex, which further contributes to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by HGF in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (33.Chen H.-C. Chan P.-C. Tang M.-J. Cheng C.-H. Chang T.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the role of FAK in HGF-elicited cellular functions has not been clarified. In this study, we have found that overexpression of FAK in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells apparently enhanced HGF-induced cell scattering. In contrast, the expression of FAK-related nonkinase (FRNK) significantly inhibited HGF-induced cell motility. Moreover, our results suggest that, in addition to PI3K and p130Cas, the Grb2 binding may also contribute to the ability of FAK to promote cell migration. Taken together, these results strongly implicated a role for FAK in the facilitation of growth factor-enhanced cell motility. Recombinant human HGF was purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum and LipofectAMINE were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Collagen type I, fibronectin, and vitronectin were purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA).

Repasky E.A. Bankert R.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The pKH3 expression plasmid encoding HA epitope-tagged FRNK was provided by Dr, J.-L. Guan (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) and described previously (5.Zhao J.-H. Reiske H. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). MDCK II 3B5 cells overexpressing HA epitope-tagged wild type (WT) FAK, D395A, P712A/P715A, and Y925F have been described previously (9.Chan P.-C. Lai J.-F. Cheng C.-H. Tang M.-J. Chiu C.-C. Chen H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26901-26906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418. To generate cells stably expressing FRNK, MDCK cells were grown on 60-mm dishes and transfected essentially as described (9.Chan P.-C. Lai J.-F. Cheng C.-H. Tang M.-J. Chiu C.-C. Chen H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26901-26906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE following the manufacturer's instructions. Clones were selected in G418-containing medium and screened by immunoblotting with anti-HA. MDCK cells were lyzed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors as described previously (33.Chen H.-C. Chan P.-C. Tang M.-J. Cheng C.-H. Chang T.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To analyze the tyrosine phosphorylation of HA epitope-tagged FAK proteins in MDCK cells, aliquots (100–300 μg) of lysates from various stable MDCK cell clones were incubated with 5 μl of monoclonal anti-HA for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads coupled with rabbit anti-mouse IgG. The beads were washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, boiled for 3 min in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Immunoblotting was performed with anti-phosphotyrosine (1:1000) or anti-FAK (1:1000) using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech chemiluminescence system for detection. Other antibodies for immunoblotting in this report were anti-integrin α2 (1:1500), anti-integrin α3 (1:1500), anti-integrin αV (1:1500), anti-HA (1:1000), anti-ERK (1:1500), and anti-phosphoERK (1:1500). For cell proliferation assays, 105 MDCK cells were plated on 100-mm culture dish in medium containing 10 or 1% serum with or without 1 ng/ml HGF. The medium was changed daily for 6 days. Cell number was measured every 2 days using a hemacytometer. For tubulogenesis assays, MDCK cells were suspended at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml in cold collagen solution as described previously (35.Montesano R. Schaller G. Oric L. Cell. 1991; 66: 697-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). An aliquot (1 ml) of cell suspension was dispensed into a well of 6-well plate and allowed to gel for about 20 min at 37 °C before adding 1 ml of medium containing 10% serum and 20 ng/ml HGF. The medium was changed daily. After 8 days, the tubules were photographed using a phase contrast microscope. For scatter assays, MDCK cells were allowed to grow as discrete colonies by seeding at 2 × 103/60-mm dish. When the majority of colonies contained between 20–40 cells (60–72 h after seeding), the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 5% serum and 10 ng/ml HGF. The effect of HGF on scatter of MDCK cells was evaluated every 3 h for 12 h and photographed under a phase contrast microscope at 100× magnification. To quantify the assay, cells that have lost contact with their neighboring cells and exhibited a fibroblast-like shape in total 50 colonies were enumerated. For cell spreading assays, MDCK cells were allowed to grow as discrete colonies and then treated with 10 ng/ml HGF as described above. 2 h after HGF stimulation, cells were collected by trypsinization and suspended in serum-free medium at 5 × 104 cells/ml. 2 ml of cell suspension was added to 60-mm dish that had been coated with collagen (20 μg/dish) and blocked with bovine serum albumin. Cells were allowed to spread for 20 min, and spread cells were scored under a phase contrast microscope. Cells with extended processes and not phase bright were defined as spread cells. For cell dissociation assays, MDCK cells were allowed to grow as discrete colonies and then treated with 10 ng/ml HGF as described above. 4 h after HGF stimulation, cells were collected in serum-free medium by scraping and passed through a micropipette 30 times under a constant force. The number of cell particles (N p) containing more than three cells was measured using a hemacytometer. The cell suspension containing cell particles was subsequently subjected to centrifugation and trypsinization for cell number (N c) measurement. The cell dissociation index was expressed asN p/N c × 100%. For cell migration assays, MDCK cells were allowed to grow as discrete colonies and then treated with 10 ng/ml HGF as described above. 12 h after HGF stimulation, cells were collected by trpsinization and suspended in serum-free medium at 5 × 105/ml. Migration assays were carried out in a Neuro Probe 48-well chemotaxis chamber (Cabin John, MD). The medium containing collagen or other matrix proteins at 10 μg/ml was added to the lower chamber. The lower and upper chambers were separated by a polycarbonate membrane (8-μm pore size, Poretics, Livermore, CA). Cells were allowed to migrate for 7 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The membrane was fixed in methanol for 10 min and stained with modified Giemsa stain (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells on the upper side of the membrane were removed by cotton swabs. Cells on the lower side of the membrane were counted using a light microscope at 200× magnification. To evaluate the significance of integin α2β1 in cell migration, cells were suspended in serum-free medium containing various amounts of the monoclonal antibody 5E8 before loading them to the chemotaxis chamber. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with PD98059 at the final concentration of 100 μm for 1 h before trypsinization and allowed to migrate on collagen in the presence of the inhibitor. We have previously established stable MDCK cell lines overexpressing HA epitope-tagged FAK, in which the expression level of ectopic FAK is 2–3-fold of endogenous FAK (9.Chan P.-C. Lai J.-F. Cheng C.-H. Tang M.-J. Chiu C.-C. Chen H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26901-26906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To examine whether FAK plays a role in HGF-elicited cellular functions, cells from MDCK clones overexpressing wild type FAK (WT) and control clones (Neo) resistant to G418 sulfate were subjected to assays for evaluating their proliferation, tubulogenesis, and scatter upon HGF stimulation (Fig.1). No matter whether HGF was present or not, no differences in the growth curves of control and WT cells were observed in medium with 10 or 1% serum (Fig. 1 A). Given that the doubling time of MDCK cells is approximately 12 h, even relatively small differences in the rate of cell proliferation should become apparent after 6 days. Thus, these results indicate that neither FAK overexpression nor HGF stimulates proliferation of MDCK cells under our experimental conditions. In addition, judging from the percentage of tubule formation and the morphology of tubules, FAK overexpression did not appear to affect the ability of MDCK cells to form branch tubules in three-dimensional collagen gels in response to HGF stimulation (Fig. 1 B). However, FAK overexpression in MDCK cells apparently enhanced HGF-induced cell scattering (Fig. 1 C and see below). Three days after sparsely seeding, MDCK cells grew as discrete colonies, each of which contained between 20 and 40 cells. Consistent with previous studies (36.Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), HGF induced cell colonies to spread during the first 2–4 h. Subsequently, some cells within each colony began to detach from their neighboring cells and exhibited a shape resembling that of motile fibroblasts. These cells continued to migrate, finally leading to a “scatter” phenomenon. We quantified the HGF-induced cell scattering by counting the number of cells that have lost contact with their neighbors in a total of 50 colonies. As shown in Fig.1 C, FAK overexpression in MDCK cells prominently enhanced the scatter effect of HGF. The quantitative results indicated that the number of scattered cells from WT clones was approximately twice that of control clone 6 or 9 h after HGF stimulation. As demonstrated in this study (Fig. 1 C) and elsewhere (36.Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37.Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the HGF-induced cell scattering can be further divided into three phases, namely cell spreading, cell dissociation, and cell migration. To determine which phase was potentially affected by FAK overexpression, control and WT cells were allowed to grow as discrete colonies and then treated with or without HGF for 2, 4, or 12 h before subjecting to cell spreading, dissociation, or migration assays, respectively. As shown in Fig.2 A, in the absence of HGF treatment, the number of WT cells spreading on collagen was ∼2-fold of Neo cells, supporting a role of FAK in promoting cell spreading on matrix proteins, as described previously (1.Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 2.Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The HGF treatment induced a similar increase (∼10%) in cell spreading for both control and WT cells. This result was consistent with our observation that HGF induced colonies of control and WT cells to spread with a similar extent during first 3 h after HGF stimulation (Fig.1 C). Thus, these results suggest that the effect of HGF on cell spreading is likely to be independent of FAK expression. Next we determined the degree of cell-cell adhesion using cell dissociation assays. As shown in Fig. 2 B, 4-h HGF treatment induced a similar increase (∼10%) in the degree of cell dissociation for both control and WT cells. However, FAK overexpression did not appear to have any effect on this event. This conclusion was further supported by our observations that the expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherine or β-catenin, two proteins known to be involved in cell-cell adhesion (38.Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), were not affected by FAK overexpression in MDCK cells (data not shown).Figure 4Role of matrix proteins and integrin α2β1in FAK promotion of HGF-induced cell migration. A, cells from a control clone (Neo) or MDCK cells overexpressing FAK (WT) were incubated with (+) or without (−) 10 ng/ml HGF for 12 h before subjecting to a migration assay. Cells in the upper half of the chamber were allowed to migrate through a porous membrane toward the lower chamber containing medium alone (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) or supplemented with 10 μg/ml of collagen, fibronectin, or vitronectin as an attractant. Mean cell counts are from eight fields and two independent experiments. Relative cell migration was calculated based on the level of WT cell migration on collagen in the absence of HGF stimulation. B, WT cells were incubated with (+) or without (−) 10 ng/ml HGF for 12 h before subjecting to a migration assay using collagen as an attractant. The upper half of the chamber contained cells and various amounts of monoclonal anti-α2 integrin as indicated. Monoclonal anti-HA (50 μg/ml) was used as a control. Mean cell counts are from eight fields and two independent experiments. Relative cell migration was calculated based on the level of WT cell migration without treatments of HGF and anti-α2 integrin. C, control or WT cells were treated with (+) or without (−) 10 ng/ml HGF for 12 h and then lyzed. An equal amount (50 μg) of whole cell lysates was analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against integrin α2, α3, or αV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether FAK participates in the third phase (i.e.cell migration) of HGF-induced cell scattering, cells from control and WT clones were trypsinized 12 h after HGF stimulation and then subjected to cell migration assays using collagen as an attractant (Fig. 2 C). In the absence of HGF stimulation, WT cells had exhibited a higher (∼5-fold) rate of cell migration in comparison with the control cells. This is consistent with previous studies (4.Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18.Reiske H.R. Kao S.-C. Cary L.A. Guan J.-L. Lai J.-F. Chen H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) showing that FAK overexpression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells promoted their migration on fibronectin. Significantly, cells overexpressing FAK dramatically increased their migration on collagen upon HGF stimulation, indicating that FAK overexpression synergized with the effect of HGF to promote cell migration. To further confirm the role of FAK in HGF-enhanced cell migration, FRNK, a FAK carboxyl-terminal construct known to function as a dominant negative mutant of FAK (1.Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 2.Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), was overexpressed in MDCK cells. As shown in Fig.3, approximately 60% of HGF-induced cell migration was inhibited by FRNK expression. Together, these results indicate that FAK is involved in regulating MDCK cell motility induced by not only collagen but also HGF. To examine whether the effect of FAK overexpression on promoting HGF-induced cell motility is matrix-dependent, control and WT cells were subjected to cell migration assays with or without using a matrix protein as an attractant (Fig.4 A). Although the HGF treatment generally increased MDCK cell motility, the effect of FAK overexpression on promoting HGF-induced cell motility was much more prominent when a matrix protein, especially collagen, was present. These data indicated that the ability of FAK to promote HGF-induced cell migration is mainly matrix-dependent. It is known that integrin α2β1 is the major receptor for collagen on MDCK cells (39.Schoenenberger C.-A. Zuk A. Zinkl G.M. Kendall D. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 527-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of integrin α2β1 in HGF-enhanced cell migration on collagen, a monoclonal antibody 5E8 (34.Chen F.A. Repasky E.A. Bankert R.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which recognizes integrin α2 subunit and prevents integrin α2β1 from its ligand binding, was applied to the migration assays (Fig. 4 B). The treatment of WT cells with this blocking antibody, but not a control antibody (monoclonal anti-HA), resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of HGF-induced migration, indicating that the effect of FAK on promoting HGF-induced cell migration on collagen is mediated by integrin α2β1. It is noteworthy that at the concentration of 5 μg/ml, this blocking antibody was able to completely inhibit WT cell migration in the absence of HGF stimulation but reached only a partial (∼60%) inhibition in the presence of HGF stimulation. These results suggested that HGF might increase the expression of integrins α2β1 and/or alter their conformation, leading to a less efficiency for this antibody to exert its blocking function. To examine the effect of HGF on integrin expression, control and WT cells were treated with or without HGF for 12 h, and their whole cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 C, HGF induced a marked (2-fold) increase in the expression of integrin α2and, to a lesser extent, α3. Conversely, the expression of integrin αV (Fi"

Recently, we have established the H-146 small cell lung carcinoma line as a suitable model to study the biochemical basis of neuroepithelial body cell chemotransduction. Here we explore the possibility that hypoxic modulation of K+ channels is intimately linked to activity of NADPH oxidase. Graded hypoxia caused graded inhibition of whole cell K+ currents, which correlated well with membrane depolarization. Pretreatment with the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl (TPA), inhibited K+ currents at all potentials. Although 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate and TPA in the presence of bisindolylmaleimide were also able to depress K+ currents, only TPA could significantly ameliorate hypoxic depression of these currents. Thus, protein kinase C (PKC) activation modulates the sensitivity of these cells to changes inpO2. Furthermore, because the addition of H2O2, a downstream product of NADPH oxidase, could only activate K+ currents during hypoxia (when endogenous H2O2 production is suppressed), it appears likely that PKC modulates the affinity of NADPH oxidase for O2 potentially via phosphorylation of the p47phox subunit, which is present in these cells.

Numerous physiological processes have long been known to ensure optimization of ventilation-perfusion matching, but the cellular mechanisms underlying such processes are only now beginning to be understood. One such important mechanism is that of O2 chemoreception, i.e. an active cellular response to an acute general and/or regional reduction ofpO2. Most studies to date have focused on the carotid body arterial chemoreceptors. Type I cells of these sensors express O2-sensitive K+ channels, and exposure to hypoxia causes rapid channel inhibition. This leads to cell depolarization, Ca2+ entry via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and subsequent triggering of neurosecretion, an essential step in the initiation of afferent information, which leads to reflex increases of ventilation (1.Peers C.

Compelling evidence is emerging that neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs),1 located in clusters at bronchial bifurcations throughout the lung, serve as airway chemoreceptors (6.Cutz E. Jackson A. Respir.

These transmitters (particularly serotonin) may act to initiate afferent nerve activity to medullary respiratory centers and may also act to control local vasomotor tone, hence directly influencing local ventilation-perfusion matching (9.Leach R.M. Twort C.H.C. Cameron I.R. Ward J.P.T. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1992; 82: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Compared with type I cells of the carotid body, our understanding of O2 chemoreception by NEB cells is in its infancy, due largely to the technically demanding nature of their isolation/primary culture or to the difficulty in recording currents in situusing the lung slice. However, it has been established that they are electrically excitable and, most importantly, possess O2-sensitive K+ channels (7.Youngson C. Nurse C. Yeger H. Cutz E. Nature. 1993; 365: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 10.Fu X.W. Nurse C. Wang Y.T. Cutz E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 139-150Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may respond, at least superficially, like carotid body type I cells. In recent studies, we have built on the suggestions of others to establish that small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cells, which are believed to be derived from NEB cells (11.Gazdar A.F. Helman L.J. Israel M.A. Russell E.K. Linnoila R.I. Mulshine J.L. Schuller H.M. Park J.G. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4078-4082PubMed Google Scholar) and with which they share numerous similarities (12.Pancrazio J.J. Viglione M.P. Tabbara I.A. Kim Y.I. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5901-5906PubMed Google Scholar), represent immortal airway chemoreceptors. Thus, we have recently identified, in the SCLC cell line H-146, a specific component of the whole cell K+ current, which is sensitive to hypoxia and influences membrane potential (13.O'Kelly I. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L709-L716PubMed Google Scholar, 14.O'Kelly I. Stephens R.H. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L96-L104PubMed Google Scholar). This current is 4-aminopyridine- (4-AP) and Ca2+-insensitive, quinidine-sensitive, and may be a novel member of the tandem P-domain family of K+ channels. The ease of use of cell lines as compared with isolated NEB cells or lung slices suggests that they may be exploited to understand the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying rapid effects of hypoxia on chemoreceptor cells. The mechanism(s) which couple a fall of pO2 to K+ channel inhibition remain elusive, but recent work has implicated the involvement of NADPH oxidase as an O2 sensor in both NEB cells and SCLC cells (15.Wang D. Youngson C. Wong V. Yeger H. Dinauer M.C. Vega- Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. Cutz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase model for O2 chemoreception suggests that, under normoxic conditions, the oxidase tonically generates superoxide from O2, which is rapidly converted to H2O2 by a number of enzymes including superoxide dismutase and catalase. This H2O2 is believed to promote channel activity. It follows, therefore, that H2O2 levels will decline in hypoxia, causing a concomitant reduction in channel activity. Several independent lines of evidence support this idea: (i) NEB and SCLC cells express the mRNA encoding K+channels known to be modulated by H2O2; (ii)in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry have indicated that specific subunits of NADPH oxidase (gp91phoxand p22phox) are present in both cell types; (iii) H2O2 generation in NEB cell clusters is significantly greater than in surrounding tissue, can be enhanced by protein kinase C (PKC) activation using phorbol ester (which specifically phosphorylates another subunit, p47phox, of the oxidase complex), and can be suppressed by diphenyleneiodonium, a known NADPH oxidase inhibitor and; iv), K+ currents can be enhanced (albeit transiently) by application of H2O2 (10.Fu X.W. Nurse C. Wang Y.T. Cutz E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 139-150Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15.Wang D. Youngson C. Wong V. Yeger H. Dinauer M.C. Vega- Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. Cutz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations support the idea that hypoxic inhibition of K+ channels in airway chemoreceptor cells and SCLC cells involves reduced levels of H2O2 derived from NADPH oxidase activity, but a direct link between the observations is still lacking. Indeed, it has, to date, never been demonstrated directly that hypoxia causes a fall of H2O2 levels in these cells. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that H2O2 production declines during hypoxia and have exploited the fact that NADPH oxidase activity can be regulated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation (16.Tardif M. Rabiet M.J. Christophe T. Milcent M.D. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6885-6895PubMed Google Scholar) to test further this model for O2 chemoreception in SCLC cells. Our results provide compelling functional evidence to support a central role for NADPH oxidase in this important process, and we propose that PKC may modulate chemoreception by altering the affinity of the oxidase for O2. The small cell lung carcinoma cell line, H-146, was purchased from American Tissue Type Cell Collection (Rockville, MD) and was of unknown passage number. Cells were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium (containing l-glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2% sodium pyruvate, and 2% penicillin/streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. Medium was changed every 2 days and cells were passaged every 6–7 days by splitting in the ratio 1:5. Cells were used between nominal passage numbers 1 and 6. Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were of the highest grade available and were purchased from Sigma. Standard pipette solution was K+-rich and contained: 10 mm NaCl, 117 mm KCl, 2 mmMgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.2, with KOH; free [Ca2+] = 27 nm. Standard bath solution was Na+-rich and contained: 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. 4-AP was added to the bath solution where indicated, and osmolarity was maintained by isoosmotic substitution of NaCl. Where indicated, cells were preincubated with 100 nm of the phorbol esters 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and 4α-phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate (4α-PDD) and in some cases with the PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM, 1 μm), for 10 min at room temperature. Where used, 1 μm BIM was also included in the pipette solution. All tubing was gas-impermeant (Tygon tubing BDH, Atherstone, Berkshire, UK). Normoxic solutions were equilibrated with room air. Solutions were made hypoxic, where appropriate, by bubbling with N2(g) for at least 30 min prior to perfusion of cells. This procedure produced no shift in pH. Solution flow rate was ∼5 ml·min−1. Graded hypoxia was achieved by splicing variable lengths of gas-permeant tubing into the perfusion lines.pO2 was measured (at the cell) using a polarized (−800 mV), calibrated carbon fiber electrode (16.Tardif M. Rabiet M.J. Christophe T. Milcent M.D. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6885-6895PubMed Google Scholar); for the experiments reported herein, the pO2 values were 150 (normoxia), 85, 45, 25, and 15 (hypoxia) mm Hg. Following trituration (10 passes through a 1-ml automatic pipette tip), cells were allowed to adhere at 37 °C for at least 1 h to poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips before being placed in a temperature-controlled perfusion chamber (Brook Industries, Lake Villa, IL) mounted on the stage of a Nikon TMS inverted microscope. All experiments were carried out at 21 ± 1 °C. Patch pipettes were manufactured from standard walled borosilicate glass capillary tubing on a two-stage Narishige PP-83 pipette puller (Narishige Scientific Instrument Lab, Kasuya, Tokyo, Japan), were heat-polished on a Narishige microforge, and had measured tip resistances of 3–8 MΩ (when filled with K+-rich pipette solution). Resistive feedback voltage-clamp was achieved using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Forster City, CA). Voltage protocols were generated, and currents were recorded using pClamp 6.0.3 software employing a Digidata 1200 A/D converter (Axon Instruments). Data were filtered (4-pole Bessel) at 2 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. Following successful transition to the whole-cell recording mode (12.Pancrazio J.J. Viglione M.P. Tabbara I.A. Kim Y.I. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5901-5906PubMed Google Scholar), capacitance transients were compensated for and measured. Where necessary, series resistance compensation was used at 100%. To evoke ionic currents in H-146 cells, two voltage protocols were used: (a) ramp protocol: holding potential = −70 mV, −100 to +60 mV, ramp duration = 1 s, frequency = 0.1 Hz; (b) time series: holding potential = −70 mV, single increment to 0 mV, step duration = 50 ms, frequency = 0.1 Hz. Fast current clamp was achieved using the same amplifier, and the solutions were the same as those used in the voltage-clamp experiments. Cells were clamped at I = 0 pA and the recorded voltage was filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 2 kHz. H-146 cells were loaded for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm (in 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide) H2O2 fluorescent indicator 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA, Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) during adherence to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (17.Reynolds I.J. Hastings T.G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3318-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted on the stage of Nikon Diaphot 300 and perfused with the standard normoxic (150 mm Hg) bath solution (see above for composition). H2DCFDA was excited with light of wavelength 488 nm using a monochromator and emitted fluorescence (>510 nm) collected by a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, C4880–80). Cells were imaged using Openlab software at 2-s intervals, and pixel intensity was calculated off-line. Following a control period of 20 s, cells were perfused with standard bath solution for 2 min, which was either air-equilibrated (150 mm Hg) or hypoxic (15 mm Hg). Recovery was followed for a further 3 min. The magnitude of the steady-state outward currents (time-series protocol) was measured as the mean current between 46 and 49 ms of the voltage-pulse. In the time-series plots, the currents from each separate experiment were normalized by dividing the current at each point by the mean of the first five currents in that series; in the figures, the numbers represent the mean (± S.E.);n refers to the number of cells. Current amplitudes were not corrected for cell size, because this did not vary between the four groups of cells studied, as determined by membrane capacitance measurements; control cells, 5.0 ± 0.13 picoFarad (n = 93); TPA-treated cells, 4.8 ± 0.23 picoFarad (n = 57); 4α-PDD treated cells, 4.7 ± 0.21 picoFarad (n = 23); TPA- and BIM-treated cells, 5.7 ± 0.50 picoFarad (n = 16). Statistical comparisons were made using the paired or unpaired Student'st test, as appropriate, with p < 0.05 being considered significant. H2DCFDA is effectively trapped within cells and, in common with most other flourescence indicators, undergoes photobleaching. Because it is not a dual excitation or emission dye, this artifact cannot be removed by signal ratioing. Thus, during the experimental period, fluorescence intensity declines exponentially with time. Nevertheless, a change in the rate of decay is indicative of a change in cellular H2O2content/production. Mean pixel intensity was calculated from each cell area at intervals of 2 s, background fluorescence was subtracted, and the subtracted intensity was plotted against time. The rate of change of fluorescence was calculated as a rolling average of slope of five consecutive frames for the entire duration of the experiment. To account for any differential dye loading, slope data from each cell were normalized such that the first average from each protocol was unity. In Fig. 2, the mean data plot shows this rolling averageversus time. A downward deflection (indicative of an increase in normalized slope value) represents a decrease in H2O2 production/content. Exemplar, nonadjusted data are shown in the insets of Fig. 2. Total RNA was extracted from pelleted H-146 cells using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, W. Sussex, UK). The extracted RNA was then divided; 50% was treated (cleaned) with RQ-1 RNase-free DNase (1 unit·μg−1 RNA; Promega, Southampton, Hampshire, UK) to remove genomic DNA contamination, before re-extraction using the RNeasy Micro Kit. The remaining 50% was kept in an untreated (uncleaned) state. The yield, purity, and integrity of the RNA was verified by spectrophotometry at 260/280 nm, followed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose, and was then stored in aqueous solution at −80 °C. RT was performed on 1-μg aliquots of both cleaned and uncleaned RNA using the reverse transcription system A3500 (Promega), comprising Avian Myeloblastosis Virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) (15.Wang D. Youngson C. Wong V. Yeger H. Dinauer M.C. Vega- Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. Cutz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) primers (42 °C, 15 min). The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR and screened for p47phox RNA expression using oligonucleotide primers (22-mers) designed against the published sequence of human neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (GenBankTMaccession number M55067 (18.Rodaway A.R. Teahan G.C. Casimir C.M. Segal A.W. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5388-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)). These primers (upstream: 5′-atgcaggtgagccatacgtcgc-3′, downstream: 5′-tctttcctgatgacccaccagc-3′) were chosen because they were predicted to amplify a region within a single exon. Therefore, products from both reverse transcribed mRNA and genomic DNA (the positive control used in this study) would be of identical length. PCR reactions using the cleaned and uncleaned (as positive control) cDNA were run in parallel. Amplification of 1-μl cDNA (equivalent to 160 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA) was performed using a Hybaid (Ashford, Middlesex, UK) express thermal cycler, in a volume of 50 μl, containing 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega), under optimized conditions with 2.0 mm MgCl2: hot start = 94 °C/1 min; denaturing = 94 °C/1 min, annealing = 64 °C/1 min, extension = 72 °C/1 min for 30 cycles followed by a final cycle, which had a 5-min extension. Products were separated on 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide/UV transillumination. Because signal was relatively low from cleaned cDNA, a “turbo” PCR was performed on 5 μl of the primary PCR products. Turbo PCR conditions were identical to primary PCR. Sequencing was carried out by dye terminator PCR with an ABI PRISM automated sequencer (School of Biology, University of Leeds, UK). In H-146 cells, we have recently shown that acute hypoxia (pO2 ∼15 mm Hg) causes rapid and reversible inhibition of whole cell K+currents and membrane depolarization (13.O'Kelly I. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L709-L716PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1 extends our earlier observations to show that reducing perfusate pO2 in a graded manner (between 150 and 15 mm Hg) results in correspondingly graded inhibition of these K+ currents and also causes graded membrane depolarization (Fig. 1 A). In this series of experiments, a pO2 of 15 mm Hg significantly reduced mean outward K+ current amplitudes (measured at 0 mV) from 223.2 ± 28.9 pA to 149.6 ± 41.2 pA (p < 0.005, n = 7), a reduction of∼33%. The same degree of hypoxia caused a significant depolarization from -47.9 ± 1.3 mV to −38.4 ± 3.8 mV (p < 0.05, n = 7), a reduction of 9.5 mV. These values are similar to our previously published data (13.O'Kelly I. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L709-L716PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows a plot of the mean current amplitudeversus membrane potential at the five grades of hypoxia examined. Hypoxic reduction in whole cell K+ current correlates well with membrane potential (r = 0.96) and strongly suggests, therefore, that the O2-sensitive current contributes to the resting membrane potential in this airway chemoreceptor cell model. Central to the hypothesis that NADPH oxidase acts as the O2 sensor in airway chemoreceptors is the notion that H2O2 levels are decreased during hypoxia. Fig.2 demonstrates that this is indeed the case in H-146 cells. During normoxia, fluorescence intensity gradually declined because of photobleaching (Fig. 2 A andinset). However, perfusion with the hypoxic solution (15 mm Hg) caused a far greater decline in fluorescence intensity, approaching twice the base-line bleaching rate (observed under normoxic conditions (Fig. 2 B and inset)). This effect was maximal around 30 s after exchange to the hypoxic solution and was reversible on reperfusion with normoxic solution. The time-course of this effect was similar to that of hypoxic inhibition of K+currents (see Ref. 13.O'Kelly I. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L709-L716PubMed Google Scholar and also Figs. 5 and 6). These data show clearly that H2O2 levels in H-146 cells are regulated by environmental pO2 and suggest that K+ channels are under tonic control by a H2O2-generating system.Figure 6Effect of H2O2on 4-AP-insensitive K+current. A, typical currents evoked from an example cell before (Normoxia), during (Normoxia + H2O2), and after (Normoxia) bath application of 2 mm H2O2.B, typical currents evoked from a representative cell before (Normoxia) and during hypoxia (Hypoxia) and during continued exposure to hypoxia but in the additional presence of 2 mm H2O2 (Hypoxia + H2O2). Currents were evoked by step depolarizations from −70 to 0 mV, and scale bars apply to bothA and B. 10 mm 4-AP was present throughout in both cases. C, mean time series plot of currents evoked from five cells as in A but normalized to the first five currents evoked after the effects of 10 mm4-AP had stabilized. H2O2 was applied for the period indicated by the horizontal bar. D, as C, except cells (n = 7) were exposed to hypoxia before and during H2O2 application, as indicated byhorizontal bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Preincubation of H-146 cells for 10 min with the membrane-permeable PKC activator, TPA (100 nm), caused a significant (p < 0.05, n = 11 control cells and 8 TPA-treated cells; unpaired Student's t test) reduction in ramp currents at all potentials (Figs.3, A and B). To determine the contribution which PKC activation made to this reduction in current, we employed: (a) a biologically inactive phorbol ester, 4α-PDD (100 nm); and (b) TPA together with the PKC inhibitor, BIM (1 μm bath and pipette). These maneuvers resulted in smaller, nonsignificant (p> 0.29, n = 5; p > 0.52,n = 10, respectively) reductions in currents (Fig. 3,C–E), than were seen with TPA. This suggests that the inhibition caused by TPA was attributable to both nonspecific actions of phorbol esters and activation of PKC. Fig.4 A shows currents evoked by ramp depolarizations from a typical H-146 cell before, during, and after exposure to two levels of acute hypoxia. These currents exemplify the reversible, graded inhibition caused by hypoxia, which is summarized in Fig. 1 A. In contrast to these findings, currents recorded in cells pretreated with 100 nm TPA, although reduced in amplitude (see above), were virtually unaffected by hypoxia (e.g. Fig. 4 B). Average current amplitudes (measured at 0 mV) at all levels of hypoxia examined are plotted in Fig. 4 C. Thus, TPA markedly and significantly (p < 0.01, n= 6 control cells; n = 4 TPA-treated cells) suppressed hypoxic inhibition of K+ currents in H-146 cells. The results shown in Fig. 4 D (determined from currents recorded at 0 mV during normoxia and hypoxia at 15 mm Hg) indicate that this was attributable to PKC activation, because neither 4α-PDD (p = 0.18, n = 4) nor TPA in the presence of BIM (p = 0.87, n = 5) could significantly suppress the level of hypoxic inhibition of currents. We have previously shown that the O2-sensitive K+ current is resistant to 4-AP (14.O'Kelly I. Stephens R.H. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L96-L104PubMed Google Scholar). Following treatment with TPA, the proportion of the whole cell current, which was 4-AP-insensitive, remained essentially unchanged compared with control (Fig. 5, A and D). However, in the presence of a maximally effective concentration of 4-AP (10 mm), hypoxia (15 mm Hg) caused over 50% inhibition of the residual current (e.g. Fig. 5, A,C, and D). In contrast, hypoxic inhibition of the 4-AP-resistant current was significantly (p < 0.005,n = 8) reduced to around 25% following TPA treatment (e.g. Fig. 5, B, C, and E). Fig. 5 C shows the mean time course of these effects. This observation shows that although TPA caused a generalized reduction in current (see also Fig. 3), the 4-AP-resistant component was less O2-sensitive in these cells when PKC was activated. Although there are many PKC-dependent mechanisms that could account for these data, one potential site of action for PKC might be the NADPH-oxidase complex, which has been recently implicated in NEB cell O2 sensing (15.Wang D. Youngson C. Wong V. Yeger H. Dinauer M.C. Vega- Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. Cutz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). If this is the case in our NEB cell model, we would predict that products downstream of NADPH oxidase activity would regulate the O2-sensitive K+channel. We addressed this possibility by applying one such product, H2O2, in the presence of 4-AP. Fig.6 A shows that under normoxic conditions, H2O2 was without effect. However, during hypoxic inhibition of the K+ current, H2O2 caused a dramatic and transient reactivation of the current. The time course of this effect was similar to that previously reported in NEB cells (15.Wang D. Youngson C. Wong V. Yeger H. Dinauer M.C. Vega- Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. Cutz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A probable site of PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the heteromeric enzyme, NADPH oxidase, is p47phox (16.Tardif M. Rabiet M.J. Christophe T. Milcent M.D. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6885-6895PubMed Google Scholar). However, although there is good evidence for the presence in both native NEB cells and H-146 cells of some of the components of the enzyme (15.Wang D. Youngson C. Wong V. Yeger H. Dinauer M.C. Vega- Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. Cutz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), evidence for the presence of p47phox in H-146 cells is still lacking. Fig. 7 shows the use of RT-PCR to address this question directly. Amplification of a product compatible with the presence of p47phox (130 base pairs) in genomic DNA (uncleaned lanes) shows that the PCR protocol that we employed can detect p47phox (Fig. 7 A). Using this protocol, we could detect only a small signal from cDNA reverse transcribed from DNase-treated H-146 RNA (cleaned lanes). However, a turbo PCR reaction produced a strong signal (130 base pairs) from the cleaned sample (Fig. 7 A), indicating that p47phox was indeed being transcribed by these cells (confirmed by sequencing, Fig. 7 B) but that its expression was low because of either rapid degradation or low copy number of p47phox mRNA; PCR cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. Regardless, p47phox is present and is, therefore, a possible site of PKC-dependent regulation of the oxidase in our model airway chemoreceptor cells. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that acute reductions in pO2 suppress K+currents in airway chemoreceptor NEBs (7.Youngson C. Nurse C. Yeger H. Cutz E.

Initially, it was generally accepted that the chemokine subclasses differ in their biological activity to stimulate different kinds of leukocytes, so that CXC chemokines are mediators of acute inflammation through neutrophil activation while the CC chemokines mediate chronic inflammation by attracting leukocytes such as eosinophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and dendritic cells. However, this paradigm has recently been shown to have exceptions; for example, CXCR3 is expressed on activated T cells (4.Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and neutrophils can be activated by CC chemokines following stimulation with interferon-γ (5.Bonecchi R. Polentarutti N. Luini W. Borsatti A. Bernasconi S. Locati M. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. Mackay C. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 474-479PubMed Google Scholar). Chemokines mediate their effects by binding to cell-surface receptors that belong to the seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (1.Wells T.N.C. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 376-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). More recently, chemokine receptors have been subject to intense scrutiny following the discovery that several of them are co-receptors for HIV1 cell entry (6.Berger E.A. AIDS. 1997; 11: S3-S16PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, the CC chemokine receptor CCR5 and the CXC chemokine receptor, CXCR4, function as the major co-receptors for HIV infection in vivo, while several other receptors, including CCR3, have been demonstrated to act as coreceptors in vitro (7.He J. Chen Y. Farzan M. Choe H. Ohagen A. Gartner S. Busciglio J. Yang X. Hofmann W. Newman W. Mackay C.R. Sodroski J. Gabuzda D. Nature. 1997; 385: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) The expression of chemokine receptors is under the control of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-2 (8.Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and interferon-γ (5.Bonecchi R. Polentarutti N. Luini W. Borsatti A. Bernasconi S. Locati M. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. Mackay C. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 474-479PubMed Google Scholar), and is thus modified during disease. Chemokine receptors are therefore an attractive target for therapeutic intervention both for inflammation and infection by viruses such as HIV. To this end, several kinds of chemokine receptor antagonists have been developed (9.Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 65: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is well known that the NH2-terminal region is critical for the biological activity of chemokines, and therefore modifications of this region of a chemokine can profoundly alter the activity of the chemokines on leukocytes. Thus modified chemokines such as Met-RANTES (10.Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Montjovent M.O. Borlat F. Offord R.E. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol.

In vivo studies using these analogues have proved the concept that chemokine receptor blockade is effective in preventing inflammation in several animal models; for example, Met-RANTES administration reduced the inflammation in a model of crescentic glomerulonephritis (14.Lloyd C.M. Minto A.W. Dorf M.E. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. Salant D.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. J. Exp.

In addition, MCP-1(9–68) administration was highly effective in preventing the symptoms associated with arthritis in mice that spontaneously develop this condition (18.Gong J.H. Ratkay L.G. Waterfield J.D. Clark L.I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a virally produced chemokine, vMIP-II encoded by herpesvirus-8 has also been shown to be effective in preventing nephritis (19.Chen S.H. Bacon K.B. Li L. Garcia G.E. Xia Y.Y. Lo D.

AOP-RANTES, a potent inhibitor of CCR5-mediated HIV-1 infection, has been shown to be capable of activating CCR5 in transfected cell lines, as well as in primary cells (20.Mack M. Luckow B.

In order to investigate the therapeutic potential of RANTES modifications in allergic or autoimmune disease we have further analyzed the activity of RANTES, AOP-RANTES and Met-RANTES in their ability to activate CCR3 in eosinophils, and to down-modulate CCR1 and CCR3 from monocytes and eosinophils respectively. We present results that demonstrate that while AOP-RANTES is capable of acting on CCR3 to activate eosinophils, its effects on CCR1 and CCR3 endocytosis are significantly different to those seen on CCR5. Surprisingly, we describe that RANTES induces prolonged down-regulation of CCR1, while AOP-RANTES does not. Finally, in contrast to the potent anti-infectivity properties on R5 HIV-1 viruses, the addition of the pentacarbon chain to the NH2 terminus of RANTES to form AOP-RANTES does not confer particularly potent inhibitory properties for R3 HIV-1 viral infection. Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES were prepared as described previously (10.Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Montjovent M.O. Borlat F. Offord R.E. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol.

C5a was obtained from Sigma Chemicals (Deisenhofen, Germany). The mouse mAb against human CCR1 (IgG2b) was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-CCR3 (IgG2a, clone 7B11) was prepared as described previously (23.Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) or was obtained from R&D Systems. The mouse mAb against human CCR5 (IgG1, clone MC-1) was prepared as described previously (20.Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E.I. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The murine IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b isotype control antibodies were obtained from Immunotech (Hamburg, Germany). The rat IgG2a isotype control antibody was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Human granulocytes were isolated from heparin-anticoagulated venous blood from non-atopic healthy donors using Ficoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) density gradient centrifugation as described previously (24.Elsner J. Oppermann M. Czech W. Dobos G. Schopf E. Norgauer J. Kapp A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For further purification, granulocytes were resuspended in HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml BSA (HBSS+BSA). Eosinophils were purified by negative selection with Dynabeads M-450 (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany) coated with anti-CD16 antibody (clone 3G8, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) as described previously (24.Elsner J. Oppermann M. Czech W. Dobos G. Schopf E. Norgauer J. Kapp A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The resulting eosinophil purity was 99.5%, as determined by microscopic examination with Kimura staining and flow cytometric analysis (FACScan®, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) using phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD16 antibody (clone 3G8, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) (24.Elsner J. Oppermann M. Czech W. Dobos G. Schopf E. Norgauer J. Kapp A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Receptor down-modulation on monocytes was carried out using total blood without prior isolation of the monocytes. For this purpose, freshly drawn EDTA-blood was diluted 10-fold with phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged for 8 min at 300 ×g, resuspended in RPMI, recentrifuged, and then resuspended in RPMI at a cell density of approximately 10 × 106/ml and used directly. The monocytes were distinguished from the other leukocyte populations on the basis of their forward and side light scatter properties by flow cytometry. Eosinophils were loaded with 2 μm fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes), and [Ca2+]i was measured at 37 °C in an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL) as described previously (25.Elsner J. Dichmann S. Dobos G.J. Kapp A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Autofluorescence represents approximately 10% of the total fluorescence of cells loaded with fura-2, and it is slightly greater at 340 nm than at 380 nm. The fluorescence of unloaded cells was therefore subtracted from an equivalent density of cells loaded with fura-2 to correct the signal for autofluorescence. The autofluorescence of the cells was virtually unchanged upon addition of stimulus. Dual excitation spectra were collected at 340 and 380 nm, and emission was fixed at 510 nm. Lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence was measured using a single-photon imaging system with a two-dimensional photon counting system which allows the simultaneous measurement and analysis of 96 wells (MTP Reader, Hamamatsu Photonics, Herrsching, Germany) as described elsewhere (26.Elsner J. Hochstetter R. Kimmig D. Kapp A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In brief, eosinophils were suspended at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in HBSS+BSA containing 200 μm lucigenin (Sigma). Aliquots (100 μl) containing 5 × 103 eosinophils were placed into flat-bottomed white microtiter plates (Microfluor, Dynatech, Denkendorf, Germany). Cells were stimulated by the indicated stimuli or medium as a control. Measurements were performed in triplicate at 37 °C. Integral counts from 0 to 60 min incubation intervals after addition of the stimuli to the cell sample were measured and expressed as intensity integral counts. Data are expressed as the original plots or ratio between stimulus-induced intensity integral counts and medium-induced intensity integral counts. Pertussis toxin (Calbiochem Novabiochem, San Diego, CA) treatment was performed by incubation of 1 × 106 cells/ml for 120 min at 37 °C with and without 2 μg/ml pertussis toxin as described elsewhere (26.Elsner J. Hochstetter R. Kimmig D. Kapp A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed and resuspended in test medium prior to the measurement of reactive oxygen species release induced by the ligands. Viability of eosinophils after toxin treatment was more than 95%, as assessed by propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) staining in flow cytometry. U87/CD4/CCR3 cells are a human osteosarcoma cell line stably expressing human CD4 and CCR3 and were a kind gift from Dan Littman (Skirball Institute, New York, NY). Duplicates of U87/CD4/CCR3 cells set up overnight at 1 × 104 cells/well in 48-well trays (Costar) were exposed to 75 μl of chemokine at twice the required final concentration for 30 min at 37 °C. 2000 focus-forming units of the R3R5X4 HIV-1 strain, 2028 (27.Simmons G. Wilkinson D. Reeves J.D. Dittmar M.T. Beddows S. WEBER J. Carnegie G. Desselberger U. Gray P.W. Weiss R.A. Clapham P.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8355-8360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in 75 μl was added to each well. After 3 h of incubation, the cells were washed three times and fresh medium containing chemokine at the required concentration was added. After another 3 days of incubation, the cells were fixed in cold methanol:acetone (1:1) and immunostained for HIV-1 p24gag antigen as described previously (28.Clapham P.R. McKnight A. Weiss R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3531-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infected foci stained blue and were counted by light microscopy, and focus-forming units/ml were calculated. Cells were incubated in a total volume of 100 μl of RPMI for 30 min at 37 °C in an incubator or on ice with various concentrations of chemokines. RPMI alone was used as the control. For recycling experiments, cells were washed three times with 3 ml of RPMI at room temperature and further incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were taken at the times indicated and stained for receptor surface expression as described below. All staining procedures were performed on ice, and centrifugation steps were carried out at 2 °C. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in RPMI containing 10 μg/ml anti-chemokine receptor mAb or isotype control. After 60 min, the cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate/phycoerythrin-labeled rabbit anti-mouse F(ab)2 fragment (F313/R439, Dako, Hamburg, Germany). After two washing steps, the cells were analyzed on a FACS-Calibur (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes were distinguished by their forward and side scatter properties. Fluorescence intensity was calculated as (mean channel fluorescence [chemokine receptor] − mean channel fluorescence [isotype control])/(mean channel fluorescence [medium] − mean channel fluorescence [isotype control]). Unless otherwise stated, the data in the text and figures were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.). Analysis of variance was used for comparing experimental groups to the control value. When the global test of differences was significant at the 5% level, pairwise tests of differences between groups were applied (Student's t test for paired data using 5% significance level, closed test procedure). The eosinophils from healthy non-atopic donors used in these experiments were screened for their profile of the RANTES receptors CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 by flow cytometry using the appropriate monoclonal antibodies. CCR3 was the receptor most highly expressed on eosinophils, although a significant expression of CCR1 was detectable (Fig.1). Surface expression of CCR5 was undetectable. The release of reactive oxygen species can be induced by several chemokines, eotaxin and eotaxin-2 being the most potent (Fig.2 A and Ref. 26.Elsner J. Hochstetter R. Kimmig D. Kapp A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Met-RANTES was unable to induce the release of reactive oxygen species at the concentrations tested from 0.125 × 10−10 to 1.25 × 10−7m in human eosinophils (Fig.2 B). In contrast to Met-RANTES, AOP-RANTES showed an identical activity to RANTES in this assay, which is less potent that eotaxin and eotaxin-2 (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, no calcium mobilization was observed for Met-RANTES at 1.25 × 10−8m (data not shown), whereas RANTES and AOP-RANTES gave a robust response at this concentration (Fig.3). In heterologous desensitization experiments, RANTES almost completely desensitized the response induced by an equivalent concentration (1.25 × 10−8m) of eotaxin (Fig. 3 B), but AOP-RANTES was unable to do so, since eotaxin, when applied 90 s later, still gave a larger calcium flux (Fig. 3 D). When the order of addition was reversed, homologous desensitization was observed in both cases (Fig. 3, A and C). We were able to determine if the receptor responsible for calcium mobilization was CCR3 by using the blocking monoclonal anti-CCR3 antibody, 7B11 (Fig.4). Treatment with this antibody abolished the responses induced by both RANTES (data not shown) and AOP-RANTES, as well as that induced by eotaxin, while no effect was observed on the response induced by C5a.Figure 3Eotaxin-induced heterologous desensitization to AOP-RANTES in eosinophils.

For the CCR3 neutralizing experiments, the cells were preincubated for 5 min with RPMI medium containing 10 μg/ml anti-CCR3 mAb (clone 7B11) prior to stimulation with 1.25 × 10−8mAOP-RANTES (B) and 1.25 × 10−8m eotaxin (D). C5a was used as a positive control in each experiment as indicated by 2. One representative experiment out of four is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dependence of the release of reactive oxygen species in response to the CCR3 ligands on G protein coupling was investigated by pre-incubation of the eosinophils with pertussis toxin. Pre-treatment with pertussis toxin completely abolished the response to eotaxin, eotaxin-2, RANTES, and AOP-RANTES (Fig.5). The viability of the eosinophils after incubation with the toxin was found to be greater than 95%, as assessed by flow cytometry following propidium iodide staining. The infection of human osteosarcoma cells that express CD4 and CCR3 by the HIV-1 strain 2028, which can use either CCR3, CCR5, or CXCR4 for entry, has been used to assess the inhibitory properties of CCR3 ligands. The most potent inhibitor was the virally encoded vMIP-II, as has been previously reported (29.Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Coulin F. Simmons G. Johnsen A.H. Alouani S. Power C.A. Luttichau H.R. Gerstoft J. Clapham P.R. Clarklewis I. Wells T.N.C. Schwartz T.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), which had an IC50 value of 3 nm in this assay. Eotaxin, the most efficacious CCR3 ligand, was also very potent, with an IC50 value of 4.2 nm, but it did not achieve the complete inhibition shown by VMIP-II. RANTES was less efficient, and only reached half-maximal inhibition at 100 nm. Mip-1α, in accordance with its lack of CCR3 activity, was inactive in inhibiting viral infection. AOP-RANTES was moderately effective, with an IC50 value of 15 nm (Fig.6). CCR3 down-regulation from the surface of eosinophils was monitored by pre-incubating the cells with 1.25 × 10−7m AOP-RANTES, Met-RANTES, eotaxin, and medium for 30 min at 4 °C and at 37 °C. The cells were then stained with the anti-CCR3 mAb and receptor expression measured by flow cytometry. The loss of surface CCR3 induced by ligand binding at 37 °C was presumed to be due to its down-modulation rather than altered receptor accessibility to the antibody, since ligand binding was not affected when measured at 4 °C, a temperature at which receptor internalization is prevented. The down-modulation of CCR3 on eosinophils showed some donor to donor variability. In one donor, eotaxin was significantly more potent than RANTES and AOP-RANTES (Fig.7 A), whereas, in two other donors, RANTES induced the same degree of down-modulation as eotaxin. In all donors, however, AOP-RANTES was equipotent to RANTES in inducing down-modulation. Met-RANTES was unable to induce any significant down-modulation of CCR3. The ability of the RANTES proteins to down-regulate CCR1 was investigated on freshly isolated monocytes rather than on eosinophils due to the significantly higher CCR1 expression level in the former cell type. Met-RANTES was unable to induce CCR1 endocytosis at concentrations as high as 3.75 μm (Fig.8 A), as has been described in CHO transfectants expressing CCR1 (30.Solari R. Offord R.E. Remy S. Aubry J.P. Wells T.N.C. Whitehorn E. Oung T. Proudfoot A.E.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9617-9620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). AOP-RANTES showed only weak activity in inducing CCR1 down-regulation, attaining only 30–40% at micromolar concentrations, whereas RANTES was able to achieve 80% removal of the cell surface CCR1. We were interested in the effect that the modified RANTES protein, AOP-RANTES, would have on the recycling of the other RANTES receptors, CCR1 and CCR3, in view of the fact that it prevented CCR5 from recycling to the cell surface in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (20.Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E.I. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). After 30 min of incubation with the various ligands (1.25 × 10−7m) for CCR3 on eosinophils and CCR1 on monocytes, the cells were washed three times to remove unbound ligand, and then re-incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated in Figs. 7 B and 8 B. After 2 h, 60–80% of the CCR3 receptor density was again detectable on the cell surface, following down-modulation by all the ligands tested, eotaxin, RANTES, and AOP-RANTES. After 24 h, the receptor level of CCR3 on eosinophils had reached 70–90% of their original number (data not shown). Thus, the AOP-RANTES-treated eosinophils behaved in a similar manner to the other ligand treated cells with respect to CCR3 recycling. AOP-RANTES only moderately down-regulates CCR1 achieving a maximum of 40% removal of cell surface CCR1. Over a period of 3 h following removal of AOP-RANTES, the CCR1 receptors were again detectable on the surface of the monocytes, attaining their original receptor density. Surprisingly, after removal of RANTES from the medium, no recycling of CCR1 was observed over the 3-h period. The observation that modification of the amino-terminal region of chemokines affects receptor activation and produces receptor antagonists has been made by several laboratories. Two such modified RANTES proteins, which have extensions at the amino terminus, have been reported to be potent antagonists. Met-RANTES, produced by the retention of the initiating methionine during expression in E. coli, is a potent inhibitor of RANTES- and MIP-1α-induced effects in THP-1 cells as well as T cells (10.Proudfoot A.E.I.

Furthermore, it has been shown to be efficacious in preventing inflammation in several animal models of disease (15.Plater-Zyberk C. Hoogewerf A.J. Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Wells T.N.C. Immunol.

When analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme presented as two major protein species of 46 and 97 kDa, respectively. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic peptides revealed at least partial identity of these two proteins. Amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides showed no apparent homologies of bovine N-SMase to any known protein. Peptide-specific antibodies recognized a single 97-kDa protein in Western blot analysis of cell lysates. The purified enzyme displayed a K m of 40 μm for sphingomyelin with an optimal activity at pH 7–8. Bovine brain N-SMase was strictly dependent on Mg2+, whereas Zn2+ and Ca2+ proved inhibitory. The highly purified bovine N-SMase was effectively blocked by glutathione and scyphostatin. Scyphostatin proved to be a potent inhibitor of N-SMase with 95% inhibition observed at 20 μmscyphostatin. The results of this study define a N-SMase that fulfills the biochemical and functional criteria characteristic of the tumor necrosis factor-responsive membrane-bound N-SMase. The magnesium-dependent, plasmamembrane-associated neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) catalyzes hydrolysis of membrane sphingomyelin to form ceramide, a lipid signaling molecule implied in intracellular signaling.

The mode of ceramide action and the regulation of its production have recently attracted great attention because of possible roles of ceramide in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (1.Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2.Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev.

The catabolic pathway for ceramide formation involves the action of SMases,1sphingomyelin-specific forms of phospholipase C, which hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond of sphingomyelin (N-acylsphingosine-1-phosphorylcholine), a phospholipid found in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells yielding ceramide and phosphorylcholine. There are several isoforms of SMase, distinguished by different pH optima, cellular topology, and cation dependence. A Mg2+-dependent neutral (N-)SMase operates at the plasmamembrane (4.Hostetler K.Y. Yazaki P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 456-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas an acid (A-)SMase is localized in the endosomal-lysosomal compartments (5.Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Vielhaber G. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Further, a neutral, Mg2+-independent activity was found in the cytosol (6.Yamaguchi S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4090-4092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an alkaline SMase was localized in the gastrointestinal tract (8.Duan R-D. Nyberg L. Nilsson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). N-SMase and A-SMase are rapidly and transiently activated by diverse exogenous stimuli. N- and A-SMases appear to be responsible for stimulus-induced increases of ceramide within a time frame of seconds and minutes (9.Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Therefore, these forms of SMases are considered as principal pathways for production of ceramide in early signal transduction. However, direct links between SMases and specific signaling systems remain to be established. Clearly, the unambiguous assignment of specific signaling functions to SMases will require genetic models, specific SMase inhibitors, and the availability of monoclonal anti-SMase antibodies. This is exemplified by the progress made with regard to the functional characterization of A-SMase. Human and murine A-SMase (pH optimum 4.5–5.0) have been molecularly cloned and determined to be the products of a conserved gene (10.Quintern L.E. Schuchman E.H. Levran O. Suchi M. Ferlinz K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18250-18259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The A-SMase gene also directs, independent of alternate splicing, the synthesis of a Zn2+-dependent secreted form of A-SMase (13.Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Cells from patients suffering genetically determined A-SMase deficiency (Niemann-Pick disease) (14.Brady R.O. Kanfer J.N. Mock M.N. Fredrickson D.S Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) as well as cells from A-SMase knock-out mice (15.Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) will be instrumental for unraveling the role of A-SMase in signaling and apoptosis. With respect to N-SMase, it is important to note that Niemann Pick patients as well as A-SMase knock-out mice retain N-SMase activity, indicating that the neutral forms are products of a distinct gene or genes (14.Brady R.O. Kanfer J.N. Mock M.N. Fredrickson D.S Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 15.Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In lieu of detailed information about the biochemical properties of N-SMase, the physiological function of N-SMase remains rather elusive. A vast array of biological functions has been ascribed to N-SMase. At the cellular level, N-SMase has been implicated in proliferation (17.Auge N. Escargueil-Blanc I. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Suc I. Andrieu-Abadie N. Pieraggi M.-T. Chatelut M. Thiers J.-C. Jafrezou J.-P. Laurent G. Levade T. Negre-Salvayre A. Salvayre R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12893-12900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), differentiation (18.Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), senescence (19.Venable M.E. Lee J.Y. Smyth J.M. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30701-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and apoptosis (for reviews see Refs. 1.Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2.Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 3.Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). As to more complex processes, N-SMase was suggested to regulate phagocytosis (20.Suchard S.J. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Mansfield P.J. Boxer L.A. Shayman J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lung development (21.Longo C.A. Tyler D. Mallampalli R.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), or hepatic regeneration (22.Albi E. Magni M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In view of this plethora of putative functional activities, the activation requirements of N-SMase are the subject of extensive investigations. Transient and rapid activation of N-SMase is observed in response to many exogenous stimuli including cytokines like TNF and interleukin-1, cell surface molecules like CD40 ligand and CD95 ligand, growth factors like nerve growth factor, chemotherapeutic agents, etc. (1.Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2.Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 3.Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In the paradigm of TNF signaling, we have identified a 9-amino acid residue motif at position 310–318 in the cytoplasmic tail of the p55 TNF receptor that is both necessary and sufficient for activation of N-SMase (23.Adam D. Wiegmann K. Adam-Klages S. Ruff A. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14617-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A novel WD repeat protein, designated FAN, was described that specifically binds to this motif and functionally couples the p55 TNF receptor to N-SMase (24.Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Krönke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). TNF-induced activation of N-SMase was completely abolished in mice lacking a functional FAN protein because of targeted disruption of the FAN gene, confirming the essentiality of FAN for N-SMase activation (25.Kreder D. Krut O. Adam-Klages S. Wiegmann K. Scherer G. Plitz T. Jensen J.-M. Proksch E. Steinmann J. Pfeffer K. Krönke M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Whether FAN directly interacts with N-SMase or acts through yet to be described intermediates remains to be resolved. Further delination of the activation requirements of N-SMase and its functional role in cellular signaling clearly requires its definitive biochemical characterization and the molecular cloning of N-SMase cDNA. Stoffel and co-workers (26.Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) described the cloning of a putative N-SMase cDNA that was based on homologies to phosphodiesterases. However, overexpression of this candidate N-SMase cDNA did not significantly increase intracellular ceramide levels. Furthermore, the gene product did not respond to TNF (27.Liu B. Hassler F.D. Smith K.G. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that the TNF-responsive N-SMase remains to be identified. Hannun and co-workers (27.Liu B. Hassler F.D. Smith K.G. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) recently reported the partial purification of a Mg2+-dependent N-SMase from rat brain. Thorough functional characterization revealed that this type of N-SMase most likely represents the membrane-bound form of a stimulus-responsive N-SMase, which seemed to be clearly distinct from the gene product of the putative N-SMase cDNA (27.Liu B. Hassler F.D. Smith K.G. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study we describe the purification to homogeneity of a Mg2+-dependent N-SMase from bovine brain. Biochemical and functional characteristics of this highly purified isoform of N-SMase will be provided. Bovine brain tissue was obtained from a local slaughterhouse and was homogenized immediately. Methyl-Macroprep medium and low molecular weight protein standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Nonidet P-40, hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose, Con A-Sepharose, bovine brain l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, and other lipids were obtained from Sigma.N-[methyl- 14C]sphingomyelin from bovine brain, carboxymethyl fast flow-Sepharose, and rainbow colored protein standards were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fresh tissue was homogenized in 6 volumes of homogenizing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A) with a motor-driven Teflon pestle glass homogenizer. The suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min to remove debris. The supernatant (postnuclear supernatant) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was then resuspended by homogenization in 2 volumes of N-SMase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm magnesium chloride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA) followed by solubilization with Nonidet P-40 (1% final concentration) and kept for 2 h at 4 °C with constant shaking. After centrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 ×g the samples were subjected to column chromatography. All steps were carried out at 4 °C with buffers containing NaN3 (0.02% w/v) to prevent bacterial growth. Unless stated otherwise, the flow rate of the column chromatography steps was maintained at 30 ml/h. A CM-Sepharose column was equilibrated with buffer A consisting of N-SMase buffer and an inhibitor mixture (1 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A). The Nonidet P-40 extract containing the membrane proteins was diluted with buffer A to obtain a final concentration of 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and loaded onto the CM-Sepharose column, which was eluted by a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–100% buffer A containing 1 m KCl. The flow-through fraction of the CM-Sepharose column was loaded onto a Con A-Sepharose column, which had been equilibrated with buffer A containing additionally 200 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm magnesium chloride, and 2 mm calcium chloride. EDTA and EGTA were omitted in this buffer (Con A buffer). Bound glycoproteins (e.g.A-SMase) were eluted using a linear gradient of α-methylglucopyranoside (from 0 to 15%) in con A buffer. This step was used to remove A-SMase activity, and the N-SMase activity was found in the flow-through. The flow-through fraction of the Con A-Sepharose column was loaded onto a methyl-Macroprep column, which had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 200 mm sodium chloride and 10% saturated ammonium sulfate (buffer C). Bound material was eluted from the column using a linear gradient of Nonidet P-40 (from 0 to 2%) in buffer C without ammonium sulfate and sodium chloride. Preparative isoelectric focusing was performed on an Octopus “free flow electrophoresis” (Weber GmbH, München FRG) apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions. The electrolyte solution including 0.1m NaOH and 0.1 m phosphoric acid in 20% (v/v) glycerol and 0.2% (v/v) hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose were used. The ampholyte solution contained Ampholine 3–10 (Serva, Heidelberg-FRG) and Ampholine 4–7 (Serva Heidelberg-FRG) (0.5% v/v), 0.2% hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose, 20% glycerol (v/v), and 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. A suspension of 0.2% hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose in 20% glycerol (v/v) was used as counterflow to avoid electroendoosmosis. The ampholyte solution was prefocused by setting the current to 3000 V, 12 watt, and 15 mA prior to the application of the N-SMase preparation. Samples were collected into 96-well plates with a fraction size of 1.3 ml. After determining the pH of every second fraction, 30 μl of 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.4) was added to each fraction. Fractions were stored at −20 °C until analysis for N-SMase activity and SDS-PAGE. A polyclonal antibody was raised against a p97-derived peptide (GLPYLEQLFR) in rabbits. The antibody was purified using a 5-ml HiTrap N-hydroxy succinimide activated peptide affinity chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The activities of both N-SMase and A-SMase were determined using radiolabeled substrate in a mixed micelle assay system as described by Wiegmann et al. (9.Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). For N-SMase, the reaction mixture contained 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 nmol of [14C]sphingomyelin (80,000 cpm), 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (1.54 mm), 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm magnesium chloride and various dilutions of the enzyme preparation in a total volume of 50 μl. A-SMase activity was measured in a 50-μl reaction mixture consisting of enzyme preparations in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 2 nmol of [14C]sphingomyelin (80,000 cpm), 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. To examine the effects of other lipids, the substrate was mixed with these lipids before drying under nitrogen. Mixed micelle solutions were prepared by sonicating the tube for 5 min in a bath sonicator and vortexed for 5 min at room temperature. The mixture was incubated for 120 min at 37 °C, and the enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of 250 μl of water and 800 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v). After vortexing and phase separation by centrifugation, 0.2 ml of the upper aqueous phase was removed and added to 2 ml of scintillation solution for radioactivity counting. The reaction was linear with incubation times up to 6 h. The amount of enzyme added to the reaction mixtures was chosen such that no more than 10% of the substrate would be degraded. Appropriate blanks containing denatured enzyme (30 min, 95 °C) were run with each reaction and subtracted from the experimental samples. Possible inhibitors of the N-SMase were tested by adding them to the assay in aqueous solution. Alternatively, hydrophobic compounds were aliquoted into each assay tube in the appropriate solvent and dried under nitrogen along with the substrate. Micelle-solubilized compounds were tested routinely at concentrations below 500 μm, to maintain the integrity of the micelle. To examine the effects of metal ions on the activity of the purified N-SMase, aliquots of the purified N-SMase were additionally incubated in N-SMase standard buffer with chelators (EDTA or EGTA) in the absence of magnesium. All IC50 determinations are representative for at least three experiments where each value represents the average of three independent samples. One-dimensional denaturing SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Schägger and Jagow (28.Schägger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 106: 368-379Crossref Scopus (10407) Google Scholar) in a Bio-Rad Protean-II electrophoresis system. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed according to O'Farrell (29.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the IPG-Phor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) system according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Isoelectric focusing was performed as described by Görg et al. (30.Görg A. Postel W. Günther S. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) using 8m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, and 0.05% bromphenol blue. Focusing of the N-SMase was carried out in the buffer containing 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, and 0.05% bromphenol blue with increasing voltage (1 h, 100 V; 1 h, 200 V; 1 h, 500 V; 1 h, 1000 V; 1 h, 2000 V; and 3 h, 8000 V). Rod gels were soaked for 15 min at ambient temperature in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 10 mg/ml DTT). A second equilibration was performed for further 15 min in equilibration buffer containing 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide instead of DTT, and applied to a second dimension using a 10% Tris-Tricine SDS gel (16 cm × 16 cm × 1.0 mm). The gels were stained for 1 h in 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 with 45% ethanol in water containing 15% acetic acid. Alternatively, silver staining was performed according to the method described by Mann and co-workers (31.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (7734) Google Scholar). In gel digestion with trypsin was performed according to standard protocols (31.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (7734) Google Scholar, 32.Jenö P. Mini T. Moes S. Hintermann E. Horst M Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Coomassie Blue-stained protein spots were excised from the gel and washed three times for 10 min with water. In situ reduction was achieved in a total volume of 50 μl containing 25 mm DTT, 4 mm guanidinium hydrochloride, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, for 1 h at 37 °C. After cooling to room temperature, SH groups were alkylated by adding iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 50 mmfollowed by a 30-min incubation in the dark. Excess of iodoacetamide was neutralized by adding 5 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. The gel pieces were then washed (2 × 40 μl) for 10 min with water, equilibrated (2 × 40 μl) with 50 mmNH4HCO3 (pH 7.8), (1 × 40 μl) with 50 mm NH4HCO3/acetonitrile (1:1 v/v), and shrunk by dehydration with acetonitrile. The gel pieces were reswollen in a digestion buffer containing 50 mmNH4HCO3, 5% acetonitrile and treated with 0.2 μg of trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptides were extracted by subsequent incubation for 15 min at room temperature with 50 mm NH4HCO3, two changes of trifluoroacetic acid (70%), and two changes of trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (1:1 v/v). The supernatant and extracts were combined and dried down. The pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and immediately analyzed by micro reverse phase-HPLC on a 180-μm capillar column. Prior to μHPLC analysis, aliquots of 0.5 μl of the combined extract were used for MALDI mass spectrometry to obtain MS fingerprints. All mass spectra were obtained with Bruker REFLEX III mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). Control of all data acquisition parameters and the transfer and the subsequent averaging of the time-of-flight data, as well as all further data processing, were carried out using the XMASS 4.02 postanalysis software. MALDI-MS spectra were calibrated using several peaks as external standards. Obtained spectra were analyzed using the sequest algorithm against public data base. The purification procedure of N-SMase from bovine brain is summarized in Table I. Protease inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors, and reducing agents were used throughout the extraction and purification procedure to preserve and stabilize the N-SMase activity. Nonidet P-40 membrane protein extracts were applied to a carboxymethyl-Sepharose fast flow column. The flow-through from the CM-Sepharose column containing the major part of N-SMase activity was loaded to Con A-Sepharose, which served to effectively remove the acid SMase. The flow-through from the Con-A column was loaded to the hydrophobic interaction chromatography column using the methyl-Macroprep material (Bio-Rad) in the presence of 10% of saturated ammonium sulfate. The enzyme bound to the hydrophobic column and the majority (80%) of the N-SMase activity were eluted between 0.4 and 0.7% Nonidet P-40. Preparative isoelectric focusing by free flow electrophoresis eventually resulted in a ∼23,300-fold purification of the N-SMase from bovine brain. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed two major protein species with molecular masses of ∼97 and ∼46 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1). In some preparations also minor protein spots corresponding to molecular masses of 14, 17, and 28 kDa, respectively, were also occasionally observed. Peptide MS fingerprint analysis and Edman microsequencing of these bands revealed their relatedness to the 97-kDa as well to the 46-kDa protein (data not shown), indicating that these protein species are either degradation products or subunits of the mature N-SMase.Table IPurification of neutral sphingomyelinase from bovine brainPurification stepVolumeTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurification factormlmgnmol/hnmol/h/mg%-foldWhole homogenate1,00088,62551,7000.61001Postnuclear homogenate27025,77048,4811.9943.6NP-40 extract2005,68532,0675.6629.3CM-Sepharose fast flow25092529,50031.95753.2Concanavalin A-Sepharose34054431,68058.261.397Methyl-Macroprep505aThe protein amount was determined by SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as standard.1,8553713.6618Preparative isoelectric focusing300.03aThe protein amount was determined by SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as standard.42014,0000.823,330a The protein amount was determined by SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as standard. Open table in a new tab Polyclonal antibodies were raised against a synthetic 10-amino acid peptide based on the amino acid sequence of a p97-derived peptide. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Western blot analysis of the purified enzyme revealed a 97-kDa protein species. To avoid proteolytic degradation processes in bovine brain cadaver we analyzed N-SMase in living cells. Within brain tissue the cell type expressing high N-SMase activity has not yet been determined. However, because N-SMase activity is ubiquitously expressed we have chosen bovine aortic endothelial cells (obtained from ATCC, Rockville). When extracts from bovine aortic cells were analyzed, a major 97-kDa protein was stained under nonreducing as well as under reducing conditions (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the 97-kDa band is not composed of subunits. The reactivity of the antibody with a 97-kDa protein was efficiently competed by the peptide used for immunization (Fig.2 B), indicating nonspecific staining of proteins of lower apparent molecular mass. Because the polyclonal antibody does not specifically recognize a 46-kDa protein found in the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1), these findings strongly suggest that the 46-kDa protein species represents a breakdown product rather than a subunit of the 97-kDa protein. The methyl-Macroprep eluate as well as the isoelectric focusing purified N-SMase were used for further functional characterization. Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis revealed an apparent K m of ∼40 μm (Fig.3). The reaction was linear for up to 6 h. The purified enzyme displayed a pH optimum of 7.0–8.0 with half-maximal activity at pH 6.5. No activity was detected at acidic pH (4.Hostetler K.Y. Yazaki P.J. J.

The target protein involved appeared to be Ras, because transient transfections with dominant negative RasN17 inhibited p38 MAPK activation by IL-1. Furthermore, transfections of cells with constitutively active RasVHa-activated p38 MAPK. Further evidence for Ras involvement came from the observation that IL-1 caused a rapid activation of Ras in the cells and from the inhibitory effects of the Ras inhibitors manumycin A and damnacanthal. Toxin B fromClostridium difficile, which inactivates Rac, Cdc42, and Rho, was without effect. Dominant negative versions of Rac (RacN17) or Rap (Rap1AN17) did not inhibit the response. Intriguingly, transfection of cells with dominant negative Rap1AN17 activated p38 MAPK. Furthermore, constitutively active Rap1AV12 inhibited p38 MAPK activation by IL-1, consistent with Rap antagonizing Ras function. IL-1 also activated Rap in the cells, but with slower kinetics than Ras. Our studies therefore provide clear evidence using multiple approaches for Ras as a signaling component in the activation of p38 MAPK by IL-1, with Rap having an inhibitory effect.

The signaling pathways by which IL-1 mediates its effects have been the focus of much attention. IL-1 activates four protein kinase cascades in cells. The best characterized of these culminates in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (reviewed in Ref. 1.O'Neill L.A.J. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The other three are mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades involving the stress-activated kinases p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the classical MAPK cascade involving p42/p44 MAPK (2.Zhang S.

Early events involved in the activation of these pathways have been uncovered (reviewed in Ref. 1.O'Neill L.A.J. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). IL-1 elicits its effects by binding to its Type I IL-1 receptor, which in a complex with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein recruits the adapter protein MyD88. This in turn recruits IL-1 receptor-associated kinases 1 and 2. From there, the best characterized pathway—the one that leads to NF-κB—involves the adapter TRAF-6, two additional kinases (TAK-1 and TAB-1 (5.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar)), NF-κB-inducing kinase, and the IκB kinase complex. For the MAPK cascades, details are less clear. IL-1 has been shown to activate Raf-1 (6.Huwiler A. Brunner J. Hummel R. Vervoordeldonk M. Stabel S. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which would lead to p42/p44 MAPK activation. The upstream kinases responsible for the activation of JNK by IL-1 are MKK7 (8.Finch A. Holland P. Cooper J. Saklatvala J. Kracht M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and MKK4 (9.Guan Z. Buckman S.Y. Miller B.W. Springer L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol.

A role for low molecular weight G proteins has also been explored, particularly in the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK. Both Rac and Cdc42 have been implicated, through the use of dominant negative mutants, in both pathways (14.Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

In this study, we have sought to investigate further the role of small G proteins in the activation of p38 MAPK by IL-1. We have used three distinct approaches: (i) treatment of cells with Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (LT) and Clostridium difficiletoxin B (ToxB) (virulence factors that specifically glucosylate and inhibit the small G proteins Ras, Rac, and Rap, or Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, respectively (17.Popoff M.R.

The murine thymoma cell line EL4.NOB-1 was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Wiltshire, United Kingdom) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Chinese hamster Don diploid lung fibroblasts and the LT-resistant mutant cell line (Don CdtR-Q) derived from these cells (27.Florin I. Microb. Pathog. 1991; 11: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were cultured in minimal essential medium with Earle's salt supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For use in Western blotting, 8 × 106 EL4.NOB-1 or 2 × 106 Don fibroblast cells in 4 ml of complete medium were incubated with medium alone or with the indicated doses of inhibitors for 1–4 h. Following this, the cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-1α for 10 min. For use in transfection assays, transfected EL4.NOB-1 cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells per ml and pretreated as indicated in the figure legends to Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8.Figure 4Effect of SB203580 and LT on IL-1-induced phosphorylation of CHOP by p38 MAPK in EL4.NOB-1 cells. A, 1.4 × 107 EL4.NOB-1 cells were transfected with the components of the GAL4-CHOP(1–101)system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transfected cells (5 × 105 per sample) were pretreated with SB203580 for 1 h or LT for 4 h at the indicated doses (1 μm and 500 ng/ml, respectively), following which cells were stimulated with IL-1α for a further 4 h (filled bars) or left unstimulated (open bars). B,cells co-transfected with the components of the GAL4-CHOP(1–101) system and constitutively active MEK3 were pretreated with LT (500 ng/ml; 4 h) and stimulated with IL-1α for 4 h (filled bars) or left unstimulated (open bars). In all cases (A and B), cells were subsequently lysed, the luciferase activity of each sample was measured, and readings were corrected for protein measured according to the method of Bradford (30.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (215990) Google Scholar).

Briefly, whole cell lysates were generated using a buffer consisting of 62.5 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue. Equal amounts of lysates were subjected to 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.2 m glycine, 20% methanol). Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/0.1% Tween (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20). The membranes were blocked at room temperature for 2–3 h in 5% fat-free dry milk in TBS/0.1% Tween. The anti-IκB primary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:200 in 1% fat free dry milk in TBS/0.1% Tween. The antibodies recognizing dually phosphorylated (Thr-180/Tyr-182) p38 MAPK, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-CPP32, or anti-Rap1A were each used at a dilution of 1:1000 in 1% fat free dry milk in TBS/0.1% Tween. The pan-Ras antibody was used at a dilution of 1:20 in 1% fat-free dry milk in TBS/0.1% Tween. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit or a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse antibody, each used at a dilution of 1:2000 in 5% fat-free dry milk in TBS/0.1% Tween. The secondary antibody was subsequently detected using a kit for enhanced chemiluminescense substrate development (New England BioLabs Ltd). In order to assess the degree of glucosylation by LT in intact cells, 1 × 107 cells (in 4 ml of RPMI 1640 medium/10% fetal calf serum) were incubated with medium alone or with LT at 500 ng/ml for various times or at the doses indicated in figure legends for 4 h. After washing the cells in phosphate-buffered saline, cell extracts were prepared as described previously (18.Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. de Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing in 50 μl of 50 mm triethanolamine, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The extent to which glucosylation had occurred in intact cells was then measured by incubating 20 μl of the cell extracts, normalized for protein (as determined by the method of Bradford), with 2 μg/ml LT or ToxB together with 20 μl of dried14C-labeled UDP-glucose (300 mCi/mmol). After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, 5 μl of sample buffer was added, and the cell extracts were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.2 m glycine, 20% methanol). In order to enhance the signal from the incorporated14C-labeled UDP-glucose, the membranes were dipped in 20% 2,5-diphenyloxazole in toluene (w/v), dried, and exposed to radiographic film to detect the radiolabeled proteins. The degree of glucosylation in intact cells will be inversely proportional to the intensity of the bands obtained because there will be less target for LT to glucosylate in vitro if glucosylation has occurred in intact cells. Cells (1.4 × 107) were harvested (in exponential growth phase) and resuspended in a final volume of 1.2 ml of Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm NaH2PO4) containing 10–20 μg of DNA (5 μg of pFA-CHOP, 5 μg of pFR-Luc, and 2.5–10 μg of G protein mutant expression vector), 250 μg/ml DEAE-dextran, and 40 μg/ml chloroquine as described previously (29.Moynagh P.N. Williams D.C. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Following incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice in complete RPMI 1640 medium and resuspended in 40 ml of RPMI/20% (v/v) fetal calf serum medium. After a recovery period of 16–24 h, the cells were harvested, seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml, and, when required for the experiment, incubated with medium alone or the indicated inhibitor for 1–4 h. Following this, the cells were washed and stimulated with IL-1α (10 ng/ml) for 4–6 h. Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates, prepared using Passive lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) diluted 1:5, and samples were normalized for protein, determined by the method of Bradford (30.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (215990) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity of cell extracts were determined using standard procedures. In order to normalize for transfection efficiency, we co-transfected cells with a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase. In all samples tested, the levels of β-galactosidase expressed was negligible, and as a consequence, no normalization was performed. Cells were batch-transfected and aliquoted, and all results obtained were highly consistent with little between-experiment variation. Furthermore, all effects (including those that were inhibiting) were expressed relative to control values, with little effect being evident on the reporter system in control cells. Ras and Rap1A activation assays using Raf-1-RBD and RalGDS-RBD, respectively, have been described elsewhere (25.de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 26.Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 31.Herrmann C.

In brief, pGEX-KG-Raf-RBD-GST and pGEX-4T3-Ral-GDS-GST were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the bacteria were sonicated for 5 min (pulses of 5 s) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 μm aprotinin. The GST fusion proteins were isolated from glutathione-Sepharose beads with 10 mm reduced glutathione (pH 8) in 50 mmTris-HCl. 2 × 106 EL4.NOB-1 cells were incubated with IL-1α (10 ng/ml) as indicated in the figure legends. Whole cell extracts were prepared using a lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm iodacetamide, 75 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa2VO3), and equal amounts of protein per sample, as determined by the method of Bradford (30.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (215990) Google Scholar), were incubated with 10 μl of a 50% solution (v/v) containing GST-RalGDS-RBD or GST-RafRBD precoupled to glutathione-agarose beads (coupled by incubating 10 mg of fusion protein per ml of 50% slurry glutathione-agarose beads, for 2 h at 4 °C). The beads were subsequently washed in lysis buffer, and coupled protein was released by heating the samples to 95 °C while they were resuspended in sample buffer. The samples were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) and detected by immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-pan-Ras antibody or polyclonal anti-Rap1 antibody as described above.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We first tested the effect of LT on p38 MAPK activation in EL4.NOB-1 cells. The Western blotting assay used here detects the dually phosphorylated form (and hence the active form) of p38 MAPK (3.Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). Pretreating the cells with 500 ng/ml of LT blocked the ability of IL-1 to activate p38 MAPK (Fig.1 A, top panel). An optimal effect was observed with a pretreatment time of 4 h (Fig.1 A, compare lanes 8 and 2). LT glucosylates at least two proteins of approximately 19 and 23 kDa in EL4.NOB-1, which are in the correct molecular mass range for low molecular weight G proteins (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel, comparelanes 2 and 1). Similar to the inhibition of p38 MAPK activation, a 4-h pretreatment time was required to cause optimal glucosylation of these target proteins. This was determined by first treating the cells with LT for increasing times up to 4 h, following which cell extracts were treated with LT in the presence of14C-labeled UDP-glucose. The degree of glucosylation in the extracts will be inversely proportional to that in intact cells, thereby giving a measure of the degree of glucosylation in intact cells. As can be seen in Fig. 1 A, bottom panel (lane 5), a 4-h treatment of the cells was sufficient to cause significant glucosylation of target proteins, particularly the 23-kDa form, which was fully glucosylated by the toxin. This therefore correlated with the degree of inhibition of p38 MAPK activation shown in Fig. 1 A, top panel. The effect of LT on p38 MAPK was also dose-dependent, as shown in Fig. 1 B. 500 ng/ml of LT was required for optimal inhibition (top panel, lane 8). This again correlated with the degree of glucosylation, because 500 ng/ml LT at 4 h of incubation resulted in optimal glucosylation of protein substrates (bottom panel, lane 4). These results suggest that one or more of the target proteins for LT play a crucial role in the activation of p38 MAPK by IL-1. It should be noted that the degree of inhibition differed between experiments, varying from total inhibition (as shown in Fig.1 A) to incomplete inhibition (as shown in Fig.1 B). Inhibition was always observed, however, and in general, it correlated with the degree of glucosylation of target substrates by the toxin. Although the inhibitory effect of LT on p38 MAPK activation by IL-1 correlated with the degree of glucosylation by the toxin, we wished to provide further evidence that the effect of LT was dependent on glucosylation. This involved testing the effect of the toxin on CdtR-Q, a mutant cell line (27.Florin I. Microb. Pathog. 1991; 11: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that, due to a single point mutation in the UDP-glucose phosphorylase gene, has an intracellular UDP-glucose level of just 26% of that of the parental strain (32.Flores-Diaz M. Alape-Giron A. Persson B. Pollesello P. Moos M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Florin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23784-23791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because of this deficiency of the cofactor for glucosyl transferase toxins, the mutant cells are resistant to LT and ToxB (33.Chaves-Olarte E. Florin I. Boquet P. Popoff M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6925-6932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Treatment of the parental line Don wild type with LT dose-dependently inhibited p38 MAPK activation by IL-1 (Fig. 2 A, top panel), with 500 ng/ml causing an optimal inhibition (compare lanes 8 and2). This indicated that the effect of LT was also evident in primary fibroblasts. Importantly, similar treatment did not inhibit the response in Don CdtR-Q, however (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel), with doses of LT up to 500 ng/ml having no effect. We next confirmed that that the differential effects on the Don wild type and the CdtR-Q by LT were not due to a difference in intracellular levels of the target proteins. As shown in Fig. 2 B, top panel, treatment of intact Don cells leads to the glucosylation of a protein of 19 kDa, as is evident by the lack of substrate for LT during subsequent in vitro treatments with14C-labeled UDP-glucose (Fig. 2 B, top panel,compare lanes 2 and 5). On the other hand, although the substrates for LT are present in ample amounts in CdtR-Q, as assessed using 14C-labeled UDP-glucose supplied in vitro (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel, lane 2), the toxin is unable to glucosylate these proteins in intact cells (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel, lanes 3–5), because of the lack of UDP-glucose. These results therefore strongly indicate that the inhibitory effect of LT on p38 MAPK activation by IL-1 is dependent on glucosylation of target proteins. This has also been shown in the case of p42/p44 MAPK activation by epidermal growth factor in fibroblasts (18.Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. de Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We next tested the specificity of the effect of LT by examining its effect on another IL-1 response in the cells, IκBα degradation, which, similarly to the p38 MAPK pathway, involves phosphorylation (22.Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, increasing amounts of LT (up to 500 ng/ml for 4 h (lanes 5 and 6)) did not block IL-1-induced IκBα degradation. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3 B, LT did not induce processing of pro-caspase 3 (CPP32), which was used as a marker for apoptosis (34.Polverino A.J. Patterson S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7013-7021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), verifying that at the concentrations used here, LT has no apoptotic effect on these cells. LT also did not induce an apoptotic or necrotic morphology in the cells under any of the conditions used in this study (not shown). These results indicate that the inhibitory effect on p38 MAPK was not due to nonspecific toxic effects. Our data with LT indicated that Ras, Rac, or Rap would appear to be critical for p38 MAPK activation by IL-1. We therefore focused on these three small G proteins using an assay that would allow the use of transient transfections with mutant constructs of each of these G proteins. The technique is based on atrans-acting one-hybrid system involving phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK-specific substrate CHOP (35.Wang X. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). IL-1 activated the CHOP-Gal4 reporter system in EL4.NOB-1, which was indicative of p38 MAPK activation, the effect being apparent from 1.5 h and peaking at 6 h (not shown). Activation of this response by IL-1 varied from 2-fold to 8-fold over control levels, depending on the passage number of the cells. Later passage cells (p > 25) were generally less responsive (not shown). Fig. 4 A shows that the response requires p38 MAPK because treating the cells with the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 at 1 μm inhibited the effect of IL-1, verifying that the assay is specific for p38 MAPK (36.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar).

Local regulation of AAT may be important in maintaining the protease-antiprotease balance and preventing tissue damage induced by proteases in the microenvironment of injury or inflammation. For instance, several studies have demonstrated that local release of bacterial endotoxin and/or early production of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in lung tissue may up-regulate AAT expression in monocytes and, thereby, serve an important regulatory role in preventing protease destruction in the lung microenvironment (9.Knoell D.L.

Chem. 1988; 263: 16499-16503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enhanced plasma levels of AAT are also known to be correlated with severity of inflammatory processes associated with coronary atherosclerosis and have been suggested to play an important part in protecting endothelial cells against the degradative effects of proteases released from activated phagocytes (11.Mori T. Sasaki J. Kawaguchi H. Handa K. Takada Y. Matsunaga A. Kono S. Arakawa K. Am. Heart J. 1995; 129: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12.Smith E.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1977; 86: 665-674PubMed Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that inflammatory exudates contain AAT in diverse molecular forms including native inhibitory form and several inactive, noninhibitory forms such as complexed with protease, cleaved, polymerized, and oxidized (13.Wawrzos I. Kitagawa Y. Koloczek H. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1996; 43: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 14.Zhu X.J. Chan S.K. Biochem.

AAT is known to be inactivated by cleavage and complex formation with target protease, such as leukocyte elastase, by cleavage by certain nontarget matrix metalloproteases, by oxidation of the reactive site methionine, and by polymerization induced by various factors such as oxidation, low pH, and interactions with other molecules (1.Travis J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Our understanding of AAT function has been derived primarily from studies of native, functionally active AAT, whereas possible biological roles of oxidized, polymerized, and post-cleavage, noninhibitory forms of AAT have not been thoroughly investigated. Inactivation of AAT with subsequent enhanced proteolysis, particularly by neutrophil elastase, has been invoked in the pathogenesis of lung disease, such as emphysema and lung matrix degradation in adult respiratory distress syndrome as well as in rheumatoid arthritis (19.Koyama H. Geddes D.M. Torax. 1998; 53 Suppl. 2: 510-514Google Scholar, 20.Abbink J.J. Kamp A.M. Nuijens J.H. Swaak T.J.G. Hack C.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that fragmented and complexed AAT promotes an increase in synthesis of AAT in human monocytes and mediates neutrophil chemotaxis (21.Zay K. Loo S. Xie C. Devine D.V. Wright J. Churg A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L269-L279PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Michaelis J. Vissers M.C. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which suggests that proteolytically inactivated AAT may play multiple roles at sites of inflammation. In our previous work, we examined the effects of the proteolytically modified, cleaved form of AAT on HepG2 cells and also the effects of the amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment (C-36, corresponding to amino acid sequence 358–396) of AAT on human monocyte culture. We showed that these forms of AAT induce significant changes in lipid catabolism in both cell types and a remarkable stimulation in pro-inflammatory cytokine and free radical production and also up-regulate scavenger receptor CD36 in primary human monocyte cultures (23.Janciauskiene S. Al Rayyes O. Floren C-H. Eriksson S. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1997; 57: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24.Janciauskiene S. Lindgren S. Wright T.H. Eur. J.

Wright H.T. Lindgren S. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 147: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This led us to propose that under inflammatory conditions, AAT might play not only a role as an inhibitor of proteases but also as a protease substrate and a reservoir of physiologically active degradation products. Oxidized AAT is a modified form of AAT found in inflammatory exudates at levels of about 5–10% that of total AAT (27.Sepper R. Konttinen Y.T. Ingman T. Sorsa T. J. Clin. Immunol. 1995; 15: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28.Zhang Z. Farrell A.J. Blake D.R. Chidwick K. Winyard P.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The amino acid at position P1 in the reactive site of each inhibitory serpin primarily determines the specificity of inhibition and, thereby, its biological activity. P1 in AAT is methionine, the most readily oxidized amino acid of proteins, which is converted by oxidation to methionine sulfoxide. Met can be attacked by various oxidants produced in biological systems, such as peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, hypochloride, chloramines, and peroxynitrite (29.Vogt W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 30.Wallaert B. Gressier B. Aerts C. Mizon Ch. Voisin C. Mizon J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Evidence that this occurs in vivocomes from the observation that inactive AAT purified from inflammatory synovial fluid contains methionine sulfoxide residues (31.Chidwick K. Winyard P.G. Zhang Z. Farrell A.J. Blake D.R. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1991; 50: 915-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32.Johnson D. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7142-7144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, oxidative inactivation of the AAT can be induced in vitro by incubating AAT with purified myeloperoxidase or stimulated phagocytes (33.Carp H. Janoff A. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This oxidation results in a change in the functional activity of AAT and probably promotes local inflammatory processes, including uncontrolled degradation of connective tissues. Oxidative inactivation of AAT with subsequent enhanced proteolysis, particularly by neutrophil elastase, has been invoked in the pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema (34.Mohsenin V. J. Appl. Physiol. 1991; 70: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and rheumatoid arthritis (15.Wong P.S. Travis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). That AAT oxidation and proteolysis occur is supported by findings that, on average, 41% of total AAT in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid is inactive (31.Chidwick K. Winyard P.G. Zhang Z. Farrell A.J. Blake D.R. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1991; 50: 915-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently Scottet al. demonstrate that oxidation of AAT promotes AAT- immunoglobulin A complex formation in vitro. IgA-oxidized AAT complexes isolated form synovial fluid of rheumatoid disease patients were suggested to protect the oxidized AAT molecule from proteolytic cleavage by free elastase (35.Scott L.J. Russell G.I. Nixon N.B. Dawes P.T. Mattey D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Leukocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, which secrete large quantities of oxidants at sites of inflammation, were shown to induce oxidative inactivation of AAT in vivo and to result in perturbed protease-antiprotease balance. Although oxidized AAT plays a pro-inflammatory role at sites of inflammation because of its loss of inhibitor activity toward proteases, it cannot be excluded that oxidized AAT may also have other biological activities related to inflammation. In this study, we have examined whether oxidized AAT can stimulate monocyte activation. We show that oxidized AAT induces monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, activates NADPH oxidase, decreases LDL uptake and degradation and intracellular cholesterol synthesis, increases LDL receptor number, and decreases scavenger receptor CD36 expression. Native, purified AAT was a gift from Prof. C.-B. Laurell, Department of Clinical Chemistry, MAS, Malmö, Sweden. Native AAT was oxidized with N-chlorosuccinimide (Sigma) as described (32.Johnson D. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7142-7144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a reaction between AAT and N-chlorosuccinimide in a molar ratio 1:25 in a 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 min, and oxidized AAT was recovered after passing the reaction mixture through a Sephadex G-25 column (2 cm x 15 cm) that had been equilibrated in 50 mmNH4HCO3 or by using a centrifugal microconcentrator Centricon-30 (Amicon) equilibrated in 0.05m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 mNaCl. The quality of oxidized AAT was analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The oxidized AAT was also tested for capacity to form covalent complex with pancreatic elastase (EC 3.4.21.36) (Sigma). Samples of oxidized AAT or native AAT were digested with pancreatic elastase at a 1.2:1 molar ratio for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer, and mixtures were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE without reducing agent and stained with Coomassie Blue. The endotoxin content in the oxAAT preparations used was tested by limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL), Coamatic® Chromo-LAL assay (Chromogenix, AB, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Endotoxin standard concentrations (from 50 to 0.005 enzyme units/ml) and tested samples were placed into a microplate (preincubated at 37 °C), mixed with substrate, and incubated in a reader (ThermoMax, Molecular Devices, Inc) at 37 °C for 1 h. Negative controls (endotoxin-free water) were included in every set of assays. Absorbance measurements at 405 nm were collected with time after the addition of chromo-LAL and analyzed by the software program. Assay sensitivity was 0.005 enzyme units/ml. According to this assay, the endotoxin levels ranged between 0.006 and 0.079 enzyme units/ml in all oxAAT preparations used in our experiments. LDL was isolated by sequential preparative Ultracentrifugation using an OptimaTM XL-80K Ultracentrifuge (Beckman) as described previously (25.Janciauskiene S. Lindgren S. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A narrow density range (1.034–1.054 kg/liter) was used to prepare LDL for the experiments. LDL was labeled with125I by the iodine monochloride method (36.McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Unbound125I was removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by extensive dialysis against 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.03m KI and further dialysis against 0.15 m NaCl containing 1 mm EDTA. The specific activity of LDL ranged between 229 and 433 cpm/ng of LDL protein. The endotoxin content in the lipoprotein preparations used was tested by LAL assay (E-TOXATE, Sigma). LDL samples were diluted 1:10 in endotoxin-free water, heated at 65 °C for 5 min to inactivate the LAL inhibitor found in plasma, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The positive test performed using endotoxin standard dilutions (0.25, 0.125, and 0.06 enzyme units/ml) was formation of a hard gel, which permits complete inversion of the tube. Absence of hard gel formation was found in all our tested LDL samples, which are endotoxin-free, as assessed by this assay. Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coats obtained from pooled plasma of different donors by the Ficoll-Hypaque procedure as described previously (26.Janciauskiene S. Wright H.T. Lindgren S. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 147: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A monocyte isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Glagbach, Germany) was used to obtain a highly pure monocyte population. Cell purity was >90%, as determined on an AC900EO AutoCounter (Swelab Instruments, AB); cell viability was analyzed by 0.4% trypan blue staining. Monocytes were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml into plastic plates or dishes. After removal of nonadhering cells, the remaining adherent monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mm N-acetyl-l-alanyl-l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% (by volume) nonessential amino acid, 2% (by volume) sodium pyruvate, and 20 mm Hepes (Fluka, Chemie AG) without serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2. Experiments were performed within 24 h after plating of monocytes. For experiments, monocytes were incubated alone or with the addition of native or oxAAT (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml) or native LDL (100 μg/ml) separately or together. Monocytes seeded into 12-well plates (Nunclon), 2 × 106 cells/well were incubated in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium without fetal calf serum (see above) without or with various concentrations of native or oxAAT and with 125I-LDL (3.4 μg of LDL protein/mg of cell protein) for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The medium was aspirated for subsequent determinations of LDL degradation, measured as the trichloroacetic acid-soluble noniodine 125I radioactivity in the medium (37.Bierman R.L. Stein O. Stein Y. Circ. Res. 1974; 35: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Cells were washed 3 times with PBS and scraped into 1 ml of 0.5 m NaOH for125I-LDL uptake measurement (the sum of bound and internalized 125I-LDL) and for cell protein determination. The radioactivity was determined in an LKB 1271 automatic gamma counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). The results are expressed as ng of LDL protein taken up or degraded per mg of cell protein. The binding of LDL to monocytes was performed at 4 °C. Cells in serum-free medium were incubated with several concentrations of oxAAT (up to 0.2 mg/ml) alone or in the presence of LDL (100 μg/ml). Binding studies at 4 °C were performed by washing the cells three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS followed by precooling for 20 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of ice-cold RPMI medium containing 0.5% human serum albumin. After the addition of125I-LDL (3.5 mg/liter), the cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, then washed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. New medium containing 10 g/liter dextran sulfate (M r∼ 500 000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added (polymer was added for osmotic balance), and the cells were subjected to a second incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in a rotary shaker at 60 rpm. Dextran sulfate is known to release receptor-bound LDL from the surface of the cell (38.Salter A.M. Saxton J. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Medium containing dextran sulfate-released125I-LDL was then aspirated, and the radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter. Total RNA from monocytes was isolated as outlined by Davis et al. (39.Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Davis L.G. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 129-156Google Scholar). Cold GT buffer (4m guanidine thiocyanate, 3 m sodium acetate, pH 6, and 7% β-mercaptoethanol) was added directly to the cells in culture dishes. Sarkosyl was added to 2%, and the lysate was layered onto a 4-ml 5.7 m CsCl cushion and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 16 h. The pellet was washed with ethanol (95%), suspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated distilled water (dH2O), precipitated in 95% ethanol at pH 5.0, and stored at −20 °C. LDL receptor mRNA was quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction as described previously (25.Janciauskiene S. Lindgren S. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides of 5′primer (5′-CAATGTCTCACCAAGCTCTG-3′) and 3′primer (5′-TCTGTCTCGAGGGGTAGCTG-3′) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The amplification was performed with a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler using the following cycle profile: denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, then primer annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. The initial denaturation step was prolonged to 3 min, and after 32 cycles, the reaction mixture was incubated at 72 °C for 7 min and then cooled to 4 °C. Each polymerase chain reaction product (20 μl) was electrophoresed along with a DNA molecular weight marker (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a 4% agarose-sieving gel (2:3 (wt/wt) NuSieve-agarose and 1:3 (wt/wt) SeaKem LE-agarose (In Vitro AB, Stockholm, Sweden) in TAE (40 mmTris, 20 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) running buffer at 90 V for 3 to 4 h at 4 °C. The gel was scanned in a FluorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm (argon laser). Images were analyzed using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics), and the signal intensity was calculated according to the vendor's instructions. The amount of LDL receptor polymerase chain reaction fragment was normalized to that of the internal standard. Values are expressed as percent of levels of LDL receptor mRNA in control monocytes. Monocytes were grown on coverslips in the presence of oxAAT (up to 0.25 mg/ml) and/or LDL (100 μg/ml) for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% PBS-buffered formaldehyde for 15 min. In the next step, cells were rinsed with water, dipped for a few seconds in 60% isopropanol, stained in the Oil Red O for 10–15 min and rinsed again in 60% isopropanol to remove excess of stain. Cell nuclei were stained for a few seconds in the hematoxylin solution, washed with water, and mounted with commercially available mounting medium (DAKO). Samples were analyzed by microscope (Olympus Bx60) using the PC program Olympus MicroImage. Images were taken by digital camera (Sony, DKC-5000) at magnification 40×. Cellular synthesis of cholesterol was estimated by measuring [14C]acetate incorporation into sterols from cell extracts as described (25.Janciauskiene S. Lindgren S. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 60-mm Petri dishes for 48 h. Native or oxAAT alone, AAT together with LDL, or LDL (100 μg/liter) alone was added together with [14C]acetate (1 μCi/ml media in 1.8 mmsodium acetate) and incubated for 24 h. After the medium was aspirated, cells were washed once with PBS and harvested in 1 ml of cold medium containing 2 mm sodium acetate. Cells were centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5 (cold), and 9 ml of acetone:ethanol (1:1), vortexed, and precipitated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged (1000 rpm, 5 min). Supernatant (5-ml aliquots) was collected, and 100 μl of cholesterol carrier (1 mg/ml cholesterol in acetone) and 2 ml of digitonin (5 mg/ml in 50% ethanol) were added and precipitated overnight. Precipitates were washed twice with acetone:ether (1:1) and once with ether, dissolved in methanol, and counted in a β-counter (Liquid Scintillation System TRI-CARB 300C). Monocytes incubated without and with oxAAT and native LDL separately or together were lysed on ice in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 10 mmol/liter benzamidine for 15 min or were sonicated with repeated freeze-thaw cycles and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The aliquots were collected, and the protein concentration was determined. 50 μg of cell protein was separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were calibrated by high range molecular weight markers (MultiMarkTM, Multi-Colored Standard, Novex, San Diego, CA). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. A monoclonal antibody against CD36 receptor (SMO, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or antibody against human LDL receptor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1:5000) was used for Western blot analysis. The antibody was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000) using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+Plus) Western blotting detection system kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were exposed to high performance autoradiography Hyperfilm™ MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the indicated times. Immunoblots were quantified by scanning densitometry (model Personal Densitometer SI, Molecular Dynamics). The ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Ins.) was used to display images and to quantitate the result. Cell culture supernatants from monocytes treated with oxAAT (up to 0.25 mg/ml) and/or LDL (100 μg/ml) for 24 h were analyzed to determine human IL-1 and IL-6 and TNFα. A quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay (QuantikineTM, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) technique sensitive to pg/ml assay levels was used according to manufacturer's instructions. Monocytes were cultured for various time points alone or with the addition of oxAAT and/or LDL as described above. Culture medium was collected, and MCP-1 expression was assayed by a quantitative sandwich immunoassay technique according to manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems Europe Ltd, Abingdon, UK). The optical density was determined using a microplate reader at 450 nm. The readings at 570 nm were subtracted from the readings at 450 nm for wavelength correction. The duplicate readings for each standard, control, and samples were averaged, and the average zero standard optical density was subtracted. Superoxide produced from the NADPH oxidase was monitored by the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable rate of cytochrome c reduction (40.Li Y. Trush M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Monocytes (2 × 106/ml) were incubated for various time points up to 3 h at 37 °C, with 1.5 mg/ml cytochrome c and oxAAT in 2 ml of air-saturated PBS containing 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% glucose in the presence or absence of 300 units/ml superoxide dismutase. After incubation, the cells were removed by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min, and the reduced cytochrome c in the supernatant was measured at 550 nm. The rate of superoxide production is given by the difference in the rate of cytochrome c reduction in the absence and presence of superoxide dismutase. Cells were incubated with and without added oxidized or native AAT for 20 h. [3H]Thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then added to the cells (0.2 μCi/ml) for a further 4-h incubation at 37 °C. After the medium was aspirated, the cells were washed twice with 0.5m NaCl and incubated for 5 min with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were then washed with water, dissolved in 1 ml 0.5m NaOH, and neutralized with 200 μl of HCl, and radioactivity was determined in a β-counter (Packard 300CD liquid scintillation spectrometer; Packard Instrument Co.). The differences in the means in experimental results were analyzed for their statistical significance with independent sample two-sided t test and/or one-way analysis of variance combined with a multiple comparisons procedure (Scheffé multiple range test) with the overall significance level of α = .05. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows, Version 6.0) was used for the calculations (41.Norusis M.J. SPSS for Windows, Version 6.0. SPSS Inc., Chicago1993Google Scholar). AAT can be rendered inactive toward elastase by at least two known mechanisms: either by oxidation of the reactive center Met-358 or by protease cleavage of peptide bonds close to the reactive center (1.Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar, 31.Chidwick K. Winyard P.G. Zhang Z. Farrell A.J. Blake D.R. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1991; 50: 915-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In our experimental model, purified native AAT was oxidized with N-chlorosuccinimide and characterized for its ability to interact with pancreatic elastase. Samples of native and oxAAT alone or incubated with pancreatic elastase were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE. In Fig.1 a single band with similar molecular mass is seen for both native and oxAAT.

Recent studies with heterozygous MTP knockout mice have suggested that half-normal levels of MTP in the liver reduce apoB secretion. We hypothesized that reduced apoB secretion in the setting of half-normal MTP levels might be caused by a reduced MTP:apoB ratio in the endoplasmic reticulum, which would reduce the number of apoB-MTP interactions. If this hypothesis were true, half-normal levels of MTP might have little impact on lipoprotein secretion in the setting of half-normal levels of apoB synthesis (since the ratio of MTP to apoB would not be abnormally low) and might cause an exaggerated reduction in lipoprotein secretion in the setting of apoB overexpression (since the MTP:apoB ratio would be even lower). To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of heterozygous MTP deficiency on apoB metabolism in the setting of normal levels of apoB synthesis, half-normal levels of apoB synthesis (heterozygousApob deficiency), and increased levels of apoB synthesis (transgenic overexpression of human apoB). Contrary to our expectations, half-normal levels of MTP reduced the plasma apoB100 levels to the same extent (∼25–35%) at each level of apoB synthesis. In addition, apoB secretion from primary hepatocytes was reduced to a comparable extent at each level of apoB synthesis. Thus, these results indicate that the concentration of MTP within the endoplasmic reticulum rather than the MTP:apoB ratio is the critical determinant of lipoprotein secretion. Finally, we found that heterozygosity for an apoB knockout mutation lowered plasma apoB100 levels more than heterozygosity for an MTP knockout allele. Consistent with that result, hepatic triglyceride accumulation was greater in heterozygous apoB knockout mice than in heterozygous MTP knockout mice.

In each of these tissues, MTP plays a key role in the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins (1.Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J.

MTP is located within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is thought to transfer lipids to apoB as that molecule is translated, allowing apoB to assume a proper conformation for forming a spherical lipoprotein with a neutral lipid core (6.Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R. Gregg R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the absence of MTP, triglyceride-rich, apoB-containing lipoproteins cannot be assembled or secreted (3.Borén J. Véniant M.M. Young S.G. J. Clin.

Of note, several lines of evidence have suggested that the assembly of lipoproteins involves a direct interaction between MTP and apoB. First, Wu et al. (8.Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) demonstrated that apoB can be immunoprecipitated from the microsomes of cultured hepatoblastoma cell lines with an antiserum against MTP. Second, the laboratory of Mahmood Hussain has provided biochemical evidence that MTP binds to apoB (9.Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Jamil H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13060-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and that this interaction depends on arginine and lysine residues within apoB (10.Bakillah A. Jamil H. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Third, a pair of recent studies, each using independent experimental approaches, identified specific domains within the amino terminus of apoB that bind to the 97-kDa subunit of MTP (11.Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Nayak N. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25612-25615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12.Bradbury P. Mann C.J. Kšchl S. Anderson T.A.

It has been suggested that apoB-MTP complexes could play an important role in the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins (12.Bradbury P. Mann C.J. Kšchl S. Anderson T.A. Chester S.A. Hancock J.M. Ritchie P.J. Amey J. Harrison G.B. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To define the role of MTP in lipoprotein assembly in vivo, our laboratory recently inactivated the mouse gene for the 97-kDa subunit of MTP (Mttp) (4.Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Véniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Homozygous Mttpknockout mice died early in development, likely because an absence of lipoprotein secretion by the yolk sac interferes with the delivery of lipid nutrients to the developing mouse embryo (4.Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Véniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 14.Kim E. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 703-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heterozygous knockout mice developed normally and manifested a 50% reduction in MTP activity levels in both the liver and intestine. The half-normal MTP levels were accompanied by an ∼25% reduction in plasma apoB100 levels on both chow and high fat diets. The finding that half-normal levels of MTP appeared to reduce plasma apoB100 levels suggested that there is not a great excess of MTP within the ER of hepatocytes (4.Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Véniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A key goal of the current study was to further elucidate that finding. In particular, we wanted to determine whether the effects of half-normal MTP levels in reducing lipoprotein levels would be equally noticeable at different levels of apoB expression. We imagined two possible scenarios by which half-normal levels of MTP might reduce the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. One possibility was that the half-normal levels of MTP would reduce the ratio of MTP to apoB within the lumen of the ER, thereby reducing the number of direct protein-protein interactions between these molecules. If a normal ratio of MTP to apoB were critical for lipoprotein assembly, one might reasonably surmise that half-normal levels of MTP would have little effect on lipoprotein production in the setting of half-normal levels of apoB synthesis, since the MTP:apoB ratio would not be reduced below that in wild-type cells. According to this scenario, half-normal MTP levels might cause an even greater reduction in lipoprotein synthesis in the setting of increased levels of apoB synthesis, since the MTP:apoB ratio would be further reduced. A second possible scenario is that the ratio of MTP to apoB molecules is irrelevant and that the key consideration is simply the absolute concentration of MTP within the ER. If the absolute concentration of MTP were the most important factor, one would surmise that the consequences of half-normal MTP levels would be independent of the apoB synthetic rate. We tended to favor the former scenario; thus, oura priori hypothesis was that the ratio of MTP to apoB would prove to be the critical factor governing lipoprotein production in the setting of half-normal MTP levels. The fact that MTP and apoB bind to each other during lipoprotein assembly prompted us to consider another hypothesis. We hypothesized that overexpression of apoB might lead to more MTP-apoB interactions within the ER and that these more numerous MTP-apoB interactions might stabilize MTP, increasing its half-life within the ER. To the extent that this were the case, MTP levels in liver microsomes might be increased in the setting of high levels of apoB expression and decreased at low levels of apoB expression. A key goal of this project was to address those two hypotheses: that the ratio of MTP to apoB might be the critical factor governing apoB production rates, and that changes in apoB expression might affect the levels of MTP activity within the liver. To address the latter hypothesis, we simply measured hepatic MTP activity levels in liver microsomes at three levels of apoB expression: low (heterozygosity for an Apob knockout mutation) (15.Farese Jr., R.V. Ruland S.L. Flynn L.M. Stokowski R.P. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1774-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), normal (two wild-typeApob alleles), and high (two wild-type alleles plus a “high expressing” human APOB transgene) (16.Nielsen L.B.

To assess the former hypothesis, that the ratio of MTP to apoB within the ER was a critical determinant of apoB production, we examined the phenotype of heterozygous Mttp knockout mice at each of the three distinct levels of apoB synthesis. For these studies, the metabolic effects of a single Mttp knockout allele were assessed with specific mouse apoB100 immunoassays and with metabolic labeling studies in primary mouse hepatocytes. In addition to addressing these two hypotheses, we wanted to quantify and compare the effects of a mutant Apob allele and a mutantMttp allele on hepatic lipoprotein secretion. This topic cannot be addressed convincingly with human investigations but can be addressed definitively in experiments with knockout mice. Heterozygous Apobknockout mice (Apob +/−), heterozygousMttp knockout mice (Mttp +/−), and high expressing hemizygous human APOB transgenic mice (HuBTg+/o) have been previously described (4.Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Véniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 15.Farese Jr., R.V. Ruland S.L.

In high expressing human apoB transgenic mice on a chow diet, we have documented human apoB100 levels of ∼40–50 mg/dl (18.Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin.

Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 703-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HuBTg+/o,Apob +/−, and Mttp +/−mice were intercrossed to produce human apoB transgenic mice that were heterozygous for the Mttp knockout mutation (HuBTg+/o Mttp +/−) and mice that were heterozygous for both the Apob and Mttpmutations (Apob +/− Mttp +/−). We compared groups of mice with a single copy of an Mttpknockout allele with control mice with two normal Mttpalleles. For each of these comparisons, the control mice were invariably littermates. All mice were female and had a mixed genetic background (∼75% C57BL/6 and 25% 129/Sv). The mice were housed in a full-barrier facility and were fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (PicoLab Mouse Chow 20, No. 5058, Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). Blood was sampled for lipid and apolipoprotein measurements when the mice were greater than 2 months old. The mice sacrificed for measurement of liver triglyceride stores were more than 4 months old. Plasma lipid levels were measured on fresh plasma samples (in duplicate) after a 4-h fast. Cholesterol levels were measured with the Abbott Spectrum kit (Abbott Laboratories Diagnostics Division, Abbott Park, IL), and triglyceride levels were determined with the triglyceride/GB kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (19.Linton M.F.

The distribution of cholesterol within the plasma lipoproteins was assessed by size-fractionating 250 μl of plasma (pooled from 7 female mice after a 4-h fast) by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a Superose 6B 10/50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (19.Linton M.F.

Mouse livers were dissected and homogenized, and MTP activity levels were performed according to the procedures described by Wetterau et al. (1.Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C.

For several groups of mice, the amount of the 97-kDa subunit of MTP was assessed on Western blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels using a rabbit antiserum against bovine MTP (provided by Dr. John Wetterau, Bristol-Myer Squibb, Princeton, NJ). Primary mouse hepatocytes were prepared and cultured as described previously (22.Kim E. Cham C.M. Véniant M.M. Ambroziak P. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1468-1477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were allowed to attach for 90 min, and the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 50 μl of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Pro-mix, 530 Mbq/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per ml of medium. After a 3-h incubation, a sample of the medium (40 μl) was size-fractionated on a 4–15% polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel. The gel was dried, and the incorporation of 35S into apoB48 and apoB100 was assessed with a Fuji Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fiji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). For each well of primary hepatocytes, the amount of 35S incorporation into the apoB proteins was normalized to the amount of35S incorporation into characteristic triplet bands (secreted non-apoB proteins) that migrated immediately below the apoB48 band (see Fig. 4 E below). Liver samples from each animal were disrupted with a homogenizer (Ultra-Turbax T8, VWR) for 2 min in 1.0 ml of a 2:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol. The homogenizer probe was rinsed twice with 1.0 ml of the same chloroform/methanol mixture, bringing the total volume of the mixture to 3 ml. Next, 1.0 ml of water and 0.576 mg of tripentadecanoin (an internal standard dissolved in hexane) were added. After vortexing for 2 min, the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 900 ×g. The bottom layer was transferred to a new tube and dried under a stream of nitrogen at 30 °C. Each sample was resuspended in 40 μl of hexane. The plate was sprayed with a fixative (10 mg of 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonic acid trisodium in 50 ml of methanol), and the triglyceride band was visualized with a hand-held UV lamp. The silica containing the triglycerides was scraped off and placed in a new tube and transmethylated with 1.0 ml of 3 n methanolic HCl. The samples were vortexed, incubated at room temperature overnight, and centrifuged for 3 min at 900 × g. The liquid portion was transferred to a glass tube and dried under nitrogen. The samples were then resuspended in 1.0 ml of heptane, and the fatty acid methyl esters were quantified by gas chromatography (23.Jung H.R. Turner S.M. Neese R.A. Young S.G. Hellerstein M.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After normalization of the data to the C-15 internal standard, triglyceride measurements were calculated as μm of triglyceride/g of liver tissue. Mean levels of apoB, plasma lipids, or liver triglyceride stores are reported for each group of mice along with standard deviations or standard errors of the means. Statistical differences were modeled by analysis of variance with genotype being an intergroup factor. We found that hepatic MTP activity levels were 49.7% lower in Mttp +/− mice than in wild-type mice (p < 0.001) (Fig.1 A). Recent studies have suggested that apoB and MTP bind to each other during lipoprotein assembly (8.Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11.Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Nayak N. Shelness G.S. J. Biol.

We hypothesized that overexpression of human apoB might conceivably lead to an increased number of those interactions, potentially stabilizing MTP within the ER and leading to increased amounts of MTP activity in hepatic microsomes. Our data, however, did not support this hypothesis. The hepatic MTP activity levels were no higher in HuBTg+/o mice than in wild-type mice and were 50% lower in HuBTg+/o Mttp +/−mice than in HuBTg+/o mice (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1 A). A single copy of an Apob knockout allele had no significant effect on hepatic MTP activity levels (Fig.1 A). As judged by Western blots, the half-normal MTP activity levels in heterozygous Mttp knockout mice were due to half-normal levels of the 97-kDa subunit of MTP (Fig.1 B). We sought to assess the metabolic effects of half-normal MTP levels at several different levels of apoB synthesis. Initially, we performed RIAs on a series of dilutions of pooled plasma from female mice of each of the six genotypes (wild-type,Mttp +/−, HuBTg+/o, HuBTg+/o Mttp +/−,Apob +/− , andApob +/− Mttp +/−) (Fig.2 A–C). These studies suggested that the Mttp knockout mutation reduced mouse apoB100 levels to a similar extent at each level of apoB synthesis. To further test this idea, we measured plasma apoB100 levels for each mouse in each of the six groups (TableI). Three features of those data are noteworthy. First, the Mttp knockout allele reduced plasma apoB100 levels to a similar extent at each level of apoB synthesis (∼25–35%). The effect of half-normal MTP activity levels on apoB100 levels was neither diminished at reduced levels of apoB synthesis nor exaggerated by increased levels of apoB expression. Second, theApob knockout allele reduced plasma apoB levels far more (>50%) than the Mttp knockout allele (∼25%). Third, human APOB expression increased the plasma levels of mouse apoB100. Increased plasma levels of mouse apoB100 in the setting of human apoB overexpression were not unexpected, as we had encountered the same finding in a recent study of atherogenesis in human apoB transgenic mice (24.Gosling J.

We also assessed the effects of the Mttp knockout mutation on the plasma levels of human apoB100 in HuBTg+/o and HuBTg+/o Mttp +/− mice. As shown in Table I and Fig. 2, B and D, the defectiveMttp allele resulted in very similar reductions in the levels of mouse and human apoB100 (29 and 32%, respectively). Measurements of total plasma cholesterol or triglycerides were poor surrogates for the apoB100 measurements, at least from the perspective of identifying metabolic perturbations resulting from half-normal MTP activity levels. Inactivating one of the two Mttp alleles had no effect on plasma triglyceride levels. The total plasma cholesterol level was significantly lower inMttp +/− mice than in the wild-type mice, but no significant effect on cholesterol levels was noted in the setting of the human apoB transgene or the Apob knockout mutation (Table II). The FPLC studies revealed that a single copy of the Mttp mutation reduced the levels of cholesterol in the intermediate and low density lipoproteins by ∼20% at each level of apoB synthesis (Fig.3). However, on a chow diet, the quantitative significance of this reduction was modest and in some cases was offset by increases in high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.Table IITotal plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in six groups of female miceGenotypenTotal cholesterolTriglyceridesmg/dlmg/dlWild-type1547.2 ± 9.332.1 ± 9.5Mttp +/−1135.0 ± 8.8ap = 0.002 vs. wild-type mice.31.8 ± 7.5HuBTg+/o1055.1 ± 14.146.8 ± 10.0HuBTg+/o Mttp +/−2256.8 ± 11.749.5 ± 10.2Apob +/−1025.8 ± 8.912.2 ± 4.2Apob +/− Mttp +/−827.9 ± 4.513.9 ± 1.9Values are reported as means ± S.D.

To investigate the mechanism for the reduced plasma apoB levels in the setting of half-normal levels of MTP, we performed metabolic labeling experiments on the primary hepatocytes of different groups of mice (Fig. 4). The amount of apoB100 in the medium from Mttp +/− hepatocytes was 27% lower than in wild-type mice (p = 0.026 and 0.037 in two independent experiments) (Fig. 4, A andB). The Mttp mutation lowered apoB100 secretion by 28% in the setting of the human apoB transgene (p = 0.002 and 0.015 in two experiments) and by 21% in the setting of anApob knockout allele (p = 0.016 and 0.014 in two experiments) (Fig. 4, A and B). The effect of the Mttp mutation on apoB48 secretion was modest. ApoB48 secretion from Mttp +/− hepatocytes was 15% lower than from wild-type hepatocytes (p = 0.125 and 0.048 in two experiments) (Fig. 4, C and D). TheMttp mutation lowered apoB48 secretion by 18% (p = 0.036 and 0.049 in two experiments) in the setting of the human apoB transgene and by 15% in the setting of anApob knockout allele (p = 0.027 and 0.034 in two experiments) (Fig. 4, C and D). Fig.4 E shows an autoradiogram of the media from HuBTg+/o and HuBTg+/o Mttp +/− primary hepatocytes; a reduction in apoB100 in the medium from HuBTg+/o Mttp +/− primary hepatocytes was visually apparent. We determined whether the reduced apoB secretion in the setting of the Mttp and Apobmutations would be accompanied by an accumulation of triglycerides within the liver. Pairwise comparisons of littermates revealed a tendency for higher liver triglyceride stores in the setting of theMttp mutation, but none of these differences achieved statistical significance (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the hepatic triglyceride stores were greater in heterozygous Apob knockout mice than in heterozygousMttp knockout mice (Fig. 5). In our initial characterization of Mttp knockout mice (4.Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Véniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we noted that the Mttp +/− mice displayed half-normal MTP activity levels and an ∼25% reduction in plasma apoB100 levels. The latter finding was somewhat surprising, given the prevailing view that heterozygosity for MTP deficiency in humans has no effect on plasma lipid or lipoprotein profiles (25.Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Kane J.P. Havel R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1139-1164Google Scholar). In the current study, we hypothesized that the ratio of MTP to apoB might be a key determinant of lipoprotein secretion. Thus, we suspected that half-normal MTP levels might have little effect on lipoprotein production when apoB synthesis was also reduced by 50% (since the ratio of MTP to apoB within the ER would not be abnormally low) and might have an exaggerated effect in the setting of apoB overexpression (since the ratio of MTP to apoB would be further reduced). We further hypothesized that increased levels of apoB synthesis could affect the stability of the MTP protein and, hence, the amount of MTP activity in liver microsomes. Each of these two hypotheses seemed plausible in view of evidence indicating the existence of a direct MTP-apoB interaction within the ER (8.Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J.

Mann C.J. Kšchl S. Anderson T.A. Chester S.A. Hancock J.M. Ritchie P.J. Amey J. Harrison G.B. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data, however, provided no support for either hypothesis. Hepatic MTP activity levels were completely unaffected by either apoB overexpression (a human APOB transgene) or by apoB underexpression (heterozygosity for an Apob knockout mutation). Also, half-normal levels of MTP reduced apoB100 production rates to a similar extent at each level of apoB synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study to quantify the relative impact of half-normal levels of MTP and apoB on lipoprotein assembly and secretion. Our experiments revealed that both mutations reduced hepatic lipoprotein secretion, but the effect of theApob mutation was much greater. Of course, this conclusion should not be generalized past the specific experimental model that we examined. We examined hepatic secretion in animals fed a chow diet, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the relative importance of these two gene products on intestinal lipoprotein secretion or on hepatic lipoprotein secretion in the setting of a high fat diet. The fact that the effects of half-normal MTP levels were similar at each level of apoB synthesis indicates that the absolute ratio of MTP to apoB is not an important determinant of lipoprotein secretion, at least within the range of apoB synthesis rates that we examined. Instead, it appears that the most important factor is the absolute amount or concentration of MTP within the ER. We emphasize that our experiments did not attempt to study MTP-apoB interactions directly nor do the results of our experiments necessarily cast doubt on the potential importance of these direct interactions during lipoprotein assembly. Our data simply show that half-normal levels of MTP influence lipoprotein secretion similarly at different levels of apoB synthesis. MTP is not the only factor that can affect lipoprotein production. Our findings with the Apob knockout mice reveal that reduced amounts of apoB synthesis can also limit hepatic lipoprotein production. Other investigations have documented that the levels and intracellular availability of lipids can limit cellular lipoprotein secretion (27.Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Thus, lipoprotein assembly and secretion require adequate levels of apoB, MTP, and lipids, and reductions in any one of these can limit the output of lipoproteins from cells. Reductions in two of these factors can result in additive decreases in lipoprotein production, as demonstrated in the current studies by the low plasma apoB100 levels and low apoB100 production rates inApob +/− Mttp +/−mice. In this study, we relied mainly on apoB metabolic labeling studies and monoclonal antibody-based apoB RIAs to investigate the metabolic effects of half-normal MTP activity levels. Both of these strategies revealed reproducible and concordant effects of the Mttpknockout mutation on apoB metabolism. It is interesting that the plasma lipid levels were poor surrogates for the apoB measurements. The total plasma cholesterol levels were quite insensitive to the effects of theMttp knockout mutation, although the FPLC fractionation studies did uncover ∼20% reductions in low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at each level of apoB synthesis. A single copy of the Mttp knockout allele had no detectable effect on plasma triglyceride levels, a somewhat surprising result in light of recent studies that have shown that hepatic MTP plays a crucial role in triglyceride secretion (7.Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 33.Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We do not understand why theMttp mutation failed to reduce the plasma triglyceride levels. It seems possible that the variability in plasma triglyceride levels made it difficult to identify such an effect or perhaps that changes in the activity of triglyceride removal pathways masked any changes in hepatic triglyceride secretion rates. The metabolic labeling studies revealed that half-normal MTP levels reduced apoB100 secretion more than they reduced apoB48 secretion. This result is consistent with recent findings with MTP inhibitor compounds in cultured cells (29.Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34.Nicodeme E. Benoist F. McLeod R. Yao Z. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol.

Björkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). We used Cre/loxP recombination techniques to produce liver-specificMttp knockout mice and documented a >95% reduction in both hepatic MTP activity levels and plasma apoB100 levels (7.Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effects of the liver-specific knockout on plasma apoB48 levels were modest, and primary hepatocytes from those mice secreted substantial amounts of the apoB48 protein. In this study, a defective Apob allele was more potent in reducing plasma apoB levels than a defective Mttp allele. Equally intriguing, however, were the relative effects of theMttp and Apob mutations on hepatic stores of triglycerides. Given the obligatory role of MTP in the entry of triglycerides into the secretory organelles of hepatocytes (7.Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), one might have reasonably hypothesized that half-normal MTP levels would significantly increase liver triglyceride stores. Moreover, it would have been reasonable to hypothesize that the normal MTP activity levels in Apob +/− mice would completely prevent an accumulation of triglycerides in the liver simply by packing each nascent apoB-containing lipoprotein with a double dose of triglycerides. Our current data appear to be inconsistent with both of these hypotheses. Liver triglyceride stores were increased only modestly by the Mttp mutation, and the increase was not statistically significant. In addition, the Apob mutation appeared to have a much greater effect on liver triglyceride stores than the Mttp mutation, just as the Apob mutation had a greater effect in reducing the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. These findings, as far as we are aware, are novel, as there have been no prior studies of the effects of heterozygous apoB or MTP deficiency on hepatic triglyceride stores in either mice or humans. The results of our current experiments, that a 50% reduction in MTP levels reduces plasma lipoprotein levels with only a modest effect on liver triglyceride stores, will likely be heartening to pharmaceutical company investigators who are developing MTP inhibitor drugs to treat human hyperlipidemias. Although the safety profile of these drugs in humans remains to be established, a study of an MTP inhibitor drug in rabbits and hamsters was recently reported (37.Wetterau J.R. Gregg R.E. Harrity T.W. Arbeeny C. Cap M. Connolly F. Chu C.-H. George R.J. Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Jolibois K.G. Kunselman L.K. Lan S.-J. Maccagnan T.J. Ricci B. Yan M. Young D. Chen Y. Fryszman O.M. Logan J.V.H.

Science. 1998; 282: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The MTP inhibitor compound reduced plasma lipoprotein levels while increasing liver triglyceride stores only modestly. Those results appeared to be consistent with our genetic studies. The finding of increased triglyceride stores in theApob +/− mice should also be of interest to the pharmaceutical industry, particularly to investigators who are seeking new therapeutic strategies for treating hyperlipidemias. Our results suggest that pharmaceutical strategies designed to reduce the transcription of the apoB gene or any other strategy to reduce the number of apoB transcripts may not be free of the hepatic steatosis issue. The issue of increased triglyceride stores may be shared by any strategy that reduces the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. We thank S. Ordway and G. Howard for editorial assistance and J.

https://openalex.org/W1998117078,"Hsc66 from Escherichia coli is a constitutively expressed hsp70 class molecular chaperone whose activity is coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis. To better understand the mechanism and regulation of Hsc66, we investigated the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis and the interactions of Hsc66 with nucleotides. Steady-state experiments revealed that Hsc66 has a low affinity for ATP (K mATP = 12.7 μm) compared with other hsp70 chaperones. The kinetics of nucleotide binding were determined by analyzing changes in the Hsc66 absorbance spectrum using stopped-flow methods at 23 °C. ATP binding results in a rapid, biphasic increase of Hsc66 absorbance at 280 nm; this is interpreted as arising from a two-step process in which ATP binding (k aATP = 4.2 × 104m−1s−1, k dATP= 1.1 s−1) is followed by a slow conformational change (k conf = 0.1 s−1). Under single turnover conditions, the ATP-induced transition decays exponentially with a rate (k decay = 0.0013 s−1) similar to that observed in both steady-state and single turnover ATP hydrolysis experiments (k hyd = 0.0014 s−1). ADP binding to Hsc66 results in a monophasic transition in the absence (k aADP = 7 × 105m−1 s−1,k dADP = 60 s−1) and presence of physiological levels of inorganic phosphate (k aADP(Pi)) = 0.28 × 105m−1s−1,k dADP(Pi)= 9.1 s−1). These results indicate that ATP hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step under steady-state conditions and is >103-fold slower than the rate of ADP/ATP exchange. Thus, in contrast to DnaK and eukaryotic forms of hsp70 that have been characterized to date, the R ⇔ T equilibrium balance for Hsc66 is shifted in favor of the low peptide affinity T state, and regulation of the reaction cycle is expected to occur at the ATP hydrolysis step rather than at nucleotide exchange. Hsc66 from Escherichia coli is a constitutively expressed hsp70 class molecular chaperone whose activity is coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis. To better understand the mechanism and regulation of Hsc66, we investigated the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis and the interactions of Hsc66 with nucleotides. Steady-state experiments revealed that Hsc66 has a low affinity for ATP (K mATP = 12.7 μm) compared with other hsp70 chaperones. The kinetics of nucleotide binding were determined by analyzing changes in the Hsc66 absorbance spectrum using stopped-flow methods at 23 °C. ATP binding results in a rapid, biphasic increase of Hsc66 absorbance at 280 nm; this is interpreted as arising from a two-step process in which ATP binding (k aATP = 4.2 × 104m−1s−1, k dATP= 1.1 s−1) is followed by a slow conformational change (k conf = 0.1 s−1). Under single turnover conditions, the ATP-induced transition decays exponentially with a rate (k decay = 0.0013 s−1) similar to that observed in both steady-state and single turnover ATP hydrolysis experiments (k hyd = 0.0014 s−1). ADP binding to Hsc66 results in a monophasic transition in the absence (k aADP = 7 × 105m−1 s−1,k dADP = 60 s−1) and presence of physiological levels of inorganic phosphate (k aADP(Pi)) = 0.28 × 105m−1s−1,k dADP(Pi)= 9.1 s−1). These results indicate that ATP hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step under steady-state conditions and is >103-fold slower than the rate of ADP/ATP exchange. Thus, in contrast to DnaK and eukaryotic forms of hsp70 that have been characterized to date, the R ⇔ T equilibrium balance for Hsc66 is shifted in favor of the low peptide affinity T state, and regulation of the reaction cycle is expected to occur at the ATP hydrolysis step rather than at nucleotide exchange. Hsp70 proteins comprise a ubiquitous family of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones that have been shown to play roles in stress responses, protein processing, and protein folding (for reviews see Refs. 1.Bukau B.

To accomplish their cellular roles, Hsp70 proteins couple nucleotide binding and hydrolysis with conformational changes that control their peptide substrate affinity. ATP binding results in a conformational change leading to the formation of a tense state (T state) with reduced affinity for peptide substrates, and subsequent hydrolysis to ADP and phosphate relieves this tense state and results in formation of a relaxed state (R state) with increased peptide binding affinity (7.Palleros D.P.

DnaK from Escherichia coli has been the prototypical hsp70 family member for elucidating the mechanism of hsp70 chaperone action. Kinetic studies have shown that in the absence of cochaperones and substrates, the rate of interconversion between the R and T states of DnaK is slow on the time course of physiological processes with both ATP hydrolysis and ADP/ATP exchange occurring with rates ≤ 1 min−1 (11.Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12.Russell R. Jordan R. McMacken R.

Both of these kinetic steps in the DnaK ATPase cycle, however, are subject to regulation by cochaperones; the rate of ATP hydrolysis is stimulated up to ∼103-fold by DnaJ (14.Karzai A.W. McMacken R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and the rate of ADP/ATP exchange is stimulated up to ∼103-fold by GrpE (17.Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Many bacteria contain a second constitutively expressed hsp70, in addition to DnaK, encoded by the hscA gene and designated Hsc66 (heat shock cognate,M r ∼66,000; see Refs. 18.Kawula T.H. Lelivelt M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 610-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 19.Seaton B.L. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2066-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although the exact cellular role of Hsc66 has not been determined, localization ofhscA to a gene cluster (iscSUA-hscBA-fdx) encoding proteins thought to be involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters (20.Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) suggests a specialized role in the folding of Fe/S proteins. In vitro studies indicate Hsc66 exhibits chaperone activity as evidenced by its ability to prevent the aggregation of model polypeptide substrates (21.Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Hsc66 exhibits slow, intrinsic steady-state ATPase activity (<1 min−1 at 37 °C and <0.1 min−1 at 20 °C; Ref. 22.Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and ATP causes effects consistent with destabilization of Hsc66·peptide complexes (21.Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results support a model for Hsc66 action similar to that proposed for DnaK in which the rates of peptide binding and release are coupled to ATP hydrolysis and ADP/ATP exchange rates. In contrast to DnaK, however, the ATPase activity of Hsc66 is not affected by physiological levels of DnaJ and GrpE (21.Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, Hsc66 is regulated by a specific, 20-kDa cochaperone encoded by thehscB gene and designated Hsc20 (21.Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby Hsc20 stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsc66, however, is not known, and kinetic characterization of the Hsc66 ATPase reaction cycle will be required to address this question. The finding that Hsc66 does not interact with the nucleotide exchange protein GrpE also raises the question of whether the rates of ADP and ATP exchange with Hsc66 differ significantly from those of DnaK and other GrpE-regulated hsp70 chaperones. To understand better the kinetics of Hsc66 and nucleotide interactions and to provide a framework for future evaluation of regulation of its activity, we have carried out a kinetic characterization of the Hsc66 ATPase reaction cycle. Our results indicate that ATP hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step under steady-state conditions and is slow compared with the rate of ADP/ATP exchange. Thus, in contrast to DnaK, in which there is a balance between the R and T states in the absence of auxiliary factors, the R ⇔ T equilibrium balance for Hsc66 is shifted in favor of the T state. Cochaperone stimulation of Hsc66, therefore, is not likely to be exerted on nucleotide exchange but is instead expected to be on the rate-determining ATP hydrolysis step. Recombinant Hsc66 was expressed and purified as described previously (22.Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The concentration of Hsc66 was measured spectrophotometrically using a calculated molar extinction coefficient of 19,600 (m·cm)−1 determined using average absorptivities for tryptophan and tyrosine of 5,600 and 1,400 (m·cm)−1 (23.Gill S.C. VonHippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar, 24.Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal.

Absorption spectra of purified Hsc66 indicated that no bound nucleotides were present as previously reported (22.Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained HKM buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2), 1 μm Hsc66, 0.1–1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 2–125 μm ATP (Sigma). Each reaction was incubated without ATP at 23 °C for 5 min prior to initiating the hydrolysis reaction. Aliquots of the reaction mixture (10 μl) were removed at various times after ATP addition and quenched by adding 10 μl of acetonitrile (Fisher). The sample was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 30 s, and 3 μl was spotted on polyethylene-cellulose TLC sheets (Supelco). TLC sheets were dried and developed in 1 m formic acid containing 0.5 m LiCl, and the fraction of ADP present was determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The rate of hydrolysis (V o) was determined for each concentration of ATP by linear regression analysis, and the fraction of ATP hydrolyzed was not allowed to exceed 20%. As found for other hsp70 proteins (28.O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 29.Ziegelhoffer T. Lopez-Buesa P.

Biochem. 1996; 237: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), no ATPase activity was observed for Hsc66 in the absence of potassium ions (data not shown), and a physiological concentration of potassium (150 mm; see Ref. 31.Epstein W. Schultz S.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 49: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was included in all assay buffers. K m andV max values were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to a plot of V o versus [ATP]free using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) which makes use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (26.Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in C: the Art of Scientific Computing. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, New York1992: 683-688Google Scholar) to approximate curve fits. The rates for V o shown represent an average of two independent experiments with error bars corresponding to ±1 S.D. Reactions were identical to those described for steady-state ATPase assays, except Hsc66 was present in excess over ATP (150 μm Hsc66 and 1 μm ATP containing 0.1–1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP), and ATP hydrolysis was followed for 90 min at 23 °C. Data were corrected for the background level of [α-32P]ADP (typically ∼2%) and an unknown impurity (typically ∼2%) which migrated farther than ADP on TLC. 1Additional impurities in [α-32P]ATP may account for the finding in single turnover experiments (Fig. 2) that the fraction of ADP produced is <100%. The conversion of ATP to ADP was plotted versus time and fit to a first-order equation using Kaleidagraph. The data shown represent the average of two independent experiments with error bars corresponding to ±1 S.D. ATP synthesis reactions (600 μl) were performed in the presence and absence of 50% H218O and contained 50 mm ATP, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm Hsc66. After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, D2O was added to a final concentration of 20% to maintain a deuterium frequency lock and allow for optimization of the magnetic field homogeneity in 31P NMR experiments. One-dimensional31P NMR spectra were recorded at 161.97 MHz on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) DRX400 spectrometer. Spectra were acquired at 23 °C in Fourier transform mode using a 4-μs pulse (33° flip angle) and a spectral width of 200 Hz. Two thousand repetitive scans were signal averaged, and exponential modulation was applied to the free-induction decay. Chemical shifts are reported with reference to 85% H3PO4. Slow kinetic measurements were performed using a Cary 1 spectrophotometer (Varian). Reaction mixtures containing HKM buffer and 40 μm Hsc66 were incubated at 23 °C for 5 min prior to initiating the reaction by adding 20 μm ATP or 20 μmADP/Pi. Spectra were acquired using a data interval of 1 nm and a scan rate of 120 nm/min. Fast kinetic experiments were performed using a stopped-flow UV-visible spectrophotometer (Hi-Tech, UK). Assays were carried out in HKM buffer using 20–40 μm Hsc66 and 0–500 μm ADP or ATP. Experiments were initiated by rapidly mixing equal volumes of protein and nucleotide solutions (100 μl each) that had been pre-equilibrated at 23 °C for 5 min prior to injection. Absorbance changes were monitored at 280 nm. For each experiment 2,000 data points were collected, and experiments were repeated at least five times for each nucleotide concentration. Data were fit to a single or double exponential using Kaleidagraph. Concentrations of proteins and nucleotides reported in figures are final concentrations in the optical cell after mixing and dilution. A Microcal Omega titration calorimeter (Microcal, Inc., Northampton, MA) was used to investigate the Hsc66 equilibrium binding constants for ADP and inorganic phosphate. Hsc66 was exchanged into HKM buffer, and nucleotides or phosphate were prepared in the same buffer. Immediately prior to the titration, all solutions were thoroughly degassed while gently stirring for 15 min. Injections were separated by 5-min intervals to allow for baseline stabilization. Experiments were performed at 25 °C, and the heats of reaction were determined by integration of the peaks obtained using Origin software. To correct for the heat of dilution of ADP or phosphate, control experiments were performed under identical conditions with the sample cell containing buffer alone. After the contribution from the heat of dilution of each injection was subtracted, the sum of the heat evolved (Q inj) was plotted against the molar ratio of ligand to Hsc66 in the cell. Binding constants (K d), enthalpies of binding (ΔH 0), and stoichiometry (n) were determined by fitting the binding isotherm to the equation previously described by Wiseman et al. (27.Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar). The data were deconvoluted using a nonlinear least squares algorithm incorporated in the Origin software provided with the instrument that makes use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (26.Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in C: the Art of Scientific Computing. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, New York1992: 683-688Google Scholar) to approximate curve fits. The rate of phosphate dissociation from Hsc66 was determined by following ATP-induced spectral changes subsequent to Pi release using methods similar to those described for determining nucleotide association/dissociation rates. Hsc66 used in this assay was preincubated with 10 mm Pi for 30 min, and assays were carried out by mixing Hsc66 and ATP in HKM buffer to final concentrations of 20 μm and 5 mm, respectively, at 23 °C. Absorbance changes were monitored at 288 nm where the extinction coefficient of ATP is <102(m·cm)−1. The data shown represents the average of 13 independent experiments, and the rate constant is reported ±1 S.D. from the fit to the average data. Data shown in figures are plotted with error bars of ±1 S.D. for each data point. Kinetic values are reported ±1 S.D. resulting from the fit to the data, with propagation of error through any subsequent calculations. Rate constants requiring a fit ofk obs (i.e. k a andk d for ATP and ADP) are reported as ±1 S.D. from the secondary fit, using all available values ofk obs. In initial experiments we investigated the steady-state ATPase activity of Hsc66 over a range of ATP concentrations (2–100 μm) at 23 °C (Fig.1). The value obtained fork cat (0.00138 ± 0.00005 s−1) is similar to values reported for DnaK under similar experimental conditions (∼0.0003–0.0014 s−1; see Refs. 8.Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 11.Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12.Russell R. Jordan R. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13.Slepenkov S.V. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, and 32.Steinfeld J.I. Francisco J.S. Hase W.L. Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1989: 22-23Google Scholar). Hsc66, however, exhibits an unusually low affinity for ATP (K m = 12.7 ± 1.8 μm), ∼103-fold lower affinity than values reported for DnaK (K m ∼0.019 μm; see Ref. 12.Russell R. Jordan R. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To examine the rates of individual steps in the Hsc66 ATPase reaction cycle, we first investigated single turnover ATP hydrolysis activity by monitoring the production of [α-32P]ADP from [α-32P]ATP using methods described previously (12.Russell R. Jordan R. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed using limiting [α-32P]ATP and high concentrations of Hsc66 such that most of the nucleotide will be bound rapidly compared with the rate of hydrolysis. Under these conditions, the observed rate for conversion of ATP to ADP is described by Equation 1 (32.Steinfeld J.I. Francisco J.S. Hase W.L. Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1989: 22-23Google Scholar). This equation can be simplified to Equation 2 if the rate of ATP hydrolysis is much greater than that of ATP synthesis as is the case for other stress-70 family members (12.Russell R. Jordan R. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 33.Ha J. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14625-14635Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The time course of ADP formation using 150 μm Hsc66 is shown in Fig.2. Fitting Equation 2 to the data using nonlinear regression yields k obs = 0.00143 ± 0.00002 s−1 and maximal hydrolysis of 92.8 ± 0.3%. This value for k obs is similar tok cat determined in the steady-state experiment described above in Fig. 1 (k cat = 0.00138 s−1) suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is the rate-determining step in the overall Hsc66 ATPase cycle (where hyd is hydrolysis and syn is synthesis). [ADPt]=[ADP∞]·[1−{khyd/(khyd−ksyn)}·e−(khyd+ksyn)·t]Equation 1 [ADPt]=[ADP∞]·(1−e−khyd·t)Equation 2 The finding that the maximum fraction of ADP produced in the single turnover experiment shown in Fig. 2 is slightly less than 100% suggested the possibility that the ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by Hsc66 may be a reversible reaction. To determine if Hsc66 can synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate, we performed ATP hydrolysis experiments in the presence of 50% H218O. If ATP hydrolysis is a reversible reaction, then a distribution of 18O species of inorganic phosphate containing zero to four 18O atoms are expected,i.e. P16O4, P16O318O … , P18O4, since ATP hydrolysis for hsp70 proteins is thought to involve the incorporation of water into the phosphate product (34.Wilbanks S.W. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12893-12898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If ATP synthesis is negligible, however, then a maximum of one 18O will be incorporated into phosphate as a result of the single hydrolysis event. Hydrolysis reactions containing 150 μm Hsc66 and 50 mm ATP were allowed to proceed for 48 h at 37 °C, and 31P NMR was then used to investigate the distribution of 18O species in inorganic phosphate. Each 18O incorporated into phosphate is expected to cause a ∼0.02 ppm chemical shift in the signal arising from phosphate (35.Bock J.L. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4082-4085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 h, peaks corresponding to the α-, β-, and γ-phosphates in ATP were no longer detectable, whereas those corresponding to the α- and β-phosphates in ADP were observed indicating hydrolysis had proceeded to completion (data not shown). The resonance for phosphate produced in reactions lacking enriched water appeared as a singlet with a resonance at 2.159 ppm (Fig. 3 A). Resonances for reactions performed in the presence of 50% H218O appeared as a doublet with peaks at 2.159 and 2.141 ppm consistent with the presence of both P16O4 and P16O318O (Fig. 3 B). Because 31P NMR is capable of detecting phosphate concentrations ≥ 1 mm under the experimental conditions used, we conclude that <2% of the phosphate molecules produced from ATP hydrolysis have two or more 18O atoms incorporated into them. Based on these results, we estimate that the rate of ATP synthesis (k syn ≤ 3 × 10−5 s−1) is at least 50-fold slower than the rate of ATP hydrolysis and thus is unlikely to occur in the time course of physiological processes. For DnaK and some other hsp70 proteins, nucleotide-induced fluorescence changes have been used to determine the kinetics of hsp70 and nucleotide interactions (11.Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Bukau B.

Witt S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9744-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We investigated whether nucleotides affect the spectral properties of Hsc66 and found that ATP binding induces a red shift in the near-UV absorption spectrum of Hsc66. The difference spectrum induced immediately following ATP addition is shown in Fig.4. This ATP-induced spectral change is time-dependent and decays to that resembling the spectrum observed upon mixing Hsc66 and ADP or Hsc66 and ADP plus Pi. The rate of disappearance of the ATP-induced spectral change under these single turnover conditions can be described by a single exponential (inset, Fig. 4). The observed rate of decay (k decay = 0.00126 ± 0.00003 s−1) is similar to the rate observed for ATP hydrolysis (k hyd = 0.00143 s−1) suggesting that the state giving rise to this difference absorbance spectrum requires bound ATP. The large magnitude of the difference spectra induced upon mixing Hsc66 with ATP (Δε280 2 × 103m−1 cm−1) or ADP/Pi(Δε280 ∼500 m−1cm−1) provides a useful probe for investigating Hsc66 and nucleotide binding kinetics using stopped-flow methods. Fig.5 A shows a representative plot of the rate of the ΔA 280 formation upon mixing 75 μm ATP and 20 μm Hsc66. Residuals for single and double exponential fits to this data, Equations 3 and 4, indicate that the formation of the ATP-induced difference spectrum is biphasic, and the curve shown represents a double exponential fit to the data. The first rapid exponential comprises ∼70% of the ΔA 280 and displays a rate (k fast) = 4.9 ± 0.2 s−1; the slower exponential comprises ∼30% of the ΔA 280 signal and displays a rate (k slow) = 0.096 ± 2 × 10−3 s−1. At=ΔA·e−kobs·t+CEquation 3 At=ΔAfast·e−kfast·t+ΔAslow·e−kslow·t+CEquation 4 To investigate whether the absorbance changes observed are the result of a bimolecular binding reaction or might represent unimolecular changes in the conformation of the Hsc66·ATP complex following binding, we carried out measurements over a range of ATP concentrations (25–150 μm) with Hsc66 fixed at 20 μm. Fig. 5, B and C, shows thatk fast, but not k slow, is affected by ATP concentration. The value ofk fast increases with ATP concentration in a linear fashion indicating that this rate constant describes an absorbance change associated with the binding of ATP and Hsc66. Becausek fast represents the observed rate constant for a reversible binding reaction, the plot of k fast versus [ATP] in Fig. 5 B has a slope equal to kaATP (4.2 ± 0.4 × 104m−1 s−1) and ay intercept equal to kdATP (1.1 ± 0.3 s−1) (40.Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985: 131-133Google Scholar). By using these values to calculate aK d for ATP yields a value ( KdATP = kdATP/ kaATP= 26 ± 7 μm) which is similar to theK m (13 μm) determined in steady-state experiments (Fig. 1). Thus the unusually low affinity of Hsc66 for ATP compared with DnaK ( KdATP∼0.001–0.007 μm; Ref. 11.Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12.Russell R. Jordan R. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) arises primarily from the much higher ATP dissociation rate for Hsc66. In contrast to k fast,k slow is not affected by ATP concentration and displays an average value of 0.10 ± 0.03 s−1. This suggests k slow represents a unimolecular change that follows ATP binding but precedes hydrolysis (k hyd = 0.00143 s−1). We propose that k slow represents a conformational change (k conf) corresponding to the rate of conversion of Hsc66 from the R state (high peptide affinity) to the T state (low peptide affinity) similar to that proposed for other hsp70 proteins (11.Theyssen H.

The rate of this ATP-induced unimolecular transition for Hsc66 is slower than that observed for DnaK under similar conditions (k ∼0.67–1.5 s−1; Refs. 11.Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Bukau B.

Furthermore, JNK activation by Gαi was inhibited by dominant-negative Rho and Cdc42 and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but not dominant-negative Rac and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors.

MAPKs are grouped into four major classes: ERK/MAPK, BMK1/ERK5, JNK/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 MAPK. ERK and BMK1 are activated mainly by growth factors and are involved in cell cycle progression and cell growth (5.Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem.

Inflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses stimulate the activities of JNK and p38 MAPK, which appear to be implicated in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (6.Davis R.J. Trends Biochem.

MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues catalyzed by MAPKK/MEK, which is phosphorylated and activated by serine/threonine kinases called MAPKKK/MEKK (5.Nishida E.

JNK is phosphorylated and activated by MKK4/SEK1/JNKK1/SKK1 and MKK7/JNKK2/SKK4, while p38 MAPK is phosphorylated and activated by MKK3/SKK2, MKK6/SKK3, and MKK4. Since many MAPKKK/MEKKs including MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, MEKK4, MAPKKK5, and MAPKKK6, induce the activation of JNK and/or p38 MAPK cascade(s), the linkage of MAPKKK/MEKK to MAPKK/MEK is more complicated than that of MAPKK to MAPK.Several lines of evidence suggest that G protein-coupled receptors stimulate the ERK pathway through some G protein subunits in various cells (9.Gutkind J.S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). It is likely that Gi-dependent ERK activation is mediated primarily by Gβγ (9.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc permits the translocation of the Grb2-Sos complex to plasma membranes, leading to the promotion of the GDP-GTP exchange on Ras. Ras regulates the activity of Raf, which induces the activation of MEK1 and -2 and subsequently ERK.Some G protein-coupled receptors are able to activate JNK in certain types of cells (9.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). JNK is activated by agonist stimulation of Gi-coupled receptors in NIH3T3, Rat-1, and COS-7 cells (15.Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.P. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

It has been reported that JNK activation by Gi-coupled m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is mediated mainly by Gβγ in COS-7 cells (17.Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Small GTPases Ras and Rac and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ are involved in this Gβγ-induced JNK activation (17.Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. J. Biol.

In the course of studying Gi-dependent JNK activation in human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293 cells, we found that its activation was mediated by both Gαi and Gβγ. Here we show that constitutively activated Gαi2 mutant as well as Gβγ (19.Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) stimulates JNK activity. Furthermore, we investigate whether JNK kinases, Rho family GTPases, tyrosine kinases, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases participate in this signal transduction pathway.DISCUSSIONJNK activation induced by constitutively activated mutant of Gαi2 has been shown in two systems including Gαi2Q205L-overexpressing mice (35.Guo J.H. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16487-16493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and Rat-1 cells inducibly expressing Gαi2Q205L (36.Edamatsu H. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 440: 231-234Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although the mechanism by which Gαi2 regulates JNK activity remained to be characterized. In the present study, we first found that mastoparan-induced JNK activation was dependent on Gi and mediated by both Gαi and Gβγ in HEK 293 cells. In addition, constitutively activated mutants of Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 induced JNK activation. But JNK was not stimulated by activated Gαo and Gαz mutants. Moreover, Gαi2 appeared to regulate JNK activity through a MKK4- and MKK7-independent pathway. Furthermore, JNK activation by Gαi2 was dependent on small GTPases Rho and Cdc42 and Src family tyrosine kinases but not on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.Two JNK kinase genes, MKK4 and MKK7, have been cloned to date. We showed previously that Gβγ activates JNK via mainly MKK4 and to a lesser extent MKK7 (19.Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, JNK activation by Gαi2Q205L was not inhibited effectively by cotransfection of kinase-deficient MKK4 and MKK7 (Fig. 4). Moreover, transfection of Gαi2Q205L into the cells failed to stimulate the activities of MKK4, MKK7, and MKK7β, an alternative splicing form of MKK7 (Fig. 4). It has been reported that there is a JNK kinase other than MKK4 and MKK7 at the level of the fractionation by column chromatography with lysates of stress-stimulated cells (37.Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gαi2 may regulate JNK activity through an unidentified JNK kinase.A Rac and Cdc42-binding region is found in MAPKKKs including MEKK1, MEKK4, MLK2, and MLK3. MEKK1 activates primarily JNK pathway and appears to mediate JNK activation by Rac or Cdc42 (38.Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It has been shown that MEKK1 and ASK1 mediate JNK activation induced by Gα12 and Gα13 in COS-7 and HEK 293 cells (39.Berestetskaya Y.V. Faure M.P. Ichijo H. Voyano-Yasentskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27816-27823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Additionally, Collins et al. (40.Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have reported that Gα12-induced JNK activation partially involves Cdc42 in HEK 293 cells. It appears that a Cdc42-MEKK1 signaling unit functions upstream of JNK. Because Gαi2-induced JNK activation depended on Cdc42 (Fig. 5), MEKK1 might be a candidate of MAPKKK in the JNK pathway from Gαi. JNK activation by Gαidepended on Rho (Fig. 5). Although a MAPKKK regulated by Rho has not yet been identified, it is expected that there may exist a MAPK cascade linking Rho with a transcription factor SRF in c-fospromoter activation induced by lysophosphatidic acid, a Gi-coupled receptor ligand (41.Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).Gαi2Q205L-induced JNK activation was inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP1 and PP2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). These inhibitors preferentially inhibit Src family tyrosine kinases, and the IC50 value of PP2 for the inhibition of Src is 15 μm in intact cells. 2A. Levitzki, personal communication. Furthermore, cotransfection of Csk attenuated Gαi2Q205L-induced JNK activation (Fig. 6). Src family tyrosine kinases are likely to be involved in the signaling pathway from Gαi to JNK.We reported previously that Gβγ stimulates MKK4 activity in a Rho- and Cdc42-dependent manner (19.Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gαi2Q205L failed to activate MKK4, but activated JNK in a Rho- and Cdc42-dependent manner. This difference may be due to the difference of downstream signaling components of Gαi and Gβγ. It must be noted that JNK activation by Gαi2Q205L, but not by Gβγ, was reduced by Csk (Fig.6) and dominant-negative Fyn. These results suggest that the relationships among tyrosine kinases, Rho, and Cdc42 may be more complex than a single sequential cascade.Fig. 8 shows a proposed pathway from Gi to JNK. In the present study, we used mastoparan as an activator of Gi. JNK activation by mastoparan, as well as Gαi2Q205L and Gβγ (19.Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was almost completely inhibited by dominant negative mutants of Rho and Cdc42 (Fig. 5). Moreover, mastoparan-induced JNK activation was blocked partially by Src family inhibitor PP1 and the kinase-deficient mutant of MKK4 (Figs.3 and 6). These results are consistent with the model in which Gαi and Gβγ participate equivalently in the signaling pathway from Gi to JNK.Activating mutations of Gαi2, which were denoted as thegip2 oncogene, have been found in some types of tumor including ovarian sex cord stromal tumors, adrenal cortex tumors, and nonfunctional pituitary tumors (42.Dhanasekaran N. Tsim S. Dermott J.M. Onesime D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of the gip2 oncogene has been shown to cause oncogenic transformation of Rat-1 fibroblast cells. However, it appears that thegip2 oncogene fails to transform other fibroblast cells such as NIH3T3 (42.Dhanasekaran N. Tsim S. Dermott J.M. Onesime D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that conditional expression of active Gαi2 mutant in Rat-1 cells induces the colony formation on soft agar (36.Edamatsu H. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 440: 231-234Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We found that JNK is activated with the expression of active Gαi2 mutant in the cells (36.Edamatsu H. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 440: 231-234Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). On the other hand, JNK activity was not stimulated in NIH3T3 cells expressing active Gαi2 mutant (43.Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18655-18659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Further elucidation of the Gαi2-JNK pathway may clarify the relationship between the activation of JNK and the mechanism of oncogenic transformation by the gip2 oncogene. Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins)1 are composed of α, β, and γ subunits (Gα, Gβ, and Gγ), which are encoded by at least 15, 5, and 11 genes, respectively, in mammalian cells (1.Gilman A.G.

MAPKs are grouped into four major classes: ERK/MAPK, BMK1/ERK5, JNK/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 MAPK. ERK and BMK1 are activated mainly by growth factors and are involved in cell cycle progression and cell growth (5.Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem.

Inflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses stimulate the activities of JNK and p38 MAPK, which appear to be implicated in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (6.Davis R.J. Trends Biochem.

MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues catalyzed by MAPKK/MEK, which is phosphorylated and activated by serine/threonine kinases called MAPKKK/MEKK (5.Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 6.Davis R.J. Trends Biochem.

JNK is phosphorylated and activated by MKK4/SEK1/JNKK1/SKK1 and MKK7/JNKK2/SKK4, while p38 MAPK is phosphorylated and activated by MKK3/SKK2, MKK6/SKK3, and MKK4. Since many MAPKKK/MEKKs including MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, MEKK4, MAPKKK5, and MAPKKK6, induce the activation of JNK and/or p38 MAPK cascade(s), the linkage of MAPKKK/MEKK to MAPKK/MEK is more complicated than that of MAPKK to MAPK. Several lines of evidence suggest that G protein-coupled receptors stimulate the ERK pathway through some G protein subunits in various cells (9.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). It is likely that Gi-dependent ERK activation is mediated primarily by Gβγ (9.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Gβγ directly activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ and β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1, resulting in an increase of activities of Src family tyrosine kinases (9.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc permits the translocation of the Grb2-Sos complex to plasma membranes, leading to the promotion of the GDP-GTP exchange on Ras. Ras regulates the activity of Raf, which induces the activation of MEK1 and -2 and subsequently ERK. Some G protein-coupled receptors are able to activate JNK in certain types of cells (9.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). JNK is activated by agonist stimulation of Gi-coupled receptors in NIH3T3, Rat-1, and COS-7 cells (15.Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.P. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

It has been reported that JNK activation by Gi-coupled m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is mediated mainly by Gβγ in COS-7 cells (17.Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Small GTPases Ras and Rac and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ are involved in this Gβγ-induced JNK activation (17.Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. J. Biol.

In the course of studying Gi-dependent JNK activation in human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293 cells, we found that its activation was mediated by both Gαi and Gβγ. Here we show that constitutively activated Gαi2 mutant as well as Gβγ (19.Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) stimulates JNK activity. Furthermore, we investigate whether JNK kinases, Rho family GTPases, tyrosine kinases, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases participate in this signal transduction pathway. DISCUSSIONJNK activation induced by constitutively activated mutant of Gαi2 has been shown in two systems including Gαi2Q205L-overexpressing mice (35.Guo J.H. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16487-16493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and Rat-1 cells inducibly expressing Gαi2Q205L (36.Edamatsu H. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 440: 231-234Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although the mechanism by which Gαi2 regulates JNK activity remained to be characterized. In the present study, we first found that mastoparan-induced JNK activation was dependent on Gi and mediated by both Gαi and Gβγ in HEK 293 cells. In addition, constitutively activated mutants of Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 induced JNK activation. But JNK was not stimulated by activated Gαo and Gαz mutants. Moreover, Gαi2 appeared to regulate JNK activity through a MKK4- and MKK7-independent pathway. Furthermore, JNK activation by Gαi2 was dependent on small GTPases Rho and Cdc42 and Src family tyrosine kinases but not on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.Two JNK kinase genes, MKK4 and MKK7, have been cloned to date. We showed previously that Gβγ activates JNK via mainly MKK4 and to a lesser extent MKK7 (19.Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, JNK activation by Gαi2Q205L was not inhibited effectively by cotransfection of kinase-deficient MKK4 and MKK7 (Fig. 4). Moreover, transfection of Gαi2Q205L into the cells failed to stimulate the activities of MKK4, MKK7, and MKK7β, an alternative splicing form of MKK7 (Fig. 4). It has been reported that there is a JNK kinase other than MKK4 and MKK7 at the level of the fractionation by column chromatography with lysates of stress-stimulated cells (37.Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gαi2 may regulate JNK activity through an unidentified JNK kinase.A Rac and Cdc42-binding region is found in MAPKKKs including MEKK1, MEKK4, MLK2, and MLK3. MEKK1 activates primarily JNK pathway and appears to mediate JNK activation by Rac or Cdc42 (38.Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It has been shown that MEKK1 and ASK1 mediate JNK activation induced by Gα12 and Gα13 in COS-7 and HEK 293 cells (39.Berestetskaya Y.V. Faure M.P. Ichijo H. Voyano-Yasentskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27816-27823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Additionally, Collins et al. (40.Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have reported that Gα12-induced JNK activation partially involves Cdc42 in HEK 293 cells. It appears that a Cdc42-MEKK1 signaling unit functions upstream of JNK. Because Gαi2-induced JNK activation depended on Cdc42 (Fig. 5), MEKK1 might be a candidate of MAPKKK in the JNK pathway from Gαi. JNK activation by Gαidepended on Rho (Fig. 5). Although a MAPKKK regulated by Rho has not yet been identified, it is expected that there may exist a MAPK cascade linking Rho with a transcription factor SRF in c-fospromoter activation induced by lysophosphatidic acid, a Gi-coupled receptor ligand (41.Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).Gαi2Q205L-induced JNK activation was inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP1 and PP2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). These inhibitors preferentially inhibit Src family tyrosine kinases, and the IC50 value of PP2 for the inhibition of Src is 15 μm in intact cells. 2A. Levitzki, personal communication. Furthermore, cotransfection of Csk attenuated Gαi2Q205L-induced JNK activation (Fig. 6). Src family tyrosine kinases are likely to be involved in the signaling pathway from Gαi to JNK.We reported previously that Gβγ stimulates MKK4 activity in a Rho- and Cdc42-dependent manner (19.Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gαi2Q205L failed to activate MKK4, but activated JNK in a Rho- and Cdc42-dependent manner. This difference may be due to the difference of downstream signaling components of Gαi and Gβγ. It must be noted that JNK activation by Gαi2Q205L, but not by Gβγ, was reduced by Csk (Fig.6) and dominant-negative Fyn. These results suggest that the relationships among tyrosine kinases, Rho, and Cdc42 may be more complex than a single sequential cascade.Fig. 8 shows a proposed pathway from Gi to JNK. In the present study, we used mastoparan as an activator of Gi. JNK activation by mastoparan, as well as Gαi2Q205L and Gβγ (19.Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was almost completely inhibited by dominant negative mutants of Rho and Cdc42 (Fig. 5). Moreover, mastoparan-induced JNK activation was blocked partially by Src family inhibitor PP1 and the kinase-deficient mutant of MKK4 (Figs.3 and 6). These results are consistent with the model in which Gαi and Gβγ participate equivalently in the signaling pathway from Gi to JNK.Activating mutations of Gαi2, which were denoted as thegip2 oncogene, have been found in some types of tumor including ovarian sex cord stromal tumors, adrenal cortex tumors, and nonfunctional pituitary tumors (42.Dhanasekaran N. Tsim S. Dermott J.M. Onesime D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of the gip2 oncogene has been shown to cause oncogenic transformation of Rat-1 fibroblast cells. However, it appears that thegip2 oncogene fails to transform other fibroblast cells such as NIH3T3 (42.Dhanasekaran N. Tsim S. Dermott J.M. Onesime D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that conditional expression of active Gαi2 mutant in Rat-1 cells induces the colony formation on soft agar (36.Edamatsu H. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 440: 231-234Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We found that JNK is activated with the expression of active Gαi2 mutant in the cells (36.Edamatsu H. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 440: 231-234Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). On the other hand, JNK activity was not stimulated in NIH3T3 cells expressing active Gαi2 mutant (43.Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Dermott J.M.

Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The human homologue of rat PTTG (hPTTG) has also been identified (3.Zhang X. Horwitz G.A. Prezant T.R. Valentini A. Nakashima M. Bronstein M.D. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and its overexpression in 3T3 cells resulted in increased expression of basic fibroblast growth factor-2, a potent angiogenic growth factor (3.Zhang X. Horwitz G.A. Prezant T.R. Valentini A. Nakashima M. Bronstein M.D. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). PTTG has also been found to participate in early stage development of prolactinoma and is highly expressed in experimental and clinical pituitary tumors (4.Heaney A.P. Horwitz G.A. Wang Z. Singson R. Melmed S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 5.Zhang X. Horwitz G.A. Heaney A.P. Nakashima M. Prezant T.R. Bronstein M.D. Melmed S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). PTTG recently was shown to behave as a vertebrate sister-chromatid separation inhibitor providing a potential mechanism for PTTG to mediate aneuploidy and genetic instability, thus contributing to cell malignancy (6.Zou H. McGarry T.J. Bernal T. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Human PTTG has several gene homologues comprising a gene family including PTTG1 (most homologous to rat PTTG), PTTG2, PTTG3, and PTTG4 (7.Prezant T.R. Kadioglu P. Melmed S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have also cloned the murine PTTG cDNA (most homologous to human PTTG1) and its promoter (8.Wang Z. Melmed S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In a detailed computational analysis of human, rat, and murine PTTG protein sequences, Glu and Pro residues were observed to be abundant in the C-terminal region, a known characteristic of transactivation domains in transcription factors and/or co-activators. We therefore fused murine PTTG with a GAL4 DNA binding domain and found that PTTG indeed possesses transcriptional activation ability; mutation analysis identified several residues and regions important for this activation, and soft agar assay suggested a high correlation between transactivating and transforming abilities of PTTG. Furthermore, a novel murine PTTG alternative transcript encoding a variant protein containing a different C-terminal tail was detected. This variant PTTG is devoid of both transactivation function and transforming ability. Deletion of the variant C-terminal tail restores both transactivation and transforming ability. These results imply that PTTG-mediated transactivation correlates with its transforming ability, and the variant C terminus may function as an endogenous competitor to wild-type PTTG. pcDNA3.1 and pCRII vectors were from Invitrogen, and murine PTTG was cloned in this laboratory (8.Wang Z. Melmed S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1. pGAL4 vector, which contains the GAL4 DNA binding domain, and pGAL4-VP16 as a positive control vector were from Stratagene. pLuc vector, which contains five copies of GAL4 DNA element in front of a minimal promoter, and the luciferase gene were also from Stratagene. Polyclonal antibody against a 20-amino acid peptide of rat PTTG was generated commercially (Research Genetics). Mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 (ATCC CCL-92) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium low glucose medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum, and mouse MOP8 (ATCC CRL-1709) and mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 (ATCC CRL-1720) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum. All culture media were supplemented with standard antibiotics, and cells were passaged twice weekly. Murine PTTG cDNA was fused in-frame with pGAL4, designated pGAL4-mPTTG and used as template for all deletion and mutation analysis. pGAL4-VP16 was used as a positive control. Experimental plasmids were co-transfected with pLuc and pCMV-β-Gal (as internal control). Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity as described (9.Wang Z. Melmed S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27957-27965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.2.1-10.2.6Google Scholar). 3′RACE was performed as suggested by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Total RNA derived from F9 cells was used for reverse transcription, and one PTTG gene-specific primer (5′-GCTCCAGCCGTGCCTAAAGCCAG-3′) and universal primer were used in polymerase chain reaction. A probe derived from unique sequence in the alternative transcript was used to screen a F9 cDNA library, and full-length mPTTG variant cDNA was cloned and sequenced. Mutagenesis and deletion of PTTG using pGAL4-mPTTG as template were performed as suggested using the ExSite polymerase chain reaction-based method (Stratagene). All mutants were sequence-verified. A total of 37 primers were used for mutation and deletion, and their sequences are available upon request. NIH3T3 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Expression vectors for mPTTG, mPTTG-variant, Ala139-mPTTG, Asn139-mPTTG, mPTTG-d-(171–196), and mPTTG-d-(1–100) were transfected, and G418 selection started after 48 h. Stable transfectants were confirmed by Western blot, in which cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer and protein concentrations were quantitated by Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and antigen detection was performed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The assay was performed as described previously (2.Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). 5000 cells were seeded in triplicate for each cell line in the top layer in the presence of 0.5% agar in a 35-mm dish. 3 weeks after seeding, cell morphology was observed, and numbers of transformed colonies (>16 cells per colony) were counted. MOP8 cells were used as a positive control, and NIH3T3 cells were used as a negative control. PTTG does not exhibit significant similarity to a known protein, but computational analysis shows that the N-terminal half (1–100 aa) is rich in alkaline residues (21/100), whereas the C-terminal half is rich in acidic residues, especially glutamic acid (8/96) and proline (17/96). Because an abundance of Glu and/or Pro is characteristic of transactivation domains for transcription factors and/or co-activators, we tested whether PTTG demonstrated transcriptional activation. Fig.1 shows that PTTG exhibits transcriptional activation; the mutant human PTTG-M9 (replacing region 163–166 from Pro-Pro-Ser-Pro to Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu), which is devoid of transforming ability (3.Zhang X. Horwitz G.A. Prezant T.R. Valentini A. Nakashima M. Bronstein M.D. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), also does not activate transcription. This result suggests that transforming and transcriptional activation functions of PTTG are distinct and correlate with each other. Murine PTTG shows high homology with human and rat PTTG. Nevertheless, on Northern blot analysis, a second band (∼1.6 kb) was detected in RNA derived from embryonic F9 cells (8.Wang Z. Melmed S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine the presence of this alternative PTTG transcript, 3′RACE was performed and a ∼1.3 kb band was amplified in addition to the band corresponding to wild-type mPTTG (Fig. 2 a). Sequencing revealed that this transcript differed from wild-type mPTTG after exon 4. Using the distinct sequence obtained using this 3′RACE product as probe, an F9 cDNA library was screened and a ∼1.7-kb mPTTG alternative transcript was identified, which encoded a 188-aa murine PTTG cDNA variant that has been deposited in GenBankTM (accession number AF071209). Comparison of this mPTTG variant with wild-type is shown in Fig. 2 b, and major differences are apparent in the C-terminal tail. Understanding PTTG structure-function relationships in terms of its transforming ability is important for unraveling its mechanism of action as an oncogene. However, establishing stable transfectant cell lines and performing anchorage-independent soft agar assays is time-consuming and not suitable for pilot scale screening. As mutant human PTTG-M9 is devoid of both transforming and transactivation ability, we reasoned that these two functions might correlate, and therefore we tested transactivating activity to identify amino acid residues important for this function. Transactivation-related Glu and Pro, phosphorylation-related Ser and Tyr, conserved acidic and/or alkaline residues, other conserved regions, and the novel mPTTG variant C-terminal tail were mutated and/or deleted and tested for transactivating activity (Table I). Deletion of the first 100-aa mPTTG residues does not alter transactivation, indicating that this function is inherent within the C-terminal half of the mPTTG protein. Several residues were found to be important for transactivation including Pro139, Ser159, Pro134, and Glu169, and two regions including Leu120-Asp121-Phe122-Asp123-Leu124and Pro157-Pro158-Ser159-Pro160(PPXP motif). Mutation of Pro139 to Ala or Leu resulted in complete loss of transactivation, whereas mutation of Pro139 to Asn did not disrupt transactivation, showing that the Pro139 tolerates a hydrophilic residue but not hydrophobic substitution for its activity. Mutation of Ser159 to Ala or Ser159 to Leu abrogated transactivation by 70 and 80%, respectively, whereas mutation of Ser159 to Thr only reduced transactivation by 30%. Thus, maintaining the Ser159 position hydrophilic appears critical, and this residue may be a potential phosphorylation site for regulation. Mutation of Glu169 to Gln resulted in loss of 75% transactivation activity, showing that the acidic residue is important at this position. Two regions were also found to be important for transactivation, including a highly conserved region, Leu120-Asp121-Phe122-Asp123-Leu124, which when completely deleted disrupted transactivation. The other region, a PXXP motif from aa 157 to 160 is also important for the activity. Moreover, the mPTTG cDNA variant did not exhibit transactivating ability, whereas deletion of the variant tail Gly-Lys-Gly-Val-Arg-Ser-Asn-Gly-Cys-Lys-Asp-Leu-Val-Thr (equivalent deletion of 171–196 aa in wild-type mPTTG) restored transactivation.Table ITransactivation assay of mPTTG mutation and deletion mutantsMutantActivation capabilityMutantActivation capability%%pGAL4-WT-mPTTG100-Ser159→ Ala30 ± 2 -Pro139 → Ala7 ± 1-Ser159 → Thr60 ± 5 -Pro139 → Leu4 ± 1-Ser159 → Leu20 ± 2 -Pro139→ Asn100 ± 10-Ser170 → Ala100 ± 10 -Pro125 → Ala100 ± 10-Ser177 → Ala100 ± 10 -Pro134 → Ala30 ± 2-Ser178 → Ala120 ± 10 -Pro157→ Ala100 ± 10-Ser181 → Ala130 ± 10 -Pro160 → Ala45 ± 5-His128 → Leu100 ± 10 -Pro164 → Ala100 ± 10-Arg147 → Ala100 ± 10 -Pro176→ Ala100 ± 10-Lys151 → Ala100 ± 10 -Pro188 → Ala100 ± 10-Lys162 → Ala100 ± 10 -Pro189 → Ala100 ± 10-mPTTG variant8 ± 1 -Glu126 → Gln100 ± 10-d-(171–196)85 ± 5 -Glu145 → Gln100 ± 10-d-(157–196)75 ± 5 -Glu146 → Gln100 ± 10-d-(140–196)50 ± 4 -Glu150 → Gln100 ± 10-d-(125–196)40 ± 4 -Glu169 → Gln100 ± 10-d-(120–124)7 ± 1 -Glu186 → Gln50 ± 3-d-(1–100)100 ± 10 -Cys187 → Ala50 ± 3-mut-mPTTG6 ± 1 -Tyr108 → Phe100 ± 10Indicated plasmids were co-transfected with pLuc and pCMV-β-Gal into NIH3T3 cells, and luciferase assays were performed with β-Gal serving as the internal control.

Although these results provided useful insights for the transactivation function of mPTTG, we also tested these residues and/or regions for their transforming properties. Several constructs were chosen to establish stable NIH3T3 transfectants, and soft agar assays were performed to test transforming ability (TableII). As depicted, a high correlation between transactivating and transforming abilities was observed. Pro139 is also an important residue for transforming ability, whereas the novel mPTTG variant failed to transform NIH3T3 cells. Deletion of the variant C-terminal tail restored the transforming ability of the variant cDNA.Table IIColony formation in soft agar assayCell lineNumber of coloniesMOP8 (positive control)880 ± 60NIH3T3 (negative control)12 ± 5NIH3T3-WT-mPTTG374 ± 20NIH3T3-Ala139-mPTTG22 ± 8NIH3T3-Asn139-mPTTG388 ± 25NIH3T3-mPTTG-variant25 ± 6NIH3T3-mPTTG-d-(171–196)410 ± 25NIH3T3-mPTTG-d-(1–100)42 ± 15Indicated cells were seeded at 5,000 cells per 35-mm dish in triplicate, and colonies (>16 cells per colony) were counted after 3 weeks. Open table in a new tab Indicated cells were seeded at 5,000 cells per 35-mm dish in triplicate, and colonies (>16 cells per colony) were counted after 3 weeks. PTTG is a highly conserved protein, with murine PTTG sharing 88% and 66% amino acid homology with rat PTTG and human PTTG1, respectively. Nonetheless, the C-terminal 26-amino acid tail is relatively low in homology (about 31%) and seems unlikely to be important for conserved function of the molecule. Indeed, deletion of the last 26 amino acids did not affect transcriptional activation induced by mPTTG nor did it alter the transforming ability of the protein. These results show good correlation between transforming ability and transcriptional activation mediated by murine PTTG. Similar findings have been obtained with other oncogenes, which function as transcription factors including Jun or Myb; Jun transactivates the Myb promoter via an AP-1-like sequence, and its N terminus demonstrates the transactivation property. Interestingly, the δ domain in human Jun, absent in the v-Jun oncogene, stabilizes the interaction of cell-specific transcriptional inhibition with activation regions (11.Baichwal V.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Expression of v-Src or oncogenic Ras disrupts the Jun-inhibitor complex, thus increasing transcriptional activity (12.Baichwal V.R. Park A. Tjian R. Nature. 1991; 352: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The protooncogene Myb also contains DNA binding, transcriptional activation, and negative regulatory domains (13.Graf T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14.Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In both cases inactivation of relevant transcriptional activation domains also abrogates transforming abilities. Notably, deletion of PTTG N-terminal 100 aa disrupts transformation, while not affecting transactivation. It is therefore possible that the N-terminal 100-aa region interacts with DNA element(s) or other proteins whereas the C-terminal portion mainly interacts with the RNA polymerase complex for transcriptional activation. Thus without the N-terminal 100 aa, mPTTG still maintains its transactivation ability when fused with the GAL4 DNA binding domain but is unable to interact with endogenous substrate in NIH3T3 cells to mediate its transforming effect. The comprehensive deletion and mutagenesis analysis in the C terminal region demonstrates that it is most likely that, overall, a three-dimensional structure is important for function, and Pro139, Ser159, Pro157-Pro158-Ser159-Pro160, and Leu120-Asp121-Phe122-Asp123-Leu124are critical contact sites for PTTG function. We have recently demonstrated that human PTTG1 C terminus is also critical for in vitro and in vivotransforming. 2G. A. Horwitz, unpublished data. On the other hand, whether PTTG is a true transcription factor/co-activator remains to be tested via efforts to identify its endogenous binding element and/or interacting proteins. Identification of the new murine PTTG variant is interesting. This variant possesses a different C-terminal tail and does not exhibit transforming ability. Deletion of the variant C-terminal tail restores both transcriptional activation and transforming ability, indicating an inhibitory effect of the tail on PTTG function by conformational perturbation or interaction with specific residues. Thus the intracellular balance of PTTG and this variant PTTG may compete to determine their ultimate effects on the cell. Future comparison of gene expression profiles between wild-type PTTG and variant PTTG stable transfectants should help identify downstream target genes for PTTG."

Some CHOP-C/EBP heterodimers apparently bind to alternative DNA sequence and thereby regulate the transcription of other genes. Recently, we demonstrated that CHOP is up-regulated during certain stages of erythroid differentiation and that ectopic overexpression of CHOP enhances this process (Coutts, M., Cui, K., Davis, K. L., Keutzer, J. C., and Sytkowski, A. J. (1999) Blood 93, 3369–3378). In the present study, we report that CHOP also interacts with another non-C/EBP protein designated v-fos transformation effector (FTE) (Kho, C. J., and Zarbl, H. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacterially expressed His-CHOP and in vitrotranslated 35S-labeled FTE/S3a-Gal4 fusion protein co-immunoprecipitated using anti-CHOP antibodies, and both anti-CHOP and anti-FTE/S3a antibodies co-immunoprecipitated CHOP and FTE/S3a from lysates of Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells overexpressing both proteins. The in vivo interaction of CHOP and FTE/S3a was also demonstrated in cells overexpressing FTE/S3a but with endogenous expression levels of CHOP. Western blot analysis demonstrated co-localization of CHOP and FTE/S3a in both the cytosol and the nuclei of non-transfected cells. Overexpression of FTE/S3a inhibited differentiation of Rauscher cells induced either by erythropoietin or by dimethyl sulfoxide. This inhibition was reversed partially by simultaneous overexpression of CHOP or of antisensefte/S3a. FTE/S3a appears to be a bifunctional ribosomal protein that regulates CHOP and, hence, C/EBP function during erythropoiesis.

Gain-of-function studies indicated that increasing CHOP expression enhances hemoglobinization of erythroid cells, indicating a functional role forCHOP in erythroid differentiation. Additionally, we obtained evidence that CHOP protein can bind to several nuclear proteins from erythroid cells, potentially some that are not C/EBP family members. We have now used the yeast two-hybrid system (26.Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) to screen an erythroid cell cDNA library for proteins that interact with CHOP. We report that CHOP interacts with a non-C/EBP protein designated v-fos transformation effector (FTE) (27.Kho C.J. Zarbl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2200-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) which is identical to ribosomal protein S3a (28.Metspalu A. Rebane A. Hoth S. Pooga M. Stahl J. Kruppa J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 119: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that this interaction inhibits the ability of CHOP to enhance erythroid differentiation. A library from Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells (29.de Both N.J. Vermey M. van't Hull E. Klootwijk-van-Dijke E. van Griensven L.J. Mol J.N. Stoof T.J.

Science. 1980; 210: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was constructed into the pAD-Gal4 vector. Briefly, 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was converted to double-stranded DNA using Stratascript RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). First strand synthesis was primed with an oligonucleotide containing poly(dT) and an XhoI site (31.Huynh T. Young R.A. Davis R.W. Glover D.N. DNA Cloning Techmiques: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 49-78Google Scholar). Second strand synthesis was carried out using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and RNase H (32.Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar). The cDNA ends were filled with T4 DNA polymerase, and the internal EcoRI sites of the cDNA were methylated with EcoRI methylase. Following EcoRI linker addition and size fractionation in a 1% agarose gel, double-stranded cDNA over 800 base pairs was cleaved with EcoRI and XhoI. The fragments purified from agarose gel were ligated into the Hybri-ZAP vector in unidirection (Stratagene). After in vitro packaging, 106 recombinant phages were plated, and the Hybrizap Lambda library was converted into the phagemid library pAD-GAL4 after in vitro mass excision. For the expression of CHOP as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, two restriction enzyme cleavage sites were introduced into the two ends of CHOP cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers, 5′-TTCGGACGACCTAGTGCAAGCCGA-3′ and 5′-TTAAGGAATTCGCAGCAGCTGAGTCCTGCCTT-3′. The first primer introduced aSalI second site at the 5′ end of the cDNA, and the second primer added an EcoRI site at the 3′ end of cDNA. The 5′ end nucleotide sequence of CHOP was also adjusted by primer design so that the CHOP cDNA was in the right reading frame of the Gal-4 DNA binding domain. After cleavage, the PCR product was cloned into the SalI and EcoRI sites of the pBD-Gal4 yeast vector. The library was used to screen for CHOP binding partners following the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). Positive yeast clones were selected by prototrophy for histidine and expression of β-galactosidase. Yeast DNA was recovered and transformed into E. coli. Plasmids containing cDNA clones were identified by restriction mapping and were further characterized by DNA sequencing. Subsequent two-hybrid interaction was carried out with the positive and negative controls, including plasmids containing the Gal4 DNA- binding (pBD-Gal4) and Gal4 activation (pAD-Gal4) domains in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain SFY526. For in vitro transcription and translation, fte-1 cDNA fused with Gal-4 activation domain was cleaved from the pAD-GAL4 vector with HindIII and SalI and subcloned into the same sites of the pSP72 vector (Promega). Sp6 polymerase was used forin vitro transcription and translation assays according to the manufacturer's procedure. For expression of CHOP protein inE. coli, BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were introduced at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA, respectively, by PCR using the following two primers, 5′-TTAAGGGATCCCAGCTGAGTCCCTG-3′ and 5′-TTCGGAATTCCTATGTGCAAGCCGA-3′. The PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI and was cloned into the pTrc-His expression vector (Invitrogen) in the reading frame. Therefore, CHOP was expressed as a His-tagged protein. For mammalian cell expression of CHOP, anSspI/EcoRI fragment containing CHOPcDNA from the pTrc.His vector was blunted using mung bean nuclease and was subcloned into the SmaI site of pSVK3 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under the transcriptional control of SV40 early promotor. The orientation of the insert was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequence analysis. In order to express fte-1 in the mammalian cells, the 5′-untranslated region of rat fte-1 and one start codon (ATG) was added to the 5′ end of mouse fte-1 cDNA by PCR using following primers, 5′-GGGAGTACTAGTGGGTCTCAGAGCGGCACCATGGCGGTCGGCAAGCAAGAACAACAAG-3′ and SP6 primer 5′-GATATCACAGTGGATTTA-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pZeoSV vector (Invitrogen) for eukaryotic expression under the transcriptional control of SV40 promotor and enhancer with Zeocin resistance as a selection marker. Polyclonal antisera recognizing FTE/S3a or ribosomal protein S26 were raised in rabbits or goats by immunization with the corresponding ribosomal proteins purified from rat liver ribosomes by a combination of carboxymethylcellulose chromatography, reversed phase liquid chromatography, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. From the sera, monospecific antibodies were prepared by immunosorption to the purified ribosomal proteins immobilized to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (33.Lutsch G. Stahl J. Kargel H.J. Noll F. Bielka H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 140-150PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antisera recognizing His-CHOP were prepared by Organon Teknika using antigen supplied by us. The polyclonal antibody was affinity purified using His-CHOP as the ligand covalently linked to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad). 35S-Labeled proteins were generated with TNT SP6 polymerase-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Five μl of the 50-μl translation mixture was used for immunoprecipitation. In vitro translation products were combined with 250 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.25 mm dithiothreitol) and precleared by addition of 10 μl of preimmune rabbit serum. After the mixture containing preimmune serum was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, 10 μl of immunoprecipitin (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added, and the mixture was incubated for another hour. Nonspecific immune complexes were pelleted by slow speed centrifugation and discarded. The supernatant was mixed with 3 μl of bacterially expressed CHOP (6.0 μg), anti-CHOP antibody, and immunoprecipitin. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed four times with washing buffer (same as binding buffer except containing 200 mmNaCl). The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of binding buffer, and the slurry was heated to 100 °C for 5 min in a water bath. After centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 2 min, the supernatant was carefully removed, and 200 μl of binding buffer was added. Another round of immunoprecipitation was carried out as described above. After extensive washing, the precipitate was fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Rauscher cells were harvested by centrifugation and were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. A 5-fold volume excess/packed-cell pellet of Dignam buffer A (34.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) was added to the pellets that were gently resuspended by low speed vortexing. The mixture was incubated at 0 °C for 10 min and was centrifuged at low speed in a microcentrifuge followed by vigorous vortexing. The nuclei were pelleted; the supernatant was removed, and four original cell pellet volumes of Dignam buffer C were added. The nuclei were lysed by 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (type B pestle). The lysate was shaken in a microcentrifuge tube on a rotating shaker for 30 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. The protein concentration was determined with a Micro BCA kit (Pierce). For determination of the relative apparent molecular weights of FTE/S3a and CHOP, 100 μg of both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12:0.32% acrylamide/bisacrylamide polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was cut in half so that each half of the membrane contained a lane of cytoplasmic protein and a lane of nuclear protein with prestained molecular weight standards on the right side of each half-membrane. Anti-CHOP and anti-FTE/S3a antibodies were used to detect CHOP and FTE/S3a on each membrane half, respectively. For studies to determine whether CHOP and FTE/S3a interact within the ribosomal particle, 300 μg of cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins were used for immunoprecipitation by anti-CHOP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) after clearing with preimmune rabbit serum. The immunoprecipitation pellets were mixed with reducing SDS sample buffer, were boiled for 4 min, were centrifuged for 3 min, and were immediately put on ice. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 15:0.4% acrylamide/bisacrylamide SDS gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, 0.45 μm) for 2 h in a mini-gel protein transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) in regular transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris-HCl, and 20% methanol). The membrane was blocked with PBST (PBS + 0.5% Tween) buffer containing 5% non-fat dry milk powder. After blocking, the membrane was incubated in the presence of anti-S26 antibody (20 μg/ml) overnight. The membrane was washed twice for 5 min each and once for 15 min, separately. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody was added. The blot was allowed to incubate for 1 h, and the membrane was washed three times for 10 min each. Chemiluminescent detection of the bound complex was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Pierce). The day before transfection, Rauscher cells were plated at the density of 105 cells/ml transfection in 10-cm tissue culture dishes in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection was conducted by electroporation using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). In most case, cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection. For stable transfection, harvested cells were divided into four tissue culture dishes and were cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 250 μg/Zeocin ml for 2 weeks. During this time, fresh medium containing Zeocin was added every 2 days. Individual colonies were pipetted into 96-well plates. Transfection efficiency was analyzed by determining the galactosidase activity according to supplier's procedure (Invitrogen). The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS solution and once with methionine-deficient RPMI, 10% FCS medium. Cells were resuspended in methionine-deficient medium at the density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated for 30 min to deplete the excess methionine. [35S]Methionine (NEN Life Science Products) was added (0.5 mCi/ml), and the cells were incubated 1 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended directly in the lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg aprotinin, 10 μg leupeptin. Cells were incubated in lysis buffer, gently rocked for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. To carry out the two-hybrid screen, CHOP was fused with the Gal-4 DNA binding domain in a pBD-Gal4 vector. This bait plasmid was co-transformed into cells with a Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cell cDNA library fused with the Gal-4 activation domain in a pAD-Gal4 vector. Ten positive clones were obtained from 3 × 106 transformants screened. To determine the specificity of the interaction, plasmids containing activation domain fusion proteins from the putative positive clones were co-transformed into yeast with Gal-4 binding domainCHOP and control heterologous baits. Nine clones were found to interact with the Gal-4 DNA domain protein containing CHOP but not with the DNA vector alone or with the heterologous bait. DNA sequence analysis revealed that two of the nine clones encoded the mouse homologue of rat v-fos transformation effector-1 gene (fte-1) (27.Kho C.J. Zarbl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2200-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), also known as ribosomal protein S3a (28.Metspalu A. Rebane A. Hoth S. Pooga M. Stahl J. Kruppa J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 119: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Within the coding region, the mouse and rat nucleotide sequences are 97% identical. The deduced amino acid sequences are identical. Data base searches did not identify sequences with significant similarity to the other positive clones. We demonstrated the interaction of the CHOP and FTE/S3a proteinsin vitro. The fte/S3a Gal-4 DNA binding domain clones were subcloned into a pSP72 vector containing the SP6 promotor.35S-Labeled protein prepared by in vitrotranscription and translation was tested for association with bacterially expressed recombinant CHOP protein. Immunoprecipitation with anti-CHOP antibodies showed that CHOP bound to the GAL4-FTE/S3a fusion protein (Fig. 1). Next, we confirmed the in vivo interaction of FTE/S3a and CHOP in erythroid cells. Rauscher cells were co-transfected transiently with fte/S3a and CHOP cDNAs and incubated with [35S]methionine. Lysates were prepared and were incubated either with anti-FTE/S3a or with anti-CHOP antibodies followed by precipitation with protein A-agarose, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. Incubation with either antibody resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of both CHOP and FTE/S3a as a closely spaced doublet (Fig. 2). We also confirmed the identities of the co-immunoprecipitated proteins and demonstrated both cytosolic and nuclear co-localization of FTE/S3a and CHOP. Non-transfected Rauscher cells were lysed, and cytosolic and nuclear protein fractions were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). CHOP was detected in both the cytosolic and, in a significantly higher amount, in the nuclear fraction. It migrated as a single, well resolved species aligned precisely with the 29-kDa molecular mass standard. A trace amount of a higher molecular weight cross-reacting protein was also seen. FTE/S3a was also detected in both the cytosolic and the nuclear fractions but in approximately equal amounts. It also migrated as a single, well resolved species that, in contrast to CHOP, was slightly (∼2 mm) ahead of the 29-kDa molecular mass standard, thus identifying CHOP and FTE/S3a as the upper and lower members, respectively, of the closely spaced doublet seen in Fig. 2. In another experiment we established a Rauscher cell line stably overexpressing fte/S3a. Cells were lysed and the cytosolic fraction was incubated with anti-CHOP antibody followed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis with anti-FTE/S3a antibody (Fig. 4). Cytosolic fractions were also subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Anti-FTE/S3a antibodies identified FTE/S3a in the cytosolic fractions and in the immunoprecipitate obtained with the anti-CHOP antibodies again running slightly ahead of the 29-kDa standard. The evidence for co-localization of CHOP and FTE/S3a in both the nucleus and the cytosol prompted us to ask whether the interaction might also occur within the ribosome itself. Immunoelectron microscopy studies have mapped FTE/S3a to the surface of the small subunit and the 80 S ribosome (33.Lutsch G. Stahl J. Kargel H.J. Noll F. Bielka H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 140-150PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that if CHOP binds to FTE/S3a on the surface of the ribosome, immunoprecipitation with anti-CHOP antibody should result in the appearance of other ribosomal proteins in the immunoprecipitate, including proteins such as RPS26, which is located within the ribosomal particle rather than at its surface (33.Lutsch G. Stahl J. Kargel H.J. Noll F. Bielka H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 140-150PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Stahl J. Kobetz N.D. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1984; 9: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and is not known to interact with FTE/S3a. We prepared cytosolic and nuclear extracts of Rauscher cells and carried out an immunoprecipitation with anti-CHOP antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”). Then the immunoprecipitates, along with purified ribosomal total protein (containing rpS26) and Rauscher cell cytosolic lysate, were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose, and probing with anti-S26 antibody. As seen in Fig.5, S26 protein was detected readily in the control purified ribosomal protein fraction (Fig. 5, lane 1) and in the Rauscher cell cytosolic lysate (Fig. 5, lane 2). However, S26 was not detected in the anti-CHOP cytosolic immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5, lane 3) nor in the nuclear immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5, lane 4). Similar results were obtained in several repeat experiments. Occasionally, an extremely faint band was detected in the cytosolic immunoprecipitate. However, this was not seen regularly and may have represented a small amount of ribosomal contamination of the centrifuged immunoprecipitate pellet. Northern blot analysis showed that fte/S3a transcript is approximately 0.9 kilobase pairs, close to the size of the cDNA clones. The mRNA level was not induced by Epo or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (not shown). Since we had discovered previously that up-regulation ofCHOP enhanced hemoglobinization in response to Epo or Me2SO (25.Coutts M. Cui K. Davis K.L. Keutzer J.C. Sytkowski A.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 3369-3378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and since CHOP and FTE/S3a interact, we hypothesized that FTE/S3a might participate in regulating erythroid differentiation. To test this, Rauscher cells were transfected withfte/S3a. Transfection efficiency was monitored by transfection of β-galactosidase plasmid. Stable clones were selected by Zeocin resistance with the transfection of pZeoSV as the control. Cells from different independent transfections were incubated in the absence or presence of Epo or Me2SO for 48 h. Differentiation was quantified by benzidine staining for hemoglobin production (36.Rifkind R.A. Fibach E. Marks P.A. Murphy M.J. In Vitro Aspects of Erythropoiesis. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1978: 266Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, cultures of uninduced cells, whether transfected or non-transfected with fte/S3a,contained very few (<1%) hemoglobin-positive (Hb+) cells, as expected (Fig. 6, −/−). Non-transfected cells induced to differentiate with Epo (white bars) or Me2SO (black bars) were 34 and 49% Hb+, respectively (Fig. 6, +/−). In contrast, induced differentiation offte/S3a-transfected cells was reduced markedly to 8 and 7%, respectively (Fig. 6, +/FTE). This inhibition of differentiation in cells overexpressing fte/S3a was reversed partially by co-transfecting these overexpressing cells with an antisense fte/S3a construct transiently (17 and 29% Hb+, respectively) (Fig. 6, +/FTE/AS FTE). This degree of reversal was consistent with the observed transfection efficiency of 30–50%. Western blot analysis showed that the FTE/S3a protein concentration in the FTE/S3a-overexpressing cells was 480% that of the non-transfected cells. Transfection with an antisensefte/S3a construct reduced this to 170% that of the non-transfected cells (Fig. 7). These results suggested to us that increased formation of FTE/S3a-CHOP heterodimers in cells overexpressing fte/S3a might prevent endogenous CHOP from interacting with other proteins, including C/EBPs, interactions of which enhance erythroid differentiation. This was supported by the results of transiently overexpressing CHOPin the fte/S3a-transfected cells (Fig. 6, FTE/CHOP). SuchCHOP overexpression also resulted in partial reversal of the FTE/S3a inhibition of hemoglobinization (18 and 22% Hb+, respectively), similar to the results obtained with antisensefte/S3a. As observed by us previously (24.Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabaee A. Philipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), transient transfection with CHOP alone without fte/S3aoverexpression enhanced hemoglobinization significantly to 53 and 62% Hb+, respectively (Fig. 6, +/CHOP). Transfection with antisense fte/S3a alone (Fig. 6, +/AS FTE) had no significant effect.Figure 7FTE/S3a protein is reduced by transfecting cells with an antisense fte/S3a construct. 1st lane, normal Rauscher cells;"

A conserved N-terminal disulfide bond is necessary for sorting of chromogranins in neuroendocrine PC12 cells. Surprisingly, this disulfide bond is not necessary for sorting of chromogranins in endocrine GH4C1 cells. To investigate the sorting mechanism in GH4C1 cells, we made several mutant forms removing highly conserved N- and C-terminal regions of bovine chromogranin A. Removing the conserved N-terminal disulfide bond and the conserved C-terminal dimerization and tetramerization domain did not affect the sorting of chromogranin A to the regulated secretory pathway. In contrast, removing the C-terminal 90 amino acids of chromogranin A caused rerouting to the constitutive secretory pathway and impaired aggregation properties as compared with wild-type chromogranin A. Since this mutant was sorted to the regulated secretory pathway in PC12 cells, these results demonstrate that chromogranins contain independent N- and C-terminal sorting domains that function in a cell type-specific manner.

Secretory proteins that are not stored in secretory granules are secreted directly by the constitutive secretory pathway, originating in the trans-Golgi network (2.Kelly R.B.

J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Thus, granule storage of secretory proteins appears to require two sorting steps (sorting for entry and sorting by retention; Ref. 3.Shennan K.I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that refine the final complement of stored proteins. Several mechanisms have been proposed for sorting of secretory proteins into secretory granules. These sorting mechanisms include low pH and/or calcium-induced aggregation (6.Gorr S.U. Kumarasamy R.

Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Normant E. Loh Y.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). While chromogranins aggregate at low pH and in the presence of calcium, this aggregation is neither necessary nor sufficient for sorting in PC12 cells (12.Glombik M.M. Kromer A. Salm T. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16.Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, a narrowly defined aggregation domain is necessary for sorting of pro-atrial natriuretic factor to the regulated secretory pathway in AtT-20 cells (17.Canaff L. Brechler V. Reudelhuber T.L. Thibault G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9483-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that individual secretory proteins contain protein-specific sorting signals that interact with different cellular sorting mechanisms. It has long been assumed that regulated secretory proteins contain a single sorting domain that directs their sorting and storage in secretory granules (see, e.g., Ref. 18.Gorr S.U. Darling D.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, we have recently found that the N-terminal disulfide bond that is necessary for sorting of chromogranin B in neuroendocrine PC12 cells (14.Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) is not required for sorting in endocrine GH4C1 cells (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that, in endocrine cells, the signals and mechanisms used for sorting of regulated secretory proteins into secretory granules are different from those used in neuroendocrine cells. These endocrine-specific sorting signals remain unknown. Chromogranin A (CgA) is a regulated secretory protein that is stored in secretory granules of both endocrine and neuroendocrine cells. To identify potential signals for sorting of CgA in endocrine cells, we prepared three mutants of bovine CgA. These mutants were designed to delete separately: 1) the N-terminal disulfide bond and dimerization domain (19.Thiele C. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1223-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), 2) the C-terminal domain involved in dimerization and tetramerization (20.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8816-8822Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17041-17046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and 3) a putative calcium-aggregation/condensation domain. The latter was based on our observation that an approximately 8-kDa peptide of CgA is necessary for calcium-induced aggregation at acidic pH (22.Gorr S.U. Shioi J. Cohn D.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E247-E254PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that the C-terminal domain of CgA is necessary for both sorting and for low pH/calcium-induced aggregation in GH4C1 cells. In contrast, it is shown that the C-terminal domain of CgA is not necessary for sorting to the regulated secretory pathway in PC12 cells. Together with previous results (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these findings show that CgA contains two independent cell-specific sorting domains.

BioMax film was from Eastman Kodak Co. The antiserum to bovine CgA was kindly provided by Dr. David V. Cohn (University of Louisville, Louisville, KY). GH4C1 rat pituitary somatomammotroph cells were cultured in medium containing 42.5% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 42.5% Ham's F-10 medium, and 15% gelding equine serum. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% gelding equine serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Both cultures were supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and cultured at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For each experiment, GH4C1 cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline, (pH 7.2) containing 0.2 g/liter EDTA, while PC12 cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin in DMEM. The cells were plated in culture medium at 5 × 105 cells/well in six-well culture plates (5 × 104 cells/cm2). The expression plasmids for wild-type bovine CgA, CgAΔCC (missing the disulfide bond), and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) were described previously (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23.Gorr S.U. Moore Y.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CgA341 and CgA387 were prepared from wild-type CgA by site-directed mutagenesis with primers from Genosys Biotechnologies Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). The selection primer (5′-ACTCTGGGGATCGATATGACCGACC-3′) changed the BstBI site of pcDNA3 to a unique ClaI site, whereas the mutagenesis primer for CgA341 (5′-GAGGAAGAGTAGGATCCCGACCGC-3′) added a stop codon at position 342 of the mature protein. In CgA341, amino acids 339 and 341 were changed from glutamic acid and aspartic acid to glutamine and glutamic acid, respectively, during DNA manipulation. The mutagenesis primer for CgA387 (5′-GCGCGGCTAGCCGGATCCGAAGAAGGA-3′) added a stop codon at position 388. Both mutagenic primers also added aBamHI restriction endonuclease site for screening. The identity of the CgA mutants was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All clones were tested for expression by transient transfection of GH4C1 cells. Expression and secretion of CgA, CgAΔCC, CgA341, and CgA387 were confirmed by immunoblotting of secretion media, while SEAP expression and secretion were confirmed by alkaline phosphatase activity. Transfections of GH4C1 and PC12 cells were performed as described previously (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pcDNA3/CgA, pcDNA3/CgAΔCC, pcDNA3/CgA341, pcDNA3/CgA387, pcDNA3/SEAP plasmids (and pcDNA3 as a control) were used to transiently transfect GH4C1 or PC12 cells in separate experiments. Prior to secretion or fractionation experiments, the cells were treated with 5 mm sodium butyrate for 20 h. These were performed as described previously (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, GH4C1 and PC12 cells cultured in six-well plates were washed with 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer (KRH) (129 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.8 mm KCl, 2.8 mm glucose, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2, (pH 7.4)) for 15 and then 30 min. Stimulated secretion of GH4C1 cells was measured in 1 ml of KRH buffer containing a secretagogue mixture defined below. Unstimulated secretion was measured in the absence of secretagogues. For experiments using cycloheximide treatment, GH4C1 cells were hormone-treated as described (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CgA and CgA341 were transiently expressed in hormone-treated GH4C1 cells. The cells were treated for 4 × 30 min with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide prior to secretion experiments. Stimulated and unstimulated secretion media were then collected for 30 min in the presence of cycloheximide. Secretion was stimulated in 1 ml of KRH buffer supplemented with 50 mmKCl, 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and 1 μm Bay K8644. Unstimulated cells received 50 mm NaCl and 100 nm 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate. Secretion of CgA, CgA341, and SEAP transiently expressed in PC12 cells was measured for 30 min in either 1 ml of KRH (unstimulated) or in low salt KRH (NaCl reduced to 79 mm, no CaCl2) supplemented with 50 mm KCl and 2 mmBaCl2 (stimulated). For GH4C1 and PC12 cells, the secretion media were collected and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and Tween 20 and PMSF were added to final concentrations of 0.3% and 1 mm, respectively. EDTA was added to the GH4C1 medium to a concentration of 5 mm. The media containing secreted CgA and CgA mutants were heated at 100 °C for 10 min and centrifuged to remove denatured proteins. Soluble proteins in the supernatant were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting. To quantitate SEAP secretion, aliquots of secretion medium were diluted in KRH (1:50 for GH4C1 cells or 1:10 for PC12 cells) and alkaline phosphatase activity was determined with the Phospha-Light alkaline phosphatase assay kit and quantitated using a Berthold LB 9501 luminometer (Wallac, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Transiently transfected GH4C1 cells in six well plates were pulse-labeled (2 h, 37 °C) with 50 μCi/well l-[4,5-3H]leucine (specific activity 154 Ci/mMol) in 1 ml/well KRH. Following the 2-h pulse, cells were washed briefly with 1 ml of KRH containing 2 mmleucine and then chased for seven consecutive 30-min intervals at 37 °C in 1 ml of KRH containing 2 mm leucine. The medium was replaced with fresh medium after each 30-min interval. Following the collection of basal secretion media for 3.5 h, the cells were incubated for 30 min in 1 ml of KRH containing 2 mmleucine, 50 mm KCl, 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and 1 μm Bay K8644 and secretion medium was collected. The secretagogue mix was used to ensure optimal stimulated secretion of stored proteins (24.Hinkle P.M. Scammell J.G. Shanshala E.D.I. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3503-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Immediately after each 30-min chase, secretion media samples were collected and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes and frozen until immunoprecipitated. CgA immunoreactivity was immunoprecipitated in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) using CgA antibody that had been bound to protein A-Sepharose. Only a negligible amount of CgA was not immunoprecipitated by this procedure, as revealed by a second immunoprecipitation of the supernatant fractions. GH4C1 cells transiently transfected as described above were scraped from the plates into 1 ml of KRH containing 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm N α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 5 mm EDTA. The cells from duplicate wells were combined and lysed by scraping and repeated passage through a 26-gauge hypodermic needle. Each sample was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, frozen, and thawed twice followed by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 16,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of the above buffer with or without 1% Triton X-100 and recentrifuged. After this centrifugation, the supernatant (soluble fraction) was transferred to a new tube and the pellet remaining was washed with 100 μl of KRH containing the protease inhibitors and recentrifuged. After washing, the pellet (membrane fraction) and the soluble fraction from above were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and immunoblotting. Transiently transfected GH4C1 cells from duplicate 35-mm culture wells were lysed, as described above, in 750 μl of ice cold 0.3 m sucrose, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant fraction was layered on top of 750 μl of ice-cold 0.6 m sucrose, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The 0.3 m and 0.6m sucrose fractions and the pellet were adjusted to 1 ml total volume and 0.3% Tween 20. Total protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid in 0.3–0.45 m sucrose and analyzed by immunoblotting. The aggregation experiments were performed as described previously (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secretion medium containing SEAP was centrifuged, but not heated, before use. SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% gels (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were visualized by immunoblotting (26.Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5911) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting (Western and dot) was conducted as described (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The blocked membranes were incubated for 1–2 h with the appropriate polyclonal antibody (anti-bovine CgA 1:20,000; anti-human placental alkaline phosphatase 1:1,000) in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) in the Tris-NaCl-Tween antibody dilution buffer with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1–2 h, developed with chemiluminescent substrate, and exposed to BioMax film. The quantitation of immunoblots was performed as described (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). -Fold stimulation was calculated as immunoreactive CgA in secretion medium from stimulated cells/immunoreactive CgA in secretion medium from unstimulated cells. -Fold stimulation was calculated for each individual experiment, and the mean ± S.E. was determined from two to eight experiments. The data were analyzed by Student's t test, or an ordinary analysis of variance with Student-Neuman-Keuls test; p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Chromogranins are highly conserved in both their N- and C-terminal regions. The N-terminal region is involved in sorting in PC12 cells but not in GH4C1 cells (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine what regions of CgA were necessary for sorting in GH4C1 cells, we prepared three CgA mutants: CgAΔCC (missing the conserved disulfide bond), CgA387 (missing the conserved C-terminal peptide that is involved in dimerization and tetramerization), and CgA341 (lacking the putative aggregation domain) (Fig. 1). These proteins were expressed in endocrine GH4C1 cells. Pulse-chase experiments were used to test the sorting of wild-type CgA and the three CgA mutants in GH4C1 cells. The cells were pulse-labeled for 2 h, after which chase media were collected every 30 min until the addition of secretagogues to stimulate granule release at 3.5 h of chase (Fig. 2). Wild-type CgA, CgAΔCC, and CgA387 each exhibited basal secretion that decreased over the first 2 h of chase incubation, consistent with the release of some non-stored CgA. Upon the addition of secretagogues, secretion of these three forms of CgA was strongly stimulated, consistent with granule storage (Fig. 2, compare the 3.5-h and 4.0-h time points). In contrast, the CgA341 deletion mutant was completely secreted without stimulation and did not exhibit stimulated secretion (Fig. 2). These results suggested that CgA341 was secreted only constitutively in GH4C1 cells. Therefore, the secretion and subcellular localization of this mutant were further analyzed. The secretion of total, immunoreactive wild-type CgA and CgA341 were compared in hormone treated cells (Fig.3). Hormone treatment stimulates prolactin granule formation in GH4C1 cells (27.Scammell J.G. Burrage T.G. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28.Gorr S.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3575-3580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We used the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to create a block of basal protein secretion (23.Gorr S.U. Moore Y.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29.Sachs E. Jamieson J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G257-G266PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions only proteins that were stored in secretory granules prior to cycloheximide treatment would be available for stimulated secretion (23.Gorr S.U. Moore Y.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29.Sachs E. Jamieson J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G257-G266PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, secretion of wild-type CgA was stimulated 4.7-fold whereas secretion of CgA341 was only stimulated 2.0-fold under these conditions (Fig. 3). These findings suggested that, unlike wild-type CgA, which was sorted to the regulated secretory pathway, CgA341 was preferentially secreted by the constitutive or constitutive-like secretory pathway in GH4C1 cells. Regulated secretory proteins are stored in dense core secretory granules, while constitutive secretory proteins are located in lighter Golgi and transport vesicles. To determine if wild-type CgA and CgA341 are located in different membrane compartments, a membrane pellet was prepared from transiently transfected GH4C1 cells. The membrane pellet was resuspended to gently disrupt the membrane, and the extent of CgA release was determined by immunoblotting. Wild-type CgA was efficiently retained in the membrane fraction (less than 20% released), while CgA341 was readily released from the membrane fraction (75% released) (Fig. 4). The differential release of the two forms of CgA suggested that they are located in different membrane compartments. The near complete extraction of both forms of CgA with the addition of Triton X-100 showed that the proteins are enclosed in a membrane compartment, as opposed to forming an insoluble aggregate (Fig. 4). CgAΔCC and CgA387 were released similarly to wild-type CgA (not shown), consistent with their co-localization in secretory granules with wild-type CgA. To further examine the subcellular localization of these proteins, a 0.3 and 0.6 m sucrose step gradient was used. Postnuclear supernatants were prepared in 0.3 m sucrose and then centrifuged on a 0.6 m sucrose cushion. The migration of CgA from 0.3 to 0.6 m sucrose was determined as an indicator of granule localization. Fig. 5shows that only 10% of CgA341 migrated to the denser sucrose solution, whereas 30% of wild-type CgA was located in this fraction. This distribution suggests that CgA341 is stored less efficiently in dense core secretory granules than wild-type CgA. The pellets that were collected following the sucrose gradient centrifugation contained 30% of both forms of CgA (data not shown). Regulated secretory proteins aggregate under the conditions of millimolar calcium concentrations and acidic pH that are found in the trans-Golgi network and secretory granules (e.g. Ref. 30.Demaurex N. Furuya W. D'Souza S. Bonifacino J.S. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2044-2051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and this aggregation has repeatedly been suggested to play a role in sorting of regulated secretory proteins. Interestingly, aggregation is neither necessary nor sufficient for sorting in PC12 cells (12.Glombik M.M. Kromer A. Salm T. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16.Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To test if the missorting of CgA341 in GH4C1 cells could be explained by a lack of aggregation, the sorting and aggregation of wild-type CgA, CgA341, and the constitutive secretory pathway marker SEAP (28.Gorr S.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3575-3580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were separately determined by immunoblotting (CgA) or alkaline phosphatase activity (SEAP). Fig. 6 shows that the sorting efficiency of wild-type CgA, CgA341, and SEAP is correlated with the aggregation efficiency of these proteins. The results reported so far demonstrate that, although GH4C1 cells require a C-terminal domain for sorting of CgA (this report), PC12 cells use an N-terminal sorting domain in chromogranin (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Glombik M.M. Kromer A. Salm T. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13.Kromer A. Glombik M.M. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14.Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To complete these data, we tested the sorting of CgA341 in PC12 cells. Sorting was assayed by immunoblotting of secretion medium collected in the presence or absence of secretagogues. Secretion of wild-type CgA and CgA341 were stimulated 47- and 65-fold, respectively. In contrast, the secretion of the constitutive secretory pathway marker SEAP was only stimulated 1.1-fold (Fig. 7). Thus, sorting of CgA341 was similar to that of wild-type CgA in these cells. The very high -fold stimulated secretions reported for wild-type CgA and CgA341 reflect the higher sorting efficiency of PC12 cells as compared with GH4C1 cells (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are due to the near absence of unstimulated secretion, as detected by Western blotting (Fig.7 A). Endogenous CgA is only present in low amounts in these cells and was not detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 7 A,CTRL). Chromogranin A contains two independent cell type-specific sorting signals: a conserved N-terminal disulfide bond, which was recently found to act as a sorting signal in neuroendocrine PC12 cells (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Glombik M.M. Kromer A. Salm T. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13.Kromer A. Glombik M.M. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14.Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal sorting domain that is necessary for sorting in endocrine GH4C1 cells (this report). Importantly, the C-terminal domain is not necessary for sorting in PC12 cells (this report; Ref. 31.Parmer R.J. Xi X.P. Wu H.J. Helman L.J. Petz L.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1042-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), while the N-terminal domain is not necessary for sorting in GH4C1 cells (this report; Ref. 11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the two sorting signals complement each other to allow sorting of CgA to the regulated secretory pathway in both endocrine and neuroendocrine cells. It was recently proposed that sorting-for-entry dominates in neuroendocrine cells while sorting-by-retention dominates in endocrine cells (4.Thiele C. Gerdes H.H. Huttner W.B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R496-R500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our current data now provide a molecular mechanism for this proposed sorting difference. The newly identified C-terminal sorting domain in CgA is necessary for calcium-induced condensation/aggregation of the protein. As used here, this includes local condensation of secretory proteins that is not necessarily receptor-mediated. Thus, this is the first evidence that calcium-induced aggregation plays a role in sorting of chromogranins. Such a mechanism had long been proposed to play a role in sorting or storage of chromogranins in secretory granules (6.Gorr S.U. Kumarasamy R. Dean W.L. Cohn D.V. Bone Miner. 1987; 2: 251-255PubMed Google Scholar), but recent evidence from PC12 cells actually suggested that aggregation was neither necessary nor sufficient for sorting to the regulated secretory pathway (12.Glombik M.M. Kromer A. Salm T. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16.Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Calcium-induced aggregation, however, appears to play a role in sorting in some other cell types. Pro-atrial natriuretic factor contains two amino acids (Glu-23 and Glu-24) that are both necessary for sorting and calcium-induced aggregation in AtT-20 cells (17.Canaff L. Brechler V. Reudelhuber T.L. Thibault G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9483-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In β-cells, pro-insulin is sorted to immature secretory granules but retention of the hormone in mature granules is enhanced after conversion of non-aggregating proinsulin to aggregating insulin (32.Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Together with the present data, these reports suggest that aggregation plays a cell-specific role in sorting and retention of regulated secretory proteins. Comparison of the sorting of total CgA and newly synthesized CgA suggests that CgA341 partially enters secretory granules (2–2.8-fold stimulation of total protein; see Figs. 3 and 6) but that this protein is not stored in mature granules (no stimulated secretion after 3.5-h chase period, Fig. 2). Instead, CgA341 appears to be secreted by the constitutive-like secretory pathway. This is consistent with the poor aggregation of CgA341 since aggregation is thought to play a role in sorting-by-retention in maturing secretory granules in endocrine cells (1.Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 3.Shennan K.I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 4.Thiele C. Gerdes H.H. Huttner W.B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R496-R500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Gorr S.U. Kumarasamy R. Dean W.L. Cohn D.V. Bone Miner. 1987; 2: 251-255PubMed Google Scholar). CgA contains two dimerization domains that have been proposed to play a role in sorting to the regulated secretory pathway: an N-terminal dimerization domain that includes the disulfide bond (19.Thiele C. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1223-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal dimerization/tetramerization domain (20.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8816-8822Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17041-17046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The data for CgAΔCC and CgA387 now show that loss of either dimerization domain does not prevent sorting of CgA to secretory granules in GH4C1 cells (Fig. 2). Additionally, the C-terminal dimerization domain is not necessary for sorting of CgA in PC12 cells (Fig. 7). We cannot formally exclude that some of the CgA341 is sorted by forming heterotypic N-terminally linked dimers with endogenous CgA (13.Kromer A. Glombik M.M. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19.Thiele C. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1223-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the very low expression levels of endogenous CgA (see control lanes of Fig. 7 A) makes this an unlikely explanation for the bulk sorting of overexpressed CgA341 in PC12 cells. Thus, the physiological function of these dimerization domains remains unclear. The N-terminal domain of CgA has been proposed to play a role in binding to granule membranes, but it is not clear how. We have previously noted that the N-terminal sorting domains of several regulated secretory proteins share similar secondary structures characterized by a hydrophobic domain that overlaps with an amphipathic α-helix (18.Gorr S.U. Darling D.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). While it has been proposed that this structure interacts directly with lipid domains in the granule membrane (10.Thiele C. Huttner W.B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), recent data suggest that this domain is not necessary for membrane binding of CgA in epithelial cells. 2U. Kühn and S.-U. Gorr, unpublished results. As an alternative to direct membrane binding, CgA may bind to membrane-associated proteins. It has recently been shown that POMC binds to membrane-bound carboxypeptidase E (9.Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). POMC exhibits an N-terminal hydrophobic domain similar to the one found in CgA (18.Gorr S.U. Darling D.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, this domain of POMC contains a disulfide bond that is necessary for sorting of POMC and binding to carboxypeptidase E (9.Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). While it is clear that CgA does not bind to carboxypeptidase E (11.Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,33.Cool D.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), CgA may bind to other receptor-like proteins that are included in granule membranes. The physiological significance of two independent sorting signals in CgA is not clear. It is possible that this is an adaptation to the widespread expression of chromogranins in most endocrine and neuroendocrine cells. Thus, the protein is equipped to enter secretory granules in cells that may exhibit different sorting mechanisms (4.Thiele C. Gerdes H.H. Huttner W.B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R496-R500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is of interest that, in a comparison of CgA sequences ranging from frog to man, the N- and C-terminal domains are the most highly conserved (34.Turquier V. Vaudry H. Jegou S. Anouar Y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4104-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An alternative, but not mutually exclusive, model is that the presence of multiple sorting signals is related to the physiological functions of CgA. The protein is a precursor for several biologically active peptides that play a role in the regulation of endocrine secretion. These peptides are located in the N-terminal region, central region, and the C-terminal region of CgA (35.Cohn D.V. Fasciotto B.H. Reese B.K. Zhang J.X. J. Nutr. 1995; 125 Suppl.: 2015S-2019SCrossref Google Scholar). The presence of multiple sorting signals may ensure that N-and C-terminal fragments of CgA are correctly sorted after cell type-specific proteolytic processing of CgA. As an example, processing of CgA by furin is thought to produce parastatin and CgA347 (35.Cohn D.V. Fasciotto B.H. Reese B.K. Zhang J.X. J. Nutr. 1995; 125 Suppl.: 2015S-2019SCrossref Google Scholar). This shortened form of CgA is similar to the CgA341 tested in this report. Since furin processing takes place in the trans-Golgi network, the processed protein would contain the N-terminal but not the C-terminal sorting domain. Thus, this processing could determine the further routing and processing of CgA in the secretory pathway in different cell types. This proposed mechanism is similar to the processing of egg-laying hormones in neurons ofAplysia and Lymnaea. In these cells, cleavage by furin or furin-like enzymes determines the intracellular localization of the processing products in individual cell types (36.Jung L.J. Kreiner T. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37.Klumperman J. Spijker S. van Minnen J. Sharp-Baker H. Smit A.B. Geraerts W.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7930-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike sorting of egg-laying hormones, which are sorted to different subcellular locations in individual cell types, the two sorting signals in CgA are used to reach equivalent secretory granules in different cell types.

https://openalex.org/W1972030154,"ROMK channels are inhibited by intracellular acidification. This pH sensitivity is related to several amino acid residues in the channel proteins such as Lys-61, Thr-51, and His-206 (in ROMK2). Unlike all other amino acids, histidine is titratable at pH 6–7 carrying a positive charge below pH 6. To test the hypothesis that certain histidine residues are engaged in CO2 and pH sensing of ROMK1, we performed experiments by systematic mutations of all histidine residues in the channel using the site-directed mutagenesis. There are two histidine residues in the N terminus. Mutations of His-23, His-31, or both together did not affect channel sensitivity to CO2. Six histidine residues are located in the C terminus. His-225, His-274, His-342, and His-354 were critical in CO2 and pH sensing. Mutation of either of them reduced CO2 and pH sensitivities by 20–50% and ∼0.2 pH units, respectively. Simultaneous mutations of all of them eliminated the CO2 sensitivity and caused this mutant channel to respond to only extremely acidic pH. Similar mutations of His-280 had no effect. The role of His-270 in CO2 and pH sensing is unclear, because substitutions of this residue with either a neutral, negative, or positive amino acid did not produce any functional channel. These results therefore indicate that histidine residues contribute to the sensitivity of the ROMK1 channel to hypercapnia and intracellular acidosis. ROMK channels are inhibited by intracellular acidification. This pH sensitivity is related to several amino acid residues in the channel proteins such as Lys-61, Thr-51, and His-206 (in ROMK2).

These results therefore indicate that histidine residues contribute to the sensitivity of the ROMK1 channel to hypercapnia and intracellular acidosis. 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid ROMK channels (Kir1.1 and Kir1.2), members in the inward rectifier K+ channel family, were first cloned in the kidney and have later been found in several organs including the central nervous system (1.Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 2.Zhou H. Tate S.S. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C809-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These K+ channels are believed to control K+ secretion in the renal tubular cells and membrane potential in excitable cells (3.Hebert S.C. Wang W.H. Wien. Klin. Wochenschr. 1997; 109: 471-476PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Wang W. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). ROMK channels have a relatively weak inward rectification allowing significant K+ currents in the outward direction and are subject to extensive modulations by second messengers, protein kinases, phospholipids, ATP, and other nucleotides (5.Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Another important modulator of the ROMK channels is proton. A decrease in intracellular pH strongly inhibits these channels (6.Tsai T.D. Shuck M.E. Thompson D.P. Bienkowski M.J. Lee K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1173-C1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Doi T. Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Schulte U. Brandle U. Weidemann S. Zenner H.P. Lang F. Ruppersberg J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Proton sensing in ROMK channels requires multiple sites or residues in the channel protein to interact with protons. A lysine residue (Lys-80 in ROMK1 or Lys-61 in ROMK2) in the N terminus of channel proteins plays a critical part in the channel sensitivity to intracellular pH. Mutation of this residue to methionine greatly reduces the pH sensitivity (8.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10.McNicholas C.M. MacGregor G.G. Islas L.D. Yang Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F972-F981PubMed Google Scholar). However, lysine is not titratable at a physiological pH range. Thus, how this lysine residue works in pH sensing is not fully understood. A nontitratable threonine residue at position 51 of ROMK2 is also involved in pH sensing (8.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Mutation of this threonine to a negatively charged residue enhances pH sensitivity, whereas switching it to a positive amino acid decreases the pH sensitivity (8.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Another residue related to pH sensing is histidine 206. Mutation of this residue to glycine enhances channel sensitivity to pH (10.McNicholas C.M. MacGregor G.G. Islas L.D. Yang Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F972-F981PubMed Google Scholar). Supporting multiple interaction sites in proton sensing are also recent studies showing that movements of protein domains in N and C termini occur during the recovery of ROMK1 channels from the inhibition by acidic pH (11.Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Two cysteine residues (Cys-49 and Cys-308) are critical players in the recovery, although they do not affect the channel inhibition per se (11.Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although these observations clearly demonstrate that multiple residues are involved in proton sensing in ROMK proteins, which one of them is the proton-binding site remains to be known.Unlike all other amino acids, histidine can be protonated at pH 6–7 (side chain pK 6.04) resulting in a positive charge at this residue with acidic pH. This may in turn cause alterations in protein conformation and channel activity. Indeed, there is experimental evidence indicating that histidine is a central player in the pH-dependent modulation of a number of ion channels, including KST1, connexin 43, GABA receptor, Kv2.1, and porin (12.Todt J.C. McGroarty E.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10479-10482Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13.Ek J.F. Delmar M. Perzova R. Taffet S.M. Circ.

In ROMK1, there is a total of eight histidine residues in the channel protein with two of them in the N terminus and the rest in the C terminus. To test the hypothesis that certain histidine residues are involved in CO2 and pH sensing of the ROMK1 channel, we performed experiments by systemic mutations of these histidine residues in the ROMK1 protein and studied channel response to CO2and pH. Our results indicate that His-225, His-274, His-342, and His-354 play a role in CO2 and pH sensing of the ROMK1 channel.MATERIALS AND METHODSFrogs, Xenopus laevis, were anesthetized by bathing in 0.3% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. A few lobes of ovaries were removed after a small abdominal incision (∼5 mm).Xenopus oocytes were treated with 2 mg/ml of collagenase (Type I, Sigma) in OR2 solution (82 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 90 min at room temperature. After washing, the oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C in ND-96 solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate with 100 mg/l geneticin added (pH 7.4).A vector for eukaryotic expression (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to express ROMK1 and Kir2.1 channels (1.Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 17.Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutations were carried out using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Quickchange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) based on thePfu polymerase chain reaction (18.Qu Z.Q. Zhu G.Y. Yang J. Cui N.R. Li Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13783-13789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The correct sequences in both subcloning and site-directed mutagenesis were confirmed with DNA sequencing. Systemic mutations were performed on each histidine residues in the ROMK1, in which these residues were substituted in order with a neutral (asparagine, glutamine, or alanine), acidic (aspartic acid or glutamic acid), and alkaline amino acids (lysine). After expressions of these mutant channels were confirmed in voltage clamp, their sensitivity to CO2 was tested.Whole-cell currents were studied on the oocytes 2–4 days after a cDNA injection (20–50 ng in 50 nl of H2O). Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed using an amplifier (Geneclamp 500, Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) at room temperature (∼25 °C). The extracellular solution contained: 96 mmKCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Cells were impaled using electrodes filled with 3 mKCl. Currents were recorded using electrodes with resistance of 0.4–0.6 MΩ, low pass-filtered (Bessel, 4-pole filter, 3 dB at 5 kHz), digitized at 5 kHz (12-bit resolution), and acquired using pClamp 6.0.3 (Axon Instruments) (18.Qu Z.Q.

Oocytes were accepted for further experiments only if they expressed large inward rectifying currents (>3 μA) with clear superimposed current traces in response to depolarizing command potentials.In a semi-closed recording chamber (BSC-HT, Medical System, Greenvale, NY), the oocytes were placed on a supporting nylon mesh, so that the perfusion solution bathed both the top and bottom surface of the oocytes (18.Qu Z.Q.

The perfusate and the superfusion gas entered the chamber from the inlet at one end and flowed out at the other end. There was a 3 × 15-mm gap on the top cover of this chamber, which served as the gas outlet and an access to the oocytes for recording microelectrodes. The perfusate contained 96 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). At baseline, the chamber was ventilated with atmospheric air. Exposure of the oocytes to CO2 was carried out by switching the superfusion air to a gas mixture containing CO2 balanced with 21% O2 and N2. The high solubility of CO2 resulted in an evident change in intra- or extracellular acidification as fast as 10 s in these oocytes. Current responses to CO2 were studied before, during (4–5 min), and after CO2 exposure. Extracellular acidification was done using a buffer containing 10 mmPIPES1 or HEPES. The pH of these solutions was titrated to the desired levels immediately before experiments. In intracellular acidification experiments, the bath solution contained 76 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 20 mm KHCO3 (pH titrated to 9.5). This solution was then bubbled with 15% CO2 for at least 30 min before recordings. The CO2 bubbling decreased the pH level in this perfusion solution to about 7.35.Patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (∼25 °C) as described previously (18.Qu Z.Q. Zhu G.Y.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5590-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, fire-polished patch pipettes (0.5–2 MΩ) were made from 1.2-mm borosilicate capillary glass (Sutter P-94/PC puller). Macroscopic currents were recorded from giant inside-out patches using pipettes (0.5–1.0 MΩ). Current records were low pass-filtered (2000 Hz, Bessel, 4-pole filter, −3 dB), digitized (10 kHz, 12 bit resolution), and stored on computer disc for later analysis (PCLAMP 6, Axon Instruments). Junction potentials between bath and pipette solutions were appropriately nulled before seal formation. Vitelline membranes of the oocytes were mechanically removed after exposing to hypertonic solution (400 mosM) for 5 min. The stripped oocytes were placed in a Petri dish containing regular bath solution. The solution applied to the bath and recording pipettes contained: 40 mm KCl, 75 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm potassium fluoride, 0.1 mmsodium vanadate, 10 mm potassium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ADP, 10 mm PIPES, 10 mm glucose, and 0.1 mm spermine (FVPP solution, pH 7.4). This solution was chosen after several others had been tested regarding channel rundown in excised patches. In a control experiment, we found that macroscopic currents recorded from giant inside-out patches were very well maintained showing less than 10% reduction over a 20-min period of recordings in such a bath solution. Data were further filtered (1000 Hz) with a Gaussian filter. Current amplitude was measured at −100 mV after averaging eight consecutive traces. Percentage changes in current amplitude with CO2and intracellular acidification were presented in these experiments.A parallel perfusion system was used to administer agents to patches at a rate of ∼1 ml/min with no dead space (18.Qu Z.Q.

Low pH was produced by exposing patches to the same internal FVPP solution that had been titrated to various pH levels using gluconic acid,N-methyl-d-glucamine, or KOH. Osmotic pressure was adjusted to ∼300 mosM after pH titration. No significant difference in single channel conductance was seen betweenN-methyl-d-glucamine and KOH titrations (18.Qu Z.Q. Zhu G.Y.

This is likely to be mediated by interactions of protons with the ROMK1 protein. We have demonstrated that four histidine residues in the C terminus of ROMK1 are involved in CO2/pH sensing.Inhibition of ROMK1 during HypercapniaPrevious studies have shown that certain unidentified Kir channels in the kidney are inhibited by hypercapnia (22.Wang W.H.

ROMK channels were cloned from the kidney and are known to be inhibited by a drop in intracellular pH (6.Tsai T.D. Shuck M.E. Thompson D.P. Bienkowski M.J. Lee K.S. Am. J.

This inhibition is mediated by a decrease in intracellular pH, as selective decrease intra- but not extracellular pH inhibits this channel in whole-cell recordings and excised patches. It is known that protons can affect K+ currents by directly acting on channel proteins or by involving another intermediate molecules such as polyamines (8.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The possibility of involving polyamines appears small, because both inward and outward rectifying currents are affected by CO2 and pH in ROMK1 and its mutants. Also, we do not believe that the proton-induced inhibition is mediated by second messengers and protein phosphorylations, because the inhibition is seen in cell-free membrane patches in which cytosol-soluble factors are largely washed out. Furthermore, there are inhibitors for phosphatases and phosphodiesterases in our intracellular solutions, so that the turnover of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation may not occur at least in our experimental periods of pH exposures (1–2 min). Thus, it is likely that the ROMK1 channel is inhibited by CO2 through interactions of intracellular protons with the channel protein.Proton Bindings to Titratable Residues in ROMK1Protons can affect protein conformation and activity via their interactions with amino acid residues in the peptide chain. The potential amino acid residues that may interact with protons in the ROMK1 channel have been examined (8.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9.Choe H. Zhou H. Palmer L.G. Sackin H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F516-F529PubMed Google Scholar, 10.McNicholas C.M. MacGregor G.G. Islas L.D. Yang Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F972-F981PubMed Google Scholar). In our current studies, we have revealed four histidine residues in the C terminus of ROMK1, which are likely to be the proton-binding sites. First, mutations of any of these residues significantly reduce channel sensitivity to CO2 and pH. Second, greater reductions in pH sensitivity are seen when more histidine residues are mutated. The channel with three or four histidines mutated generally becomes CO2-insensitive. Third, these effects of histidine mutations on channel sensitivities to CO2 and pH were observed when Lys-80 and Thr-70 were intact, two residues known to be responsible for pH sensing in the N terminus of the ROMK1. In addition, baseline currents after a replacement of these histidine residues with positive amino acids are significantly smaller than those with neutral amino acids. Because the expression density of these mutant channels was not determined, it is unclear whether this is a result of surface expression of the channels or protonation of these histidine residues. When all these four histidines are mutated, we have found that the H225N/H274K/H342Q/H354N channel completely loses its CO2 sensitivity. This is likely to result from the left shift of the pH titration curve in which this mutant channel does not respond to acidic pH unless it drops below pH 6.6 (Fig. 7 A). We have also realized that extremely acidic pH can still inhibit the mutant channel, implying that there may exist unidentified proton sensor(s). We believe that the His-270 may be one of them. This histidine is conserved among Kir channels. We have tried to mutate it to positive, negative, or neutral amino acids but did not see any functional expression. Because another conserved histidine residue His-225 is involved in pH sensing, it is possible that the His-270 also has the proton-binding capability.The His-225 is located in the corresponding position of His-206 in ROMK2. Mutation of the latter histidine to glycine (H2O6G) has been shown to enhance pH sensitivity (10.McNicholas C.M. MacGregor G.G. Islas L.D. Yang Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F972-F981PubMed Google Scholar). In our current studies, we have mutated it to another neutral and polar amino acid asparagine and found that the H225N mutant became more sensitive to CO2 and pHi. In addition, we have realized that the H225N mutant loses most of its inward rectification. This is not a result of leaky membranes, because whole-cell currents are strongly inhibited by CO2 with clear inward rectification seen during the inhibition. Hence, the His-225 may be involved in the regulation of inward rectification in the ROMK1, as demonstrated recently on the His-216 in the Kir6.2 channel, which however apparently works in an opposite way (25.Baukrowitz T. Tucker S.J. Schulte U. Benndorf K. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations of the His-225 to positive or negative amino acid suppress channel sensitivities to CO2 and pH. What causes the different effects of these mutations is unclear. It is possible that this residue is normally engaged in the inward rectification. This engagement may limit the availability of the protein segment around this residue for the channel inhibition by intracellular protons. Mutation of this residue to a noncharged amino acid may lead to a release of this engagement allowing it to contribute to the channel inhibition during hypercapnia and intracellular acidification.Fakler et al. (8.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have shown that Lys-80 in ROMK1 is crucial in the pH-mediated channel inhibition. Mutation of this lysine residue to methionine virtually eliminates the channel sensitivity to pHi (8.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10.McNicholas C.M. MacGregor G.G. Islas L.D. Yang Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F972-F981PubMed Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies have raised a question as to whether the Lys-80 is the only proton-binding site responsible for ROMK1 channel inhibition. First, several other residues are also involved in pH sensing in ROMK channels, such as Thr-51 and His-206 in ROMK2 (9.Choe H. Zhou H. Palmer L.G. Sackin H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F516-F529PubMed Google Scholar, 10.McNicholas C.M. MacGregor G.G. Islas L.D. Yang Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F972-F981PubMed Google Scholar) and His-225, His-274, His-342, and His-354 in ROMK1 as shown in the present study. Second, pH sensing in ROMK1 channel requires movements of both the N and C termini, in which structures other than the Lys-80 are required for the pH sensing (11.Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Multiple interaction sites of protons with the channel protein seem to be needed to produce such a large scale of movements, as has been demonstrated in the pH-dependent gating of the KcsA K+ channel (26.Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Third, the high Hill coefficient (h > 3) for pH-dependent inhibition of ROMK channels suggests the existence of multiple proton-binding sites (8.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9.Choe H. Zhou H. Palmer L.G. Sackin H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F516-F529PubMed Google Scholar, 10.McNicholas C.M. MacGregor G.G. Islas L.D. Yang Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F972-F981PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, lysine has a pK value of 10.8 in its side chain and may not be titratable at physiological pH levels such as during an exposure to 5–15% CO2. Although it has been postulated that Thr-51 and other unidentified residues might be responsible for lowering the pK point of this lysine residue (Lys-61) in ROMK2 (8.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9.Choe H. Zhou H. Palmer L.G. Sackin H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F516-F529PubMed Google Scholar), there is still a lack of information indicating that this lysine is indeed protonated at near physiological pH levels.If the Lys-80 is not the only proton-binding site, then how can we explain the phenomenon that the K80M mutant ROMK1 becomes pH-insensitive? Although a number of amino acid residues in the ROMK channels are involved in the pH sensing, clearly none of them has an effect as potent as the Lys-80. For instance, we have found that channel sensitivity to 15% CO2 disappears in the K80M mutant with or without histidine mutations (Fig. 4). Because mutations of all other titratable and nontitratable residues diminish but not abolish the pH sensitivity in the mutant channels, it is possible that the Lys-80 does not work in parallel with other residues that are related to pH sensing. Instead, this lysine residue seems to act as a common final path or a gate in the modulation of the channel activity by other residues. The Lys-80 is located in an area in which several important channel modulations take place. For example, the presence of a threonine residue in this area makes the Kir2.3 channel sensitive to protein kinase C modulation. Introducing this threonine to a Kir2.1 channel that does not own this threonine in its wild type enables a PKC sensitivity in the mutant channel (27.Zhu G. Qu Z. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11643-11647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This threonine is also important in the pH sensitivity of the Kir2.3 channel, despite the fact that it is not titratable at all (18.Qu Z.Q. Zhu G.Y. Yang J. Cui N.R. Li Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 19"

Early analysis of GABP binding to the herpes simplex virus immediate early promoter indicated that GABP forms predominantly a heterotetrameric complex composed of two α and two β subunits (1.LaMarco K.

The results of gel filtration and preparative ultracentrifugation of highly purified recombinant GABPα and GABPβ proteins were further interpreted to support a model depicting GABP as a stable heterotetrameric complex in solution, suggesting that this complex binds as a single unit to DNA (1.LaMarco K.

Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The ability to form the heterotetrameric complex has been shown to be necessary for GABP-dependent transcription (20.Sawada J. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21.Gugneja S. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, modulation of GABP tetramer formation represents a potentially important means of regulating GABP-dependent transcription.We have previously shown that GABP-dependent transcription initiator activity required two PEA3/EBSs, and the highest activity was achieved with two sites positioned on the same face of the DNA helix (23.Yu M. Yang X.-Y. Schmidt T. Chinenov Y. Martin M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29060-29067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24.Sucharov C. Basu A. Carter R.S. Avadhani N.G.

Since the ability to activate transcription was previously shown to be dependent on heterotetramer complex formation, these results favored the stable GABP heterotetramer complex model. However, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with DNA probes containing only a single PEA3/EBS detected a complex consistent with the mobility of the GABPαβ heterodimer (23.Yu M. Yang X.-Y.

In contrast, a probe with two PEA3/EBSs formed two complexes, one co-migrating with the GABPαβ complex observed on a single PEA3/EBS and a slower migrating complex identified as GABPα2β2heterotetramer. These observations are consistent with the notion that GABP binds to a single PEA3/EBS only as a heterodimer, and requires two or more PEA3/EBSs to bind DNA as a heterotetramer. Therefore, if GABP forms a stable heterotetrameric complex in solution, then dissociation of this complex would be required upon binding to a single PEA3/EBS. Alternatively, GABP may form a stable heterodimer, or may exist in heterodimer-heterotetramer equilibrium that, at concentrations typically found in EMSA assays, favors the GABPαβ heterodimer. Therefore, prior interaction of a GABPαβ heterodimer complex with DNA containing two PEA3/EBS may be required for successful assembly of a transcriptionally competent GABPα2β2heterotetramer.To address the mechanism of GABP assembly and the role of DNA binding in this process, we have utilized EMSAs and analytical ultracentrifugation. In this report we show that GABP exists exclusively as a stable heterodimeric complex (GABPαβ). Even at exceedingly high concentrations little or no significant quantities of GABP heterotetramer complex is observed. These observations support the hypothesis that GABP exists as a stable heterodimer in solution which assembles into the heterotetrameric complex upon binding to target DNA containing two PEA3/EBSs. We further demonstrate that heterotetramer DNA binding is stabilized by positioning the two PEA3/EBSs on the same face of the DNA helix, and that the two motifs can be separated by up to three helical turns. These results are consistent with our earlier results demonstrating that GABP-dependent initiators were most efficient when two PEA3/EBSs were positioned on the same face of the DNA helix, and confirms the importance of the GABP heterotetramer complex in transcription initiator and activator activities of this important regulatory factor (23.Yu M.

These results suggest (i) that GABP α and β subunits form a stable heterodimer in solution with an estimatedK d less than 10−8m, and (ii) that, under our experimental conditions, no GABPα2β2 heterotetramer is observed in solution. Our estimation for a GABPαβ dissociation constant is consistent with the apparent K d determined by Suzukiet al. (30.Suzuki F. Goto M. Sawa C. Ito S. Watanabe H. Sawada J. Handa H. J. Biol.

Our results are also consistent with EMSA experiments suggesting that efficient heterotetramer formation in the absence of any exogenous regulatory influences occurs only on DNA with two or more PEA3/EBSs (Fig. 1).GABPαβ heterodimers assemble into the heterotetramer complex on DNA containing two PEA3/EBSs separated by as many as 4.0 helical turns (Fig. 2).2 The stability of the heterotetramer complex is greatly affected by the spacing between PEA3/EBSs such that, stability is enhanced on DNAs containing two PEA3/EBSs positioned on the same face of the DNA helix. These results are consistent with our previous data showing that GABP-dependent initiator activity is enhanced when two PEA3/EBSs are positioned on the same face of the DNA helix (23.Yu M. Yang X.-Y.

Similarly, GABPβ isoforms or mutants lacking the COOH-terminal homodimerization domain are reportedly unable to promote heterotetramer complex formation and fail to activate transcription of linked promoters (20.Sawada J.

The demonstration that heterotetramer complex stability correlates with GABP-dependent initiator activity further advances the notion that the heterotetramer complex is the functionally active form of GABP.The NH2-terminal deletion mutant of GABPα (GABPαcQ) forms significant amounts of heterotetramer complex even on DNA with a single PEA3/EBS. This finding suggests that the NH2 terminus of GABPα may interfere with heterotetramer complex formation. In agreement with this observation, the concentration distribution of a GABPαcQ/GABPβ equimolar mixture best fits a two-species associative model (K d = 0.17 ± 0.045 μm) with the molecular weight of the monomeric species equal to that of the His6-tagged GABPαcQ/GABPβ dimer. Therefore, we have demonstrated that GABP exists as a stable heterodimer, and that multiple PEA3/EBSs are required to promote formation of the heterotetramer complex. Our observation that the NH2-terminal portion of GABPα subunit exerts an inhibitory effect on GABPα2β2heterotetramer formation, and the observations of Shiijo et al. (31.Shiio Y. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1837-1845PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating the bcl3 enhances GABPα2β2 heterotetramer DNA binding, suggest that heterotetramer assembly is likely a regulated process that depends on specific promoter organization and/or specific regulatory proteins.Homo- and heterodimerization is often used by DNA-binding proteins in order to increase specificity and affinity for a cognate binding site. Although preassembled multiprotein complexes may possess higher overall affinity, they also will have higher nonspecific affinity for DNA, and at limiting concentrations, a protein complex could become kinetically trapped at random positions in the genome (34.Kohler J.J. Metallo S.J. Schneider T.L. Schepatz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 35.Pomerantz J.L. Wolfe S.A. Pabo C.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, a high “off-rate” of a monomeric protein, compared with the fully assembled complex, will ensure, that only high affinity sites will be occupied for a sufficient amount of time to enucleate the assembly of a higher order protein-DNA complex. This mechanism, designated as the “monomeric pathway,” has been proposed for the basic helix-loop-helix protein max, the bZIP transcription factor ATF-2, and the Arc repressor (34.Kohler J.J. Metallo S.J. Schneider T.L. Schepatz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36.Reintzeperis D. Johnson T. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the GABPα subunit is capable of DNA binding, in the presence of sufficient GABPβ, a highly stable heterodimer complex is formed. Thus, the GABPαβ heterodimer serves as a functional “monomeric” DNA binding entity. We have demonstrated that the presence of two PEA3/EBSs promotes further high affinity multimerization, suggesting that GABP assembly may proceed along the monomeric pathway. The GA-binding protein (GABP)1 is a heteromeric transcription factor that binds to GA-rich sequences ((A/C)GGAAG) in DNA, and contains two unrelated subunits belonging to the Ets (GABPα) and the Notch-Ankyrin repeat (GABPβ) families of proteins (1.LaMarco K.

Recently, an important role for GABP in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in brown adipose tissue was demonstrated (12.Villena J.A. Vinas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Giralt M. Villarroya F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The GABP-binding site first identified in the herpes simplex virus immediate early promoter contains two tandemly arranged PEA3/Ets-binding sites (EBS) (1.LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P.

A. 1988; 85: 5839-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Early analysis of GABP binding to the herpes simplex virus immediate early promoter indicated that GABP forms predominantly a heterotetrameric complex composed of two α and two β subunits (1.LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2.Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The results of gel filtration and preparative ultracentrifugation of highly purified recombinant GABPα and GABPβ proteins were further interpreted to support a model depicting GABP as a stable heterotetrameric complex in solution, suggesting that this complex binds as a single unit to DNA (1.LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2.Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The ability to form the heterotetrameric complex has been shown to be necessary for GABP-dependent transcription (20.Sawada J. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21.Gugneja S. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, modulation of GABP tetramer formation represents a potentially important means of regulating GABP-dependent transcription. We have previously shown that GABP-dependent transcription initiator activity required two PEA3/EBSs, and the highest activity was achieved with two sites positioned on the same face of the DNA helix (23.Yu M. Yang X.-Y. Schmidt T. Chinenov Y. Martin M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29060-29067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24.Sucharov C. Basu A. Carter R.S. Avadhani N.G.

Since the ability to activate transcription was previously shown to be dependent on heterotetramer complex formation, these results favored the stable GABP heterotetramer complex model. However, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with DNA probes containing only a single PEA3/EBS detected a complex consistent with the mobility of the GABPαβ heterodimer (23.Yu M. Yang X.-Y. Schmidt T. Chinenov Y. Martin M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29060-29067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26.Martin M.E. Chinenov Y., Yu, M. Schmidt T.K. Yang X.-Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6203-6209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, a probe with two PEA3/EBSs formed two complexes, one co-migrating with the GABPαβ complex observed on a single PEA3/EBS and a slower migrating complex identified as GABPα2β2heterotetramer. These observations are consistent with the notion that GABP binds to a single PEA3/EBS only as a heterodimer, and requires two or more PEA3/EBSs to bind DNA as a heterotetramer. Therefore, if GABP forms a stable heterotetrameric complex in solution, then dissociation of this complex would be required upon binding to a single PEA3/EBS. Alternatively, GABP may form a stable heterodimer, or may exist in heterodimer-heterotetramer equilibrium that, at concentrations typically found in EMSA assays, favors the GABPαβ heterodimer. Therefore, prior interaction of a GABPαβ heterodimer complex with DNA containing two PEA3/EBS may be required for successful assembly of a transcriptionally competent GABPα2β2heterotetramer. To address the mechanism of GABP assembly and the role of DNA binding in this process, we have utilized EMSAs and analytical ultracentrifugation. In this report we show that GABP exists exclusively as a stable heterodimeric complex (GABPαβ). Even at exceedingly high concentrations little or no significant quantities of GABP heterotetramer complex is observed. These observations support the hypothesis that GABP exists as a stable heterodimer in solution which assembles into the heterotetrameric complex upon binding to target DNA containing two PEA3/EBSs. We further demonstrate that heterotetramer DNA binding is stabilized by positioning the two PEA3/EBSs on the same face of the DNA helix, and that the two motifs can be separated by up to three helical turns. These results are consistent with our earlier results demonstrating that GABP-dependent initiators were most efficient when two PEA3/EBSs were positioned on the same face of the DNA helix, and confirms the importance of the GABP heterotetramer complex in transcription initiator and activator activities of this important regulatory factor (23.Yu M.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1837-1845PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating the bcl3 enhances GABPα2β2 heterotetramer DNA binding, suggest that heterotetramer assembly is likely a regulated process that depends on specific promoter organization and/or specific regulatory proteins.Homo- and heterodimerization is often used by DNA-binding proteins in order to increase specificity and affinity for a cognate binding site. Although preassembled multiprotein complexes may possess higher overall affinity, they also will have higher nonspecific affinity for DNA, and at limiting concentrations, a protein complex could become kinetically trapped at random positions in the genome (34.Kohler J.J. Metallo S.J. Schneider T.L. Schepatz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 35.Pomerantz J.L. Wolfe S.A. Pabo C.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, a high “off-rate” of a monomeric protein, compared with the fully assembled complex, will ensure, that only high affinity sites will be occupied for a sufficient amount of time to enucleate the assembly of a higher order protein-DNA complex. This mechanism, designated as the “monomeric pathway,” has been proposed for the basic helix-loop-helix protein max, the bZIP transcription factor ATF-2, and the Arc repressor (34.Kohler J.J. Metallo S.J. Schneider T.L. Schepatz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36.Reintzeperis D. Johnson T. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the GABPα subunit is capable of DNA binding, in the presence of sufficient GABPβ, a highly stable heterodimer complex is formed. Thus, the GABPαβ heterodimer serves as a functional “monomeric” DNA binding entity. We have demonstrated that the presence of two PEA3/EBSs promotes further high affinity multimerization, suggesting that GABP assembly may proceed along the monomeric pathway. Since the discovery of GABP (1.LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2.Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18.LaMarco K.L. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1372-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it has been widely accepted that GABP exists in solution predominantly as a heterotetramer (α2β2), due to stable β-β interactions (2.Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3.de la Brousse F.C. Birkenmeier E.H. King D.S. Rowe L.B. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This model was supported by subsequent observations that heterotetramer formation was required for full transcriptional transactivation by GABP (20.Sawada J. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21.Gugneja S. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although attractive, this model is not consistent with the absence of heterotetramer complex in EMSA experiments performed with a DNA probe containing a single PEA3/EBS (Fig. 1). DNA containing two PEA3/EBSs is required to observe significant amounts of heterotetramer complex in EMSA experiments, although equivalent amounts of heterodimer complex is observed in these experiments. These results are inconsistent with a stable GABP heterotetramer complex binding as a single unit to DNA containing one or two PEA3/EBSs. Cellular proteins such as bcl3 can promote GABP heterotetramer formation in EMSA experiments (31.Shiio Y. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1837-1845PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the absence of the heterotetrameric complex does not merely reflect its instability under EMSA conditions, but that its formation may be a regulated process. Our observations suggest that the GABPαβ heterodimer is the major species found in solution and that efficient heterotetramer formation requires specific DNA for assembly. To directly address the associative behavior of GABP in solution, we have performed sedimentation equilibrium analysis of purified GABPα, GABPβ, and several deletion mutants in various combinations (27.Chinenov Y. Schmidt T. Yang X.-Y. Martin M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6203-6209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32.Hansen J.C. Lebowitz J. Demeler B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13155-13163Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,33.Minton A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our observation that GABPβ exists in a “monomer to dimer” equilibrium (K d = 1.8 ± 0.4 μm), is incompatible with the “stable heterotetramer” model previously suggested to be required for heterotetramerization (1.LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2.Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3.de la Brousse F.C. Birkenmeier E.H. King D.S. Rowe L.B. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Concentration distributions of an equimolar mixture of GABPα and GABPβ, however, best fit to a two-species model consisting of the GABPαβ heterodimer and a 619,573 Da species, which we attribute to the aforementioned nonspecific aggregation of GABPα. We have been unable to satisfactorily model the GABPαβ concentration distribution with an α + β ↔ αβ ↔ (αβ)2equilibrium model. These results suggest (i) that GABP α and β subunits form a stable heterodimer in solution with an estimatedK d less than 10−8m, and (ii) that, under our experimental conditions, no GABPα2β2 heterotetramer is observed in solution. Our estimation for a GABPαβ dissociation constant is consistent with the apparent K d determined by Suzukiet al. (30.Suzuki F. Goto M. Sawa C. Ito S. Watanabe H. Sawada J. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29302-29308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using surface plasmon resonance (K d = 7.8 ± 0.63 × 10−10m). Our results are also consistent with EMSA experiments suggesting that efficient heterotetramer formation in the absence of any exogenous regulatory influences occurs only on DNA with two or more PEA3/EBSs (Fig. 1). GABPαβ heterodimers assemble into the heterotetramer complex on DNA containing two PEA3/EBSs separated by as many as 4.0 helical turns (Fig. 2).2 The stability of the heterotetramer complex is greatly affected by the spacing between PEA3/EBSs such that, stability is enhanced on DNAs containing two PEA3/EBSs positioned on the same face of the DNA helix. These results are consistent with our previous data showing that GABP-dependent initiator activity is enhanced when two PEA3/EBSs are positioned on the same face of the DNA helix (23.Yu M. Yang X.-Y. Schmidt T. Chinenov Y. Martin M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29060-29067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, GABPβ isoforms or mutants lacking the COOH-terminal homodimerization domain are reportedly unable to promote heterotetramer complex formation and fail to activate transcription of linked promoters (20.Sawada J. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21.Gugneja S. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22.Sawa C. Goto M. Suzuki F. Watanabe H. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The demonstration that heterotetramer complex stability correlates with GABP-dependent initiator activity further advances the notion that the heterotetramer complex is the functionally active form of GABP. The NH2-terminal deletion mutant of GABPα (GABPαcQ) forms significant amounts of heterotetramer complex even on DNA with a single PEA3/EBS. This finding suggests that the NH2 terminus of GABPα may interfere with heterotetramer complex formation. In agreement with this observation, the concentration distribution of a GABPαcQ/GABPβ equimolar mixture best fits a two-species associative model (K d = 0.17 ± 0.045 μm) with the molecular weight of the monomeric species equal to that of the His6-tagged GABPαcQ/GABPβ dimer. Therefore, we have demonstrated that GABP exists as a stable heterodimer, and that multiple PEA3/EBSs are required to promote formation of the heterotetramer complex. Our observation that the NH2-terminal portion of GABPα subunit exerts an inhibitory effect on GABPα2β2heterotetramer formation, and the observations of Shiijo et al. (31.Shiio Y. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Yamamoto T. Inoue J.

This line should be deleted. The corrected table is shown on the following page. Full-Text PDF Open Access active DNA-dependent ATPase A domain base pair DNA recognition and the ensuing ATP hydrolysis by DNA-dependent ATPases are common denominators of a number of different macromolecular assembly/disassembly processes that are required for DNA metabolic events such as chromatin remodeling, replication, repair, recombination, and transcription. There are a variety of types of known nucleic acid-modifying enzymes that use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to produce changes in a nucleic acid substrate (i.e. helicases, nucleases, topoisomerases, ligases, and recombinases). However, there are a few nucleic acid-dependent ATPases where the nucleic acid is not obviously modified and consequently does not appear to be a substrate for the enzyme. In these cases, the nucleic acid is generally regarded as an effector of the enzymatic activity. DNA-dependent ATPase A hydrolyzes ATP only in the presence of a DNA effector, without apparent modification of the effector. Originally isolated from calf thymus tissue, ATPase A is a 105-kDa protein that undergoes proteolysis to yield two smaller polypeptides with estimated molecular masses of 68 and 83 kDa (1.Mesner L.D. Truman P.A. Hockensmith J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7772-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). All three polypeptides possess ATPase activity that is manifested only in the presence of DNA. Initial studies with the 68-kDa polypeptide indicated that the protein is maximally active in the presence of DNA effectors possessing primer-template junctions (i.e. double-stranded to single-stranded transition). This effector preference is reminiscent of the gp44·62 and gp45 protein complex from T4 bacteriophage (2.Hockensmith J.W. Wahl A.F. Kowalski S. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7812-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 3.Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. Hockensmith J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12717-12729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gp44·62 protein complex hydrolyzes ATP in the presence of primer-template DNA, with the energy release being coupled to the loading of a gp45 sliding clamp complex onto DNA, thereby increasing the processivity of DNA synthesis (4.Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12709-12716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recognition of common epitopes by monoclonal antibodies (5.Mesner L.D. Sutherland W.M. Hockensmith J.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11490-11494Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) for gp44·62 and DNA-dependent ATPase A coupled with the use of similar DNA effectors led us to the suggestion that DNA-dependent ATPase A acts similarly to gp44·62,i.e. as a protein assembly factor. Assembly and the corresponding disassembly of multiprotein complexes are known to be essential for the DNA metabolic processes of transcription, recombination, repair, and chromatin remodeling, and the SWI2/SNF2 family of DNA-dependent ATPases is known to be involved in these processes (6.Carlson M. Laurent B.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Although all members of this family contain seven helicase-related motifs, none of them have been reported to possess helicase activity, and not all members of this family require DNA for ATP hydrolysis (e.g. Mot1) (7.Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8.Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 9.Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of these helicase-related motifs, apart from being required for ATP hydrolysis, has not been established. Based on our observations with DNA-dependent ATPase A, we hypothesize that the “helicase” motifs function as DNA structure recognition elements (2.Hockensmith J.W. Wahl A.F. Kowalski S. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7812-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Heretofore, data from studies of SWI2/SNF2 family members have not addressed two of the key components of this hypothesis: (i) the types of DNA secondary structures that effect ATP hydrolysis and/or function by these enzymes and (ii) the structural features of the proteins composing this family of ATPases that are responsible for binding to DNA in a structure-selective manner. We demonstrate here that DNA-dependent ATPase A belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 family of proteins and that a polypeptide domain encompassing the seven helicase-related motifs contains all the necessary regions for binding to DNA and hydrolysis of ATP. Furthermore, the domain is sufficient for recognition of specific DNA elements, and these DNA elements are necessary and sufficient for effecting ATP hydrolysis by DNA-dependent ATPase A. Our data support the proposal that the amino acid motifs common to the SWI2/SNF2 family of proteins are not helicase motifs, but are motifs that permit recognition of specific DNA elements. Similar to the structures generated by helicases, these elements are composed of double-stranded to single-stranded transition regions and as such are found in the DNA metabolic processes that include SWI2/SNF2 family members as participants. We suggest that one common theme for the SWI2/SNF2 family of proteins is specific recognition of DNA architecture. Unless noted otherwise, chemicals were purchased from Fisher, Sigma, or Mallinckrodt Chemical Works. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega and New England Biolabs Inc. Automated Edman degradation peptide sequencing was conducted by the University of Virginia Biomolecular Research Facility, which also synthesized all DNA constructs using spectrophotometric and gas chromatographic analyses for quality control. Calf thymus DNA-dependent ATPase A (105-kDa species) was purified as described (1.Mesner L.D. Truman P.A. Hockensmith J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7772-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The activeDNA-dependent ATPase Adomain (ADAAD)1was purified from Escherichia coli cells following expression from the plasmid pRM102. Briefly, cDNA was generated from calf thymus mRNA using oligo(dT) primers. Oligonucleotide primers 502 (5′-GCTCGAATTCTTTATAGAGGAGAGGTAAAGCT-3′) and 503 (5′-TATACCATGGCAGGGACCCCGATGCACAGA-3′) were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify the region of the cDNA encoding amino acids 215–941 of ATPase A. The amplified polymerase chain reaction product was purified, restricted with EcoRI and NcoI, and ligated into the pET-24d(+) vector (Novagen) cut with these same two enzymes. The ligated product was transformed into JM109 cells, and transformants were selected in the presence of 51 μmkanamycin. A plasmid (pRM102) was isolated from this clone and transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) for expression. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the pRM102 plasmid were grown at 25 °C in the absence of kanamycin 2Muthuswami, R., Mesner, L. D., Wang, D., Hill, D. A., Imbalzano, A. N., and Hockensmith, J. W. (2000)Biochemistry, in press. to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were grown at 25 °C for 2 h, harvested by centrifugation at 4225 ×g in a GS3 rotor for 15 min, weighed, and stored at −80 °C. For purification of ADAAD, 10 g of cells were thawed; resuspended in 200 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer; and lysed by passing twice through a French press at 1500 p.s.i. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and 2 m NaCl was added to the supernatant. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 191,230 × g for 2 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a P-60 gel filtration column (6.5 × 20 cm). The P-60 column was eluted with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the resulting protein was loaded onto an immunoaffinity column, which was prepared and eluted according to a previously devised protocol (1.Mesner L.D. Truman P.A. Hockensmith J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7772-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Enzymatic ATP hydrolysis was monitored by a colorimetric assay (2.Hockensmith J.W. Wahl A.F. Kowalski S. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7812-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Protein content was estimated using the Bradford assay (10.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215560) Google Scholar). The binding of DNA to protein was monitored by the ability of the DNA molecule to effect ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme. To calculate the apparent binding constant for ATPase A/DNA or ADAAD/DNA interactions, we used a model that described a simple one-substrate, one-product reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. The interaction between the DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA leading to ATP hydrolysis was described as follows: enzyme·ATP + DNA → enzyme·ATP·DNA → enzyme·ADP + product + DNA, where the amount of phosphate released is a measure of the product formed. We described the rate of reaction (V) as follows:v i =V DNA[DNA]/(K DNA + [DNA]), where V DNA is the maximal velocity for the reaction described above. In this particular case, we have definedV max as V DNA andK DNA as the apparent dissociation constant since DNA is not a substrate, but is an effector. Biochemical characterization of bovine 105-kDa DNA-dependent ATPase A (2.Hockensmith J.W. Wahl A.F. Kowalski S. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7812-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) coupled with amino acid analysis of the immunoaffinity-purified 83-kDa ATPase A polypeptide and its cyanogen bromide-generated cleavage products led to elucidation of the amino acid sequence for this protein (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequences of seven different peptides were obtained, and the sequences were used to generate oligonucleotide primers. The nucleotide sequence was then deduced using these primers in a polymerase chain reaction with template cDNA generated from two parallel systems: a bovine aortic endothelial cell cDNA library and a cDNA prepared from oligo(dT)-primed calf thymus mRNA. The amino acid sequence was generated by translation of the nucleotide sequence (Fig. 1). Sequence comparison using BLASTP (NCBI) revealed that, despite having similar effector preference and common epitopes, ATPase A does not have any significant similarity to gp44·62. Instead, the sequence possesses seven helicase-related motifs in the carboxyl terminus (from amino acids 451 to 941), which are characteristic of the SWI2/SNF2 family of proteins (11.Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). This region of 490 amino acids shows up to 36% identity to members of the SWI2/SNF2 family of proteins (12.Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9377) Google Scholar). The sequence yielding the highest degree of similarity to ATPase A has been tentatively identified as encoding a helicase from Caenorhabditis elegans (NCBI accession number U41534; BLASTP value: 4 × 10−88). However, the C. elegans amino acid sequence showed homology only from amino acids 292 to 929 (33% identity) of ATPase A. Of the various proteins that have been at least partially purified by biochemical techniques, ATPase A showed 24% identity over 461 amino acids of hSNF2H (NCBI accession numberAB010882; BLASTP value: 6 × 10−27) and 30% identity over 289 amino acids of yeast Mot1 sequence (NCBI accession numberP32333; BLASTP value: 2 × 10−17) (13.Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although BLASTP demonstrated significant similarity of ATPase A to otherSaccharomyces cerevisiae proteins such as the Snf2 and Sth1 proteins (14.Laurent B.C. Yang X. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15.Laurent B.C. Treich I. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), no S. cerevisiae sequence showed significant similarity over the entire length of the protein. Despite having both the amino acid sequence and confirming nucleotide sequence, BLASTP analysis of the amino terminus of ATPase A (amino acids 1–450) did not show significant similarity to any protein sequence. Northern blot analysis of mRNA isolated from calf thymus tissue confirmed the presence of a 2.8-kilobase transcript corresponding to the 105-kDa protein (data not shown). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from human, bovine, and murine tissues confirmed the presence of a gene encoding DNA-dependent ATPase A (data not shown). The Southern blot yielded the same results regardless of whether a probe was used for the 5′- or 3′-end of the gene and also supported the conclusion that multiple copies of this gene are present in these three organisms. Neither yeast RNA nor genomic DNA hybridized to any probe, confirming the absence of a sequence sharing full-length similarity in the yeast proteome data base and leading us to suggest that DNA-dependent ATPase A is unique to higher eukaryotes. For DNA-dependent ATPase A, generation of free phosphate via ATP hydrolysis is manifested only in the presence of DNA. In particular, single-stranded and double-stranded heteropolymeric DNAs, either closed circular or linear, act as effectors of ATP hydrolysis with no indication of base sequence specificity (2.Hockensmith J.W. Wahl A.F. Kowalski S. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7812-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Optimal effectors have the capability of possessing secondary structures such as double-stranded to single-stranded transitions. The analysis of the interaction between SWI2/SNF2 family members and DNA effectors has been limited in scope, and although sequence specificity for binding has been suggested, no DNA consensus sequence has been reported (16.Quinn J. Fyrberg A.M. Ganster R.W. Schmidt M.C. Peterson C.L. Nature. 1996; 379: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that DNA-dependent ATPase A recognizes specific DNA structures and although the formation of these structures is sequence-dependent, there is no a prioriassumption of specific base recognition. To delineate the specific structures required to effect ATP hydrolysis, we chose a reductionist approach and employed a set of synthetic oligonucleotides to define a minimal effector (Table I).Table IOligonucleotide effectors and predicted structuresOligonucleotideSequence (5′ to 3′)Possible structurePredicted structureΔG502GCTCGAATTCTTATAGAGGAGAGGTAAAGCTSingle-stranded01027AGCTTTACCTCTCCTCTATAAGAATTCGAGCSingle-stranded01026GCTCGAATTCTTATTATAGAGAGGTAAAGCTSingle-stranded0650GCGCAATTGCGCDouble-strandedGCGCAATTGCGC23.3CGCGTTAACGCG1009GACTCGAGTCGACTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGGGG5′-Recessed termini5′-GACTCGAGTCGACTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGGGG10.8———-CAGCTGAGCTCAG-5′995CGCGCGTACGCACGTACGACGCGCACACGTGTGTG5′-Recessed termini5′-CGCGCGTACGCACGTACGACGCGCACACGTGTGTG12—ACGCATGCGCGC-5′993CGCGCGTACGCATACGTTGTATGCACACGTGTGTG5′-Recessed termini5′-CGCGCGTACGCATACGTTGTATGCACACGTGTGTG12——–CATGCGCGC-5′1008CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCTCGATGTCGACTCGAGTC3′-Recessed terminiCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCTCGATGTCGACTCGAGTC-3′10.83′-CTGAGCTCAGCTGTA——–994CACACACGTGTGCATACAACGTATGCGTACGCGCG3′-Recessed terminiCACACACGTGTGCATACAACGTATGCGTACGCGCG-3′123′-GCGCGCATGC——-1027 + 502AT-rich DNAAGCTTTACCTCTCCTCTATAAGAATTCGAGC46.7TCGAAATGGAGAGGAGATATTCTTAAGCTCG1008 + 100910-bp mismatchCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCTCGATGTCGACTCGAGTC41.9GGGGGGGGGGTTTTTTTTTTCAGCTGAGCTCAG1027 + 10264-bp mismatchAGCTTTACCTCTCCTCTATAAGAATTCGAGC41.4TCGAAATGGAGAGATATTATTCTTAAGCTCG950GCGCAATTGCGCTCGACGATTTTTTAGCGCAATTGCGCStem-loopCGACG18.25′-GCGCAATTGCGCT A3′-CGCGTTAACGCGA TTTTTTThe structures were predicted using the Mfold, Plotfold, and FoldRNA programs contained within GCG software.

The ability of oligonucleotides to interact with DNA-dependent ATPase A was measured as a function of ATP hydrolysis. We initially found that oligonucleotides <40 bases in length varied widely in their ability to effect ATP hydrolysis by DNA-dependent ATPase A, varying from no induced hydrolysis up to hydrolytic levels greater than we had previously seen with any effector. Possible secondary structures of the oligonucleotide effectors were predicted using the FoldRNA, Mfold, and Plotfold programs contained within the GCG software package (17.Zuker M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 262-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 18.Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). As these programs are designed to predict the secondary structure for an RNA molecule, we also predicted possible structures for each of our DNA constructs by analyzing the sequence manually. Subsequently, we calculated the free energy of destabilization for possible duplexes using the method of Breslauer et al. (19.Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar). The most probable structure for a given DNA construct was selected from the possible distribution of structures as the one that was the most energetically favorable (Table I). Neither a single-stranded DNA molecule (oligonucleotides 502, 1027, and 1026) nor a double-stranded, blunt-ended DNA (oligonucleotide 650) was capable of effecting ATP hydrolysis by DNA-dependent ATPase A (Table II). However, DNA molecules with both single-stranded and duplex character were effectors of ATP hydrolysis by DNA-dependent ATPase A. In particular, a stem-loop DNA molecule (oligonucleotide 950) was the optimal effector of DNA-dependent ATPase A. We also found that duplex DNA molecules that possess the character necessary to yield a double-stranded to single-stranded transition region, such as mismatches of 4 and 10 base pairs or AT-rich sequence, were effectors of DNA-dependent ATPase A.Table IIEffector utilization and kineticsDescriptionOligonucleotideATPase A ActivityADAAD KDNAADAAD V DNAnmol Pireleased/hnmnmol Pi released/minSingle-stranded1026None NMaNM, not measurable; ND, not determined.NM502NoneNMNM1027NoneNMNMBlunt-ended duplex650NoneNMNM5′-Recessed ends, no stem loops1009NoneNMNM995NoneNMNM993NoneNMNM3′-Recessed ends, no stem loops1008174.160 ± 171.7 ± 0.1994240.6NDNDAT-rich duplex1027 + 502210.349 ± 114.5 ± 0.510-Base pair mismatch duplex1008 + 1009280.215.8 ± 4.03.9 ± 0.54-Base pair mismatch duplex1027 + 1026284.34.1 ± 1.53.8 ± 0.5Stem-loop950320.61.9 ± 0.42.4 ± 0.1DNA-dependent ATPase A hydrolytic activity was measured in the presence of 10 nm effector at 37 °C for 1 h.

For K DNA andV DNA calculations, ADAAD hydrolytic activity was measured as a function of DNA concentration for 1 h at 37 °C.K DNA and V DNA were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To establish the affinity of DNA-dependent ATPase A for these double-stranded to single-stranded transition regions, we used a kinetic phosphate release assay to estimate the dissociation constant for the interaction between the enzyme and its optimal effector, stem-loop DNA. We assumed that the protein/DNA interaction is in rapid equilibrium and that the formation of this complex is not the rate-limiting step. Under these conditions, the dissociation constant was calculated to be 0.5 nm, indicating that DNA-dependent ATPase A has a high affinity for this type of DNA structure. The yeast SWI/SNF multiprotein complex has previously been reported to have a high affinity for some promoter sequences and DNA-binding properties that permit recognition of structured DNA (four-way junctions), but the protein components responsible for binding the DNA have not been identified (16.Quinn J. Fyrberg A.M. Ganster R.W. Schmidt M.C. Peterson C.L. Nature. 1996; 379: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Our results lead to the proposal that the SNF2 component of the SWI/SNF complex may be solely responsible for the high affinity DNA binding. With the apperception that DNA-dependent ATPase A recognizes DNA in a highly structure-dependent fashion that is not dependent on other protein cofactors and with a desire to elucidate the kinetic mechanism of DNA-dependent ATPase A, we sought to establish whether the helicase-related motifs constitute a functional domain. To characterize the protein/DNA interaction, we overexpressed and purified the molecular motor from ATPase A using a heterologous expression system. During our biochemical characterization of ATPase A, we identified shorter proteolytic forms (Fig. 1), which retain DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis comparable to the full-length parent polypeptide; thus, the amino terminus of the enzyme is dispensable for ATP hydrolytic function. The cDNA sequence encoding one of these proteolytic products (82 kDa) was cloned into a pET-24d(+) vector. Since the 82-kDa polypeptide comprised both the ATP- and DNA-binding domains of ATPase A as well as the seven helicase-related motifs, we termed it the activeDNA-dependent ATPase Adomain (ADAAD) (Fig. 1, amino acids 215–941). Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies raised against ATPase A (5.Mesner L.D. Sutherland W.M. Hockensmith J.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11490-11494Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) showed the presence of the ADAAD protein following induction of expression with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The specific activity of ADAAD (16 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min/mg), overexpressed and purified in the absence of kanamycin,2 was nearly identical to that of the 83-kDa ATPase A purified from calf thymus tissue (5.Mesner L.D. Sutherland W.M. Hockensmith J.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11490-11494Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Also similar to the proteolytic products, ADAAD exhibited a stability of >80% remaining activity after 20 days at room temperature. We conclude that ADAAD constitutes a correctly folded domain composed of the helicase-related motifs and that this domain is sufficient for effector recognition and subsequent ATP hydrolysis. This region of DNA-dependent ATPase A can thus be considered as the “motor” domain of the SWI2/SNF2 family (9.Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T.

Obertone T.S. Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), understanding how this essential effector of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone endocrine axis is regulated might provide new insights into how several cardiovascular diseases develop. Down-regulation of AT1-R gene expression occurs within a few hours following activation of vascular smooth muscle cells with many different types of stimuli. These include several growth factors acting through receptor tyrosine kinases (4.Nickenig G. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ullian M.E. Raymond J.R.

Nickenig G. Clark M. Murphy T.J. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 601-609PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Wang X. Nickenig G. Murphy T.J. Mol.

We suspect that regulated post-transcriptional mechanisms may account for some or all of the effects of these diverse stimuli. Among the indirect evidence supporting this notion are observations that cAMP-elevating agents do not affect AT1-R gene transcription (8.Wang X. Nickenig G. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10.Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although Gαq-coupled and growth factor receptor signaling suppresses AT1-R gene transcription, the more rapid rate of AT1-R mRNA decay in response to mitogens relative to transcriptional inhibitors raises the possibility of superimposed post-transcriptional processes (4.Nickenig G. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Nickenig G. Clark M. Murphy T.J. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 601-609PubMed Google Scholar). Gaining tight and selective experimental control over AT1-R gene transcription would help to clarify these matters. A role for post-transcriptional regulation in agonist-mediated control of AT1-R gene expression has wider implications. Current knowledge about regulated post-transcriptional processes lags considerably the more detailed understanding of how gene transcription rates are modulated by receptor signaling (11.Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Although there is a growing appreciation that receptor-operated post-transcriptional control processes likely exist, gathering unambiguous functional evidence for this modality of gene expression regulation is not a trivial matter (reviewed in Ref. 12.Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The typical approach involves measuring how signaling changes mRNA decay rates, using general transcriptional inhibitors like actinomycin D or DRB. The nonspecific effects of these drugs are problematic and raise serious questions about their utility and thus the reliability of many studies that resort to their use. For example, actinomycin D can evoke several stress-like responses in cells, potentially disrupting interfaces between signaling and mRNA metabolism (13.Cherry L.M. Hsu T.C. Environ. Mutagen. 1982; 4: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 14.Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15.Beard S.E.

Furthermore, the mechanism of action of DRB is through inhibiting phosphorylation of RNA polymerase, but its selectivity for the RNA polymerase kinasesversus signaling kinases is unknown (19.Dubois M.-F.

Finally, actinomycin D can directly interfere with basal mRNA turnover mechanisms, raising concerns that this might be a more general problem than is currently appreciated (12.Ross J. Microbiol.

The present study surmounts these difficulties, providing direct functional evidence that post-transcriptional processes regulated by signaling contribute to modulating vascular AT1-R mRNA abundance. We clarify the role of post-transcriptional regulation among the many different factors that can down-regulate AT1-R mRNA expression. We begin with the premise that an mRNA will be regulated at the post-transcriptional level irrespective of whether it is transcribed from a recombinant or a native locus. Mimicry by a recombinant surrogate of a response affecting its native transcript is essential direct evidence that a post-transcriptional regulatory process exists. The predictive value of recombinant surrogates then rests largely on how accurately mRNA expression dynamics have been reconstructed. By using tetracycline-suppressible transcription factors (23.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 24.Gossen M. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4411-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to express highly accurate AT1-R mRNA mimics in vascular smooth muscle cells, we directly test whether post-transcriptional mechanisms are involved in its modulation by specific receptor-coupled signaling systems. Rat aortic vascular smooth muscle (RASM) cells (passages 8–25) and A7r5 smooth muscle cells were cultured as described (3.Adams B. Obertone T.S. Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8.Wang X. Nickenig G. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After reaching confluence, growth media containing 10% serum was replaced with serum-free media for an additional 16 h before initiating treatments. Infectious retroviral supernatants were generated by a helper virus-free, transient transfection protocol and used to infect smooth muscle cells with >99% efficiency as described elsewhere (25.Boss V. Abbott K.L. Wang X.-F. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To ensure stable chromatin integration, cells infected with AT1-R mRNA expression viruses were treated with 200 μg/ml G418 for 7–10 days. Experiments were then performed on such recombinant cell batches over the succeeding 3–5 passes through subculture, representing studies on cells that have gone through approximately 12–20 population doublings after retroviral infection. The plasmid pXF42-eGFP was created by removing the neomycin cassette in pXF40-eGFP (10.Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol.

The tetracycline transactivator (tTA) cDNA from pUD15-1 (23.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All retroviral AT1-R expression plasmids were constructed in pTJM12, a derivative of pTJM9 (25.Boss V. Abbott K.L. Wang X.-F. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol.

To create pTSO33, which is the wild-type AT1-R mRNA expression vector, eight copies of the tetracycline operator sequence (tetOp) derived from pUD10-3 (23.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

AKpnI-DraIII fragment was fused downstream of this, derived from the vector pTSO31 (3.Adams B. Obertone T.S. Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol.

This latter fragment encodes the remainder of the third exon of the rat AT1-R gene, including its open reading frame and 3′-UTR region and ∼370 base pairs of additional non-transcribed genomic sequence that encode downstream polyadenylation signals. The vector pTSO41 uses the tetracycline-regulated minimal CMV promoter, as a XhoI-EcoRI fragment from pUD10-3, instead of the minimal AT1-R promoter, but is otherwise identical to pTSO33 downstream from this. The vector pTSO31 is the same as pTSO41 at the 5′ end but uses an SV40 pA+ signal, rather than AT1-R pA+ signals as transcriptional terminators (3.Adams B. Obertone T.S. Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Plasmids for the various mutant and deletion AT1-R mRNA were constructed using shuttle vectors and standard oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis or polymerase chain reaction protocols. The plasmid pXF40-eGFP (10.Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) served as a base to construct chimera AT1-R/eGFP mRNAs, and unlike the AT1-R mRNA constructs, these were infected into cells that express the tTA through infection with the retrovirus pTSO5 (3.Adams B. Obertone T.S. Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All mutations and polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were verified by sequencing using the Emory University DNA sequencing core facility before subcloning into the retroviral expression vectors. Plasmids and their complete sequences are available on request. Samples of total RNA were hybridized with a mixture of gel-purified, [α-32P]UTP-labeled antisense AT1-R and cyclophilin (Cyp) riboprobes and treated with RNase A and T1 before resolution on sequencing gels as described in detail elsewhere (3.Adams B. Obertone T.S. Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All AT1-R riboprobes incorporate sequences antisense to the HA epitope. The hybridization signals were quantified from phosphorimages using a volume integration protocol in the ImageQuaNT software. AT1-R mRNA hybridization signals were divided by those for Cyp in each sample, and the data are normalized to this ratio in untreated control samples, which is taken as 100%. Decay rate constants were calculated after combining all sets of experimental data for a given mRNA construct and protocol and performing an iterative best-fit computation using the single-site exponential decay function in GraphPad Prism. Nuclei from confluent RASM cells were isolated, and in vitro run-on transcription assays using 250 μCi of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were conducted in a 200-μl volume as described previously (8.Wang X. Nickenig G. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled nuclear RNA was isolated and split into 2 equivalent aliquots and each hybridized in solution at 22 °C precisely as described (28.Rasmussen E.B. Lis J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7923-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), using either 0.21 nmol of biotinylated antisense HA epitope oligonucleotide (5′biotin-(18 carbon spacer)-AACGGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAC) or 0.21 nmol of oligonucleotide antisense to the L32 ribosomal protein mRNA (5′biotin-(18 carbon spacer)-TTCACATATCGGTCCGACTGGTGCCTGATGA) as an internal control. After an overnight hybridization, streptavidin-coated ferrous beads (Promega, Inc. Madison, WI; 300 μg, ∼1.25 nmol capacity) were added. After a brief incubation, the samples were clamped against a magnetic bar and washed six times with 1-ml aliquots of RNase-free 0.1× SSC. The samples were eluted in a sequencing gel loading dye by heating to 90 °C for 10 min before resolution by electrophoresis through 5% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Expression of recombinant AT1-R mRNAs in vascular smooth muscle cells from tetracycline-regulated promoters exploits a helper virus-free, non-replicating retroviral vector system (Fig.1). The gene transfer efficiency is routinely close to 100% using this, allowing for rapid derivation of new recombinant cell populations compared with alternative methods. Stable chromatin integration of the recombinant genes allows for continued study on successive passages of cells following a single infection protocol. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (10.Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was used first to create vascular smooth muscle cell lines enriched for expression of the tetracycline transactivator (23.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar) using the self-regulating vector pXF42-eGFP (Fig. 1 a). After expansion and storage, these cells were used to provide a uniform genetic background for subsequent transduction with recombinant AT1-R retroviruses. The vector used to express what is termed the wild-type recombinant AT1-R mRNA (referred herein as wtAT1-R), which represents the most accurate possible mimic of the native transcript, is shown in Fig. 1 b. This anhydrotetracycline (Antet)-suppressible mRNA begins and ends, respectively, with transcriptional initiation (minimal promoter) and termination (polyadenylation) sequences derived from the native AT1-R gene (26.Takeuchi K. Alexander R.W. Nakamura Y. Tsujino T. Murphy T.J. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In using these elements, rather than heterologous promoter and poly(A)+ sequences, the composition of the 5′ and 3′ ends of the recombinant mRNA precisely mimic those of the major native 2.2-kb AT1-R transcript expressed in VSMC and other cells (27.Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). An in-frame hemagglutinin (HA) epitope within the amino terminus of the AT1-R open reading frame is the only difference between the recombinant wtAT1-R and the native transcript, which was necessary to distinguish between them using ribonuclease protection assays. A7r5 smooth muscle do not to express the AT1-R gene natively (3.Adams B. Obertone T.S. Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but after sequential infection with tTA and wtAT1-R mRNA viruses, they display an anhydrotetracycline (Antet)-suppressible 2.2-kb AT1-R mRNA (labeled “tetOp”). It migrates on agarose gels the same as the more abundant native transcript in a second line of cells termed RASM (Fig. 1 c), demonstrating that the expression vector produces the expected AT1-R mRNA product. Notably, this is slightly smaller than the 2.4-kb transcript produced from the vector TSO31 (see below), which has additional heterologous 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences derived from CMV and SV40 elements (3.Adams B. Obertone T.S. Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The recombinant wtAT1-R mRNA presumably migrates at 2.2 kb in recombinant RASM cells, inferred from the finding that none of the detectable hybridization signals are suppressed by Antet treatment. Of note, the weaker 3.2-kb transcript observed in RASM mRNA represents a previously cloned alternately spliced product of the native AT1-R gene, rather than a recombinant molecule (26.Takeuchi K. Alexander R.W. Nakamura Y. Tsujino T. Murphy T.J. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27.Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). The barely detectable hybridization signals migrating at ∼6 kb, labeled “LTR,” likely represent the transcript driven by the LTR promoter, essentially reflecting a neomycin mRNA with antisense AT1-R mRNA sequences in the 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1 b). Our ribonuclease protection assay discriminates recombinant from native transcripts in a single sample, because the riboprobes used incorporate sequence antisense to the HA epitope in addition to the flanking AT1-R mRNA sequence (Fig.2). The phosphorimage (Fig.2 a) shows a single large protected fragment representative of the recombinant wtAT1-R mRNA. The three smaller fragments reflect the native mRNA because synthesis of the riboprobe from a recombinant template crosses over both the heterologous HA epitope and an exon that is alternatively spliced within the native mRNA 5′-UTR (26.Takeuchi K. Alexander R.W. Nakamura Y. Tsujino T. Murphy T.J. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27.Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Although the recombinant transcript is suppressed after treatment with 1 μg/ml Antet, this does not affect expression of the native AT1-R mRNA, showing the selectivity of Antet (Fig. 2 b). A comparatively delayed decay occurs for the wtAT1-R in cells treated with actinomycin D (20 μg/ml) relative to the effect of Antet, indicating that actinomycin D strongly interferes with basal AT1-R decay processes. Previous studies have established that forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, down-regulates the AT1-R mRNA through activation of PKA, because this response is inhibited in cells expressing a highly selective polypeptide inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent kinase (10.Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A bolus (5 or 10 μm) of forskolin was used to stimulate PKA in RASM cells, and recombinant wtAT1-R mRNA levels were measured at various times thereafter (Fig. 3). Treatment with forskolin causes down-regulation of the mRNA, with an apparent half-life of 1.7 h (TableI). Notably, decay rates following Antet treatment or Antet plus forskolin treatment are similar (Table I).Table IKinetic analysis of recombinant AT1-R mRNA decaymRNAnForskolinAntetAntet + forskolink (h−1) ± S.E.(t 1/2, h)k (h−1) S.E.(t 1/2, h)k (h−1) S.E.(t 1/2, h)wtAT1-R40.40 ± 0.111.70.49 ± 0.091.40.57 ± 0.081.2TSO3120.45 ± 0.081.50.24 ± 0.062.80.48 ± 0.131.4TS04140.36 ± 0.061.90.33 ± 0.122.10.37 ± 0.151.9KX3820.38 ± 0.081.80.39 ± 0.051.80.44 ± 0.091.6TSO3220.30 ± 0.112.30.28 ± 0.062.50.39 ± 0.041.7TSO2820.30 ± 0.092.30.24 ± 0.042.90.30 ± 0.062.3TSO2920.21 ± 0.033.30.25 ± 0.042.80.23 ± 0.063.0KX3940.21 ± 0.043.20.17 ± 0.044.10.24 ± 0.032.8KX303STABLE0.39 ± 0.051.80.43 ± 0.061.6KX632STABLE0.50 ± 0.101.4NDKX652STABLE0.54 ± 0.11.3NDXF403STABLE0.13 ± 0.015.40.13 ± 0.025.4KX4120.41 ± 0.061.70.29 ± 0.052.40.32 ± 0.062.2KX41(−)2STABLE0.18 ± 0.023.9NDThe decay rate constants (k) and their S.E. are derived from non-linear analysis of data from combined experiments using a single-site exponential decay function.

Half-lives (t 1/2) were calculated from the relationshipt 1/2 = 0.693/k. ND, not determined. STABLE represents no response to forskolin treatment. Because Antet suppresses transcription by a mechanism that relieves transactivation, rather than through direct inhibition (23.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar), nuclear run-on assays were performed to ensure that forskolin does not directly inhibit transcription of the wtAT1-R gene. Nuclei were collected after treating cells for 45 min with forskolin, reasoning that any transcriptional suppression caused by forskolin by this point should be quite pronounced to account for its affect on steady-state mRNA levels. For comparison, cells were also treated with Antet to assess transcriptional suppression and with Antet plus forskolin to test whether forskolin interferes with the mechanism of action for Antet. The recombinant AT1-R transcripts were selectively captured by solution hybridization using a biotinylated antisense oligonucleotide directed against its HA epitope (28.Rasmussen E.B. Lis J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7923-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Capture of the ribosomal L32 protein mRNA similarly from aliquots of the same samples served as an internal control. Antet treatment for 45 min suppresses the transcripts captured by the wtAT1-R probe, with transcription to about 10% of control levels consistent with the “leak” that occurs in this system (3.Adams B. Obertone T.S. Wang X. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig.4). Similar results were obtained in other run-on experiments in which the Antet treatment period was 30 min, suggesting Antet-mediated transcriptional suppression occurs rapidly (data not shown). Co-treatment with forskolin and Antet does not interfere with the transcriptional suppression, and forskolin has no effect on transcription compared with vehicle-treated cells. These observations establish that transcriptional suppression cannot account for the forskolin-mediated reduction of the recombinant wtAT1-R mRNA. To determine if mitogenic receptor signaling affects recombinant wtAT1-R mRNA expression, the cells were stimulated for up to 6 h following a bolus of either angiotensin II or the growth factor PDGF-BB. As shown in Fig.5 a, their effects are not comparable to that of forskolin, wherein angiotensin II has no effect and PDGF reduces the recombinant mRNA only at the latest time point tested. Whereas the recombinant mRNA is largely unaffected by mitogens, the native AT1-R mRNA is down-regulated in the same samples, which establishes that the agonists nevertheless evoked their regulatory effects on AT1-R gene expression (Fig. 5 a). The modest suppressive effect of PDGF on the recombinant wtAT1-R mRNA at the latter time point might be due to a transcriptional effect. To test this, the PDGF response was measured in cells expressing a recombinant mRNA from the vector TSO41, which is identical to the wtAT1-R mRNA except that it is driven from a tetracycline-suppressible minimal CMV promoter. This renders an mRNA with ∼60 additional bases of heterologous CMV sequence in the 5′-UTR. As shown in Fig.5 b, the TSO41-derived recombinant AT1-R mRNA is down-regulated by forskolin but unaffected by PDGF-BB treatment. We conclude that the reduction of the recombinant wtAT1-R mRNA in response to PDGF-BB is most likely due to a modest degree of transcriptional suppression at the minimal AT1-R promoter. To test whether the AT1-R mRNA is regulated in another smooth muscle cell phenotype, levels of the recombinant wtAT1-R mRNA levels were measured after infection of A7r5 cells with the display system. Like RASM, A7r5 cells are derived from rat thoracic aorta (29.Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) but differ in morphological and growth characteristics (30.Firulli A.B. Han D. Kelly-Roloff L. Koteliansky V.E. Schwartz S.M.

This factor is found in cells as a dimer which can contain any two members of the Rel family of proteins (p50, p65, p52, c-Rel, and RelB). The different dimers show distinct preferences for DNA-binding site sequences. To understand the relationship between the DNA binding properties of the dimer forms and transcriptional activation, the physical properties of the complexes of p50 and p65 with DNA have been analyzed. Comparison of apparent DNA binding affinity showed differences in selectivity of DNA-binding site sequence. The ionic strength dependence of apparent binding affinity has shown that the number of ionic interactions in the protein-DNA complex depends on the DNA-binding site sequence and the dimer form, which are consistent with changes in the structure of the protein-DNA complex. Using a fluorescent technique to measure DNA structure changes, protein binding does not appear to alter the structure of the DNA-binding site within the limits of detection. These results are consistent with a change in protein structure that may result in activation differences due to alternative interactions with other transcription proteins.

These results are consistent with a change in protein structure that may result in activation differences due to alternative interactions with other transcription proteins. human immunodeficiency virus glutathione S-transferase TATA-binding protein human The transcription factor NF-κB has been shown to activate transcription from many genes involved in the immune response (for review, see Ref. 1.Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar) and from several viral promoters (HIV1 (2.Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar) and cytomegalovirus (3.Niller H.H. Hennighausen L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3715-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). The central role for NF-κB in inflammation has been confirmed in mice lacking the p50 or the RelB subunit of NF-κB. These animals show severe alterations in their response to immune challenge (4.Sha W.C. Liou H.C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 5.Weih F. Carrasco D. Durham S.K. Barton D.S. Rizzo C.A. Ryseck R.P. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Cell. 1995; 80: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In addition, p65-deficient B- and T-cells show severe reductions in cellular activation (6.Doi T.S. Takahashi T. Taguchi O. Azuma T. Obata Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The active DNA binding form of NF-κB is a dimer and can consist of any combination of five different NF-κB/Rel protein subunits (p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB) (1.Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 7.Gilmore T.D. Cancer Surv. 1992; 15: 69-87PubMed Google Scholar). Many previous studies have shown that dimers of the different monomeric forms show differences in sequence selectivity. Early studies looking at p50 and p65 DNA binding specificity suggested that the p65 subunit extended the specificity of p50 (8.Urban M.B. Baeuerle P.A. New Biol. 1991; 3: 279-288PubMed Google Scholar). In studies of DNA-binding site selection, Kunsch et al. (9.Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown defined selectivities for each dimer form using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Perkinset al. (10.Perkins N.D. Schmid R.M. Duckett C.S. Leung K. Rice N.R. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1529-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) have shown that subunit composition could influence transcriptional activation in transfection assays in Jurkat T-cells. It has also been shown that the 3′-half site of a NF-κB element has a profound effect on the species of NF-κB dimer that binds to that site (11.Muroi M. Muroi Y. Yamamoto K. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19534-19539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, Schmid et al. (12.Schmid R.M. Liptay S. Betts J.C. Nabel G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32162-32167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the p50 and p49 subunits of NF-κB have distinct binding properties and function differently on different DNA-binding sites. Thus, there is clear evidence that there are differences between the protein-DNA complexes that depend on the dimer form and the DNA sequence in the complex. However, there have been few studies to identify and characterize what the structural differences could be between these complexes. The structures of the p50, p52, p65 homodimer, and p50/p65 heterodimer protein-DNA complexes have been reported (13.Muller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 14.Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B.

Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and have provided a great deal of insight into the mechanisms of specificity of these protein-DNA interactions. It is clear that there are many direct contacts between the protein and DNA in the DNA-binding domain that afford specificity to a consensus DNA-binding site. However, there are still many questions about how the observed structures relate to transcriptional activity. Although the structures reported show differences in the DNA-binding domain, it is unclear if there are any changes in the DNA-binding domain when the protein is bound to different DNA-binding sites. These structures were solved with a limited number of DNA sequences, so any changes in complex structure that depend on the DNA sequence in the site cannot be defined. Understanding these changes in structure are particularly interesting as the residues that interact with the DNA in a sequence specific manner are found in a portion of the protein that is likely to be flexible owing to its location at the end of a β-sheet structure (14.Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Because, the differences in activity observed when bound to alternate sites is likely to be biologically significant, we have analyzed the physical characteristics of p50/p50, p65/p65, and p50/p65 dimer binding to several DNA-binding site sequences. Using both nitrocellulose filter binding and fluorescence polarization, the apparent dissociation constants for protein-DNA site interactions were determined under various conditions. This analysis has identified several interesting aspects of the NF-κB-DNA complexes. The data show that the p50 homodimer can bind to nonspecific DNA with a higher apparent affinity than the p65 homodimer. Also, the NF-κB-DNA interaction is sensitive to the anion in the buffer, which suggests that ions are released from the protein upon binding. Finally the number of ions released upon complex formation is dependent on the DNA sequence of the binding site and the dimer form. This last result is consistent with the hypothesis that the conformation of the protein-DNA complex can vary with DNA-binding site sequence. The GSTp50 and GSTp65 prokaryotic expression plasmids were a generous gift of Drs. Neal Perkins and Gary Nabel (18.Perkins N.D. Agranoff A.B. Pascal E. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6570-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified essentially as described by Perkins et al. (18.Perkins N.D. Agranoff A.B. Pascal E. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6570-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 3–5 h and induced with 1 to 3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h. Induced cells were washed and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml DNase I, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 10 min. Glutathione-agarose purification was done as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Homodimer binding experiments were done using the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins without further purification. Heterodimer binding experiments were carried out after incubation of equimolar amounts of GSTp50 and GSTp65 for 30 min at 37 °C (19.Duckett C.S. Perkins N.D. Kowalik T.F. Schmid R.M. Huang E.S. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TATA-binding protein was a gift of Dr. B. Markham (Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research). Protein-DNA complex formation was measured by the method of Riggs et. al. (20.Riggs A.D. Suzuki H. Bourgeoss S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) as described briefly below. DNA probe (32P-β-interferon NF-κB site 20-mer; 10 nm) was mixed with variable amounts of the competitor DNA prior to the addition of the GST-Rel fusion proteins. DNA-binding site sequences used are shown in TableI. Competitor DNA concentration varied from zero to 10 μm. Rel protein dimers (50 nmp50 homodimer, p65 homodimer, or the p50/p65 heterodimer) were incubated with the β-interferon probe and cold competitors in binding buffer (10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.4), 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 30 min. Following the incubation period, each reaction was filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon nitrocellulose 96-well filter plate; Millipore, Bedford, MA) which was pre-equilibrated with filter buffer (10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.4), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide). Each filter plate was then washed with filter buffer and dried. Filter plates were counted using a Microbeta 1450 liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). The degree of competition was determined as the percentage of specific counts retained on the filter in the presence of competitor compared with that in the absence of competitor. Each experimental point was done in triplicate and the average and error are reported for representative experiments (average error was less than 5%). The half-maximal concentration of competition was determined by nonlinear least squares fitting of the data sets to a simple logistic plus slope using the Origin analysis software package (MicroCal, MA).Table INF-κB site sequence variants used in this studyBinding sitesSequenceHu Ig-κGGGGATTTCCβ-InterferonGGGAAATTCCVCAM-63GGGATTTCCCVCAM-77GGGTTTCCCCp50 consensusGGGGATTCCCHu Ig-κ mutant 1GGGAATTTCCHu Ig-κ mutant 2GGGGAATTCCHIV LTRGGGACTTTCCMutantGCTCATAAACTATAGATATAATCCFlanking sequences 20-merGCCCT… … … .TTGAA 18-merCCCT… … … ··TTGADNA sites used in this report are shown.

Open table in a new tab DNA sites used in this report are shown. In each case, the decamer sequence was synthesized with the flanking regions shown. Complementary oligonucleotides were made to generate a blunt end. Oligonucleotides for the β-interferon, human Ig-κ, and HIV-binding site were synthesized with a single primary amine (Aminolink; ABI) at the 5′ end of the 18-mer using an ABI 294 DNA synthesizer. The primary amine was then conjugated to fluorescein using NHS-fluorescein (Molecular Probes). The fluorescein-conjugated oligonucleotide was then purified from unreacted oligonucleotide using gel electrophoresis. DNA was removed from the gel slice by crush and soak in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA buffer. Double stranded DNA-binding site was then prepared by reanealing to an unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide and again purified by gel electrophoresis. The annealed binding site was then used without further purification at a concentration of 2 nm for subsequent binding experiments unless otherwise noted. Polarization was measured using a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization system (PanVera, Madison, WI). Experiments were done in polarization binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and indicated concentration of NaCl or sodium acetate) at 37 °C. Labeled binding site was added to 0.5 ml of buffer in 10 × 75-mm tubes and the initial polarization reading was taken. Protein aliquots were then added to the tube and additional readings were taken until the readings did not change (within 2 min) and the last 2 readings were averaged in the data shown. The data from these experiments was plotted and fit to a hyperbola using the nonlinear curve fitting functions of Origin analysis software package (MicroCal, MA). DNA structure change was measured using oligonucleotide-binding sites labeled with both fluorescein and rhodamine at opposite ends using the same procedure as described above, except a rhodamine (Molecular Probes) labeled oligonucleotide was used instead of reannealing with an unlabeled oligonucleotide. A binding site length of 18 base pairs was used because some energy transfer was observed in the unbound DNA which was significantly increased in the presence of TATA-binding protein (TBP) in substrate containing the TATA-binding site. Fluorescence measurements were made using an SLM-Aminco SPF-500C spectrofluorimeter in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and indicated concentration of NaCl or sodium acetate) at 25 °C. Previous studies have shown that the alternative dimer forms prefer different DNA-binding site sequences (9.Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that can effect transcriptional activation (10.Perkins N.D. Schmid R.M. Duckett C.S. Leung K. Rice N.R. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

We have analyzed the relative affinities of several DNA-binding sites for p50/p50, p65/p65, or p50/p65 using purified fusion proteins and defined flanking sequences. Fig. 1 shows data for p65 homodimer and 3 different competitor DNA-binding sites. The data have been normalized to the concentration required to inhibit binding to 50% of the highest affinity competitor (TableII). As expected from previous studies, the order of apparent affinities for p50 homodimer is different from that of p65 homodimer. The apparent affinity for p65 homodimer binding to any of these sites varies over a 30-fold concentration range, while the range of apparent affinity for p50 homodimer with the same DNA-binding sites is less than 10-fold. The p50/p65 heterodimer order of apparent affinity is similar to that of p65, however, the range of apparent affinities for the p50/p65 heterodimer is smaller than that of p65 homodimer. Thus, in this set of binding sites, the p65 monomer seems to define the selectivity for the p50/p65 heterodimer complexes. Also, the smaller difference in apparent affinity observed for p50 homodimer, compared with p65 homodimer, suggests that p65 binding is more sensitive to DNA-binding site sequence than p50, for the DNA-binding sites tested.Table IIComparison of DNA-binding site preference between rel-protein dimersSiteSequenceRelative apparent affinityp65p50/p65p50β-InterferonGGGAAATTCC119Hu Ig-κ mutant 1GGGAATTTCC416VCAM-63GGGATTTCCC422Hu Ig-κGGGGATTTCC732Hu Ig-κ mutant 2GGGGAATTCC965HIV LTRGGGACTTTCC>30131VCAM-77GGGTTTCCCC>30173p50 consensusGGGGATTCCC>30182Binding experiments were done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data is reported as the IC50 values normalized to the competitor with the highest apparent affinity within a dimer form.

The list is arranged in order of highest to lowest apparent affinity for the p65 homodimer. Sequences are shown in the forward orientation (as found in their endogenous promoters) for convenience. The filter binding assay is useful for surveying many different sites, but a solution binding assay is preferred for detailed binding studies. Fluorescence polarization has been used to study protein association with fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide-binding sites. Labeled DNA alone shows low fluorescence polarization in solution (typically ∼60–80 millipolarization units). Upon addition of protein, the polarization increases to ∼180–200 millipolarization units for the protein-DNA complex. Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that the cellular activity of the human Igκ, β-interferon, and the HIV NF-κB DNA-binding sites are very different depending on the dimer composition, 3J. B. Marine and J. P. Menetski, unpublished observations. so these sites were chosen for examination. As shown in Fig.2 A, increasing the protein concentration increases the observed fluorescence polarization. This change can be observed for the three forms of NF-κB that have been tested (p50/p50, p50/p65, and p65/p65). For each site the starting polarization value of free DNA site was constant, however, the three sites did show slightly different polarization in the absence of protein (Igκ = ∼95, HIV = ∼90, and interferon = ∼110). The polarization value of free DNA-binding site has been subtracted from each data point for analysis. The data from the filter binding experiments showed that there was less of a change in affinity with binding site for p50 than observed for p65. This observation can be interpreted to suggest that p50 is less binding site selective than p65. Since selectivity is related to the difference between the affinity of the protein to nonspecific sites compared with that for specific sites, the ability of p50 homodimer and p65 homodimer to bind to an oligonucleotide that does not contain a consensus NF-κB-binding site was measured. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the fluorescence polarization of the nonspecific DNA-binding site increased with increasing concentration of p50 homodimer. A small change was observed only at high concentrations of p65 homodimer, suggesting that, under these conditions, p50 homodimer shows a higher apparent affinity for nonspecific DNA than p65 homodimer. These data can be compared with binding to a specific site and under the conditions tested, the difference between the binding affinity of p50 homodimer for a nonspecific site compared with a specific site is approximately 100–1,000, while that for p65 homodimer binding affinity is at least 1,000–10,000. The ionic dependence of NF-κB binding to the human Igκ, β-interferon, and the HIV NF-κB DNA-binding sites have been determined. Since, the relationship between the apparent dissociation constant and the ionic strength is related to the net number of ions displaced during complex formation (21.deHaseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4783-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 22.Record Jr., M.T. Anderson C.F. Lohman T.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 103-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar), differences in ionic strength dependence suggest differences in the structure of the protein-DNA complex. To understand the physical properties of the different protein-DNA complexes, the ionic strength dependence of DNA binding was determined for each of the protein dimer form and the different DNA-binding sites. The results from p50 titration of the β-interferon DNA-binding site are shown in Fig.3 at increasing sodium acetate concentrations. It is clear from these results that increasing the sodium acetate concentration increases the amount of protein required to approach saturation of the binding site. These data have been fit to determine the apparent dissociation constantsK D,app. As described elsewhere (23.Record Jr., M.T. Lohman M.L. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), the slope of the log K versus the log monovalent cation is equal to m′ψ, where m′ is the number of direct ionic interactions and ψ represents the number of thermodynamically bound cations to the polyanion. The log-log analysis for p50 or p65 homodimer or the p50/p65 heterodimer with the human Igκ, β-interferon, or the HIV NF-κB DNA-binding site is shown in Fig.4. The slopes from the data determined using the interferon (Fig. 4 A) and HIV (Fig. 4 B) sites are consistently 3–4 (Table III), for all of the protein forms tested. Interestingly, the human Igκ site (Fig. 4 C) shows a difference in the slopes observed with the p65 homodimer (3.4) compared with the p50 homodimer or the p50/p65 heterodimer (6.0 and 6.1, respectively). These data suggest that more ions are displaced upon complex formation with p50. Thus, the complexes formed with the human Igκ site must be structurally different in the complexes containing p50 compared with those formed with p65 alone.Figure 4Log-log analysis of apparent affinity sensitivity to ionic strength for several NF-κB-DNA complexes.

Open table in a new tab The data shown in Fig. 4 have been analyzed to determine the slope of the line for each data set and is reported. Binding reactions were done as described under “Experimental Procedures” for each dimer form and DNA-binding site. Because the p50 homodimer can bind to nonspecific DNA with an appreciable affinity, the ionic strength dependence of this interaction could also be determined. Apparent DNA binding affinity of p50 binding for a non-NF-κB-binding site were determined at several sodium acetate concentrations and the results were analyzed in a log-log analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 D, the apparent affinity of p50 homodimer for nonspecific DNA shows a reduced dependence on ionic strength compared with the specific site data (slope = 1.4). These results suggest that the contacts in the nonspecific DNA complex are not exactly the same as those found in the specific complex. Several reports have suggested that the anionic component of the buffer can effect binding affinity. In addition, the anion can also be found to effect the slope in a log-log analysis, suggesting that some of the ions displaced upon binding are anions (24.Menetski J.P. Varghese A. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10400-10404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Analysis of the effect on the anionic component on p50 homodimer binding is shown in Fig.5, however, similar data have been obtained for p65 homodimer. Substitution of chloride for acetate significantly reduces the apparent affinity of p50 homodimer for DNA. However, the slope of the log-log analysis is the same for chloride or acetate. Thus, although the apparent affinity of DNA binding is affected the net number of ions displaced is unchanged. Since the ionic strength dependence data suggest that there is a difference in the structure of the protein-DNA complex, the molecular change could be in a change in the DNA, a change in the protein or both. NF-κB binding to DNA has been shown to bend DNA or not bend DNA depending on the report and the method of measurement. The structure of the DNA-binding site in solution can be determined using fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a fluorescence donor and acceptor at opposite ends of the DNA, as changes in the end to end distance of the oligonucleotide would be expected to accompany bending (26.Gohlke C.

Using fluorescein and rhodamine as fluorescence donor and acceptor, respectively, we have measured changes in DNA bending of short oligonucleotides (18-mers) containing a single DNA-binding site in solution. As a control for the technique, we have also measured transfer using an oligonucleotide containing a TATA-binding site and TBP, which is known to bend upon protein binding (30.Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 A, the spectrum of the double-labeled TATA site DNA, in the absence of TBP, shows a slight transfer as seen in the small peak at 600–620 nm. Addition of TBP significantly increases the transfer to the acceptor and increases the peak in this region. There is also a strong decrease in the fluorescence associated with fluorescein, the donor, as is expected with increased transfer efficiency. Since, a difference was observed in the ionic strength dependence of p50-human Igκ and interferon-binding site, these complexes were tested for changes in fluorescence energy transfer. As shown, binding of p50 has no effect on the overall fluorescence energy transfer observed for the human Igκ or the interferon DNA-binding site (Fig. 6, B andC, respectively). These experiments are done under conditions where binding occurs at the protein concentrations tested and this has been verified using polarization. These data suggest that protein binding to this oligonucleotide does not make a net change in the end to end distance of the oligonucleotide. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the structure of the DNA molecule does not change substantially in these experiments. In this report, we assess the biochemical characteristics of NF-κB-DNA complex formation with several different sites. These analysis has lead to several conclusions. The p50 homodimer shows less selectivity of DNA-binding site sequence than the p65 homodimer. Also, the ionic strength dependence of complex formation is dependent on both the NF-κB dimer form and the DNA-binding site sequence. Finally, the apparent affinity of the NF-κB protein for DNA is influenced by the anionic component of the buffer. This type of physical data, along with models of the protein from x-ray crystallographic studies is necessary for understanding the determinants of DNA binding specificity and how they relate to the structure of the protein-DNA complex. While studying DNA-binding site selectivity, the interaction with nonspecific DNA has also been addressed. The data show that p50 binds to nonspecific DNA with a higher apparent affinity than p65 under the conditions tested. We can define specificity of binding to a DNA sequence as the ratio of the apparent affinity for a specific DNA-binding site sequence divided by the apparent affinity for nonspecific DNA. For p50, this comparison is complicated by the finding that the ionic strength dependence for specific and nonspecific binding sites is different. The data show that the specificity of p50 for a specific sequence decreases as ionic strength increases, because nonspecific binding is less sensitive to ionic strength than specific binding. A comparison of p50 specificity at several sodium acetate concentrations shows that at low ionic strength (∼50 mm) the specificity of binding is between 100 and 4000 depending on the site, but a physiological ionic strength the specificity is significantly lower (5.Weih F.

The significance of this result is unclear, however, these experiments were done using short DNA-binding sites (18 nucleotides) and we have observed that the apparent affinity of DNA binding is very sensitive to binding site length (data not shown). It is possible that the apparent affinity dependence on length is a consequence of the nonspecific affinity and is a mechanism used by p50 to find specific DNA-binding sites. Thus, in the context of a longer DNA sequence the apparent affinity of a specific site might increase, which would increase the overall specificity. However, further analysis of this interaction would be required to test this hypothesis. The selectivity of different forms of NF-κB has been previously described (9.Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the amino acid sequences of the monomers are different, it was assumed that the selectivity arose exclusively from different amino acid-nucleotide base contacts. Recent descriptions of the structures of NF-κB-DNA complexes have shown that many hydrogen bonds are made between the protein monomer and the bases in the DNA-binding site (13.Muller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 14.Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B.

Ghosh S. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Five amino acids in the p50 monomer appear to make direct hydrogen bonds to bases and two of these are different between p50 and p65 (His67 → Ala; and Lys244→ Arg) allowing for differences in hydrogen bonding patterns. The reported structures for Rel family proteins (13.Muller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C.

Ghosh S. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) show that the major DNA recognition amino acids are found on a loop between two β-sheet structures. In the absence of DNA, this loop has been suggested to be flexible since it is not contained in a defined secondary structure motif. These data suggest that the DNA-binding site of Rel family proteins is likely to be flexible enough to allow some movement when associated to DNA-binding site sequences other than those that are found in the crystal structures. Recently, the crystal structure of the p65-DNA complex has been described to have structural differences in the DNA-binding domains of the two monomers (16.Chen Y.Q. Ghosh S. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The ionic strength dependence of the affinity of a protein for DNA is related to the number of ions released to solvent upon complex formation (22.Record Jr., M.T. Anderson C.F. Lohman T.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 103-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). If the number of ions released changes, it may be related to a change in the structure of the protein. The change in the ionic strength dependence of NF-κB-DNA complex formation described in this report, suggest that the structure of the p50-DNA complex containing either the β-interferon or the hu Igκ sites are different. These results are consistent with the structural changes observed in the p65 homodimer crystals. Thus, this data provides physical evidence for flexibility in the DNA-binding site of p50 that depends on the DNA-binding site sequence. In addition the data suggests that, along with different amino acid contacts, the structure of the protein may be altered when bound to different DNA-binding site sequences. Thus, these data are consistent with a model of NF-κB binding to DNA that allows some variations in the DNA-binding domain of the protein to accommodate different DNA-binding site sequences. This model might explain why only some NF-κB DNA-binding sites promote cooperative interactions with other transcription factors or accessory proteins like high mobility group-I(Y) (31.Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the alternative structures are associated with NF-κB transcriptional activity directly, as some strong p65 homodimer DNA-binding sites are found to be very poor activators of transcription (32.Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Song Z. Zubkoff I.D. Abdulkadir S.A. Thanos D. Ono S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, the alternative structures of NF-κB complexes may add another level of regulation to transcription by this complex by using the DNA-binding site as an allosteric effector of NF-κB activity.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 686-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) has been documented. Nevertheless, this kind of requirement is not a widespread phenomenon (18.Pollard K.J. Peterson C.L. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and in some instances, these complexes act as negative regulators (19.Holstege F.C.P. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Activation of genes involved in galactose or phosphate metabolism, for example, requires the function of their specific DNA binding transcription factors, the Gal4p and the Pho4p proteins, respectively. In these instances, the dependence on the above mentioned chromatin remodeling complexes stands only in particular cases, in which the activators function gets weakened (20.Gaudreau L. Schmid A. Blaschke D. Ptashne M. Hörz W. Cell. 1997; 89: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21.Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). One of the unresolved questions concerns the real function of DNA binding transcription factors. Two scenarios were proposed. 1) the most important function of activators is to directly favor the recruitment of the transcription initiation complex, which in turn modifies the nucleosome structure, as in the case of Gal4p (10.Axelrod J.D. Reagan M.S. Majors J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22.Stafford G.A. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), Pho4p (20.Gaudreau L. Schmid A. Blaschke D. Ptashne M. Hörz W. Cell. 1997; 89: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21.Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), and estrogen receptor derivatives produced in S. cerevisiae(23.Pham T.A. Hwung Y.-P. McDonnell D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18179-18187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and 2) the regulatory role of positive factors implies a first step in which transcription-independent binding of the activator to its target promoter allows the establishment of a specific architecture that favors the subsequent contact between the activation domain and the transcription initiation complex. Evidence in support of this second hypothesis has been presented recently: yeast mutants defective in TATA-binding protein function are able to remodel chromatin at the CHA1 locus (24.Moreira J.M.A. Holmberg S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6028-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have used the ADH2 promoter coding for the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase II as a model system to investigate this problem. This gene is tightly repressed by glucose and is derepressed when the glucose content of the medium is lowered. During derepression, the promoter undergoes structural changes at the level of a few nucleosomes, mainly the –1 and +1 nucleosomes, containing the TATA box and the RNA initiation sites, respectively (25.Verdone L. Camilloni G. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1978-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated (25.Verdone L. Camilloni G. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1978-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that this chromatin remodeling requires the transcription factor Adr1p (26.Denis C.L. Ciriacy M. Young E.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which also activates genes involved in peroxisome biogenesis and glycerol metabolism. Here, we show that a major component of the SWI/SNF complex is not required for the wild type chromosomal ADH2 derepression. Furthermore, to understand the role of individual Adr1p domains in the steps leading to ADH2 derepression, we analyzed the function of a group of constructs coding for portions of the regulatory molecule. In cells containing the Adr1p DNA binding domain alone, in the absence of transcription, a predominant change in the structure of the TATA box containing nucleosome –1 was seen. When a small acidic domain of 43 amino acids recently characterized to possess the strongest activation potential of the entire Adr1p molecule (27.Young E.T. Saario J. Kacherovsky N. Chao A. Sloan J.S. Dombek K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32080-32087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was added to the DNA binding domain, a qualitatively different nucleosome modification was observed, and at the same time, ADH2transcription level reached its maximum. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were as follows: CY26 (MATα,SWI/ADR6, ura3–52,lys2–801 a, ade2–101 o,trp1-Δ1, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1), CY58 (MATa, same as CY26 exceptswi1::LEU2;, JSY112 (MATα, same as CY26 except adr1::LEU2), and EPY10 (MATa, same as CY26 except adr1::LEU2,swi1::LEU2). Yeast strains carrying no plasmid were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto peptone, 3% glucose). To obtain ADH2derepression, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with water, and resuspended in the same volume of fresh YP medium containing 0.05% glucose for the appropriate time. Cells carrying the plasmids described below were grown in YNB medium (0.68% yeast nitrogen base) supplemented with the required amino acids and 3 or 0.05% glucose. For yeast transformations, cells were made competent by treatment with lithium acetate (28.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Adr1p derivatives used were as follows: pADR1Δ172, consisting of the first 172 amino acids of Adr1p inserted in pRS314 (CEN6, ARSH4, andTRP1); pADR1Δ172-AD, same as above with the addition of a peptide containing amino acids 420–462 of Adr1p; and pADR1 s, consisting of the entire ADR1 gene inserted in pRS314. The construction of these molecules has been described previously (27.Young E.T. Saario J. Kacherovsky N. Chao A. Sloan J.S. Dombek K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32080-32087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These plasmids were used to transform theadr1 disrupted strain JSY112. As a control, the same strain was also transformed with the vector pKD8 (CEN3,ARS1, and TRP1). pFA plasmid DNA (29.Verdone L. Cesari F. Denis C.L. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30828-30834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used to prepare the probe for the indirect end labeling analysis and as deproteinized material for control reactions with micrococcal nuclease (MN).1 The analysis of nucleosome position and/or structure was performed by using MN digestion of spheroplasts coupled with the indirect end labeling procedure (30.Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Cells exponentially growing (A 600 0.5/ml) inADH2 repressing (3% glucose) or derepressing (0.05% glucose) conditions were washed once with water and then resuspended in zymolyase buffer (1 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Incubation with zymolyase was for 20 min at 30 °C. The resulting spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in nystatin buffer (1 msorbitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml nystatin) in order to permeabilize cell membranes for the subsequent treatment with MN. (For more details on the use of nystatin for chromatin analysis, see Ref. 31.Venditti S. Camilloni G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar.) Incubation with MN was for 15 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped with 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS (final concentrations). The samples were then treated with proteinase K for 2 h at 56 °C and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. After secondary digestion with the appropriate restriction endonuclease, the samples were run on 1.5% agarose gels in Tris-borate TBE buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Southern blot and hybridization were performed by standard procedures. Aliquots containing the same number of cells were collected by centrifugation, and total RNA was prepared as described previously (32.Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). After spectrophotometric determination of the RNA amount present in each aliquot, 10 μg of RNA were loaded onto 1.2% agarose-MOPS gels containing formaldehyde and ethidium bromide. Northern blot analysis was performed by standard procedures. For hybridization, a 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-GTTGGTAGCCTTAACGACTGCGCTAAC-3′) specific for the ADH2gene (from +710 to +684 of the coding region) was used. Fig. 1 shows the chromatin structure of the repressed ADH2 promoter, with the position of the three relevant nucleosomes relative to the regulatory and basal transcription elements. Upstream activating sequence 1 (UAS1) is a 22-base pair palindromic sequence recognized by the DNA binding transcription factor Adr1p (33.Shuster J., Yu, J. Cox D. Chan R.V.L. Smith M. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1894-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); UAS2 contains the consensus sequence for several proteins including Adr1p (34.Eisen A. Taylor W.E. Blumberg H. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4552-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The high resolution mapping of this region, showing the peculiar organization in families of octamer particles with the same rotational orientation, was described previously (25.Verdone L. Camilloni G. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1978-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When the sequencing of the yeast genome was completed, we became aware of the presence of a divergently located transcription unit, the putative TATA box of which turned out to be protected by the upstream edge of nucleosome –2. The ADH2 promoter is derepressed when the glucose content of the medium is lowered. The nucleosomes –1 and +1, protecting the TATA box and the RNA initiation sites, respectively, undergo a structural modification (25.Verdone L. Camilloni G. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1978-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) extending to the nucleosomes +2 and –2, which is actually part of the adjacent transcription unit. We have shown that the RNA polymerase II catalytic subunit is not required for this modification, suggesting that the transcription process per se, at least at the elongation step, is not the cause of the change (29.Verdone L. Cesari F. Denis C.L. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30828-30834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Up to now, Adr1p is the only protein shown to be required for the chromatin remodeling at the ADH2 promoter. We therefore looked at additional factors involved: the result of the analysis of a strain containing a disruption of the SWI1gene is described below. ADR6 was initially identified in a screen for mutants able to decrease Ty-activated ADH2 expression, and it was shown to be required also for ADH2 + expression, when the derepressing carbon source is glycerol (35.Taguchi A.K.W. Young E.T. Genetics. 1987; 116: 523-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Taguchi A.K.W. Young E.T. Genetics. 1987; 116: 531-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheADR6 gene was subsequently shown to be identical toSWI1 (37.Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1992; 68: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, required for the transcription of a subset of S. cerevisiae genes (19.Holstege F.C.P. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). More recently, a snf2deletion was shown to have no effect on the ability ofLexA-ADR1 fusions to activate a LexA-lacZreporter (38.Chiang Y.-C. Komarnitsky P. Chase D. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32359-32365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested directly whether in the normal chromosomal context, the accumulation of mRNA from the ADH2 promoter was affected by a SWI1 disruption. Fig. 2shows the results of a comparison among four isogenic strains:SWI1-ADR1, swi1-ADR1,swi1-adr1, and SWI1-adr1. This comparison provides a complete picture of the effect of disruptingSWI1, in both the presence and the absence of the major activator of the system. ADH2 derepression, obtained by lowering the glucose content of the medium to 0.05%, is clearly not influenced by a disruption of SWI1 (Fig. 2, second group of samples from left), whereas the lack of ADR1(fourth group) strongly reduces transcription, as expected. Interestingly, when both functions are lost, as in theswi1-adr1 strain, ADH2 transcription is almost totally turned off (Fig. 2, third group of samples fromleft), suggesting a role for SWI1 in theADR1-independent mRNA accumulation. As a control for a defect in SWI1 function, we have rehybridized the same filter with a probe for a Ty element, transcription of which is known to be reduced in SWI/SNF defective strains (39.Happel A.M. Swanson M.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1991; 128: 69-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); consistent with this observation, we found that Ty mRNA is missing in theswi1 disrupted strains (Fig. 2, second and third groups fromleft). We next analyzed the chromatin structure of isogenicADR1-SWI1 and ADR1-swi1strains. The results are shown in Fig. 3: consistent with the lack of influence of SWI1 onADH2 transcription, chromatin remodeling at theADH2 promoter occurs also in the swi1 defective strain (second group of samples) when the cells are incubated in derepressing medium (0.05% glucose). The nucleosomal organization of an isogenic adr1-SWI1 strain in the same conditions is shown in parallel to underline the relevance of ADR1 function in the structural modifications that accompany ADH2derepression. When ADR1 is disrupted, the further disruption of SWI1 does not alter the chromatin pattern which maintains the repressed configuration (data not shown). We conclude that derepression of the ADH2 promoter, in its normal chromosomal location, does not require a functional copy of theSWI1 gene. In a previous study (29.Verdone L. Cesari F. Denis C.L. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30828-30834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we searched for factors required for chromatin remodeling at the ADH2 promoter: most of the factors we have analyzed are involved in the control of mRNA accumulation but do not affect nucleosome structure. No factor was found to influence remodeling without affecting transcription, suggesting a dependence of the second event on the first. Because up to now the only factor required for both remodeling and transcription has been the Adr1p activating protein, we asked whether the chromatin modifying activity present in Adr1p is distinct from its function as transcriptional activator. This question has already been addressed in the case of other two proteins, the Gal4p activator (10.Axelrod J.D. Reagan M.S. Majors J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,22.Stafford G.A. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the Pho4p activator, which drives remodeling and transcription at the PHO5 promoter (40.Svaren J. Schmitz J. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4856-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this latter case, the two activities (nucleosome reconfiguration and transcriptional activation) could not be separated, as both were associated with a small region of the Pho4p activation domain (41.McAndrew P.C. Svaren J. Martin S.R. Hörz W. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5818-5827Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). No chromatin remodeling was observed when utilizing the DNA binding domain only (40.Svaren J. Schmitz J. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4856-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, we have readdressed this problem in the case of the Adr1p activator. Because of the large size of this factor, we analyzed a reduced version of Adr1p, recently characterized by Young et al. (27.Young E.T. Saario J. Kacherovsky N. Chao A. Sloan J.S. Dombek K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32080-32087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This molecule consists of the two zinc finger DNA binding domain, which is known to interact with the UAS1 sequence in the ADH2promoter (34.Eisen A. Taylor W.E. Blumberg H. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4552-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), fused to a 43-amino acid (amino acids 420–462) acidic domain, which has been shown to be the strongest activation domain of the entire Adr1p (27.Young E.T. Saario J. Kacherovsky N. Chao A. Sloan J.S. Dombek K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32080-32087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The natural nuclear targeting signal (42.Thukral S.K. Tavianini M.A. Blumberg H. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2360-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) is included at the N terminus of the molecule. Fig.4 A illustrates the constructs we have used for our analysis: (i) the DNA binding domain (181 aa); (ii) the DNA binding domain fused to the 43-amino acid activation domain (238 aa); and (iii) the full-length protein (1323 aa). The construction of these molecules was described previously (27.Young E.T. Saario J. Kacherovsky N. Chao A. Sloan J.S. Dombek K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32080-32087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Transcription of all of these constructs is driven by theADR1 natural promoter on centromeric plasmids that we used to transform an ADR1 disrupted strain. Fig. 4 B shows the results of a comparative analysis ofADH2 mRNA accumulation in derepressing conditions for the various Adr1p derivatives. When the ADR1 disrupted strain was transformed with the vector alone (Fig. 4 B, first group of samples from left) or with the plasmid containing the Adr1p DNA binding domain (second group), transcription was very low. When the construct containing both the DNA binding and the activation domains (Fig. 4 B, third group fromleft) was used for transformation, the kinetics of mRNA accumulation was almost indistinguishable from that shown by the plasmid containing the entire protein (fourth group). The transcriptional behavior of these four constructs is in agreement with the ADHII enzyme levels described recently (27.Young E.T. Saario J. Kacherovsky N. Chao A. Sloan J.S. Dombek K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32080-32087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In order to understand whether the nucleosome modifications occurring at the ADH2 promoter are the direct consequence of the presence of the Adr1p activation domain or are induced by the binding of the protein to DNA, we analyzed the chromatin structure of theADH2 promoter in the presence of the various Adr1p derivatives in derepressing conditions (0.05% glucose, for 3 h). Fig. 5 shows the following results: (i) in the case of the vector alone (first group of samples) chromatin remodeling did not occur, as expected; (ii) when only the DNA binding domain was present (second group of samples from left), a change in the structure of nucleosomes –1 and +1 was observed. In particular, this change consists of two bands appearing at the level of the –1 nucleosome and one band at the level of the +1.Arrowheads in Fig. 5 indicate the MN cleavage products that are present also in the in vitro treated samples (lane N), whereas an asterisk indicates the MN cleavage product that is present exclusively in the in vivo samples. The band with the asterisk is located halfway between the UAS1 sequence (recognized by Adr1p) and the TATA box, close to a poly(dA) tract of 20 adenines. The fact that this band is not visible in the in vitro treated sample at the level of the –1 nucleosome suggests that it is not due to loosening of DNA histones contacts but rather to a local DNA deformation on the surface of that nucleosome or alternatively to a redistribution of its borders (see under “Discussion”). The MN sensitivities induced by the Adr1p DNA binding domain alone disappeared at the highest enzyme dose used. (iii) When the construct containing the DNA binding domain plus the 43-amino acid activation domain was tested (Fig. 5, third group of samples fromleft), the same chromatin remodeling occurred as was observed previously with the entire Adr1p (see Refs. 25.Verdone L. Camilloni G. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1978-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and 29.Verdone L. Cesari F. Denis C.L. Di Mauro E. Caserta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30828-30834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and Fig.3). This remodeling is identified by the appearance of the two bands also visible in the in vitro treated sample at the level of the –1 and +1 nucleosomes. In this case, the band marked with theasterisk in Fig. 5 was not observed. The MN sensitivities induced by the construct containing both Adr1p domains were still visible, although less intense, at the highest enzyme dose used. The nucleosome modification induced by the Adr1p DNA binding domain in the absence of transcription is therefore distinct both qualitatively and quantitatively from that observed when the transcriptional activation domain is also present. Because of the difference in nucleosome modifications observed in the absence or in the presence of the Adr1p activation domain, we analyzed more carefully the chromatin remodeling induced by the full-length transcription factor. Fig.6 A shows the results obtained by using low MN amounts on spheroplasts from wild type cells grown in derepressing conditions for a short length of time (0.05% glucose for 1 h). The very first alteration induced is visible on the –1 nucleosome and is marked with an asterisk; this band is not present in the in vitro treated sample and coincides with that observed in the presence of the Adr1p DNA binding domain alone (Fig. 5, asterisk). At increasing amounts of MN, the efficiency of cleavage at this site decreased, whereas the two bands marked with arrowheads in Fig. 6 A,present in the –1 and +1 nucleosomes, became more and more visible. Therefore, by using low MN amounts and early derepression times (1 h), it is possible to distinguish the very first modification occurring in the TATA box containing nucleosome –1 at the ADH2 locusin vivo. This modification is due to the binding of the Adr1p transcription factor to UAS1, in close proximity to the first altered nucleosome; in fact, it can also be observed in the absence of the Adr1p activation domain (see Fig. 5). As derepression proceeded, both nucleosomes –1 and +1 showed a significant loss of protection of the two MN cleavage sites marked by arrowheads in Figs. 5and 6, suggesting loosening of DNA histone contacts. We conclude that chromatin remodeling driven by the full-length Adr1p molecule is characterized by two kinetically distinct nucleosome modifications, one due to the binding of the protein to DNA and the other one induced by its activation domain. Fig. 6 B shows the results of a similar analysis performed with the ADR1-swi1 strain: in agreement with the lack of requirement of the SWI1 function in the ADH2 chromatin remodeling (see Fig. 3), the MN cleavage site induced by the Adr1p DNA binding domain in the nucleosome –1 (asterisk) is visible also in this mutant strain. Nevertheless, the TATA box containing nucleosome –1 becomes accessible to MN in wild type (Fig. 6 A) and swi1 (Fig. 6 B) cells following different kinetics. We have shown that the chromatin remodeling that occurs at theS. cerevisiae ADH2 promoter upon derepression is characterized by two distinct structural alterations. The first consists of a localized modification induced by the Adr1p DNA binding domain at the level of the nucleosome –1 (see the band marked with anasterisk in Figs. 5 and 6); this cleavage site, appearing under derepressing conditions on the particle containing the TATA box, is located halfway between the UAS1, where Adr1p binds, and the TATA box. This early remodeling step occurs in the absence of transcription, as shown by the fact that after lowering the glucose content of the medium, the ADH2 mRNA level accumulated in theADR1 disrupted strain transformed with the Adr1p DNA binding domain does not differ from the level obtained in the ADR1disrupted strain transformed with the control vector. The MN sensitivity induced by the DNA binding domain in derepressing conditions is not present in the naked sample, suggesting a localized deformation on the surface of nucleosome –1 that can be recognized by MN. Alternatively, the new band could be due to a redistribution of the upstream borders of nucleosome –1 as a consequence of Adr1p binding to UAS1. A MN cleavage site with very similar characteristic has been recently described in the case of Gal4p binding to episomal DNA (43.Balasubramanian B. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2977-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The second type of structural alteration, induced when the activation domain is also present, is more stable and involves both nucleosomes –1 and +1; this latter particle contains the RNA initiation sites. In this case, the two MN cleavage sites, showing up in derepressing conditions, coincide with those visible in the naked sample at the level of nucleosomes –1 and +1, suggesting a partial unwrapping of these particles in conditions in which the transcription is on. A simplified scheme of these findings is shown in Fig.7, in which three possible states of theADH2 promoter are presented. In the absence of Adr1p, theADH2 promoter remains structurally and functionally inactive when the cells are shifted to derepressing conditions. In the presence of the Adr1p DNA binding domain alone, a localized modification on the –1 nucleosome, in the vicinity of the UAS1 sequence, occurs: the promoter is structurally derepressed but functionally inactive. When the Adr1p activation domain is also present, a distinct structural alteration occurs at the transcribing ADH2 locus: the promoter is fully derepressed and functionally active. The three possible states of the promoter, due to the absence or the presence of different Adr1p portions, can be considered as an ordered sequence of events occurring at the ADH2 locus during derepression. We believe that the observed differences are not due to a reduced binding ability of the small 181-amino acid construct for the following reasons: (i) in vitro gel retardation assay with these derivatives has shown that the binding abilities of the 181- and 238-amino acid constructs are equivalent (27.Young E.T. Saario J. Kacherovsky N. Chao A. Sloan J.S. Dombek K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32080-32087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); and (ii) the difference between the two types of structural modification is qualitative and not only quantitative. The observation that the chromatin remodeling induced by two different domains of the same protein, the Adr1p transcription factor, are qualitatively different is novel. In fact, in the case of the Pho4p activator, it is clear that no cromatin remodeling occurs when utilizing the DNA binding domain only (40.Svaren J. Schmitz J. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4856-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As for the Gal4p transcription factor, it appears that derivatives lacking the activation domain are still able to reconfigure nucleosomes on episomal DNA, although to a lesser extent (22.Stafford G.A. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 44.Morse R.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this latter case, the chromatin alterations observed in the absence or in the presence of the activation domain are equal but quantitatively different. In the case of Adr1p, however, we find that the DNA binding and the activation domains are able to induce two qualitatively different types of structural modification at the ADH2 promoter in its natural chromosomal location. The existence of two steps in the process of chromatin remodeling during derepression, one of which occurs in the absence of the transcription factor activation domain, suggests that at least two functions can be attributed to Adr1p. First, the protein reconfigures nucleosomes in the immediate vicinity of its binding site allowing the basal promoter elements to assume the most appropriate structure for the subsequent activation. Second, the protein recruits the transcription machinery through its activation domain, allowing mRNA accumulation. Therefore, a DNA binding factor plays a role in overcoming nucleosome-exerted repression as a prerequisite for transcriptional activation and not as a trivial consequence of RNA polymerase II recruitment, as suggested (20.Gaudreau L. Schmid A. Blaschke D. Ptashne M. Hörz W. Cell. 1997; 89: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21.Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). A recent study of theCHA1 promoter in yeast has shown that mutants defective in TBP function are still able to remodel chromatin (24.Moreira J.M.A. Holmberg S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6028-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar): based on the proposal of a two-step mechanism in the response to acidic activatorsin vivo by TBP (45.Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Trends. Genet. 1996; 12: 311-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the authors suggest that remodeling of the nucleosome covering the TATA sequence would precede the formation of a stable preinitiation complex. Our results strongly favor this model. The two distinct nucleosome modifications, characterizing theADH2 promoter, are also in agreement with a recent work demonstrating an ordered recruitment of transcription and chromatin remodeling factors in the case of a cell cycle-regulated promoter (46.Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In a speculative model of control of gene expression at the level of transcription initiation, the existence of two separate events could represent an energy saving mechanism. Each event would offer an opportunity for regulation and, in case of unfavorable conditions, the activation of a specific gene could be blocked after the earliest step of derepression. The separation between the two steps will be useful in the search for factors involved in the two types of structural modification. We have investigated the role of the ADR6/SWI1 gene, a member of the SWI/SNF protein complex, in wild type chromosomalADH2 derepression and found that it is not required for nucleosome modification and transcription. This result is in contrast with previous work showing ADR6/SWI1 involvement inADH2 expression (35.Taguchi A.K.W. Young E.T. Genetics. 1987; 116: 523-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Taguchi A.K.W. Young E.T. Genetics. 1987; 116: 531-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1992; 68: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The discrepancy could be due to the different derepressing conditions used: here, we utilized low (0.05%) glucose for a few hours, whereas in the previous works, either glycerol (35.Taguchi A.K.W. Young E.T. Genetics. 1987; 116: 523-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Taguchi A.K.W. Young E.T. Genetics. 1987; 116: 531-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or glycerol, ethanol, and sucrose for at least 20 generations (37.Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1992; 68: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) were utilized. The requirement of SWI1 in the constitutive ADH2 expression, driven by insertion of Ty elements (35.Taguchi A.K.W. Young E.T. Genetics. 1987; 116: 523-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can be explained as follows: the UAS1 sequence, where Adr1p binds, is no longer adjacent to the upstream borders of the nucleosome –1, because of the inserted elements, and the function of the activator becomes weakened. It could be argued that the simplest situation is the one in which a DNA binding transactivator works alone to drive nucleosome reconfiguration, whereas in the presence of a more complex promoter architecture, the requirement of additional protein systems is fundamental. An easy prediction would be that in higher eukaryotes, the majority of the genes require one of the numerous chromatin remodeling complexes recently characterized (6.Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 47.Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 48.Travers A.A.

https://openalex.org/W1991082655,"Abstract Structural analysis of thebc 1 complex suggests that the extramembrane domain of iron-sulfur protein (ISP) undergoes substantial movement during the catalytic cycle. Binding of Qo site inhibitors to this complex affects the mobility of ISP. Taking advantage of the difference in the pH dependence of the redox midpoint potentials of cytochromec 1 and ISP, we have measured electron transfer between the [2Fe-2S] cluster and heme c 1 in native and inhibitor-treated partially reduced cytochromebc 1 complexes. The rate of the pH-induced cytochrome c 1 reduction can be estimated by conventional stopped-flow techniques (t , 1–2 ms), whereas the rate of cytochrome c 1oxidation is too high for stopped-flow measurement. These results suggest that oxidized ISP has a higher mobility than reduced ISP and that the movement of reduced ISP may require an energy input from another component. In the 5-n-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole (UHDBT)-inhibited complex, the rate of cytochromec 1 reduction is greatly decreased to at of approximately 2.8 s. An even lower rate is observed with the stigmatellin-treated complex. These results support the idea that UHDBT and stigmatellin arrest the [2Fe-2S] cluster at a fixed position, 31 A from hemec 1, making electron transfer very slow."

ThelacUV5 promoter has been the object of many of these studies, and to date, an incredible wealth of information exists on how RNA polymerase interacts with this promoter. We have sought to expand current knowledge by the use of two chemical interference protocols, phosphate ethylation and missing nucleoside. We have added to existing information with the identification of additional phosphates, for example, at the start site of the template strand that, when ethylated, perturb the binding of RNA polymerase. We have also discovered a number of positions, most remarkably −37 to −34 of the nontemplate strand, where nucleoside loss decreases binding.

In Escherichia coli, the binding of RNA polymerase to the lacUV5 promoter provides a well studied example of protein-DNA interactions. The binding of RNA polymerase to this promoter has been studied using a wide range of techniques including mutagenesis of the promoter DNA or RNA polymerase, a variety of footprinting techniques, and numerous interference studies (1.Beckwith J.R.

Chem. 1986; 261: 10885-10890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).lacUV5 has been best studied because it is a strong promoter that works independently of activator proteins and sequences beyond the core −35 and −10 promoter elements. It also benefits from the fact that the lac operon has been a model system for studying both positive and negative transcription regulation for over 40 years. Despite the incredible depth of these studies, it would be of considerable value to determine the effects on RNA polymerase-promoter interaction caused by two types of DNA modification, phosphate ethylation and nucleoside removal. Ethylation interference can identify critical phosphate backbone contacts for protein-DNA interactions. Phosphate contacts are important to many protein-DNA interactions because the electrostatic interactions provide binding energy and increase the strength of the interaction. Electrostatic interactions have previously been demonstrated to be important for RNA polymerase-promoter interactions. For example, at λp R, approximately 20 positive ions are displaced from the phosphate backbone of the promoter in order for binding and open complex formation to be achieved (13.Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 14.Roe J.H. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1985; 14: 4721-4726Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The phosphates are a constant in the four deoxyribonucleotides. The consequence is that the phosphate backbone is relatively uniform regardless of the sequence of bases. Thus, mutation of the DNA sequence is not an option for studying the effects of specific protein-phosphate interactions during binding and open complex formation. Short of protein-DNA co-crystallography, ethylation interference is one of the few techniques available to investigate these fundamental interactions. Some data are already available concerning the effects of phosphate ethylation on RNA polymerase binding to lacUV5 (9.Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Cell. 1980; 20: 269-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 12.Shanblatt S.H. Revzin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10885-10890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ethylation interference assays have implicated the phosphates from −39 to −36, −18 to −14, −9, and −8 on the non-template strand and position −32 on the template strand as important for binding of RNA polymerase to lacUV5 (9.Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Cell. 1980; 20: 269-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 12.Shanblatt S.H. Revzin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10885-10890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phage T7 A1 promoter, which has a perfect −35 hexamer and strong activity in the absence of proteins other than RNA polymerase, displays patterns of ethylation interference (and patterns of G and A methylation protection and interference) remarkably similar to those of the lacUV5 promoter (8.Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 9.Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Cell. 1980; 20: 269-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). These ethylation interference experiments deserve to be revisited, since existing technology allows a more sensitive investigation into the effects of phosphate ethylation on binding and open complex formation at lacUV5. The missing nucleoside experiment can identify important specific contacts to bases in the promoter DNA (15.Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9521-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The missing nucleoside experiment relies on the use of hydroxyl radicals to generate DNA fragments lacking a single nucleoside. The hydroxyl radical treatment results in oxidative degradation of the deoxyribose and leads to destruction of the phosphate backbone and loss of the nucleoside at the position of modification (16.Hertzberg R.P. Dervan P.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3934-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The products are a 5′-phosphoryl group at one end and an equal mix of 3′-phosphoryl and 3′-phosphoglycolic acid at the other end. The modification results in base loss, breakage of the phosphate backbone, and the addition of two negative charges to the backbone (16.Hertzberg R.P. Dervan P.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3934-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The missing nucleoside technique, which has not been used on thelacUV5 promoter prior to this study, offers an advantage over the traditional techniques used to study specific contacts (promoter mutation or methylation interference) because it removes structure rather than altering or blocking existing DNA structure. Further, the missing nucleoside experiment is more general than methylation interference, because hydroxyl radicals modify all positions relatively equally. Other investigators have utilized the missing nucleoside experiment or similar techniques to study the ς70-dependent promoters T7 A1 (17.Werel W. Schickor P. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2589-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and ace P and rrnB P1 (18.Negre D. Bonod-Bidaud C. Oudot C. Prost J.F. Kolb A. Ishihama A. Cozzone A. Cortay J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). At T7 A1, nucleoside removal on the template strand from −34 to −31 and the 2–4 base pairs around −18 of both strands led to decreased affinity of RNA polymerase for the promoter (17.Werel W. Schickor P. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2589-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For ace P and rrnB P1, which have UP elements, enhanced affinity of RNA polymerase for promoter DNA was observed upon base elimination upstream of the −35 hexamer. At all of these ς70-dependent promoters and the phage promoters for T3, T7, and SP6 polymerases, base removal near the melting region (+2 to −14 for T7 A1, −5 to −15 for ace P and rrnB P1, and +3 to −5 for the phage promoters) enhanced RNA polymerase affinity for the DNA (17.Werel W. Schickor P. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2589-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18.Negre D. Bonod-Bidaud C. Oudot C. Prost J.F. Kolb A. Ishihama A. Cozzone A. Cortay J.C.

Chem. 1991; 266: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At λprmup-1Δ265, prenicking and depurination around the −10 region stimulated the rate of open complex formation (20.Li X.Y. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23558-23566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Finally, mismatches in the −10 region of λp Rincreased the rate of open complex formation (21.Roberts C.W. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Studies presented in this report identify the critical nucleoside contacts for RNA polymerase binding to lacUV5 and extend the available ethylation interference data to new positions. Additionally, the strand specificity of ethylation interference near the start site and the −10 hexamer support current models of initiation that require different roles for each strand. Finally, some bases within thelacUV5 promoter, when modified either by ethylation or hydroxyl radicals prior to RNA polymerase incubation, result in increased binding of the protein. This is a novel observation at thelacUV5 promoter. In all experiments, a DNA fragment extending from +60 to −180 of the lacUV5 promoter was end-labeled with 32P. The fragment was 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) or 3′-end-labeled with avian myeloblastosis virus super reverse transcriptase (Molecular Genetics Resources). RNA polymerase was supplied by Epicentre Technologies. The goal of this protocol was to generate DNA fragments that had one or less ethylated base per molecule. To achieve this end, conditions were adjusted so that approximately 30% or fewer of the molecules were modified (gel analysis indicated that 30% of the molecules were less than full-length). End-labeled DNA fragments were resuspended in 50 mm calcium cacodylate (Sigma) and added to an equal volume of ethanol saturated with ethylnitrosourea (Sigma). This mixture was heated at 50 °C for one hour. The mixture was ethanol precipitated five times followed by a 70% ethanol wash to remove excess ethylnitrosourea. Ethylated DNA was resuspended in water prior to use. Typically 0.5–2.5 nm DNA fragment was incubated with 100 nm RNA polymerase for various times at 37 °C in 100-μl reactions. The binding buffer was 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm cAMP, and glycerol to 2.5%. At the completion of binding, 20 ng/μl heparin was added, and the complexes were challenged for 1 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, bound DNA molecules were fractionated from free DNA molecules by filter binding or nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fragments were recovered, heated at 90 °C in 0.15 m NaOH to hydrolyze the DNA at the position of ethylation, and bands were resolved with 8 m urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and exposed to a storage phosphor screen, and data were analyzed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Densitometric traces are provided below. A sample gel is shown in Fig. 1. End-labeled DNA fragments were modified at a rate of a single hit per molecule via the Fenton reaction (16.Hertzberg R.P. Dervan P.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3934-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This was verified via gel analysis, as described above. 40 μl of DNA were added to 60 μl of buffer containing 4 mm(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 8 mm EDTA, 14 mm sodium ascorbate and 0.01% H2O2. The reaction was terminated after 4 min, and the DNA was precipitated, washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in water prior to use. Binding and analysis were as described above except that alkali treatment was not required for analysis. ThelacUV5 promoter is considered a strong ς70-dependent promoter. It has a perfect −10 hexamer sequence and drives the expression of the lac operon independently of CAP. RNA polymerase (the holoenzyme containing ς70) binding to a promoter depends in large part on the match of the promoter core sequence to the consensus for ς70 promoters. RNA polymerase binding tolacUV5 in vitro is, as expected, quite strong. In fact, while the wild-type lac promoter gives primarily RNA polymerase complexes with an overlapping promoter-like sequence, P2,lacUV5 exhibits binding only at the sequence expected for the biologically active promoter, P1 (7.Lorimer D.D. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2921-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 22.Peterson M.L. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We took advantage of these traits of lacUV5 to test the effects on binding and open complex formation of phosphate ethylation and loss of nucleosides within the promoter. Equilibrium binding was achieved by incubating RNA polymerase with the modified DNA for 30 min at 37 °C prior to challenging the complexes with heparin to enrich for open complexes and inactivate RNA polymerase molecules not bound in open complexes. Shorter RNA polymerase-DNA incubation periods were also examined. Analysis of the ethylation interference data reveals a pattern that is similar in a number of ways to previous data (9.Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Cell. 1980; 20: 269-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 12.Shanblatt S.H. Revzin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10885-10890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the effect of ethylation of both the nontemplate and template strands upon RNA polymerase binding. The curves are a sample from a set of experiments. Each experiment was performed at least two times and at various time points. The patterns of interference and stimulation of binding are similar among all experiments. On the nontemplate strand, ethylation of −40 to −35, −29 to −27, −22, −19 to −9, −7, +3, +4, +6, +8, +10, +14, and +15 exhibits interference with binding of RNA polymerase. On the template strand, positions −36 to −31, −29 to −27, −11 to −9, −4 to −2, +1 to +8, and +10 to +14 interfere with binding of RNA polymerase when ethyl groups are present on the phosphates. A significant pattern seen in these data is that ethylation of the nontemplate strand appears more detrimental to binding than ethylation of most positions on the template strand (with notable exceptions at −32, −4 to −2, and +3 to +4). The analysis also indicates that at some positions ethylation can enhance binding. On the nontemplate, these positions are −49 to −47, −45, −24, −6, −4, and −2 to +2; on the template strand they are −24 and −8 to −6. These data are also presented as difference plots in Fig.3.Figure 3Difference plot (bound − free) of ethylation interference at 30 min. Peak heights were measured, and the differences between the bound peak height and the free peak height for each position for the template and nontemplate strands were calculated. The results were plotted for all positions between −50 and +10. The peak height differences are shown in centimeters on they axis. Values greater than 0 indicate binding enhancement upon ethylation at that position. Values less than 0 indicate binding interference upon ethylation for that base.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the effect of lost nucleosides on binding is given in Fig.4. Data for the nontemplate strand indicate that loss of nucleosides from −9 to +4, +18, and +19 increases binding. Loss of the bases from −76 to −72, −70 to −68, −66 to −56, −52 to −40, −37 to −34, −23, −22, −20 to −17, −15, −13 to −10, +6, +7, and +10 to +16 all decrease binding. For the template strand, missing nucleoside data are only available for a 3-min incubation period. Loss of nucleosides from −44 to −42, −33 to −29, −21 to −19, and −14 to +4 increases binding, and loss of bases from −53 to −47, −40, and −39 decreases binding. We also performed time course experiments (using binding times from 0.5 to 3 min) for both the missing nucleoside and ethylation interference experiments. In general, the data were consistent among the various time points and were representative of the equilibrium results presented in Figs. 2 and 4. Thus, these data are not presented. Perhaps the most interesting result of this work is that the loss of potential contacts, either by removal of various nucleosides or by ethylation of the phosphate backbone, can increase the tendency of the DNA molecules to bind RNA polymerase and form open complexes. This enhancement of binding is present at equilibrium (Figs.2 and 4) as well as at various time points shortly after the addition of RNA polymerase (data not shown). Nucleoside loss in the missing base experiment can have four types of effects: 1) the loss of a base that participates in a protein-DNA contact; 2) possible perturbation in the backbone upon the removal of the base and sugar and generation of a gap in the phosphate chain; 3) the generation of two additional negative charges in the phosphate backbone; and 4) loss of interstrand hydrogen bonds (base pairing interactions) and base stacking interactions that could serve to destabilize the local helical structure. The increase in binding coincident with the loss of bases near the start site has seemingly clear consequences; it may aid in the melting of DNA at the start site upon open complex formation. Other investigators have reported similar effects with both ς70-dependent promoters and promoters for T3, T7, and SP6 bacteriophage polymerases (17.Werel W. Schickor P. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2589-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18.Negre D. Bonod-Bidaud C. Oudot C. Prost J.F. Kolb A. Ishihama A. Cozzone A. Cortay J.C.

Cell. 1996; 86: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In general, the increased affinity of RNA polymerase for the DNA was attributed to enhanced flexibility and/or disruption of the helix in this region, leading to stabilization of the RNA polymerase-promoter DNA complex and nucleation of DNA melting. Enhanced flexibility and/or helix disruption could contribute to the enhanced binding of RNA polymerase to thelacUV5 promoter upon nucleoside loss between −10 and +5. This model is supported by the lack of strand bias; base removal has similar effects for either strand between −10 and +5. It is not difficult to imagine that the loss of one partner in a base pair interaction in the melting region might decrease the energy input required to separate the DNA strands at the start site. Further, the generation of two additional negative charges in the phosphate backbone could promote strand separation and enhance melting. All of these mechanisms would make the formation of an open complex with that molecule more thermodynamically favorable than for a molecule unmodified in the melting region. An interesting observation in regard to this stimulation is apparent in a similar analysis of the wild-type lac promoter. Although the wild-type lac promoter shows some increase in binding with the loss of nucleosides near the P1 start site (likelacUV5), the major stimulation of binding occurs with the loss of nucleosides between −26 and −19 (data not shown). The P2 start site of lac is at −22. This suggests that destabilization of the P1 melting region will not significantly alter the balance between P2 and P1 distribution for RNA polymerase for the wild-type lac promoter sequence. In other words, the destabilization resulting from lost nucleosides does not appear to compensate for a suboptimal promoter sequence. Thus, it appears that nucleoside loss at the melted region and coincident stimulation of open complex formation is a general property of promoters and is not a response to a specific structural component of some ς70and phage promoters. Phosphate ethylation at the start site can also lead to enhanced open complex formation. Contrary to the missing nucleoside results, the enhancement that results from ethylation is strand-specific; nontemplate strand ethylation is stimulatory, while template strand ethylation is strongly inhibitory (discussed below). The data that demonstrate an interference with binding fit fairly well with published work as described above. The key difference is that this work expands the extent of positions that are critical for their phosphate contacts and defines the regions where loss of nucleosides alter binding of RNA polymerase atlacUV5. In terms of missing nucleosides, we expected to find that loss of the conserved positions would be the most severely detrimental to binding. However, none of the bases from −12 to −7 were strongly identified by this analysis. lacUV5 is a strong promoter, and its −10 hexamer is a perfect match to the consensus. Perhaps this promoter has so many optimal contacts that loss of a single one in any molecule is insufficient to perturb the binding in this assay. It is also possible that the decreased binding energy due to a lost −10 region contact is compensated by facilitated DNA melting of the start site. Alternatively, no specific contacts to the −10 hexamer are absolutely required for binding and open complex formation. This seems unlikely on the basis of 30 years of work with promoter recognition by RNA polymerase, in particular some recent work that implicates specific contacts between ς70 and the nontemplate strand at positions −11 and −12 (20.Li X.Y.

In fact, Fig. 4 shows that nucleoside loss on the nontemplate strand between −13 and −10 results in a modest decrease in RNA polymerase binding consistent with a role in ς70 binding. For the −35 hexamer, encompassing −36 to −31 at lacUV5, positions upstream of −32 appear necessary for binding. This is in line with the work done on T7 A1 (17.Werel W. Schickor P. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2589-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Further, numerous positions upstream of −37 extending to beyond −50 as well as nucleosides downstream of +6 (most notably on the nontemplate strand) give evidence of inhibiting binding upon removal. Obviously, RNA polymerase must make contacts beyond the hexamers and spacer DNA, and it appears that the nontemplate strand is more important to these protein-DNA interactions than the template strand. Regarding the positions of ethylation that interfere with binding, all previously identified positions were again found to be critical to binding (9.Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Cell. 1980; 20: 269-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 12.Shanblatt S.H. Revzin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10885-10890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the template strand, the peak of interference around −32 has been more clearly defined to extend from −36 to −31. On the nontemplate strand, the positions of ethylation that have negative effects on binding have been expanded to include sequences from −50 to +15. This pattern of interference indicates that RNA polymerase makes close contact with the DNA backbone over the entire span of the hydroxyl radical and DNase I footprints atlacUV5. Ethylation has relatively similar inhibitory effects on binding for each strand with two notable exceptions: the upstream DNA from −20 to −8 and the start site DNA. Modification of the nontemplate strand from −20 to −8 leads to significant inhibition of open complex formation (Fig. 3). Template strand ethylation for the same positions has very little effect. However, template strand ethylation at the start site has a large negative effect on open complex formation, while ethylation of the nontemplate strand at the start site is modestly stimulatory. These two examples of strand specificity of ethylation effects support a model of RNA polymerase-promoter interaction requiring close protein-DNA associations between the ς subunit and the nontemplate strand upstream of the start site and between the template strand near +1 and the active site of RNA polymerase (20.Li X.Y. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23558-23566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21.Roberts C.W. Roberts J.W.

A number of the observations from this work offer new information for the lacUV5 promoter. Most striking, nucleoside loss on either strand between −10 and +5 increases the likelihood of RNA polymerase forming an open complex on that molecule. These results indicates that individual bases at the start site do not play a major informational role in the process of RNA polymerase recognition and binding to promoters. This observation appears to be a general phenomenon of RNA polymerase-promoter DNA interactions."
