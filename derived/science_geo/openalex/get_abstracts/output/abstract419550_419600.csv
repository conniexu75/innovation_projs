https://openalex.org/W1984390450,"This study describes the generation of knock-in mouse lines that express optogenetic activators or silencers in a CRE recombinase–dependent manner, and demonstrates the reliability and utility of these tools with in vivo and ex vivo light-induced activation and silencing of neuronal activity. Cell type–specific expression of optogenetic molecules allows temporally precise manipulation of targeted neuronal activity. Here we present a toolbox of four knock-in mouse lines engineered for strong, Cre-dependent expression of channelrhodopsins ChR2-tdTomato and ChR2-EYFP, halorhodopsin eNpHR3.0 and archaerhodopsin Arch-ER2. All four transgenes mediated Cre-dependent, robust activation or silencing of cortical pyramidal neurons in vitro and in vivo upon light stimulation, with ChR2-EYFP and Arch-ER2 demonstrating light sensitivity approaching that of in utero or virally transduced neurons. We further show specific photoactivation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in behaving ChR2-EYFP reporter mice. The robust, consistent and inducible nature of our ChR2 mice represents a significant advance over previous lines, and the Arch-ER2 and eNpHR3.0 mice are to our knowledge the first demonstration of successful conditional transgenic optogenetic silencing. When combined with the hundreds of available Cre driver lines, this optimized toolbox of reporter mice will enable widespread investigations of neural circuit function with unprecedented reliability and accuracy."

Here we demonstrate the ability to resolve changes in current that correspond to a known DNA sequence by combining the high sensitivity of a mutated form of the protein pore Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) with phi29 DNA polymerase (DNAP), which controls the rate of DNA translocation through the pore. As phi29 DNAP synthesizes DNA and functions like a motor to pull a single-stranded template through MspA, we observe well-resolved and reproducible ionic current levels with median durations of ∼28 ms and ionic current differences of up to 40 pA. Using six different DNA sequences with readable regions 42-53 nucleotides long, we record current traces that map to the known DNA sequences. With single-nucleotide resolution and DNA translocation control, this system integrates solutions to two long-standing hurdles to nanopore sequencing."

https://openalex.org/W2114421191,"Interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein 3 is shown to be an innate defence mechanism against viral infection in vivo; furthermore, a subset of the patients hospitalized during the H1N1 2009 pandemic carried a variant form of the IFITM3 gene. Interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins restrict the replication of certain pathogenic viruses, but no in vivo role for these proteins has been known until now. Paul Kellam and colleagues now report that IFITM3 is essential for protecting mice infected with influenza viruses from developing fulminant viral pneumonia. The authors further find that a small subset of humans hospitalized for infection with pandemic H1N1/09 swine flu or seasonal influenza virus carried a variant of IFITM3 with reduced antiviral activity. These results suggest that IFITM3 has a pivotal role in defence against influenza infection. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic showed the speed with which a novel respiratory virus can spread and the ability of a generally mild infection to induce severe morbidity and mortality in a subset of the population. Recent in vitro studies show that the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein family members potently restrict the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Both the magnitude and breadth of the IFITM proteins’ in vitro effects suggest that they are critical for intrinsic resistance to such viruses, including influenza viruses. Using a knockout mouse model8, we now test this hypothesis directly and find that IFITM3 is essential for defending the host against influenza A virus in vivo. Mice lacking Ifitm3 display fulminant viral pneumonia when challenged with a normally low-pathogenicity influenza virus, mirroring the destruction inflicted by the highly pathogenic 1918 ‘Spanish’ influenza9,10. Similar increased viral replication is seen in vitro, with protection rescued by the re-introduction of Ifitm3. To test the role of IFITM3 in human influenza virus infection, we assessed the IFITM3 alleles of individuals hospitalized with seasonal or pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses. We find that a statistically significant number of hospitalized subjects show enrichment for a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) that alters a splice acceptor site, and functional assays show the minor CC genotype IFITM3 has reduced influenza virus restriction in vitro. Together these data reveal that the action of a single intrinsic immune effector, IFITM3, profoundly alters the course of influenza virus infection in mouse and humans."

Four competing mechanistic hypotheses have been proposed to explain network-based disease patterning: nodal stress, transneuronal spread, trophic failure, and shared vulnerability. Here, we used task-free fMRI to derive the healthy intrinsic connectivity patterns seeded by brain regions vulnerable to any of five distinct neurodegenerative diseases. These data enabled us to investigate how intrinsic connectivity in health predicts region-by-region vulnerability to disease. For each illness, specific regions emerged as critical network “epicenters” whose normal connectivity profiles most resembled the disease-associated atrophy pattern. Graph theoretical analyses in healthy subjects revealed that regions with higher total connectional flow and, more consistently, shorter functional paths to the epicenters, showed greater disease-related vulnerability. These findings best fit a transneuronal spread model of network-based vulnerability. Molecular pathological approaches may help clarify what makes each epicenter vulnerable to its targeting disease and how toxic protein species travel between networked brain structures.

Emerging network-sensitive neuroimaging techniques have allowed researchers to demonstrate that the spatial patterning of each disease relates closely to a distinct functional intrinsic connectivity network (ICN), mapped in the healthy brain with task-free or “resting-state” fMRI (Buckner et al., 2005Buckner R.L.

Collectively, these findings raise mechanistic questions about whether and how connectivity in health predicts regional neurodegeneration severity in disease. In Alzheimer's disease, increasing evidence suggests that pathology may begin within key vulnerable “hubs,” defined as central nodes within the target network's architecture (Buckner et al., 2009Buckner R.L. Sepulcre J. Talukdar T. Krienen F.M. Liu H. Hedden T. Andrews-Hanna J.R. Sperling R.A. Johnson K.A.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1860-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar). Still, open questions remain with regard to why each disease adopts a network-related spatial pattern. At least four disease-general hypotheses have been offered and can be summarized as (1) “nodal stress,” in which regions subject to heavy network traffic (i.e., “hubs”) undergo activity-related “wear and tear” that gives rise to or worsens disease (Buckner et al., 2009Buckner R.L. Sepulcre J. Talukdar T. Krienen F.M. Liu H. Hedden T. Andrews-Hanna J.R. Sperling R.A. Johnson K.A.

Although these hypothesized network degeneration mechanisms need not be considered mutually exclusive, they make competing predictions with regard to how healthy network architecture should influence disease-associated regional vulnerability (Figure 1). Here, we explored the relationship between healthy functional architecture, as assessed with graph theoretical analyses of task-free fMRI data, and neurodegenerative disease vulnerability, as assessed by quantifying regional atrophy in patients. Our previous work showed that each of five distinct neurodegenerative syndromes featured an atrophy pattern that mirrored the healthy functional ICN seeded by the cortical region most atrophied in patients with that syndrome (Seeley et al., 2009Seeley W.W. Crawford R.K. Zhou J. Miller B.L. Greicius M.D. Neurodegenerative diseases target large-scale human brain networks.Neuron. 2009; 62: 42-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). The present study, in contrast, examined every brain region within the five disease-related atrophy maps to identify the regions whose connectivity pattern in health most resembled the atrophy map seen in each syndrome (see Figure 2 for a methods schematic). The resulting dataset fully specified the node pair connectivity strengths across all regions atrophied in any of the five diseases; collectively, these regions traversed most cerebral cortical and subcortical structures. With this information in hand, we used graph theoretical analyses to test model-based predictions of how network architecture in health relates to disease-associated tissue loss (Figure 1). Although previously described spatial atrophy patterns (Seeley et al., 2009Seeley W.W. Crawford R.K. Zhou J. Miller B.L. Greicius M.D. Neurodegenerative diseases target large-scale human brain networks.Neuron. 2009; 62: 42-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar) specified the brain regions interrogated for the current study, all network connectivity analyses were performed on an independent dataset of 16 healthy subjects aged 57 to 70 (8 females, all right-handed and psychoactive medication-free; see Experimental Procedures). The resulting connectivity patterns and graph metrics were used to relate each region's healthy connectivity profile to that region's disease-specific vulnerability, defined as its atrophy severity in patients. In previous work (Seeley et al., 2009Seeley W.W. Crawford R.K. Zhou J. Miller B.L. Greicius M.D. Neurodegenerative diseases target large-scale human brain networks.Neuron. 2009; 62: 42-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), we identified regional atrophy maxima for five neurodegenerative syndromes: Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SD), progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Then, using healthy subjects scanned with task-free fMRI, we used these five atrophy maxima as “seed” regions to derive five ICNs, representing regions whose blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal time-series significantly correlated with that of the seed. The atrophy maxima seeded ICNs that resembled the parent atrophy maps, supporting the view that neurodegenerative disease patterns are network based. By studying only one seed region per atrophy pattern, however, this approach could not determine which regions featured maximal connectivity to the other vulnerable regions. We anticipated that each disease-associated pattern would harbor focal “epicenters,” regions whose connectivity patterns—in the healthy brain—most closely mirrored the disease vulnerability pattern. To seek out these epicenters, here we took a more comprehensive, data-driven approach by studying all regions within each of the five atrophy patterns. For example (Figure 2), we created 1,128 4 mm radius spherical regions of interest (ROIs) covering the entire bvFTD atrophy pattern and built 1,128 functional ICN maps, one seeded by each ROI, for each of our 16 healthy subjects. We then derived 1,128 group-level ICN maps for comparison to the (binarized) bvFTD atrophy pattern. Applying this general strategy to all five syndromic atrophy patterns, we used group-level goodness-of-fit (GOF) analyses (see Experimental Procedures) to reveal five sets of distinct and focal epicenters (Figure 3 and see Figure S1 and Table S1 available online), whose large-scale connectivity maps in health showed highest GOF to the binarized syndromic atrophy patterns. Remarkably, although atrophy severity values made no contribution to epicenter identification, the epicenters uncovered here were seated in or near the most atrophic regions identified in our previous work (Seeley et al., 2009Seeley W.W. Crawford R.K. Zhou J. Miller B.L. Greicius M.D. Neurodegenerative diseases target large-scale human brain networks.Neuron. 2009; 62: 42-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar; Figure S1), suggesting that epicenters—in addition to being broadly connected with regions atrophied in a disease—are often among the most atrophied (and perhaps earliest affected) regions in that disease. Although the terms “epicenter” and “hub” have been used interchangeably to describe transmodal convergence zones within healthy large-scale brain networks (Mesulam, 2012Mesulam M. The evolving landscape of human cortical connectivity: Facts and inferences.Neuroimage. 2012; (in press. Published online December 22, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.12.033Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we chose “epicenter” to describe the regions identified here because (1) “epicenter” carries a pathogenic connotation, describing a region that is often but not necessarily the site of maximal damage and (2) “hub” evokes a brain region with high node centrality (“hub-ness”), as defined within the network science lexicon. Our epicenter identification strategy, however, did not include graph theoretical measures and thus provided no guarantee that the identified epicenters would represent true network hubs. Having identified a set of focal epicenters within each atrophy pattern, we next sought to examine where the epicenters fit within their target network's functional architecture. To this end, we generated five intra-network healthy connectivity matrices covering all ROIs, including the epicenters, contained within the five binary spatial atrophy patterns (Figure 3). Specifically, we first generated unthresholded subject-level intranetwork matrices, using ROIs as nodes and connectivity z scores between ROI pairs as the weights of the undirected edges (see Experimental Procedures). Group-level intranetwork healthy connectivity matrices were then derived for each network using one-sample t tests. Significant edges were determined by thresholding at p < 0.01, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple comparisons across the matrix; nonsignificant edges were assigned a weight of zero. Examination of these matrices revealed that the epicenters related to each disease showed broad-based connectivity with other nodes in the target network, consistent with the manner in which they were identified (Figure 3). We further questioned whether these epicenters, though defined by their healthy ICN's resemblance to the (binary) parent atrophy pattern, might also serve as functional hubs, defined as nodes with high weighted degree centrality (total connectional flow) within the target network (Sporns et al., 2007Sporns O. Honey C.J. Kötter R. Identification and classification of hubs in brain networks.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure S2, although at least some epicenters for each disease ranked among the nodes highest in total intranetwork flow, this relationship remained nuanced and varied by disease pattern, and many nonepicenter regions showed equal or greater total flow. These observations indicated that the amount of network traffic experienced by each node may influence but does not determine the network's disease-critical epicenters. In addition, the dissociation between epicenters and hubs suggested that graph metrics related to these concepts might make dissociable contributions to atrophy severity. Next, we sought to address how the brain's healthy connectional architecture, defined in a graph theoretical framework, relates to disease-associated regional vulnerability, defined by atrophy severity in patients. We translated the four major mechanistic models into distinctive sets of connectivity-related predictions (Figure 1). The nodal stress model would predict that metabolic demands or other activity-dependent factors conferred by higher nodal flow will accelerate vulnerability, worsening nodal atrophy severity. The transneuronal spread hypothesis would predict greatest degeneration in regions connectionally closest to the node of onset, operationally defined here as those regions having the shortest functional path to any of the epicenters. The trophic failure model would predict that eccentric nodes with low total flow and low clustering coefficients will prove less resilient due to a lack of redundant trophic inputs. The shared vulnerability model, in contrast to all others, predicts no direct impact of intranetwork architecture on vulnerability, which is driven instead by a common gene or protein expression profile. To compare the model-based predictions, we used the healthy intrinsic connectivity matrices (Figure 3) to generate three graph theoretical metrics for each region within each target network: total flow, shortest path to the epicenters, and clustering coefficient (see Experimental Procedures). We then examined the correlation between these nodal metrics, derived from healthy subjects, and nodal atrophy severity in the five neurodegenerative syndromes (Figure 4 and Table S2). A node's total flow in health showed a positive correlation with disease vulnerability (Figure 4, row 1; p < 0.05 familywise error corrected for multiple comparisons) in AD (r = 0.43, p = 8.4e−40), bvFTD (r = 0.35, p = 4.9e−36), SD (r = 0.29, p = 9.9e−15), PNFA (r = 0.40, p = 5.4e−7), and CBS (r = 0.40, p = 7.9e−21). A shorter functional path from a node to the disease-related epicenters also predicted greater atrophy severity (Figure 4, row 2; p < 0.05 familywise error corrected for multiple comparisons) in all five diseases: AD (r = −0.62, p = 3.2e−90), bvFTD (r = −0.30, p = 3.1e−25), SD (r = −0.60, p = 1.0e−67), PNFA (r = −0.34, p = 1.2e−5), CBS (r = −0.33, p = 7.0e−13), an effect that remained significant after controlling for the Euclidean distance (in Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] space) from each node to its functionally nearest epicenter. Finally, no consistently significant positive or negative correlations were identified between nodal clustering coefficient and vulnerability across the five diseases (Figure 4, row 3): AD (r = −0.15, p = 2.1e−5), bvFTD (r = 0.05, p = 0.56), SD (r = −0.20, p = 9.9e−8), PNFA (r = 0.16, p = 0.03), CBS (r = 0.28, p = 7.7e−11). To reinforce the pairwise correlation findings while considering the influence of all network-based metrics together, we performed stepwise linear regression analyses in which atrophy served as the dependent measure, graph metrics served as independent predictors, and Euclidean distance from node to epicenter and region type (cortical versus subcortical) were entered as nuisance covariates. These analyses revealed that although total flow accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in atrophy severity for all five syndromes, the shortest functional path to the epicenters explained more of the atrophy variance within the AD and SD patterns (Table S3). Overall, these intranetwork findings are compatible with both the nodal stress and transneuronal spread models and suggest that these mechanisms may play differing roles in shaping regional vulnerability across the five syndromes. Predictions derived for the trophic failure and shared vulnerability models were not supported by these experiments. Neurodegenerative diseases are known to spread from their initial target network to “off-target” networks in later stages of disease (Förstl and Kurz, 1999Förstl H. Kurz A. Clinical features of Alzheimer's disease.Eur. Arch. Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1999; 249: 288-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Miller and Boeve, 2009Miller B.L. Boeve B.F.

We reasoned that vulnerability within off-target network regions may also be governed by connectional profile. To test this idea, we created a single transnetwork connectivity matrix including all ROIs in the five disease-related atrophy maps (Figure 5) and recalculated the three graph metrics. Nodes within the transnetwork connectivity graph having shorter functional paths to the disease-associated epicenters were associated with greater atrophy in patients with that disease (Figure 6, row 2; Table S2; p < 0.05 familywise error corrected for multiple comparisons) across all five diseases: AD (r = −0.27, p = 8.1e−46), bvFTD (r = −0.65, p < 1e−300), SD (r = −0.54, p = 1.5e−198), PNFA (r = −0.52, p = 3.5e−183), and CBS (r = −0.54, p = 2.1e−197), an effect that remained significant after controlling for the Euclidean distance from each node to its functionally nearest epicenter. Total flow (AD [r = −0.08, p = 1.8e−5], bvFTD [r = 0.29, p = 6.7e−51], SD [r = −0.30, p = 7.2e−57], PNFA [r = 0.26, p = 1.2e−41], CBS [r = 0.33, p = 4.6e−67]) and clustering coefficient (AD [r = −0.0, p = 0.06], bvFTD [r = 0.21, p = 7.8e−28], SD [r = −0.38, p = 5.2e−91], PNFA [r = 0.19, p = 1.1e−22], CBS [r = 0.21, p = 1.7e−26]), in contrast, exerted a weaker and inconsistent influence on atrophy severity across the five diseases (Figure 6, rows 1 and 3; Table S2). Following the same approach taken for the intranetwork analyses, a stepwise linear regression performed at the transnetwork level revealed that the shortest functional path to the epicenters stood out as the single strongest graph metric predictor across all five syndromes (Table S3). Similar results were obtained when including Euclidean distance from each node to its functionally nearest epicenter in the model, except that in AD this distance explained a substantial proportion of atrophy variance, reducing the contribution from the shortest path to the epicenters. The strong relationship between functional proximity to the epicenters and atrophy severity emerged from these transnetwork analyses even though most nodes contributing to each analysis came from “off-target” networks that made no contribution to epicenter identification. Nonetheless, to eliminate the possibility that node selection bias contributed to the observed relationships, we repeated the transnetwork correlation and stepwise regression analyses after removing all ROIs within each target network, thereby examining only how the connectivity of “off-target” network nodes predicts vulnerability. These additional control analyses showed that a node's shortest functional path to the target network epicenters remained the most robust and consistent predictor of that node's atrophy in the target disease (Tables S4 and S5). Overall, these findings suggest that although both the nodal stress and transneuronal spread models are consistent with the intranetwork analysis, incorporating off-target networks provided stronger support for the transneuronal spread hypothesis. Furthermore, the transnetwork graph metrics converge with previous studies investigating the relationships between the five neurodegenerative syndromes. For example, consistent with our previous findings that bvFTD and AD feature divergent intrinsic connectivity changes (Zhou et al., 2010Zhou J. Greicius M.D. Gennatas E.D. Growdon M.E. Jang J.Y. Rabinovici G.D. Kramer J.H. Weiner M. Miller B.L. Seeley W.W. Divergent network connectivity changes in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.Brain. 2010; 133: 1352-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), the nodes within the AD and bvFTD patterns featured the most dissimilar healthy connectional profiles and disease-associated atrophy severities (Figure 6). Regions within the bvFTD pattern showed the lowest atrophy in AD and had among the longest paths to the AD-related epicenters and vice versa.Figure 6Transnetwork Graph Theoretical Connectivity Measures in Health Predict Atrophy Severity in DiseaseShow full captionRow 2: ROIs showing greater disease-related atrophy were those featuring shorter functional paths, in the healthy brain, to the disease-associated epicenters (p < 0.05 familywise error corrected for multiple comparisons for AD, bvFTD, SD, PNFA, and CBS).

We then used graph theoretical approaches to seek disease-general principles governing connectivity-vulnerability interactions, testing predictions made by four proposed models of network-based neurodegeneration. We found that, within each targeted network, a node's vulnerability was best predicted by greater total connectional flow through that node and by a shorter functional path to the disease-related epicenters. Extending this analysis across all regions contained in any of the five networks revealed that intrinsic functional proximity to the epicenters represents the most potent predictor of disease-related atrophy. Therefore, although both the nodal stress and transneuronal spread model predictions received support from analyses of the individual target networks, incorporating the off-target networks provided strongest support for the notion that neurodegenerative diseases spread from region to region along connectional lines to adopt a network-based spatial pattern. The most mysterious aspect of neurodegenerative disease regards how each disease selects its initial target or targets. Early selective vulnerability, though not the focus of this study, creates a starting point from which disease then spreads. Regions showing greatest atrophy at later stages may or may not represent the sites of initial injury, and even longitudinal imaging studies that follow patients from health to disease may overlook incipient microscopic pathology within small neuronal populations (Braak et al"
https://openalex.org/W2089691915,"Patterns of dementia are known to fall into dissociated but dispersed brain networks, suggesting that the disease is transmitted along neuronal pathways rather than by proximity. This view is supported by neuropathological evidence for ""prion-like"" transsynaptic transmission of disease agents like misfolded tau and beta amyloid. We mathematically model this transmission by a diffusive mechanism mediated by the brain's connectivity network obtained from tractography of 14 healthy-brain MRIs. Subsequent graph theoretic analysis provides a fully quantitative, testable, predictive model of dementia. Specifically, we predict spatially distinct ""persistent modes,"" which, we found, recapitulate known patterns of dementia and match recent reports of selectively vulnerable dissociated brain networks. Model predictions also closely match T1-weighted MRI volumetrics of 18 Alzheimer's and 18 frontotemporal dementia subjects. Prevalence rates predicted by the model strongly agree with published data. This work has many important implications, including dimensionality reduction, differential diagnosis, and especially prediction of future atrophy using baseline MRI morphometrics."
https://openalex.org/W2061960110,"A consortium of inhibitory neurons control the firing patterns of pyramidal cells, but their specific roles in the behaving animal are largely unknown. We performed simultaneous physiological recordings and optogenetic silencing of either perisomatic (parvalbumin (PV) expressing) or dendrite-targeting (somatostatin (SOM) expressing) interneurons in hippocampal area CA1 of head-fixed mice actively moving a treadmill belt rich with visual-tactile stimuli. Silencing of either PV or SOM interneurons increased the firing rates of pyramidal cells selectively in their place fields, with PV and SOM interneurons having their largest effect during the rising and decaying parts of the place field, respectively. SOM interneuron silencing powerfully increased burst firing without altering the theta phase of spikes. In contrast, PV interneuron silencing had no effect on burst firing, but instead shifted the spikes' theta phase toward the trough of theta. These findings indicate that perisomatic and dendritic inhibition have distinct roles in controlling the rate, burst and timing of hippocampal pyramidal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2154942988,"Methods for specific gene silencing have advanced as far as clinical trials, but a similar set of tools does not exist for increasing gene expression. Modarresi et al. demonstrate gene-specific upregulation in vivo by treating mice with oligonucleotides that inhibit the function of natural antisense transcripts. The ability to specifically upregulate genes in vivo holds great therapeutic promise. Here we show that inhibition or degradation of natural antisense transcripts (NATs) by single-stranded oligonucleotides or siRNAs can transiently and reversibly upregulate locus-specific gene expression. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is normally repressed by a conserved noncoding antisense RNA transcript, BDNF-AS. Inhibition of this transcript upregulates BDNF mRNA by two- to sevenfold, alters chromatin marks at the BDNF locus, leads to increased protein levels and induces neuronal outgrowth and differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. We also show that inhibition of NATs leads to increases in glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and ephrin receptor B2 (EPHB2) mRNA. Our data suggest that pharmacological approaches targeting NATs can confer locus-specific gene upregulation effects."

Glutamatergic neurons are present in the rat ventral tegmental area.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 25: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). DA is thought to represent a teaching signal and has also been implicated in the induction of addictive behaviors (Lüscher and Malenka, 2011Lüscher C. Malenka R.C. Drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in addiction: from molecular changes to circuit remodeling.Neuron. 2011; 69: 650-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In fact, many VTA DA neurons are activated by reward or a cue-predicting the reward. In both cases, DA neuron firing increases only if the salient stimulus occurs without anticipation (Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P. Montague P.R. A neural substrate of prediction and reward.Science. 1997; 275: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5396) Google Scholar). In contrast, DA neurons are inhibited by reward omission. Based on these observations, now confirmed across several species ranging from humans (D'Ardenne et al., 2008D'Ardenne K. McClure S.M. Nystrom L.E. Cohen J.D. BOLD responses reflecting dopaminergic signals in the human ventral tegmental area.Science. 2008; 319: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) to rats (Flagel et al., 2011Flagel S.B. Clark J.J. Robinson T.E. Mayo L. Czuj A. Willuhn I. Akers C.A. Clinton S.M. Phillips P.E.M. Akil H. A selective role for dopamine in stimulus-reward learning.Nature. 2011; 469: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), it is generally accepted that DA neuron firing codes for the prediction error of reward. However, several studies reported that salient but aversive stimuli can enhance DA neuron activity (reviewed in Salamone, 1994Salamone J.D. The involvement of nucleus accumbens dopamine in appetitive and aversive motivation.Behav. Brain Res. 1994; 61: 117-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, and Pezze and Feldon, 2004Pezze M.A. Feldon J. Mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways in fear conditioning.Prog.

Long-term memory for pavlovian fear conditioning requires dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12751Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These studies have challenged the exclusive role of the mesolimbic DA system in reward processing. Additional evidence shows that the firing of some DA neurons, which are typically located in the caudal VTA, increased briefly in response to a footshock (Brischoux et al., 2009Brischoux F. Chakraborty S. Brierley D.I. Ungless M.A. Phasic excitation of dopamine neurons in ventral VTA by noxious stimuli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 4894-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Moreover, VTA DA neurons can also be activated by conditioned aversive stimuli (Guarraci et al., 1999Guarraci F.A. Frohardt R.J. Young S.L. Kapp B.S. A functional role for dopamine transmission in the amygdala during conditioned fear.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1999; 877: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), restraint stress (Anstrom and Woodward, 2005Anstrom K.K. Woodward D.J. Restraint increases dopaminergic burst firing in awake rats.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2005; 30: 1832-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), or social defeat stress (Anstrom et al., 2009Anstrom K.K. Miczek K.A. Budygin E.A. Increased phasic dopamine signaling in the mesolimbic pathway during social defeat in rats.Neuroscience. 2009; 161: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Clearly, VTA DA neurons are by no means a homogenous population, but subserve contrasting function in motivational control through connections with distinct circuits. As stated in a recent review, “some DA neurons encode motivational value, supporting brain networks for seeking, evaluation, and value learning. Others encode motivational salience, supporting brain networks for orienting, cognition, and general motivation” (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010aBromberg-Martin E.S. Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O. Dopamine in motivational control: rewarding, aversive, and alerting.Neuron. 2010; 68: 815-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). The control of DA neuron activity and the ensuing changes in DA levels in the target regions of the VTA are therefore important for the control of behavior. How DA levels can increase has been studied extensively. For example, addictive drugs raise DA through distinct cellular mechanisms (Lüscher and Ungless, 2006Lüscher C. Ungless M.A. The mechanistic classification of addictive drugs.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e437Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), one of which involves the disinhibition of DA neurons via an inhibition of local VTA GABA neurons (Cruz et al., 2004Cruz H.G. Ivanova T. Lunn M.-L. Stoffel M. Slesinger P.A. Lüscher C. Bi-directional effects of GABA(B) receptor agonists on the mesolimbic dopamine system.Nat.

Neural bases for addictive properties of benzodiazepines.Nature. 2010; 463: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It may therefore be the case that aversive stimuli activate VTA GABA neurons to transiently suppress DA neuron activity, which determines the behavioral response. It has been shown that salient but aversive stimuli can in fact strongly inhibit DA neurons in the VTA (Ungless et al., 2004Ungless M.A. Magill P.J. Bolam J.P. Uniform inhibition of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area by aversive stimuli.Science. 2004; 303: 2040-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, Hong et al., 2011Hong S. Jhou T.C. Smith M. Saleem K.S. Hikosaka O. Negative reward signals from the lateral habenula to dopamine neurons are mediated by rostromedial tegmental nucleus in primates.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 11457-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recent investigations into the origins of this response have identified two nuclei in rats and monkeys, the lateral habenula and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which may play a role in DA neuron responses to aversive stimuli (Hong et al., 2011Hong S. Jhou T.C. Smith M. Saleem K.S. Hikosaka O. Negative reward signals from the lateral habenula to dopamine neurons are mediated by rostromedial tegmental nucleus in primates.J.

This mirrors the established role of the VTA in reward processing (Fields et al., 2007Fields H.L. Hjelmstad G.O. Margolis E.B. Nicola S.M. Ventral tegmental area neurons in learned appetitive behavior and positive reinforcement.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 289-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, Schultz, 2010Schultz W. Dopamine signals for reward value and risk: basic and recent data.Behav. Brain Funct. 2010; 6: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, due to the technical difficulties, it has until now been impossible to dissect the role of VTA GABA neurons in the control of DA neurons during aversive events. Here, we take advantage of in vivo electrophysiology and cell-type-specific expression of optogenetic effectors to probe the role of VTA GABA neurons in mediating DA neuron inhibition. We further investigate the role of VTA GABA neurons in an electric footshock-induced inhibition of DA neurons and test whether activation of VTA GABA neurons is sufficient to elicit avoidance behavior. We expressed the optogenetic effector channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) selectively in GABA neurons of the VTA by injecting an adeno-associated virus (serotype 5) containing a double-floxed inverted open reading frame encoding a fusion of ChR2 and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (ChR2-eYFP) into the VTA of transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase in GAD65-positive neurons (Kätzel et al., 2011Kätzel D. Zemelman B.V. Buetfering C. Wölfel M. Miesenböck G. The columnar and laminar organization of inhibitory connections to neocortical excitatory cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Functional ChR2-eYFP is transcribed only in neurons containing Cre, thus restricting expression to GABA neurons of the VTA. To validate this approach, we performed immunohistochemistry on VTA slice from infected GADcre+ mice and observed that ChR2-eYFP was selectively expressed in GABA neurons. This conclusion is based on the eYFP colocalization with the α1 subunit isoform of the GABAA receptor (Tan et al., 2010Tan K.R. Brown M. Labouèbe G. Yvon C. Creton C. Fritschy J.-M. Rudolph U. Lüscher C. Neural bases for addictive properties of benzodiazepines.Nature. 2010; 463: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and mutual exclusion of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining (Figure 1A ). The quantification revealed that 92% of the GABA neurons expressed the ChR2-eYFP, while this was the case only in 3% of the DA neurons (inset, Figure 1A). The expression of the ChR2-eYFP was restricted to the VTA (Figure 1B). In vitro patch-clamp recordings also confirmed a selective expression of ChR2-eYFP in GABA cells and a synaptic connection of the latter with DA neurons as inhibitory light evoked current recorded from DA cells were abolished with picrotoxin (see Figure S1 available online; van Zessen et al., 2012van Zessen R. Phillips J.L. Budygin E.A. Stuber G.D. Activation of VTA GABA neurons disrupts reward consumption.Neuron. 2012; 73 (this issue): 1184-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, this issue of Neuron). Two weeks after the infection, anesthetized mice were canulated (Figures 1B and 1C) and GABA neuron firing controlled with blue-light (Figures 1D–1H). Intermitted blue-light stimulation (20 Hz, 5 pulses, data not shown) or continuous illumination for one second reliably excited GABA neurons as monitored by extracellular single unit recordings in vivo (+560% ± 174%; Figures 1D, 1F, and 1G). As a consequence DA neurons were strongly inhibited (−88% ± 5%; Figures 1E, 1F, and 1H). In absolute values at baseline the firing frequency was 2.08 ± 2.45 Hz on average, while during stimulation 11.85 ± 10.06 Hz was measured (n = 10, data not shown). Taken together, selective activation of VTA GABA neurons leads to the inhibition of DA neurons similar to the inhibition observed by an electric footshock. Since VTA GABA neurons inhibit strongly the activity of DA neurons, we hypothesized that the footshock-induced inhibition of DA neurons is caused by the excitation of VTA GABA neurons. We then performed recordings in vivo from VTA neurons of wild-type (WT) anaesthetized mice. One brief electric footshock (0.1 ms, 1–5 mA) sufficient to cause aversion in freely moving animals (Valenti et al., 2011Valenti O. Lodge D.J. Grace A.A.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 4280-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, Rosenkranz et al., 2006Rosenkranz J.A. Buffalari D.M. Grace A.A. Opposing influence of basolateral amygdala and footshock stimulation on neurons of the central amygdala.Biol. Psychiatry. 2006; 59: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) induced opposite responses on the spontaneous firing of putative DA neurons and putative GABA neurons of the VTA, which were identified by the criteria detailed below. Whereas putative DA neurons were inhibited, putative GABA neurons were excited (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2D ). We also recorded occasional DA neurons that were excited by the footshock (Figures 2C and 2D). These cells were typically located in the medial, ventral, and caudal portion of the VTA (Brischoux et al., 2009Brischoux F. Chakraborty S. Brierley D.I. Ungless M.A. Phasic excitation of dopamine neurons in ventral VTA by noxious stimuli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 4894-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Here, we focused our study on the cells that were inhibited by a footshock. The average response duration of the putative GABA neurons was longer than in the putative DA neurons (485 ± 345 ms versus 194 ± 131 ms, respectively; Figures 2E and 2F) while the average response latency was also significantly delayed in putative DA neurons compared to putative GABA neurons (38 ± 38 ms versus 18 ± 17 ms; Figures 2E and 2F). Interestingly, the activation of the putative GABA neurons occurred in several waves, which were mirrored by an inhibition of putative DA neurons that was initially complete and then gradually recovered. Such oscillation may originate in excitatory input onto GABA neurons, or their connectivity via gap junctions (Lassen et al., 2007Lassen M.B. Brown J.E. Stobbs S.H. Gunderson S.H. Maes L. Valenzuela C.F. Ray A.P. Henriksen S.J. Steffensen S.C. Brain stimulation reward is integrated by a network of electrically coupled GABA neurons.Brain Res. 2007; 1156: 46-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and may be part of multiplexed timing mechanisms recently reported in the mesolimbic DA system that supports processing of information (Fujisawa and Buzsáki, 2011Fujisawa S. Buzsáki G. A 4 Hz oscillation adaptively synchronizes prefrontal, VTA, and hippocampal activities.Neuron. 2011; 72: 153-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Recurring activity was first observed during a trough of the GABA activity until reaching baseline within one second (Figure 2F). Taken together, these data suggest that putative GABA neurons of the VTA mediate the inhibition of putative DA neurons, when activated by aversive stimuli. The identification of VTA neurons was based on their established pharmacological signature and electrophysiological properties (Figure S2). A neuron was categorized as putative DA when it was disinhibited by morphine and inhibited by apomorphine (Beckstead et al., 2004Beckstead M.J. Grandy D.K. Wickman K. Williams J.T. Vesicular dopamine release elicits an inhibitory postsynaptic current in midbrain dopamine neurons.Neuron. 2004; 42: 939-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar; Figures S2A and S2C). Conversely, putative GABA neurons were inhibited by morphine (Johnson and North, 1992Johnson S.W. North R.A. Opioids excite dopamine neurons by hyperpolarization of local interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 483-488PubMed Google Scholar, Figures S2B and S2C). In addition, putative DA neurons exhibited (1) a slow firing rate below 10 Hz with occasional slow bursting activity (Figure S2D; Grace and Bunney, 1983Grace A.A. Bunney B.S. Intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology of nigral dopaminergic neurons—1. Identification and characterization.Neuroscience. 1983; 10: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), (2) an action potential width to the trough larger than 1.1 ms (Ungless et al., 2004Ungless M.A. Magill P.J. Bolam J.P. Uniform inhibition of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area by aversive stimuli.Science. 2004; 303: 2040-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and a regular firing rate (Figure S2E), (3) a total duration of the action potential longer than 2.0 ms (Luo et al., 2008Luo A.H. Georges F.E. Aston-Jones G.S. Novel neurons in ventral tegmental area fire selectively during the active phase of the diurnal cycle.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 27: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar; Figure S2E). The putative DA and GABA neurons recorded in this study were located throughout the VTA. However, some of the putative GABA neurons were located in more dorsal parts of the VTA (Figure S2F). We next aimed at identifying the neurochemical basis of the footshock-driven inhibition of DA neurons. Several effector systems can efficiently hyperpolarize DA neurons to inhibit firing, including G protein inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels active in response to D2 autoreceptor or GABAB heteroreceptor activation as well as GABAA receptors. In mice lacking the GIRK subunits expressed in DA neurons (Cruz et al., 2004Cruz H.G. Ivanova T. Lunn M.-L. Stoffel M. Slesinger P.A. Lüscher C. Bi-directional effects of GABA(B) receptor agonists on the mesolimbic dopamine system.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), putative DA neurons were still inhibited by a footshock (latency: WT 30 ± 32 ms versus GIRK2/3 KO 46 ± 41 ms; duration: WT 266 ± 159 ms versus GIRK2/3 KO 335 ± 192 ms; magnitude: WT −53% ± 35% versus GIRK2/3 KO −46% ± 19%; Figures 3A and 3B ). It has been previously suggested that inhibition of DA neurons can be mediated by the activation of D2 autoreceptors after somatodendritic release of dopamine (Beckstead et al., 2004Beckstead M.J. Grandy D.K. Wickman K. Williams J.T. Vesicular dopamine release elicits an inhibitory postsynaptic current in midbrain dopamine neurons.Neuron. 2004; 42: 939-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we monitored footshock responses before and after i.v. injection of the DA receptor antagonist haloperidol. Again, this manipulation had no effect on the footshock inhibition of DA neurons (latency: saline 36 ± 25 ms versus haloperidol 30 ± 18 ms; duration: saline 215 ± 105 ms versus haloperidol 201 ± 91 ms; magnitude: saline −55% ± 13% versus haloperidol −53% ± 16%; Figures 3C and 3D). Finally, we investigated the contribution of GABAA receptors to the suppression of firing in putative DA cells (Figures 3E–3G and S3; van Zessen et al., 2012van Zessen R. Phillips J.L. Budygin E.A. Stuber G.D. Activation of VTA GABA neurons disrupts reward consumption.Neuron. 2012; 73 (this issue): 1184-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We found that neurons recorded with bicuculline-filled electrodes had significantly higher firing rate (saline: 4.78 ± 2.26 Hz, n = 35; bicuculline: 6.17 ± 2.26 Hz, n = 35, p = 0.013) as well as a higher bursting activity (saline: 18.7% ± 21.6%; bicuculline: 39.0% ± 26.1%, p < 0.001, data not shown). These results confirm that the drug diffusion in the vicinity of the cell was efficiently blocking GABAA receptors. Whereas 88% of the cells (30 out of 34) were initially inhibited under control conditions (Figure S3A), this proportion decreased to 42% (14 out of 33) when bicuculline-loaded electrodes were used (Figure S3A and S3B, insets). The residual footshock-induced inhibition still observed in these 14 cells may be due to limited diffusion of bicuculline (Figure S3C). We therefore repeated the experiment with bicuculline applied via a guide cannula that was implanted above the VTA of anaesthetized mice (Figures 1C and 3E–3G). In these conditions, 90% of the recorded DA neurons no longer responded to the footshock (latency: saline 47 ± 33 ms versus bicuculline 1 ± 1 ms; duration: saline 285 ± 62 ms versus bicuculline 1 ± 1 ms; and magnitude: saline −100% ± 28% versus bicuculline −5% ± 5%, Figure 3G). Given that a salient but aversive stimulus excites VTA GABA neurons that then inhibits DA neurons also causes aversion, we tested whether the exogenous excitation of VTA GABA neurons is sufficient to induce this behavior. To this end we looked for conditioned place aversion in ChR2-eYFP-VTA infected and cannulated GADcre+ and GADcre− mice (Figures 4 and S4). The protocol lasted 4 days and mice always had free access to the whole apparatus (Figure S4A). During the conditioning sessions, a blue light laser was switched on whenever the mouse entered the conditioned chamber. Already during the first conditioning session, this manipulation caused a strong aversion of the chamber where the laser was active in GADcre+ mice (pretest day GADcre+ 50.4% ± 2.5% versus conditioning day 1 GADcre+ 23.6% ± 5.6%; conditioning day 1 GADcre− 61.2% ± 5.8% versus conditioning day 1 GADcre+ 23.6% ± 5.6%; Figure 4A). On the test day, in the absence of blue light stimulation, GADcre+ mice developed an aversion for the light-paired chamber (pretest day GADcre+ 6.9 ± 36.6 s versus test day GADcre+ −385.8 ± 64.3 s; test day GADcre− −2.2 ± 52.9 s versus test day GADcre+ −385.8 ± 64.3 s; Figures 4B and 4C). Furthermore, during the conditioning sessions, mice were hesitant to enter the conditioned chamber and displayed a U-turn behavior never observed at the entry of the unconditioned chamber (U-turns count conditioned chamber GADcre+ 3.7 ± 1.2 s versus unconditioned chamber GADcre+ 0 ± 0; conditioned chamber GADcre+ 3.7 ± 1.2 s versus conditioned chamber GADcre− 0.3 ± 0.2; Figure 4D). When they actually entered the conditioned chamber they moved significantly faster (test day GADcre+ 0.08 ± 0.01 m/s versus GADcre− 0.05 ± 0.01 m/s; Figures 4E and S4B) to escape to the nonconditioned chamber where they showed a freezing behavior (test day GADcre+ 170.5 ± 51.7 s versus GADcre− 34.5 ± 11.8 s; Figures 4F and S4C). To confirm that inhibition of VTA DA neurons is responsible for the development of the operant CPA, we repeated the experiment in THcre+ mice where the VTA was infected with an AAV (serotype 5) expressing double-floxedzDIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP. As a control group, THcre+ mice were infected with an AAV5-DIO-eYFP. Immunohistochemistry showed a 96% colocalization of TH and eNpHR3.0-eYFP (Figure S4E) restricted to the VTA (Figure S4F). We then repeated the operant CPA protocol with the THcre/eNpHR3.0-eYFP mice. Venturing into the conditioned chamber triggered an amber laser, which led to an aversion of the light-paired chamber already during the conditioning sessions (pretest day THcre/eNpHR3.0-eYFP 49.6% ± 4.5% versus conditioning day 2 THcre/eNpHR3.0-eYFP 29.0% ± 4.2%; conditioning day 2 THcre/eYFP 46.3% ± 5.8% versus conditioning day 2 THcre/eNpHR3.0 29.0% ± 4.2%; Figure 4G). On the test day, with the amber laser no longer active, THcre/eNpHR3.0-eYFP mice retained an aversion for the light paired-chamber (pretest day THcre/eNpHR3.0-eYFP 2.6 ± 70.1 s versus test day THcre/eNpHR3.0-eYFP −276.4 ± 81.5 s; test day THcre/eYFP 36.3 ± 109.1 s versus test day THcre/eNpHR3.0-eYFP 276.4 ± 81.5 s; Figure 4H). Interestingly, the CPA score was almost identical to the one observed with GADcre+/ChR2-eYFP mice. The control mice groups for both conditions were indifferent to all manipulations throughout the duration of the experiment (Figures 4 and S4). Importantly, the blue and amber light stimulations did not have an impact on the overall locomotor activity, as the total distance traveled was similar in all groups (Figures S4D and S4G). Here, we show that optogenetic activation of VTA GABA neurons inhibits DA neurons of the VTA. We then provide evidence that VTA GABA neurons also inhibit DA neurons in response to a brief footshock via GABAA transmission. Finally, we observe that activation of VTA GABA neuron or direct inhibition of DA neurons is sufficient to elicit a strong place aversion. These findings are in line with the companion paper in this issue of Neuron (van Zessen et al., 2012van Zessen R. Phillips J.L. Budygin E.A. Stuber G.D. Activation of VTA GABA neurons disrupts reward consumption.Neuron. 2012; 73 (this issue): 1184-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The inhibitory synaptic networks that control DA neuron's activity are increasingly well described. GABA neurons of the VTA receive inhibitory afferents from medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (Xia et al., 2011Xia Y. Driscoll J.R. Wilbrecht L. Margolis E.B. Fields H.L. Hjelmstad G.O. Nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons target non-dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 7811-7816Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). If a footshock leads to a decrease in MSN activity, this could cause the disinhibition of VTA GABA neurons and eventually inhibition of DA neurons. This however seems unlikely as a tail pinch causes, on the contrary, an excitation of striatal units and would have an effect with a longer latency (Williams and Millar, 1990Williams G.V. Millar J. Concentration-dependent actions of stimulated dopamine release on neuronal activity in rat striatum.Neuroscience. 1990; 39: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an increased excitatory drive may be responsible for the enhanced GABA neuron activity. In rats, the lateral habenula sends excitatory inputs onto GABA neurons clustered in the tail of the VTA termed RMTg nucleus (Ji and Shepard, 2007Ji H. Shepard P.D. Lateral habenula stimulation inhibits rat midbrain dopamine neurons through a GABA(A) receptor-mediated mechanism.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6923-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These neurons have been demonstrated to impinge on VTA-DA neurons (Jhou et al., 2009bJhou T.C. Geisler S. Marinelli M. Degarmo B.A. Zahm D.S.

Functionally, when the RMTg is surgically lesioned, the response to aversive stimuli is attenuated, which suggests a convergence of aversive inputs onto the RMTg (Jhou et al., 2009aJhou T.C.

These midbrain GABA neurons display elevated basal firing rates and a lack of spike accommodation—two electrophysiological characteristics that distinguish them from putative midbrain DA neurons (Steffensen et al., 1998Steffensen S.C. Svingos A.L. Pickel V.M. Henriksen S.J. Electrophysiological characterization of GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8003-8015PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, VTA GABA neurons increase their firing during cues that predict appetitive rewards (Cohen et al., 2012Cohen J.Y. Haesler S. Vong L. Lowell B.B. Uchida N. Neuro-type-specific signalts for reward and punishment in the ventral tegmental area.Nature. 2012; 482: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) and also show a transient increase in activity following aversive stimuli (Cohen et al., 2012Cohen J.Y.

Importantly, GABAergic neurotransmission in the VTA is drastically altered by exposure to drugs of abuse (Bonci and Williams, 1997Bonci A. Williams J.T. Increased probability of GABA release during withdrawal from morphine.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 796-803PubMed Google Scholar, Johnson and North, 1992aJohnson S.W. North R.A.

While neurotransmission between VTA DA and GABA neurons may modulate reward processing, it is unknown whether the activity of VTA GABA neurons influences motivated behavior because manipulation of genetically distinct populations of VTA neurons has been difficult due to cellular heterogeneity. In the present study, we used optogenetic strategies to selectively stimulate VTA GABA neurons as well as their projection fibers to the NAc to determine whether the activity of these neurons could alter reward-seeking behavior as well as the excitability of neighboring DA neurons. To selectively stimulate VTA GABA neurons, we injected a Cre-inducible adeno-associated viral construct, coding for ChR2-eYFP or eGFP (Tsai et al., 2009Tsai H.C. Zhang F. Adamantidis A. Stuber G.D. Bonci A. de Lecea L. Deisseroth K. Phasic firing in dopaminergic neurons is sufficient for behavioral conditioning.Science. 2009; 324: 1080-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) unilaterally into the VTA of adult VGat-ires-Cre mice (Vong et al., 2011Vong L. Ye C. Yang Z. Choi B. Chua Jr., S. Lowell B.B. Leptin action on GABAergic neurons prevents obesity and reduces inhibitory tone to POMC neurons.Neuron. 2011; 71: 142-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). After 21–28 days, robust expression of ChR2-eYFP was localized to the VTA (Figure 1A ). Immunohistochemical staining to label tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker for DA neurons, as well as the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), revealed that ChR2-eYFP-expressing fibers throughout the VTA were colabeled for VGAT, suggesting that fibers from targeted neurons could release GABA (Figure 1B). Quantification of fluorescently labeled (but not all) VTA neurons revealed that 70.4 ± 1.3% were TH+, 29.6 ± 1.3% were eGFP+, and 0.24 ± 0.20% were colabeled for both (n = 6 sections from n = 3 mice; Figures 1C, 1D, 1E, and 1F). To determine the extent to which ChR2-eYFP-positive fibers from VTA GABA neurons innervate the VTA versus the neighboring substantia nigra pars compacta (Sn), we quantified eYFP fluorescence localized in these two regions. Robust ChR2-eYFP expression was observed in the VTA (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1G), whereas significantly less fluorescent signal was detected in the Sn (Figures 1H and 1I), demonstrating that fibers from VTA GABA neurons densely innervate the VTA but also sparsely innerve the Sn. To functionally demonstrate that VTA GABA neurons were optically excitable, we performed whole-cell current-clamp recordings from fluorescent-identified Chr2-eYFP expressing GABA neurons in VTA brain slices. Application of a 473 nm, 1 mW light pulse for 5 s, led to a sustained increase in the firing rate of these neurons (n = 4 neurons; Figures 1J and 1K.) Our data demonstrate that optical stimulation in these mice results in selective activation of VTA GABA neurons, which exhibit sustained firing at high frequencies (∼ 60 Hz), consistent with previously reported evoked firing rates from VTA GABA neurons (Steffensen et al., 1998Steffensen S.C.

Neuro-type-specific signalts for reward and punishment in the ventral tegmental area.Nature. 2012; 482: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) and unidentified VTA neurons (Kiyatkin and Rebec, 1998Kiyatkin E.A. Rebec G.V. Heterogeneity of ventral tegmental area neurons: single-unit recording and iontophoresis in awake, unrestrained rats.Neuroscience. 1998; 85: 1285-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since VTA neurons are thought to encode properties of rewards and predictive cues, we next determined the consequences of VTA GABA activation at key time points in a cue-reward conditioning task. ChR2-eYFP was selectively expressed in VTA GABAergic neurons, and implantable optical fibers (Sparta et al., 2011Sparta D.R. Stamatakis A.M. Phillips J.L. Hovelso N. van Zessen R. Stuber G.D. Construction of implantable optical fibers for long-term optogenetic manipulation of neural circuits.Nat. Protoc. 2011; 7: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) were secured unilaterally into brain tissue above the VTA (Figure S1 available online). Following recovery from surgery, mice were trained in daily cue-reward conditioning sessions consisting of 40 trials (60–120 s intertrial interval) where a 5 s tone/light stimulus predicted the delivery of 20 μl of a 10% sucrose solution. Following ∼25 training sessions, mice displayed consistent anticipatory licking during cue presentation as well as reward consummatory licking after the reward delivery (Figure 2A ). During subsequent conditioning sessions, VTA GABA neurons were optically excited during either the 5 s cue presentation period or the first 5 s following reward delivery. Activation of VTA GABA neurons during the 5 s cue period did not alter either anticipatory or reward consummatory licking (Figures 2B, 2D, and 2F) compared to behavioral sessions, where laser pulses were delivered through the fiber optic cable but light was not permitted to enter the brain. Interestingly, VTA GABA activation during the 5 s period following reward delivery significantly decreased reward consummatory licking, which then rebounded in the 5 s after termination of VTA GABA activation (Figures 2C, 2E, and 2G). The ability of VTA GABA activation to disrupt reward consumption became even more pronounced when these neurons were optogenetically stimulated for 10 s (Figure S2). Furthermore, 5 s GABA activation during the cue presentation did not alter the total number of licks over the entire behavioral session (Figure 2F), whereas activation following reward delivery significantly decreased the total number of licks (Figure 2G). In addition, when the 5 s optogenetic stimulation of VTA GABA neurons was applied every 30 s in an open field arena, we observed a reduction in movement velocity time locked to optical activation but no change in rotational locomotor behavior (Figure S2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that activation of VTA GABA neurons following sucrose delivery disrupts reward consumption. Next, we examined whether activation of VTA GABA neurons, or their projections to the NAc, could alter reward consumption in a task where mice were allowed free access to sucrose. ChR2-eYFP and optical fibers (Figure S1) were targeted to VTA GABA neurons as described above. Mice were then trained in a free-reward consumption task that allowed them unlimited access to 10% sucrose for 20 min. Following stable daily sucrose intake, mice underwent sessions where they received a 5 s optical stimulation of VTA GABA neurons every 30 s. We then examined stimulation trials where the mice were actively engaged in licking in the 5 s preceding laser onset. VTA GABA stimulation significantly reduced free-reward consumption during the time of optical activation (Figures 3A and 3B). Light delivery to the VTA in wild-type littermates of VGat-ires-Cre mice receiving virus injections but not expressing ChR2-eYFP did not alter free-reward consumption (Figures S1 and S3). In addition, burst analysis of licking time locked to the optical stimulation revealed that VTA GABA activation decreased the duration of time-locked bout licking but did not alter the interlick interval within a bout or the total number of lick bouts over the entire session. Lick bouts were defined as ≥ 4 licks occurring within 1 s (Figure S3). These data demonstrate that VTA GABA activation can disrupt free-reward consumption by inducing early termination of a licking bout. In addition to signaling locally within the VTA, VTA GABA neurons also send long-distance projections to forebrain targets, such as the NAc (Van Bockstaele and Pickel, 1995Van Bockstaele E.J. Pickel V.M. GABA-containing neurons in the ventral tegmental area project to the nucleus accumbens in rat brain.Brain Res. 1995; 682: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), a brain region that is critical for consummatory behaviors (Hanlon et al., 2004Hanlon E.C. Baldo B.A. Sadeghian K. Kelley A.E.

A pause in nucleus accumbens neuron firing is required to initiate and maintain feeding.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4746-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether activation of VTA GABA projections to the NAc could also disrupt reward consumption. ChR2-eYFP-expressing fibers were observed in striatal targets following virus delivery to the VTA in VGat-ires-Cre mice (Figure 3C). We then quantified eYFP fluorescence in the NAc, dorsal medial striatum (DMS), and dorsal lateral striatum (DLS) 6 weeks after virus injection into the VTA. Fluorescent signal, indicative of the density of GABAergic fibers originating from the VTA, was significantly higher in the NAc compared to either the DMS or DLS (Figure 3C). Importantly, whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from NAc neurons in close proximity to fluorescent fibers revealed that GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were detected following optical stimulation of ChR2 (Figure 3D). This demonstrates that NAc synapses arising from VTA GABA neurons are capable of functionally inhibiting postsynaptic NAc neurons when they are optically stimulated. Interestingly, direct activation of VTA GABAergic projections to the NAc (via an optical fiber located in the NAc, Figure S4) did not alter reward consumption that was time locked to the optical stimulation (Figures 3E and 3F), despite using optical stimulation parameters calculated to activate ChR2 within 1 mm3 from the tip of the optical fiber. This demonstrates that activation of VTA GABAergic projections in the NAc alone is not sufficient to suppress reward consumption. However, VTA-to-NAc GABA may still act in conjunction with intra-VTA GABA or GABA release in other project targets to suppress reward consumption. Since direct activation of VTA GABA neurons but not their projections to the NAc reduced reward consumption, we next explored the mechanisms by which VTA GABA stimulation could alter the activity and excitability of VTA DA neurons. We performed ex vivo whole-cell voltage and current-clamp recordings from VTA DA neurons while optically stimulating VTA GABA neurons. Optical stimulation of VTA GABA neurons led to detectable IPSCs in VTA DA neurons that were abolished by bath application of the GABAA receptor antagonist, gabazine (Figure 4A ). To examine the effects of optical activation of VTA GABA neurons on the excitability and activity of VTA DA neurons, the membrane potentials of DA neurons were initially set to −60 mV in current clamp. We then applied 5 s current injection ramps through the patch pipette to evoke firing in the presence and absence of 5 s light pulses to activate VTA GABA neurons. Activation of VTA GABA neurons reduced excitability of VTA DA neurons as indicated by a significant increase in the rheobase of the recorded neurons compared to recordings when no stimulation occurred (Figures 4B and 4C). In addition, VTA GABA stimulation reduced the activity of VTA DA neurons as indicated by an increase in the interspike interval and a reduction in total number of spikes evoked by the current injection (Figures 4B, 4D, and 4E). Furthermore, to determine whether activation of VTA GABA neurons could functionally suppress activity-dependent release of NAc DA in vivo, we performed fast-scan cyclic voltammetry experiments in anesthetized mice. Electrical activation of VTA DA neurons resulted in a stimulation frequency-dependent increase in detected NAc DA release, which was significantly attenuated by coincidental 5 s VTA GABA activation that started 2.5 s before the electrical stimulation of the VTA (Figure 5). Taken together, these data demonstrate that activation of VTA GABA neurons reduces the excitability and evoked activity of neighboring VTA DA neurons in vitro and in vivo.Figure 5In Vivo Activation of VTA GABA Neurons Reduces Electrically Evoked DA Release in the NAcShow full caption(A) Voltammetric recordings indicated that activation of VTA GABA neurons reduces terminal DA release in the NAc induced by low frequency electrical stimulation of VTA.

https://openalex.org/W2069958858,"Recent studies have shown that defined sets of transcription factors can directly reprogram differentiated somatic cells to a different differentiated cell type without passing through a pluripotent state, but the restricted proliferative and lineage potential of the resulting cells limits the scope of their potential applications. Here we show that a combination of transcription factors (Brn4/Pou3f4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, plus E47/Tcf3) induces mouse fibroblasts to directly acquire a neural stem cell identity-which we term as induced neural stem cells (iNSCs). Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into iNSCs is a gradual process in which the donor transcriptional program is silenced over time. iNSCs exhibit cell morphology, gene expression, epigenetic features, differentiation potential, and self-renewing capacity, as well as in vitro and in vivo functionality similar to those of wild-type NSCs. We conclude that differentiated cells can be reprogrammed directly into specific somatic stem cell types by defined sets of specific transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2027449023,"Recent advances have suggested that direct induction of neural stem cells (NSCs) could provide an alternative to derivation from somatic tissues or pluripotent cells. Here we show direct derivation of stably expandable NSCs from mouse fibroblasts through a curtailed version of reprogramming to pluripotency. By constitutively inducing Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc while strictly limiting Oct4 activity to the initial phase of reprogramming, we generated neurosphere-like colonies that could be expanded for more than 50 passages and do not depend on sustained expression of the reprogramming factors. These induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) uniformly display morphological and molecular features of NSCs, such as the expression of Nestin, Pax6, and Olig2, and have a genome-wide transcriptional profile similar to that of brain-derived NSCs. Moreover, iNSCs can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Our results demonstrate that functional NSCs can be generated from somatic cells by factor-driven induction."

Using paired purified primary monocytes and B cells, we identify new predominantly cell type-specific cis and trans expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), including multi-locus trans associations to LYZ and KLF4 in monocytes and B cells, respectively. Additionally, we observe a B cell-specific trans association of rs11171739 at 12q13.2, a known autoimmune disease locus, with IP6K2 (P = 5.8 × 10(-15)), PRIC285 (P = 3.0 × 10(-10)) and an upstream region of CDKN1A (P = 2 × 10(-52)), suggesting roles for cell cycle regulation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling in autoimmune pathogenesis. We also find that specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles form trans associations with the expression of AOAH and ARHGAP24 in monocytes but not in B cells.

https://openalex.org/W2053330214,"The immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a growth factor for a wide range of leukocytes, including T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Considerable effort has been invested in using IL-2 as a therapeutic agent for a variety of immune disorders ranging from AIDS to cancer. However, adverse effects have limited its use in the clinic. On activated T cells, IL-2 signals through a quaternary 'high affinity' receptor complex consisting of IL-2, IL-2Rα (termed CD25), IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ. Naive T cells express only a low density of IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, and are therefore relatively insensitive to IL-2, but acquire sensitivity after CD25 expression, which captures the cytokine and presents it to IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ. Here, using in vitro evolution, we eliminated the functional requirement of IL-2 for CD25 expression by engineering an IL-2 'superkine' (also called super-2) with increased binding affinity for IL-2Rβ. Crystal structures of the IL-2 superkine in free and receptor-bound forms showed that the evolved mutations are principally in the core of the cytokine, and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the evolved mutations stabilized IL-2, reducing the flexibility of a helix in the IL-2Rβ binding site, into an optimized receptor-binding conformation resembling that when bound to CD25. The evolved mutations in the IL-2 superkine recapitulated the functional role of CD25 by eliciting potent phosphorylation of STAT5 and vigorous proliferation of T cells irrespective of CD25 expression. Compared to IL-2, the IL-2 superkine induced superior expansion of cytotoxic T cells, leading to improved antitumour responses in vivo, and elicited proportionally less expansion of T regulatory cells and reduced pulmonary oedema. Collectively, we show that in vitro evolution has mimicked the functional role of CD25 in enhancing IL-2 potency and regulating target cell specificity, which has implications for immunotherapy."

The scope of neuroplasticity is wide, ranging from short-term weakening and strengthening of existing synapses, through induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), to formation of long-lasting new neuronal connections. These modifications include subtle changes at the synaptic level (e.g., long-term changes in neurotransmitter release) and formation of new cellular structures (Bruel-Jungerman et al., 2007aBruel-Jungerman E.

Neuronal implementation of a new long-lasting cognitive skill acquired over a long period (weeks or months) will necessarily induce such structural changes. Little is known, however, about the magnitude of these changes on a short timescale of learning (minutes to hours). Although invasive microscopy procedures were able to detect regional structural changes following short-term neuroplasticity (Xu et al., 2009Xu T. Yu X. Perlik A.J. Tobin W.F. Zweig J.A. Tennant K.

Structural plasticity, which accompanies the neurophysiological aspects of neuroplasticity, is traditionally studied using postmortem histological procedures (Lamprecht and LeDoux, 2004Lamprecht R.

Although single components of neural tissue can be followed up by two-photon microscopy, a more comprehensive and regional characterization of neuroplasticity can be obtained with MRI. In previous MRI studies on structural plasticity induced by cognitive experience, the focus was on long-term training (weeks to months) (Blumenfeld-Katzir et al., 2011Blumenfeld-Katzir T.

Those studies raised new questions about neuroplasticity and its characteristics. What, for example, is the relationship between the gross MRI changes and histological observations? Can structural changes at the synaptic level account for the significant regional volumetric changes disclosed by MRI? And can MRI detect structural tissue remodeling over short timescales? With these questions in mind, we set out to explore experience-driven structural changes (remodeling) of neuronal tissue over a timescale of hours rather than days or weeks. We discovered that 2 hr of training on a spatial navigation task results in MRI changes indicative of structural plasticity in specific brain regions. MRI provides a handful of qualitative and quantitative structural measures. The most commonly used is T1-weighted imaging, which provides the best contrast for studies of gross anatomy (macrostructure). Recent studies have addressed the relationship between tissue microstructure and cognitive performance using diffusion MRI (Klingberg et al., 2000Klingberg T. Hedehus M. Temple E. Salz T.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a framework of diffusion MRI, provides a multitude of quantitative indices that reflect the micron-scale density and organization of the tissue (Assaf and Pasternak, 2008Assaf Y.

Inferring microstructural features and the physiological state of tissues from diffusion-weighted images.NMR Biomed. 1995; 8: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Indices derived from DTI include the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA), which serve respectively as measures of tissue density and fiber organization/directionality (Pierpaoli and Basser, 1996Pierpaoli C. Basser P.J. Toward a quantitative assessment of diffusion anisotropy.Magn. Reson. Med. 1996; 36: 893-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar). In this study, we used DTI to detect structural changes in brain tissues of individuals after they had performed a spatial learning and memory task based on a computer car race game (Electronic Arts). A cohort of 46 volunteers was divided into a learning group and 2 control groups. The learning group (n = 17) repeated a single track 16 times, divided into 4 sessions of 4 trials each. Their objective was to learn the track and achieve better lap times. To enhance memorization, at the end of each session, subjects were given snapshots of locations in the track, which they had to arrange in the correct order. In addition they were asked to sketch an outline of the track at the end of each session. Subjects were engaged in the overall task for 90 min on average. Each subject underwent a DTI scan before and immediately after the task (i.e., the interval between the two scans was approximately 2 hr). Because the task included procedural learning (control of the car) as well as spatial learning and memorization, a group of 15 subjects was used to control for this aspect. These subjects played the car game for the same duration as the learning group, but the track was different in each trial. Therefore, compared to the learning group, the memorization of a single track was limited, and spatial learning was apparently attenuated. The second control group (n = 14) did not perform any task, and waited between scans for the equivalent duration of the car racing tasks. All subjects in the learning group showed improvement in the task. Their lap times decreased significantly (Figure 1; decrease in normalized lap time [mean ± SEM] was 20% ± 0.4%, p < 0.0001; for absolute values see Figure S1A available online), and their arrangement of snapshots improved (p < 0.0001; Figure S1). The active control group showed no improvement in their normalized lap time (Figure 1). In order to compare between the two groups that played the computer game, we used the normalized average score in the first and last sessions as a measure of performance. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for this measure, with learning versus active control group as a categorical factor. This analysis revealed a significant group by time interaction effect (F(1,29) = 4.59; p < 0.05) because the learning group showed improvement, whereas no changes were observed for the active control (Figure S1B). In order to characterize the effect of the task in the learning group and compare it with the control groups, three statistical analysis procedures were performed.(1)t test: A voxel-wise paired t test between the pre- and post-FA and MD maps of the learning group only was used to assess the regional brain changes that occurred in this group due to the task.(2)Planned comparisons: Following previous experiments on long-term memory of spatial learning task in rats (Blumenfeld-Katzir et al., 2011Blumenfeld-Katzir T.

The first is that MD reduction or FA increase will occur in the learning group, and not in any of the controls; the second is that MD reduction or FA increase will occur mostly in the learning group, to a lesser extent in the active control, and none in the passive control (linear effect). To test these hypotheses, we employed learning versus control group ad hoc-planned comparisons with respect to scan time with weighted contrasts that check for the aforementioned hypotheses.(3)ANOVA: a three (experimental groups) by two (scan time) mixed design ANOVA with repeated measures on the second factor was performed to search for a time by group interaction effect. We used this analysis to verify that our ad hoc comparison hypotheses indeed represent the tissue changes and that there are no other regional effects unrevealed. Figure 2 shows the results of the aforementioned statistical analyses. In all statistical analyses we report only on regions where significant differences were obtained after correction for multiple comparisons (Supplemental Experimental Procedures); for purposes of illustration, however, we also show maps where differences were significant without such correction. The analyses indicated the following regional changes in the learning group: reduction in MD in the left hippocampus (Figures 2A and 2E) and the left and right parahippocampus (Figures 2F and 2J). These results were found also in another cohort of subjects that performed the same task (replica; Figure S2A). Similar analysis was conducted on FA maps (Table S1) in which effect (increase in FA) was found in the left parahippocampus, right supramarginal/angular cortex, right superior temporal gyrus, right amygdala, and left pulvinar. The planned comparison analysis (with the learning versus control group contrast) indicates that the learning group MD reduction is significantly different from the control groups in both the hippocampus and parahippocampus (Figures 2B and 2G). Although the behavioral results indicate that the active control group did not significantly improve in its performance, task-related brain changes in this group may have occurred that are not reflected by our behavioral measures. The linear effect planned comparisons (Figures 2C and 2H) in which the control groups are differently weighted test this issue. Indeed, this analysis shows that the effect in the hippocampus and parahippocampus is slightly different. Although in the hippocampus both control groups do not show any effect, in the parahippocampus the active control group is different from the passive one. There, as can be also seen in Figure 2J, is a reduction in MD, although not as large as in the learning group. We have also performed a group by time interaction (Figures 2D and 2I), which was found to be significant in the parahippocampus. It is noteworthy that other regional effects were not observed in this analysis, indicating that the planned comparisons contrasts adequately represent tissue changes in our study design. In the regions found to change in the planned comparisons test, correlation analysis between the behavioral measures and the pre- and post-task differences in DTI measures was performed. This analysis revealed significant negative correlations between improvement rates in the car racing task and MD reduction in the left hippocampus (r = 0.49; p < 0.05) and right parahippocampus (r = 0.70; p < 0.005; Figure 2G). The improvement rate and starting performance (lap time in the first trial) were found to be highly correlated (r = 0.84; p < 0.001). Therefore, we performed partial correlation between MD reduction and improvement rate controlling for the starting performance. In this analysis the parahippocampus showed significant correlation (r = 0.56; p < 0.05). Further analysis excluded the possibility that our observations (Figure 2) were derived from artifact bias caused by image preprocessing and the registration and normalization procedures (Supplemental Experimental Procedures; Figures S2B and S2C). This included overlaying our results on a single-subject FA map to verify that the effect does not include border regions between gray and white matter (Supplemental Experimental Procedures; Figure S2B). In addition, we verified the MD reduction in the hippocampus by region of interest analysis in the native space of each subject (Supplemental Experimental Procedures; Figure S2C). To verify the statistical analysis (performed with parametric test), in addition to the paired t test, we performed the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the whole brain. This test is applicable if the distribution of the data is unknown, and is less sensitive to outliers than the paired t test. The same statistical threshold (p < 0.05, corrected) was used for both tests, and both yielded similar results, namely a decrease in MD and an increase in FA in the same regions (data not shown). To verify that the diffusion changes do not originate from volumetric or residual blood flow/activity traces, we performed voxel-based comparison of T1 and T2∗ maps (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) that were measured on the replication group. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of the T1 scans before and after the task did not reveal any affected brain regions excluding the possibility that the DTI observations are due to gross anatomical changes in the tissue. Voxel-based analysis (VBA) of the T2∗ maps before and after the task did not reveal any significant changes excluding the possibility that the DTI observations are due to changes in tissue susceptibility that may be caused by traces of neuronal function or blood vessel volume. The learning group was composed of young individuals of both genders. Behaviorally, no significant difference in improvement between the genders was obtained. However, it should not necessarily be inferred that the brain mechanisms that underlie the behavioral results were similar (Schweinsburg et al., 2005Schweinsburg A.D. Nagel B.J.

Soc. 2005; 11: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Speck et al., 2000Speck O. Ernst T. Braun J. Koch C. Miller E. Chang L. Gender differences in the functional organization of the brain for working memory.Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 2581-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, to test for gender differences in regional structural plasticity, we performed a 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA of gender by scan time. Parametric maps of the interaction between gender and scan time for the learning group reveal differences in regional changes between the two genders (Figure 3): the MD is decreased in the right caudate head in males but not in females (Figure 3D), and increased in the superior frontal gyrus in females but not in males (Figure 3G). Further investigation of the biological correlates of the DTI changes observed in humans necessitates an animal study with similar short-term memory protocol. Previous studies on rodents focused on long-term training (Blumenfeld-Katzir et al., 2011Blumenfeld-Katzir T. Pasternak O. Dagan M. Assaf Y. Diffusion MRI of structural brain plasticity induced by a learning and memory task.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e20678Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Lerch et al., 2011Lerch J.P. Yiu A.P.

Maze training in mice induces MRI-detectable brain shape changes specific to the type of learning.Neuroimage. 2011; 54: 2086-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In order to provide supporting biological relevance to the current human study, we conducted a short-term water maze study on rats. A cohort of 24 rats underwent two MRI scans 1 day a part. Between the MRI scans a water maze task was performed including 12 trials performed within 2 hr. As in the human study, two control groups were also examined: a passive group that did not perform any task between the MRI scans, and a cued group that performed the water maze but with a visible platform (for more details see Supplemental Experimental Procedures; Figure S3). In the statistical analysis (same as in the human study), we found MD decrease in the posterior parts of the hippocampus (Figures 4A and 4B). Histological analysis of the brain following the second MRI scan revealed an increase in the immunoreactivity of the following markers in the learning group compared with the control group: synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Figures 4C and S3). No immune-reactivity differences were observed when staining for microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), a marker of dendrites. This result indicates that within the regions of MD decrease, the following occurred: an increase in the number of synaptic vesicles, astrocyte activation (reflected also by increase in the number of astrocytic processes; Figure 4D), as well as increase in BDNF expression, which may be indicative of LTP. The results of this study indicated that short-term learning (2 hr) in humans leads to significant changes in diffusion MRI indices. This surprising observation was strengthened by a rigorous statistical analysis, was repeated in a replica of the study (Figure S2A), and was obtained in a supporting study in rats (Figures 4 and S3). It is reasonable to assume that this MRI observation reflects structural aspects of neuroplasticity. Because DTI can be considered to be a marker of tissue microstructure, structural remodeling of the tissue will lead to a change in its water-diffusion properties (Assaf and Pasternak, 2008Assaf Y.

These diffusion changes are likely to be manifested as an increase in tissue density (due to reshaping of neuronal or glial processes), or enhancement of tissue organization (strengthening of axonal or dendritic backbones and surrounding tissue; Assaf and Pasternak, 2008Assaf Y. Pasternak O. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based white matter mapping in brain research: a review.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2008; 34: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Reports indicate a strong link between structural changes (neuronal or cellular or both) and diffusion indices. The best studied of these links is the reduction in MD after stroke (Assaf, 2008Assaf Y.

Another indication is the transient MD reduction following neuronal depolarization (Darquié et al., 2001Darquié A. Poline J.B. Poupon C. Saint-Jalmes H. Le Bihan D.

The localization of the structural changes that we traced in this study, though expected, nevertheless, has some surprising aspects. Animal and human studies in vivo, as well as histological, functional, and anatomic observations, point to a central role of the hippocampus in short-term memory processes (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993Bliss T.V.

We modeled the genetic architecture underlying genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for rheumatoid arthritis and developed a new method using polygenic risk-score analyses to infer the total liability-scale variance explained by associated GWAS SNPs. Using this method, we estimated that, together, thousands of SNPs from rheumatoid arthritis GWAS explain an additional 20% of disease risk (excluding known associated loci). We further tested this method on datasets for three additional diseases and obtained comparable estimates for celiac disease (43% excluding the major histocompatibility complex), myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease (48%) and type 2 diabetes (49%). Our results are consistent with simulated genetic models in which hundreds of associated loci harbor common causal variants and a smaller number of loci harbor multiple rare causal variants. These analyses suggest that GWAS will continue to be highly productive for the discovery of additional susceptibility loci for common diseases."

In this report, we find that deliberate alteration of commensal bacterial populations via oral antibiotic treatment resulted in elevated serum IgE concentrations, increased steady-state circulating basophil populations and exaggerated basophil-mediated T(H)2 cell responses and allergic inflammation. Elevated serum IgE levels correlated with increased circulating basophil populations in mice and subjects with hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome. Furthermore, B cell-intrinsic expression of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) was required to limit serum IgE concentrations and circulating basophil populations in mice. Commensal-derived signals were found to influence basophil development by limiting proliferation of bone marrow-resident precursor populations. Collectively, these results identify a previously unrecognized pathway through which commensal-derived signals influence basophil hematopoiesis and susceptibility to T(H)2 cytokine-dependent inflammation and allergic disease."

Although these drugs have been used clinically since 1960, the molecular basis of this interaction is still not known. By using multiple homology models and an unbiased docking protocol, we identified a binding hypothesis for the diazepam-bound structure of the benzodiazepine site, which was confirmed by experimental evidence. Moreover, two independent virtual screening approaches based on this structure identified known benzodiazepine-site ligands from different structural classes and predicted potential new ligands for this site. Receptor-binding assays and electrophysiological studies on recombinant receptors confirmed these predictions and thus identified new chemotypes for the benzodiazepine-binding site. Our results support the validity of the diazepam-bound structure of the benzodiazepine-binding pocket, demonstrate its suitability for drug discovery and pave the way for structure-based drug design."

https://openalex.org/W2091334340,"In human leprosy, a dendritic cell differentiation pathway that depends on interleukin-32 and is induced by NOD2 represents a novel mechanism of host defense against infection. It is unclear whether the ability of the innate immune system to recognize distinct ligands from a single microbial pathogen via multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) triggers common pathways or differentially triggers specific host responses. In the human mycobacterial infection leprosy, we found that activation of monocytes via nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) by its ligand muramyl dipeptide, as compared to activation via heterodimeric Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR2/1) by triacylated lipopeptide, preferentially induced differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs), which was dependent on a previously unknown interleukin-32 (IL-32)-dependent mechanism. Notably, IL-32 was sufficient to induce monocytes to rapidly differentiate into DCs, which were more efficient than granulocyte-macrophage colony–stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-derived DCs in presenting antigen to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I–restricted CD8+ T cells. Expression of NOD2 and IL-32 and the frequency of CD1b+ DCs at the site of leprosy infection correlated with the clinical presentation; they were greater in patients with limited as compared to progressive disease. The addition of recombinant IL-32 restored NOD2-induced DC differentiation in patients with the progressive form of leprosy. In conclusion, the NOD2 ligand–induced, IL-32–dependent DC differentiation pathway contributes a key and specific mechanism for host defense against microbial infection in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2081489843,"Alternative messenger RNA splicing is the main reason that vast mammalian proteomic complexity can be achieved with a limited number of genes. Splicing is physically and functionally coupled to transcription, and is greatly affected by the rate of transcript elongation. As the nascent pre-mRNA emerges from transcribing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), it is assembled into a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particle; this is the functional form of the nascent pre-mRNA and determines the fate of the mature transcript. However, factors that connect the transcribing polymerase with the mRNP particle and help to integrate transcript elongation with mRNA splicing remain unclear. Here we characterize the human interactome of chromatin-associated mRNP particles. This led us to identify deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) and ZNF326 (which we call ZNF-protein interacting with nuclear mRNPs and DBC1 (ZIRD)) as subunits of a novel protein complex--named DBIRD--that binds directly to RNAPII. DBIRD regulates alternative splicing of a large set of exons embedded in (A + T)-rich DNA, and is present at the affected exons. RNA-interference-mediated DBIRD depletion results in region-specific decreases in transcript elongation, particularly across areas encompassing affected exons. Together, these data indicate that the DBIRD complex acts at the interface between mRNP particles and RNAPII, integrating transcript elongation with the regulation of alternative splicing."

https://openalex.org/W2025952153,"Background Levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and D-dimer predict mortality in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with relatively preserved CD4+ T cell counts. We hypothesized that elevated pre-ART levels of these markers among patients with advanced HIV would be associated with an increased risk of death following the initiation of ART. Methods Pre-ART plasma from patients with advanced HIV in South Africa was used to measure hsCRP, IL-6 and D-dimer. Using a nested case-control study design, the biomarkers were measured for 187 deaths and two controls matched on age, sex, clinical site, follow-up time and CD4+ cell counts. Odds ratios were estimated using conditional logistic regression. In addition, for a random sample of 100 patients, biomarkers were measured at baseline and 6 months following randomization to determine whether ART altered their levels. Results Median baseline biomarkers levels for cases and controls, respectively, were 11.25 vs. 3.6 mg/L for hsCRP, 1.41 vs. 0.98 mg/L for D-dimer, and 9.02 vs. 4.20 pg/mL for IL-6 (all p<0.0001). Adjusted odds ratios for the highest versus lowest quartile of baseline biomarker levels were 3.5 (95% CI: 1.9–6.7) for hsCRP, 2.6 (95%CI 1.4–4.9) for D-dimer, and 3.8 (95% CI: 1.8–7.8) for IL-6. These associations were stronger for deaths that occurred more proximal to the biomarker measurements. Levels of D-dimer and IL-6, but not hsCRP, were significantly lower at month 6 after commencing ART compared to baseline (p<0.0001). Conclusions Among patients with advanced HIV disease, elevated pre-ART levels of hsCRP, IL-6 and D-dimer are strongly associated with early mortality after commencing ART. Elevated levels of inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers may identify patients who may benefit from aggressive clinical monitoring after commencing ART. Further investigation of strategies to reduce biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation in patients with advanced HIV disease is warranted.

https://openalex.org/W2062437408,"In most eukaryotes, the progressive loss of chromosome-terminal DNA sequences is counteracted by the enzyme telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that uses part of an RNA subunit as template to synthesize telomeric repeats. Many cancer cells express high telomerase activity, and mutations in telomerase subunits are associated with degenerative syndromes including dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anaemia. The therapeutic value of altering telomerase activity thus provides ample impetus to study the biogenesis and regulation of this enzyme in human cells and model systems. We have previously identified a precursor of the fission yeast telomerase RNA subunit (TER1) and demonstrated that the mature 3'-end is generated by the spliceosome in a single cleavage reaction akin to the first step of splicing. Directly upstream and partly overlapping with the spliceosomal cleavage site is a putative binding site for Sm proteins. Sm and like-Sm (LSm) proteins belong to an ancient family of RNA-binding proteins represented in all three domains of life. Members of this family form ring complexes on specific sets of target RNAs and have critical roles in their biogenesis, function and turnover. Here we demonstrate that the canonical Sm ring and the Lsm2-8 complex sequentially associate with fission yeast TER1. The Sm ring binds to the TER1 precursor, stimulates spliceosomal cleavage and promotes the hypermethylation of the 5'-cap by Tgs1. Sm proteins are then replaced by the Lsm2-8 complex, which promotes the association with the catalytic subunit and protects the mature 3'-end of TER1 from exonucleolytic degradation. Our findings define the sequence of events that occur during telomerase biogenesis and characterize roles for Sm and Lsm complexes as well as for the methylase Tgs1."

As SV has been associated with HIV vulnerability, this study examined health related behaviours and practices associated with SV among MSM-T. Design Data were from cross-sectional surveys from four districts in Karnataka, India. Methods Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to examine factors related to SV. Multivariable negative binomial regression models examined the association between physician visits and SV. Results A total of 543 MSM-T were included in the study. Prevalence of SV was 18% in the past year. HIV prevalence among those reporting SV was 20%, compared to 12% among those not reporting SV (p = .104). In multivariable models, and among sex workers, those reporting SV were more likely to report anal sex with 5+ casual sex partners in the past week (AOR: 4.1; 95%CI: 1.2–14.3, p = .029). Increased physician visits among those reporting SV was reported only for those involved in sex work (ARR: 1.7; 95%CI: 1.1–2.7, p = .012).

https://openalex.org/W2009314584,"Networks of epithelial and endothelial tubes are essential for the function of organs such as the lung, kidney and vascular system. The sizes and shapes of these tubes are highly regulated to match their individual functions. Defects in tube size can cause debilitating diseases such as polycystic kidney disease and ischaemia. It is therefore critical to understand how tube dimensions are regulated. Here we identify the tyrosine kinase Src as an instructive regulator of epithelial-tube length in the Drosophila tracheal system. Loss-of-function Src42 mutations shorten tracheal tubes, whereas Src42 overexpression elongates them. Surprisingly, Src42 acts distinctly from known tube-size pathways and regulates both the amount of apical surface growth and, with the conserved formin dDaam, the direction of growth. Quantitative three-dimensional image analysis reveals that Src42- and dDaam-mutant tracheal cells expand more in the circumferential than the axial dimension, resulting in tubes that are shorter in length-but larger in diameter-than wild-type tubes. Thus, Src42 and dDaam control tube dimensions by regulating the direction of anisotropic growth, a mechanism that has not previously been described."

Here, we used fMRI to determine to what extent human motion-responsive areas integrate planar retinal motion with nonretinal eye movement signals in order to discard self-induced planar retinal motion and to respond to objective (""real"") motion. In contrast to other areas, V3A lacked responses to self-induced planar retinal motion but responded strongly to head-centered motion, even when retinally canceled by pursuit. This indicates a near-complete multimodal integration of visual with nonvisual planar motion signals in V3A. V3A could be mapped selectively and robustly in every single subject on this basis. V6 also reported head-centered planar motion, even when 3D flow was added to it, but was suppressed by retinal planar motion.

https://openalex.org/W2114078308,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a master gene orchestrating the activation of gluconeogenic genes in the liver in response to food withdrawal. Mechanisms of GR regulation by other nuclear receptors, however, are poorly defined. Here, we report that the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a bile acid sensor, activates gluconeogenic pathways in the liver and regulates GR expression and activity. FXR-null mice are hypoglycemic in the unfed state and exhibit both a reduced hepatic production of glucose in response to the pyruvate challenge and a decreased expression of two rate-limiting enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), along with blunted liver expression of GR. Treating wild-type mice with a semisynthetic FXR ligand (6E-CDCA) increases the liver expression of GR, PEPCK, and G6Pase. This effect was lost in fed animals, as well as in FXR–/– mice. The human and mouse GR promoters contain a conserved FXR-responsive element (an ER-8 sequence) whose activation by FXR ligation leads to GR transcription. GR silencing by siRNA in vitro or its pharmacological antagonism in vivo with mifepristone reverses the effect of FXR activation on expression of gluconeogenic genes. These findings demonstrate that an FXR-GR pathway regulates the activation of hepatic gluconeogenesis in the transition from the unfed to the fed state.—Renga, B., Mencarelli, A., D'Amore, C., Cipriani, S., Baldelli, F., Zampella, A., Distrutti, E., Fiorucci, S.

Here, we sought to investigate the roles of endogenous 5-lipoxygenase products and exogenous leukotrienes during Histoplasma capsulatum infection in vivo and in vitro. 5-LO deficiency led to increased lung CFU, decreased nitric oxide production and a deficient primary immune response during active fungal infection. Moreover, H. capsulatum-infected 5-LO−/− mice showed an intense influx of neutrophils and an impaired ability to generate and recruit effector T cells to the lung. The fungal susceptibility of 5-LO−/− mice correlated with a lower rate of macrophage ingestion of IgG-H. capsulatum relative to WT macrophages. Conversely, exogenous LTB4 and LTC4 restored macrophage phagocytosis in 5-LO deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that leukotrienes are required to control chronic fungal infection by amplifying both the innate and adaptive immune response during histoplasmosis."
https://openalex.org/W2041313758,"Gram-negative bacteria release lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the bloodstream. Here, it engages Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 expressed in human lung microvascular endothelia (HMVEC-Ls) to open the paracellular pathway through Src family kinase (SFK) activation. The signaling molecules that couple TLR4 to the SFK-driven barrier disruption are unknown. In HMVEC-Ls, siRNA-induced silencing of TIRAP/Mal and overexpression of dominant-negative TIRAP/Mal each blocked LPS-induced SFK activation and increases in transendothelial [(14)C]albumin flux, implicating the MyD88-dependent pathway. LPS increased TRAF6 autoubiquitination and binding to IRAK1. Silencing of TRAF6, TRAF6-dominant-negative overexpression, or preincubation of HMVEC-Ls with a cell-permeable TRAF6 decoy peptide decreased both LPS-induced SFK activation and barrier disruption. LPS increased binding of both c-Src and Fyn to GST-TRAF6 but not to a GST-TRAF6 mutant in which the three prolines in the putative Src homology 3 domain-binding motif (amino acids 461-469) were substituted with alanines. A cell-permeable decoy peptide corresponding to the same proline-rich motif reduced SFK binding to WT GST-TRAF6 compared with the Pro → Ala-substituted peptide. Finally, LPS increased binding of activated Tyr(P)(416)-SFK to GST-TRAF6, and preincubation of HMVEC-Ls with SFK-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PP2 and SU6656, diminished TRAF6 binding to c-Src and Fyn. During the TRAF6-SFK association, TRAF6 catalyzed Lys(63)-linked ubiquitination of c-Src and Fyn, whereas SFK activation increased tyrosine phosphorylation of TRAF6. The TRAF6 decoy peptide blocked both LPS-induced SFK ubiquitination and TRAF6 phosphorylation. Together, these data indicate that the proline-rich Src homology 3 domain-binding motif in TRAF6 interacts directly with activated SFKs to couple LPS engagement of TLR4 to SFK activation and loss of barrier integrity in HMVEC-Ls."
https://openalex.org/W2005583362,"The ubiquitously expressed cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is subjected to the physiological α-cleavage at a region critical for both PrP toxicity and the conversion of PrP(C) to its pathogenic prion form (PrP(Sc)), generating the C1 and N1 fragments. The C1 fragment can activate caspase 3 while the N1 fragment is neuroprotective. Recent articles indicate that ADAM10, ADAM17, and ADAM9 may not play a prominent role in the α-cleavage of PrP(C) as previously thought, raising questions on the identity of the responsible protease(s). Here we show that, ADAM8 can directly cleave PrP to generate C1 in vitro and PrP C1/full-length ratio is greatly decreased in the skeletal muscles of ADAM8 knock-out mice; in addition, the PrP C1/full-length ratio is linearly correlated with ADAM8 protein level in myoblast cell line C2C12 and in skeletal muscle tissues of transgenic mice. These results indicate that ADAM8 is the primary protease responsible for the α-cleavage of PrP(C) in muscle cells. Moreover, we found that overexpression of PrP(C) led to up-regulation of ADAM8, suggesting that PrP(C) may regulate its own α-cleavage through modulating ADAM8 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2031612164,"Aims To evaluate the associations of age at menarche and the leg length-to-sitting-height ratio, markers of adolescent growth, with risk of diabetes in later life. Materials and Methods Information from 69,385 women and 55,311 men, aged 40–74 years from the Shanghai Women's Health Study and Shanghai Men's Health Study, were included in the current analyses. Diabetes status was ascertained through biennial in person follow-up. Cox models, with age as the time scale, were used. Results There were 2369 cases of diabetes (1831 women; 538 men) during an average of 7.3 and 3.6 years of follow-up of the women and men, respectively. In females, menarche age was inversely associated with diabetes risk after adjustment for birth cohort, education, and income (HR = 0.95, 0.92–0.98). In both genders, leg length-to-sitting-height ratio was inversely related to diabetes (HR = 0.88, 0.80–0.97 for men; HR = 0.91, 0.86–0.96 for women) after adjustment for birth cohort, education, and income. Further adjustment for adult BMI at study enrollment completely eliminated the associations of age at menarche (HR = 0.99, 0.96–1.02) and the leg length-to-sitting-height ratio (HR = 1.00, 0.91–1.10 for men; HR = 1.01, 0.96–1.07 for women) with diabetes risk. Conclusions Our study suggests that markers of an early age at peak height velocity, i.e. early menarche age and low leg-length-to-sitting height ratio, may be associated with diabetes risk later in life and this association is likely to be mediated through obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2065086182,"Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a bulk degradation system conserved in all eukaryotes, which engulfs cytoplasmic components within double-membrane vesicles to allow their delivery to, and subsequent degradation within, the vacuole/lysosome. Autophagy activity is tightly regulated in response to the nutritional state of the cell and also to maintain organelle homeostasis. In nutrient-rich conditions, Tor kinase complex 1 (TORC1) is activated to inhibit autophagy, whereas inactivation of this complex in response to stress leads to autophagy induction; however, it is unclear how the activity of TORC1 is controlled to allow precise adjustments in autophagy activity. In this study, we performed genetic analyses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify factors that regulate TORC1 activity. We determined that the Ksp1 kinase functions in part as a negative regulator of autophagy; deletion of KSP1 facilitated dephosphorylation of Atg13, a TORC1 substrate, which correlates with enhanced autophagy. These results suggest that Ksp1 down-regulates autophagy activity via the TORC1 pathway. The suppressive function of Ksp1 is partially activated by the Ras/cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which is another negative regulator of autophagy. Our study therefore identifies Ksp1 as a new component that functions as part of the PKA and TORC1 signaling network to control the magnitude of autophagy."

https://openalex.org/W2087379600,"The Yersinia pestis adhesin molecule Ail interacts with the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (Fn) on host cells to facilitate efficient delivery of cytotoxic Yop proteins, a process essential for plague virulence. A number of bacterial pathogens are known to bind to the N-terminal region of Fn, comprising type I Fn (FNI) repeats. Using proteolytically generated Fn fragments and purified recombinant Fn fragments, we demonstrated that Ail binds the centrally located 120-kDa fragment containing type III Fn (FNIII) repeats. A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize specific epitopes within the 120-kDa fragment demonstrated that mAb binding to (9)FNIII blocks Ail-mediated bacterial binding to Fn. Epitopes of three mAbs that blocked Ail binding to Fn were mapped to a similar face of (9)FNIII. Antibodies directed against (9)FNIII also inhibited Ail-dependent cell binding activity, thus demonstrating the biological relevance of this Ail binding region on Fn. Bacteria expressing Ail on their surface could also bind a minimal fragment of Fn containing repeats (9-10)FNIII, and this binding was blocked by a mAb specific for (9)FNIII. These data demonstrate that Ail binds to (9)FNIII of Fn and presents Fn to host cells to facilitate cell binding and delivery of Yops (cytotoxins of Y. pestis), a novel interaction, distinct from other bacterial Fn-binding proteins."

CNB domains that bind cAMP are found coupled to diverse effector domains, such as cyclic nucleotide-regulated ion channels, catabolite activator protein (CAP, or cAMP-responsive proteins), guanine nucleotide exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac), and cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunits. CNB domain-containing proteins are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and are easily identifiable by a 12-amino acid motif, referred to as the phosphate binding cassette (PBC), containing invariant residues critical for anchoring cAMP. Indeed, the structural biology of diverse CNBs reveals a highly conserved architecture with an α-subdomain and a β-subdomain comprising an eight-stranded β-sheet containing the PBC. The PBC provides a conserved high affinity binding pocket for both cAMP and cGMP (1.Berman H.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Goodsell D.S. Haste N.M. Kornev A. Taylor S.S. The cAMP binding domain.

Crystal structures of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), CAP, cyclic nucleotide-regulated channels, and Epac1 reveal interactions of cAMP with the PBC as well as additional conformational changes that are relayed from the CNB domain to the associated effector domains. These studies have suggested that all CNB domains regulate the effector domain upon binding of cAMP through hydrophobic interactions (5.Kannan N. Wu J. Anand G.S. Yooseph S. Neuwald A.F. Venter J.C. Taylor S.S. Evolution of allostery in the cyclic nucleotide binding module.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R264Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CNB domains have been shown to adopt two stable end point conformations, denoted as the B (cAMP-bound, active; supplemental Fig. 1A) (6.Badireddy S. Yunfeng G. Ritchie M. Akamine P. Wu J. Kim C.W.

Conserved residues in the PBC are critical in anchoring the different functional moieties in cAMP and present a high affinity binding pocket that combines precise geometry with specificity (supplemental Fig. 1A). These include a conserved Gly, whose backbone amide nitrogen along with the side chain of a Glu residue anchor the ribose 2′-OH. A conserved Arg anchors the phosphodiester bond, and an aromatic residue, part of a “lid” region, stacks against cAMP and stabilizes its binding. A “hinge” region consisting of hydrophobic residues is responsible for propagating the effects of cAMP binding to distal regions of the protein (reviewed in Ref. 7.Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L.

Cell Proteomics. 2011; 10 (M110.004390)PubMed Google Scholar). In the induced fit model, conformational changes following cAMP binding are propagated throughout the entire protein, whereas the conformational selection model assumes that CNB domains are metastable and populate all stable end point conformations, one of which is preferentially “selected” by cAMP. The importance of allosteric relays for cAMP action is highly relevant to both models. Similar mechanisms have been described with the CNB domains in Epac, where evidence of the apo-CNB domain existing in an ensemble of two or more conformations provided the primary basis for conformational selection (16.Harper S.M.

This domain organization is unique to mycobacteria and therefore provides an opportunity to monitor conformational changes that occur upon cAMP binding to a novel effector domain, namely a protein acetyltransferase.In this study, we monitor the dynamic conformational changes that occur upon cAMP binding to MSMEG_5458 (henceforth referred to as KATms) using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) (31.Biswas K.H.

Employing HDXMS, we observed that in contrast to other CNB domains, no cAMP-dependent changes in deuterium exchange in KATms were observable in regions associated with allostery in other CNB domains. Instead, we show the importance of a putative helical region between the CBD and the AT domain and identify two residues that are crucial for transmitting the information of cAMP-binding to the C-terminal AT domain. This therefore represents the first example of a primitive CNB domain lacking specific allosteric relays that couple cAMP binding to regulation of an associated catalytic domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll fine chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich.

Aliquots of the cytosol (with luciferase activity of ∼10,000 counts/s) were incubated with the indicated amounts of cyclic nucleotide monophosphate in a buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl (total volume of 60 μl) at 37 °C for 10 min. DeepBlue C (coelenterazine 4a; Molecular Imaging Products) was added to a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings for 0.5 s were collected in a Victor3 microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Emission filters used for Rluc and GFP2 emission were 410 nm (bandpass 80 nm) and 515 nm (bandpass 30 nm), respectively. BRET2 measurements were averaged from three readings, and BRET2 ratios, calculated as GFP2 emission divided by Rluc emission, were recorded.In Vitro Acetylation AssaysAssays were carried out in a 20-μl total reaction volume containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μm acetyl-CoA, MSMEG_4207 (universal stress protein; USP) as substrate (29.Nambi S.

The assay reaction mixtures contained 0.2 mm NAD, 0.2 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2.4 mm α-ketoglutarate, 50 μm acetyl-CoA, 50 μm USP, 0.03 units of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, 190 nm KATms, 100 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm bis-Tris, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5). All assay components except KATms and USP were incubated first at 25 °C for 5 min. The rates were analyzed continuously for 5 min by measuring NADH production at 340 nm.For quantitation of immunoreactivity, a Western blot assay was used. Enzymatic assays were performed with varying concentrations of KATms, acetyl-CoA, and USP, as indicated, and incubated for the times indicated at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample dye and boiled, and aliquots were loaded onto a gel for subsequent Western blot analysis using the acetyl lysine antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. Images were acquired with the FluorChem Q MultiImage III system (Alpha Innotech), and image intensities were quantified using the AlphaView Q version 3.03 software. Values obtained were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 5 using built-in equations for enzyme kinetics.Amide Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Mass SpectrometryApo-KATms (without cAMP) was concentrated to 80 μm using Vivaspin concentrators (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Goettingen, Germany). Samples were prepared by adding cAMP, (Rp)-cAMPS, or (Sp)-cAMPS (1 mm) to the protein. 2 μl each of sample in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) was diluted individually with 18 μl of D2O (99.9%) to yield a final concentration of 90% D2O. Exchange was carried out at 20 °C for various times (0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min). The exchange reaction was quenched by adding 40 μl of prechilled 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to get a final pH read of 2.5. A 50-μl aliquot of the quenched sample (∼200 pmol of protein sample) was then injected on to a chilled nano-UPLC sample manager (beta test version, Waters, Milford, MA) as described previously (33.Engen J.R.

The sample was washed through a 2.1 × 30-mm immobilized pepsin column (Porozyme, ABI, Foster City, CA) using 100 μl/min 0.05% formic acid in water. Digested peptides were trapped on a 2.1 × 5-mm C18 trap (ACQUITY BEH C18 VanGuard precolumn, 1.7-μm resin, Waters), and peptides were eluted using an 8–40% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at 40 μl/min, which was supplied by a nanoACQUITY binary solvent manager onto a reverse phase column (Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column, 1.0 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters).

https://openalex.org/W1979820372,"The subcellular localization of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is critical to their ability to function as innate immune sensors of microbial infection. We previously reported that an I602S polymorphism of human TLR1 is associated with aberrant trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface, loss of responses to TLR1 agonists, and differential susceptibility to diseases caused by pathogenic mycobacteria. Through an extensive analysis of receptor deletion and point mutants we have discovered that position 602 resides within a short 6 amino acid cytoplasmic region that is required for TLR1 surface expression. This short trafficking motif, in conjunction with the adjacent transmembrane domain, is sufficient to direct TLR1 to the cell surface. A serine at position 602 interrupts this trafficking motif and prevents cell surface expression of TLR1. Additionally, we have found that ER-resident TLR chaperones, PRAT4A and PRAT4B, act as positive and negative regulators of TLR1 surface trafficking, respectively. Importantly, either over-expression of PRAT4A or knock-down of PRAT4B rescues cell surface expression of the TLR1 602S variant. We also report that IFN-γ treatment of primary human monocytes derived from homozygous 602S individuals rescues TLR1 cell surface trafficking and cellular responses to soluble agonists. This event appears to be mediated by PRAT4A whose expression is strongly induced in human monocytes by IFN-γ. Collectively, these results provide a mechanism for the differential trafficking of TLR1 I602S variants, and highlight the distinct roles for PRAT4A and PRAT4B in the regulation of TLR1 surface expression.

https://openalex.org/W2169045667,"The proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast (OB) precursors are essential for elaborating the bone-forming activity of mature OBs. However, the mechanisms regulating OB proliferation and function are largely unknown. We reported that OB proliferation is enhanced by megakaryocytes (MKs) via a process that is regulated in part by integrin signaling. The tyrosine kinase Pyk2 has been shown to regulate cell proliferation and survival in a variety of cells. Pyk2 is also activated by integrin signaling and regulates actin remodeling in bone-resorbing osteoclasts. In this study, we examined the role of Pyk2 and actin in the MK-mediated increase in OB proliferation. Calvarial OBs were cultured in the presence of MKs for various times, and Pyk2 signaling cascades in OBs were examined by Western blotting, subcellular fractionation, and microscopy. We found that MKs regulate the temporal expression of Pyk2 and its subcellular localization. We also found that MKs regulate the expression of two alternatively spliced isoforms of Pyk2 in OBs, which may regulate OB differentiation and proliferation. MKs also induced cytoskeletal reorganization in OBs, which was associated with the caspase-mediated cleavage of actin, an increase in focal adhesions, and the formation of apical membrane ruffles. Moreover, BrdU incorporation in MK-stimulated OBs was blocked by the actin-polymerizing agent, jasplakinolide. Collectively, our studies reveal that Pyk2 and actin play an important role in MK-regulated signaling cascades that control OB proliferation and may be important for therapeutic interventions aimed at increasing bone formation in metabolic diseases of the skeleton.

https://openalex.org/W2153194849,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein possesses a unique membrane-transduction property. Interestingly, Tat transduction could be dramatically increased 1000-fold based on LTR-transactivation assay when complexed with cationic liposomes (lipo-Tat), compared with Tat alone. Therefore, underlining mechanisms were explored further. Microscopy and flow cytometry showed that this effect was associated with enhanced membrane binding, large particle formation (1-2 μm) and increased intracellular uptake of Tat fluorescent proteins. Using pharmacological assays and immune colocalizations, it was found that lipid raft-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis were major pathways involved in lipo-Tat uptake, and actin-filaments played a major role in intracellular trafficking of lipo-Tat to the nucleus. Furthermore, we found that the Tat hydrophobic domain (aa 36–47) mediated formation of two positively charged molecules into lipo-Tat complexes via hydrophobic bonds, based on LTR-transactivation inhibition assay. Thus, the hydrophobic domain may play an important role in Tat protein uptake and be useful for intracellular delivery of biomacromolecules if coupled together with Tat basic peptide, a cell-penetrating peptide.—Li, G.-H., Li, W., Mumper, R.

https://openalex.org/W1974877525,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kre6 is a type II membrane protein essential for cell wall β-1,6-glucan synthesis. Recently we reported that the majority of Kre6 is in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but a significant portion of Kre6 is found in the plasma membrane of buds, and this polarized appearance of Kre6 is required for β-1,6-glucan synthesis. An essential membrane protein, Keg1, and ER chaperon Rot1 bind to Kre6. In this study we found that in mutant keg1-1 cells, accumulation of Kre6 at the buds is diminished, binding of Kre6 to Keg1 is decreased, and Kre6 becomes susceptible to ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which suggests Keg1 participates in folding and transport of Kre6. All mutants of the calnexin cycle member homologues (cwh41, rot2, kre5, and cne1) showed defects in β-1,6-glucan synthesis, although the calnexin chaperon system is considered not functional in yeast. We found synthetic defects between them and keg1-1, and Cne1 co-immunoprecipitated with Keg1 and Kre6. A stronger binding of Cne1 to Kre6 was detected when two glucosidases (Cwh41 and Rot2) that remove glucose on N-glycan were functional. Skn1, a Kre6 homologue, was not detected by immunofluorescence in the wild type yeast, but in kre6Δ cells it became detectable and behaved like Kre6. In conclusion, the action of multiple ER chaperon-like proteins is required for proper folding and localization of Kre6 and probably Skn1 to function in β-1,6-glucan synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2009505801,"Regardless of the route of transmission, R5-tropic HIV-1 predominates early in infection, rendering C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonists as attractive agents not only for antiretroviral therapy but also for prevention. Here, we report the specificity, potency, and underlying mechanism of action of a novel small molecule CCR5 antagonist, TD-0680. TD-0680 displayed the greatest potency against a diverse group of R5-tropic HIV-1 and SIV strains when compared with its prodrug, TD-0232, the Food and Drug Administration-approved CCR5 antagonist Maraviroc, and TAK-779, with EC(50) values in the subnanomolar range (0.09-2.29 nm). Importantly, TD-0680 was equally potent at blocking envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and cell-mediated viral transmission as well as the replication of a TAK-779/Maraviroc-resistant HIV-1 variant. Interestingly, TD-0232 and TD-0680 functioned differently despite binding to a similar transmembrane pocket of CCR5. Site-directed mutagenesis, drug combination, and antibody blocking assays identified a novel mechanism of action of TD-0680. In addition to binding to the transmembrane pocket, the unique exo configuration of this molecule protrudes and sterically blocks access to the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) region of CCR5, thereby interrupting the interaction between virus and its co-receptor more effectively. This mechanism of action was supported by the observations of similar TD-0680 potency against CD4-dependent and -independent SIV strains and by molecular docking analysis using a CCR5 model. TD-0680, therefore, merits development as an anti-HIV-1 agent for therapeutic purposes and/or as a topical microbicide for the prevention of sexual transmission of R5-tropic HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2095180356,"ICA69 (islet cell autoantigen 69 kDa) is a protein implicated in type 1 diabetes mellitus in both the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model and humans. ICA69 is encoded by the Ica1 gene on mouse chromosome 6 A1-A2. We previously reported reduced ICA69 expression in the thymus of NOD mice compared with thymus of several non-diabetic mouse strains. We propose that reduced thymic ICA69 expression could result from variations in transcriptional regulation of the gene and that polymorphisms within the Ica1 core promoter may partially determine this transcriptional variability. We characterized the functional promoter of Ica1 in NOD mice and compared it with the corresponding portions of Ica1 in non-diabetic C57BL/6 mice. Luciferase reporter constructs demonstrated that the NOD Ica1 promoter region exhibited markedly reduced luciferase expression in transiently transfected medullary thymus epithelial (mTEC(+)) and B-cell (M12)-derived cell lines. However, in a non-diabetic strain, C57BL/6, the Ica1 promoter region was transcriptionally active when transiently transfected into the same cell lines. We concomitantly identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms within the NOD Ica1 promoter. One of these single nucleotide polymorphisms increases the binding affinity for the transcription factor AIRE (autoimmune regulator), which is highly expressed in thymic epithelial cells, where it is known to play a key role regulating self-antigen expression. We conclude that polymorphisms within the NOD Ica1 core promoter may determine AIRE-mediated down-regulation of ICA69 expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells, thus providing a novel mechanistic explanation for the loss of immunologic tolerance to this self-antigen in autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1990835317,"A detailed structure/function analysis of Drosophila p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6KII) or its mammalian homolog RSK has not been performed in the context of neuronal plasticity or behavior. We previously reported that S6KII is required for normal circadian periodicity. Here we report a site-directed mutagenesis of S6KII and analysis of mutants, in vivo, that identifies functional domains and phosphorylation sites critical for the regulation of circadian period. We demonstrate, for the first time, a role for the S6KII C-terminal kinase that is independent of its known role in activation of the N-terminal kinase. Both S6KII C-terminal kinase activity and its ERK-binding domain are required for wild-type circadian period and normal phosphorylation status of the protein. In contrast, the N-terminal kinase of S6KII is dispensable for modulation of circadian period and normal phosphorylation of the protein. We also show that particular sites of S6KII phosphorylation, Ser-515 and Thr-732, are essential for normal circadian behavior. Surprisingly, the phosphorylation of S6KII residues, in vivo, does not follow a strict sequential pattern, as implied by certain cell-based studies of mammalian RSK protein."
