https://openalex.org/W4244332933,"Amplicon-based Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is an emerging method for Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing (DST) but has not been well described. We examined 158 clinical multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates via NGS of 11 resistance-associated gene regions covering 3519 nucleotides. Across these gene regions, complete resistance or heteroresistance (defined as 1%-99% mutation) was present in at least one isolate in 6.3% of loci. The number of isolates with heteroresistance was highest for gyrA codon 94, rpoB codons 526 and 531, and embB codons 306, 372 and 406 (range 11–26% of isolates exhibited heteroresistance). 57% of MDR strains had heteroresistance of one or more recognized resistance-associated mutation. Heteroresistant loci generally exhibited high or low degrees of mutation (>90% or <10%). The deep sensitivity of NGS for detecting low level pncA heteroresistance appeared to improve genotypic-phenotypic PZA susceptibility correlations over that of Sanger. NGS demonstrates that heteroresistance in TB in the regions of key genes is common and will need to be bioinformatically managed. The clinical significance of such heteroresistance is unclear, and further study of pncA should be pursued."
https://openalex.org/W2614205620,"Studies were conducted to explore the possibility of employing dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) oocytes as recipient cytoplasts for the development of interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) embryos using skin fibroblast cells of an adult Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) and Llama (Llama glama) as donor nuclei. Also, the embryos reconstructed with Bactrian cells were transferred into the uterus of synchronized dromedary camel recipients to explore the possibility of using them as surrogate mothers. Serum-starved skin fibroblast cells were injected into the perivitelline space of enucleated mature oocytes, collected from super-stimulated dromedary camels, and fused using an Eppendorf electroporator. After activation with 5μM ionomycin and 6-dimethylaminopurine, they were cultured at 38.5°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2 in air. In experiment 1, Day 7 blastocysts were stained with Hoechst to count their cell numbers, while in experiment 2, they were transferred to synchronized dromedary recipients. A lower number (P < 0.05) of blastocysts were obtained from reconstructs utilizing fibroblast cells from Llama when compared with those reconstructed with dromedary and Bactrian fibroblast cells. However, no difference was observed in their cell numbers. In experiment 2, a higher (P < 0.05) proportion of blastocysts were obtained from the cleaved embryos reconstructed with Bactrian fibroblast cells when compared to those reconstructed with dromedary cells. Twenty-six Day 7 blastocysts reconstructed with Bactrian cells were transferred to 23 synchronized dromedary recipients with 5 pregnancies established on Day 30, however, only one of the pregnancies developed to term and a healthy calf weighing 33 kgs was born after completing 392 days of gestation. Unfortunately, the calf died on day 7 due to acute septicemia. In conclusion, the present study reports, for the first time, birth of a cloned Bactrian calf by iSCNT using dromedary camel as a source for oocytes as well as a surrogate for carrying the pregnancy to term."
https://openalex.org/W2616749209,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a promising treatment option for cancer, involves the activation of a photosensitizer (PS) by local irradiation with visible light. Excitation of the PS leads to a series of photochemical reactions and consequently the local generation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing limited or none systemic defects. However, the development of resistance to this promising therapy has slowed down its translation into the clinical practice. Thus, there is an increase need in understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying resistance to PDT. Here, we aimed to examine whether a relationship exists between PDT outcome and ROS-involvement in the resistance mechanism in photosensitized cancer cells. In order to recapitulate tumor architecture of the respective original tumor, we developed a multicellular three-dimensional spheroid system comprising a normoxic periphery, surrounding a hypoxic core. Using Me-ALA, a prodrug of the PS PpIX, in human colorectal spheroids we demonstrate that HIF-1 transcriptional activity was strongly up-regulated and mediates PDT resistant phenotype. RNAi knockdown of HIF-1 impairs resistance to PDT. Oxidative stress-mediated activation of ERK1/2 followed PDT was involved on positive modulation of HIF-1 transcriptional activity after photodynamic treatment. ROS scavenging and MEK/ERK pathway inhibition abrogated the PDT-mediated HIF-1 upregulation. Together our data demonstrate that resistance to PDT is in part mediated by the activation of a ROS-ERK1/2-HIF-1 axis, thus, identifying novel therapeutic targets that could be used in combination with PDT."
https://openalex.org/W2616790363,"We examined the frequency and severity of financial distress (FD) and its association with quality of life (QOL) and symptoms among patients with advanced cancer in France.In this cross-sectional study, 143 patients with advanced cancer were enrolled. QOL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer General (FACT-G) and symptoms assessed using Edmonton Assessment System (ESAS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). FD was assessed using a self-rated numeric scale from 0 to 10.Seventy-three (51%) patients reported having FD. Patients reported having FD were most likely to be younger (53.8 (16,7SD) versus 62 (10.5SD), p<0.001), single (33 (62%) versus 40(44%), p = 0.03) and had a breast cancer (26 (36%), p = 0.024). Patients with FD had a lower FACT-G score (59 versus 70, p = 0.005). FD decreased physical (14 versus 18, p = 0.008), emotional (14 versus 16, p = 0.008), social wellbeing (17 versus 19, p = 0.04). Patients with FD had higher HADS-D (8 versus 6 p = 0.007) and HADS-A (9 versus 7, p = 0.009) scores. FD was linked to increased ESAS score (59 (18SD) versus 67 (18SD), p = 0.005) and spiritual suffering (22(29SD) versus 13(23SD), p = 0.045).The high rate of patient-reported FD was unexpected in our studied population, as the French National Health Insurance covers specific cancer treatments. The FD was associated with a poorer quality of life. Having a systematic assessment, with a simple tool, should lead to future research on interventions that will increase patients' QOL."
https://openalex.org/W2615034939,"The urinary bladder in healthy dogs has dogmatically been considered free of bacteria. This study used culture independent techniques to characterize the healthy canine urinary microbiota. Urine samples collected by antepubic cystocentesis from dogs without urinary infection were used for DNA extraction. Genital tract and rectal samples were collected simultaneously from the same dogs. The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene was amplified and compared against Greengenes database for OTU assignment and relative abundance for urine, genital, and rectal samples. After excluding 4 dogs with cultivable bacteria, samples from 10 male (M; 1 intact) and 10 female (F) spayed dogs remained. All samples provided adequate genetic material for analysis. Four taxa (Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp., Sphingobium sp. and Bradyrhizobiaceae) dominated the urinary microbiota in all dogs of both sexes. These taxa were also detected in the genital swabs of both sexes, while the rectal microbiota differed substantially from the other sample sites. Principal component (PC) analysis of PC1 through PC3 showed overlap of urinary and genital microbiota and a clear separation of rectal swabs from the other sample sites along PC1, which explained 44.94% variation. Surprisingly, the urinary microbiota (mean # OTU 92.6 F, 90.2 M) was significantly richer than the genital (67.8 F, 66.6 M) or rectal microbiota (68.3 F, 71.2 M) (p < 0.0001), with no difference between sexes at any sample site. The canine urinary bladder is not a sterile environment and possesses its own unique and diverse microbiota compared to the rectal and genital microbiota. There was no difference between the sexes at any microbiota sample site (urine, genital, and rectal). The predominant bacterial genus for either sex in the urine and genital tracts was Pseudomonas sp."
https://openalex.org/W2616645586,"Children are at risk for adverse health outcomes from occupant-controllable indoor airborne contaminants in their homes. Data are needed to design residential interventions for reducing low-income children's pollutant exposure. Using customized air quality monitors, we continuously measured fine particle counts (0.5 to 2.5 microns) over a week in living areas of predominantly low-income households in San Diego, California, with at least one child (under age 14) and at least one cigarette smoker. We performed retrospective interviews on home characteristics, and particle source and ventilation activities occurring during the week of monitoring. We explored the relationship between weekly mean particle counts and interview responses using graphical visualization and multivariable linear regression (base sample n = 262; complete cases n = 193). We found associations of higher weekly mean particle counts with reports of indoor smoking of cigarettes or marijuana, as well as with frying food, using candles or incense, and house cleaning. Lower particle levels were associated with larger homes. We did not observe an association between lower mean particle counts and reports of opening windows, using kitchen exhaust fans, or other ventilation activities. Our findings about sources of fine airborne particles and their mitigation can inform future studies that investigate more effective feedback on residential indoor-air-quality and better strategies for reducing occupant exposures."
https://openalex.org/W2614393926,"Background Recent studies suggest a role for hyperlipidemia in the development of diabetes. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between variations of total cholesterol (TC) levels and the risk for type 2 diabetes development from a Korean nationwide population-based database. Materials and methods We examined the General Health Check-up sub-dataset of the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of 2,827,950 participants who had at least three health check-ups between 2002 and 2007, and were not reported to have diabetes during that time. The variations of TC levels between the examinations were calculated as follows: . The examinees were divided into 10 groups according to TC variation, and the hazard ratio for diabetes development from 2007 to 2013, were analyzed. Results During the follow-up period, 3.4% of the participants had developed diabetes. The hazard ratio (HR) for diabetes development relative to the overall risk in the whole study population started to be higher than 1.0 from eighth decile of TC variation. The highest decile group showed an increased HR for diabetes development after adjustment for confounding variables (1.139; 95% confidence interval 1.116~1.163). These results were similar regardless of the use of anti-hyperlipidemic medication and baseline TC levels. Conclusions The participants with a large variation in TC levels showed an increased risk for diabetes development, independent of the use of anti-hyperlipidemic medications. These results suggest a relationship between fluctuations in lipid levels and the development of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2614669788,"This study aims to assess the value for money and budget impact of offering hemodialysis (HD) as a first-line treatment, or the HD-first policy, and the peritoneal dialysis (PD) first policy compared to a supportive care option in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Indonesia.A Markov model-based economic evaluation was performed using local and international data to quantify the potential costs and health-related outcomes in terms of life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Three policy options were compared, i.e., the PD-first policy, HD-first policy, and supportive care.The PD-first policy for ESRD patients resulted in 5.93 life years, equal to the HD-first policy, with a slightly higher QALY gained (4.40 vs 4.34). The total lifetime cost for a patient under the PD-first policy is around 700 million IDR, which is lower than the cost under the HD-first policy, i.e. 735 million IDR per patient. Compared to supportive care, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the PD-first policy is 193 million IDR per QALY, while the HD-first policy resulted in 207 million IDR per QALY. Budget impact analysis indicated that the required budget for the PD-first policy is 43 trillion IDR for 53% coverage and 75 trillion IDR for 100% coverage in five years, which is less than the HD-first policy, i.e. 88 trillion IDR and 166 trillion IDR.The PD-first policy was found to be more cost-effective compared to the HD-first policy. Budget impact analysis provided evidence on the enormous financial burden for the country if the current practice, where HD dominates PD, continues for the next five years."
https://openalex.org/W2615704118,"A variant in a transcription factor gene, POU4F3, is responsible for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hereditary hearing loss, DFNA15. To date, 14 variants, including a whole deletion of POU4F3, have been reported to cause HL in various ethnic groups. In the present study, genetic screening for POU4F3 variants was carried out for a large series of Japanese hearing loss (HL) patients to clarify the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DFNA15 in the Japanese population. Massively parallel DNA sequencing of 68 target candidate genes was utilized in 2,549 unrelated Japanese HL patients (probands) to identify genomic variations responsible for HL. The detailed clinical features in patients with POU4F3 variants were collected from medical charts and analyzed. Novel 12 POU4F3 likely pathogenic variants (six missense variants, three frameshift variants, and three nonsense variants) were successfully identified in 15 probands (2.5%) among 602 families exhibiting autosomal dominant HL, whereas no variants were detected in the other 1,947 probands with autosomal recessive or inheritance pattern unknown HL. To obtain the audiovestibular configuration of the patients harboring POU4F3 variants, we collected audiograms and vestibular symptoms of the probands and their affected family members. Audiovestibular phenotypes in a total of 24 individuals from the 15 families possessing variants were characterized by progressive HL, with a large variation in the onset age and severity with or without vestibular symptoms observed. Pure-tone audiograms indicated the most prevalent configuration as mid-frequency HL type followed by high-frequency HL type, with asymmetry observed in approximately 20% of affected individuals. Analysis of the relationship between age and pure-tone average suggested that individuals with truncating variants showed earlier onset and slower progression of HL than did those with non-truncating variants. The present study showed that variants in POU4F3 were a common cause of autosomal dominant HL."
https://openalex.org/W2615266093,"Thermal tolerances are affected by the range of temperatures that species encounter in their habitat. Daniel Janzen hypothesized in his “Why mountain passes are higher in the tropics” that temperature gradients were effective barriers to animal movements where climatic uniformity was high. Sea turtles bury their eggs providing some thermal stability that varies with depth. We assessed the relationship between thermal uniformity and thermal tolerance in nests of three species of sea turtles. We considered that barriers were “high” when small thermal changes had comparatively large effects and “low” when the effects were small. Mean temperature was lower and fluctuated less in species that dig deeper nests. Thermal barriers were comparatively “higher” in leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) nests, which were the deepest, as embryo mortality increased at lower “high” temperatures than in olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) and green turtle (Chelonia mydas) nests. Sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) and embryo mortality increased as temperature approached the upper end of the transitional range of temperatures (TRT) that produces both sexes (temperature producing 100% female offspring) in leatherback and olive ridley turtles. As thermal barriers are “higher” in some species than in others, the effects of climate warming on embryo mortality is likely to vary among sea turtles. Population resilience to climate warming may also depend on the balance between temperatures that produce female offspring and those that reduce embryo survival."
https://openalex.org/W2616409221,"The Grid scheduler, schedules user jobs on the best available resource in terms of resource characteristics by optimizing job execution time. Resource failure in Grid is no longer an exception but a regular occurring event as resources are increasingly being used by the scientific community to solve computationally intensive problems which typically run for days or even months. It is therefore absolutely essential that these long-running applications are able to tolerate failures and avoid re-computations from scratch after resource failure has occurred, to satisfy the user’s Quality of Service (QoS) requirement. Job Scheduling with Fault Tolerance in Grid Computing using Ant Colony Optimization is proposed to ensure that jobs are executed successfully even when resource failure has occurred. The technique employed in this paper, is the use of resource failure rate, as well as checkpoint-based roll back recovery strategy. Check-pointing aims at reducing the amount of work that is lost upon failure of the system by immediately saving the state of the system. A comparison of the proposed approach with an existing Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is discussed. The experimental results of the implemented Fault Tolerance scheduling algorithm show that there is an improvement in the user’s QoS requirement over the existing ACO algorithm, which has no fault tolerance integrated in it. The performance evaluation of the two algorithms was measured in terms of the three main scheduling performance metrics: makespan, throughput and average turnaround time."
https://openalex.org/W2614712213,"Background Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a population of bone marrow-derived cells, which have an important role in the process of endothelialization and vascular repair following injury. Impairment of EPCs, which occurs in patients with diabetes, was shown to be related to endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse clinical outcomes. Recent evidence has shown that calcitriol, the active hormone of vitamin D, has a favorable impact on the endothelium and cardiovascular system. There is limited data on the effect of vitamin D on EPCs function. Aim To examine the in vitro effects of Calcitriol on EPCs from healthy subjects and patients with diabetes. Methods Fifty-one patients with type 2 diabetes (60±11 years, 40% women, HbA1C: 9.1±0.8%) and 23 healthy volunteers were recruited. EPCs were isolated and cultured with and without calcitriol. The capacity of the cells to form colony-forming units (CFUs), their viability (measured by MTT assay), KLF-10 levels and angiogenic markers were evaluated after 1 week of culture. Results In diabetic patients, EPC CFUs and cell viability were higher in EPCs exposed to calcitriol vs. EPCs not exposed to calcitriol [EPC CFUs: 1.25 (IQR 1.0–2.0) vs. 0.5 (IQR 0.5–1.9), p < 0.001; MTT:0.62 (IQR 0.44–0.93) vs. 0.52 (IQR 0.31–0.62), p = 0.001]. KLF-10 levels tended to be higher in EPCs exposed to vitamin D, with no differences in angiopoietic markers. In healthy subjects, calcitriol supplementation also resulted in higher cell viability [MTT: 0.23 (IQR 0.11–0.46) vs. 0.19 (0.09–0.39), p = 0.04], but without differences in CFU count or angiopoietic markers. Conclusion In patients with diabetes mellitus, in vitro vitamin D supplementation improved EPCs capacity to form colonies and viability. Further studies regarding the mechanisms by which vitamin D exerts its effect are required."
https://openalex.org/W2615359732,"Iron is an important nutrient for the survival and growth of many organisms. In order to survive, iron uptake from the environment must be strictly regulated and maintained to avoid iron toxicity. The ferric uptake regulator protein (Fur) regulates genes involved in iron homeostasis in many bacteria, including phytopathogens. However, to date, the role played by Fur in the biology of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense (Pcb1692), an important pathogen of potatoes, has not yet been studied. To this end, we used the lambda recombineering method to generate a fur mutant strain of Pcb1692 and assessed the virulence and fitness of the mutant strain. The results showed that production of siderophores in Pcb1692Δfur increased compared to the Pcb1692 wild-type and the complemented strain Pcb1692Δfur-pfur. However, production of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHLs), biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, virulence on potato tubers and swimming motility, were all significantly decreased in Pcb1692Δfur compared to the wild-type and complemented Pcb1692Δfur-pfur strains. The Pcb1692Δfur mutant also demonstrated significant sensitivity to oxidative stress when exposed to H2O2. Consistent with phenotypic results, qRT-PCR results demonstrated that Fur down-regulates genes which encode proteins associated with: iron uptake (HasA-extracellular heme-binding protein and Ferrodoxin-AED-0004132), stress response (SodC-superoxide dismutase), plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PrtA and CelV) and motility (FlhC and MotA). We conclude that the ferric uptake regulator protein (Fur) of Pcb1692 regulates traits that are important to host-pathogens interactions."

Norovirus virus like particle (VLP)-based vaccines are currently under development and have been shown to elicit systemic and mucosal immune responses when delivered intranasally. In the present study, we describe the use of a dry powder formulation (GelVac™) with an in situ gelling polysaccharide (GelSite™) extracted from Aloe vera for nasal delivery of a bivalent vaccine formulation containing both GI and GII.4 norovirus VLPs. Dose-ranging studies were performed to identify the optimal antigen dosages based on systemic and mucosal immune responses in guinea pigs and determine any antigenic interference. A dose-dependent increase in systemic and mucosal immunogenicity against each of the VLPs were observed as well as a boosting effect for each VLP after the second dosing. A total antigen dose of ≥50 μg of each GI and GII.4 VLPs was determined to be the maximally immunogenic dose in guinea pigs. The immunogenicity results of this bivalent formulation, taken together with previous work on monovalent GelVac™ norovirus vaccine formulation, provides a basis for future development of this norovirus VLP vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2615394683,"Plasma membrane-localized leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases directly activates G protein complex via interaction with seven transmembrane domain Regulator of G-protein Signaling 1 (AtRGS1) protein. Brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) LIKE3 (BRL3) phosphorylates AtRGS1 in vitro. FRET analysis showed that BRL3 and AtRGS1 interaction dynamics change in response to glucose and flg22. Both BRL3 and AtRGS1 function in glucose sensing and brl3 and rgs1-2 single mutants are hyposensitive to high glucose as well as the brl3/rgs1 double mutant. BRL3 and AtRGS1 function in the same pathway linked to high glucose sensing. Hypocotyl elongation, another sugar-mediated pathway, is also implicated to be partially mediated by BRL3 and AtRGS1 because rgs1-2, brl3-2 and brl3-2/ rgs1-2 mutants share the long hypocotyl phenotype. BRL3 and AtRGS1 modulate the flg22-induced ROS burst and block one or more components positively regulating ROS production because the brl3/rgs1 double mutant has ~60% more ROS production than wild type while rgs1-2 has a partial ROS burst impairment and brl3 has slightly more ROS production. Here, we proposed a simple model where both BRL3 and AtRGS1 are part of a fine-tuning mechanism sensing glucose and flg22 to prevent excess ROS burst and control growth inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2615635272,"Although adipose tissue hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and its metabolizing enzymes have been linked to obesity and insulin resistance in animal studies, this relation remains to be evaluated in humans.Non-diabetic men (N = 43, median age, 49 (37, 54 y)) undergoing abdominal surgeries were studied. Participants were classified by body mass index (BMI) into normal-weight (N = 19), or overweight/obese (Ow/Ob; BMI ≥25; N = 24). Centrally obese men were identified by waist-height ratio ≥0.5. H2O2 and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes were assayed in subcutaneous fat samples, and visceral fat (available from N = 33), and their associations with anthropometric parameters, fasting serum lipids, and the homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were tested using correlations and multivariate linear regression.H2O2 concentrations and catalase activity were increased in visceral fat from Ow/Ob men, compared to normal-weight subjects (+32%, P = 0.038 and +51%, P = 0.043 respectively). Centrally obese subjects had >2-fold higher superoxide dismutase activity (P = 0.005), 46% higher H2O2 (P = 0.028), and 89% higher catalase activity (P = 0.009) in visceral fat, compared to lean subjects. Central obesity did not alter these markers in subcutaneous fat, apart from a 50% increase in catalase, and did not affect glutathione peroxidase in either fat depot. H2O2 in visceral fat positively correlated with insulin resistance (r = 0.40, P = 0.032). Catalase activity in visceral fat was an independent determinant of HOMA-IR, explaining ~18% of the variance (ß = 0.42, P = 0.016), after adjustment for age and BMI.These findings suggest that adipose tissue catalase shows compensatory up-regulation in response to obesity-induced H2O2 accumulation, and that perturbed H2O2 metabolism in visceral fat is linked to insulin resistance in obese humans."
https://openalex.org/W2616508775,"More than 60% of myeloid dysplasia syndrome (MDS) contains mutations in genes encoding for splicing factors such as SF3B1, U2AF, SRSF2 and ZRSR2. Mutations in SF3B1 are associated with 80% cases of refractory anemia with ring sideroblast (RARS), a subtype of MDS. SF3B1K700E is the most frequently mutated site among mutations on SF3B1. Yet the molecular mechanisms on how mutations of splicing factors lead to defective erythropoiesis are not clear. SF3B1K700E mutant binds to an RNA binding protein, RBM15, stronger than the wild type SF3B1 protein in co-immunoprecipitation assays. In addition, K700E mutant alters the RNA splicing of transcription factors TAL1 and GATA1. Via alternative RNA splicing, a novel short TAL1 transcript variant (TAL1s) is generated. Enhanced interaction between SF3B1 and RBM15 promotes the production of full-length TAL1 (TAL1fl) mRNA, while reduction of RBM15 protein level via PRMT1-mediated degradation pathway changes TAL1s/TAL1fl ratio in favor of TAL1s. TAL1s contains the helix-loop-helix DNA binding domain but not the N terminal region upstream of the DNA binding domain. The TAL1s protein loses its interaction with ETO2, which represses early erythropoiesis. In this vein, overexpression of TAL1s stimulates the transcription of β-hemoglobin in human leukemia K562 cells and promotes erythroid differentiation of human cord blood CD34+ cells cultured in erythropoietin-containing medium. Therefore, mutations of SF3B1 may block erythropoiesis via dysregulation of alternative RNA splicing of transcription factor TAL1, and targeting PRMT1 may alleviate the anemic symptoms in MDS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2616538617,"To characterize smoking and alcohol use, and to describe predictors of oral cancer knowledge among a predominantly African-American population.A cross-sectional study was conducted between September, 2013 among drag racers and fans in East St. Louis. Oral cancer knowledge was derived from combining questionnaire items to form knowledge score. Covariates examined included age, sex, race, marital status, education status, income level, insurance status, tobacco and alcohol use. Adjusted linear regression analysis measured predictors of oral cancer knowledge.Three hundred and four participants completed questionnaire; 72.7% were African Americans. Smoking rate was 26.7%, alcohol use was 58.3%, and mean knowledge score was 4.60 ± 2.52 out of 17. In final adjusted regression model, oral cancer knowledge was associated with race and education status. Compared with Caucasians, African Americans were 29% less likely to have high oral cancer knowledge (β = -0.71; 95% CI: -1.35, -0.07); and participants with a high school diploma or less were 124% less likely to have high oral cancer knowledge compared with college graduates (β = -1.24; 95% CI: -2.44, -0.41).There was lower oral cancer knowledge among African Americans and those with low education. The prevalence of smoking was also very high. Understanding predictors of oral cancer knowledge is important in future design of educational interventions specifically targeted towards high-risk group for oral cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2614680621,"Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a main constituent of green tea polyphenols that are widely used as food preservatives and are considered to be safe for consumption. However, the underlying antimicrobial mechanism of EGCG and the bacterial response to EGCG are not clearly understood. In the present study, a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of a typical spoilage bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens that responded to EGCG was performed using RNA-seq technology. A total of 26,365,414 and 23,287,092 clean reads were generated from P. fluorescens treated with or without 1 mM EGCG and the clean reads were aligned to the reference genome. Differential expression analysis revealed 291 upregulated genes and 134 downregulated genes and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were verified using RT-qPCR. Most of the DGEs involved in iron uptake, antioxidation, DNA repair, efflux system, cell envelope and cell-surface component synthesis were significantly upregulated by EGCG treatment, while most genes associated with energy production were downregulated. These transcriptomic changes are likely to be adaptive responses of P. fluorescens to iron limitation and oxidative stress, as well as DNA and envelope damage caused by EGCG. The expression of specific genes encoding the extra-cytoplasmic function sigma factor (PvdS, RpoE and AlgU) and the two-component sensor histidine kinase (BaeS and RpfG) were markedly changed by EGCG treatment, which may play important roles in regulating the stress responses of P. fluorescens to EGCG. The present data provides important insights into the molecular action of EGCG and the possible cross-resistance mediated by EGCG on P. fluorescens, which may ultimately contribute to the optimal application of green tea polyphenols in food preservation."

We compared incidence and time trends of ischemic stroke and primary intracerebral hemorrhage in South Asian, Chinese and white persons in a population-based study. Methods Population based census and administrative data analysis in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia, Canada using validated ICD 9/ICD 10 coding for acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (1997–2010). Results There were 3290 South Asians, 4444 Chinese and 160944 white patients with acute ischemic stroke and 535 South Asian, 1376 Chinese and 21842 white patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. South Asians were younger than whites at onset of stroke (70 vs. 74 years for ischemic and 67 vs. 71 years for hemorrhagic stroke). Age and sex adjusted ischemic stroke incidence in 2010 was 43% lower in Chinese and 63% lower in South Asian than in White patients. Age and sex adjusted intracerebral hemorrhage incidence was 18% higher in Chinese patients, and 66% lower in South Asian relative to white patients. Stroke incidence declined in all ethnic groups (relative reduction 69% in South Asians, 25% in Chinese, and 34% in white patients for ischemic stroke and for intracerebral hemorrhage, 79% for South Asians, 51% for Chinese and 30% in white patients). Conclusion Although stroke rates declined across all ethnic groups, these rates differed significantly by ethnicity. Further study is needed to understand mechanisms underlying the higher ischemic stroke incidence in white patients and intracerebral hemorrhage in Chinese patients."
https://openalex.org/W2615737076,"Congenital heart defects are the most common birth defect. The limiting factor in tissue engineering repair strategies is an autologous source of functional cardiomyocytes. Amniotic fluid contains an ideal cell source for prenatal harvest and use in correction of congenital heart defects. This study aims to investigate the potential of amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSC) to undergo non-viral reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) followed by growth-factor-free differentiation into functional cardiomyocytes. AFSC from human second trimester amniotic fluid were transfected by non-viral vesicle fusion with modified mRNA of OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, LIN28, cMYC and nuclear GFP over 18 days, then differentiated using inhibitors of GSK3 followed 48 hours later by inhibition of WNT. AFSC-derived iPSC had high expression of OCT4, NANOG, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81 after 18 days of mRNA transfection and formed teratomas containing mesodermal, ectodermal, and endodermal germ layers in immunodeficient mice. By Day 30 of cardiomyocyte differentiation, cells contracted spontaneously, expressed connexin 43 and β-myosin heavy chain organized in sarcomeric banding patterns, expressed cardiac troponin T and β-myosin heavy chain, showed upregulation of NKX2.5, ISL-1 and cardiac troponin T with downregulation of POU5F1, and displayed calcium and voltage transients similar to those in developing cardiomyocytes. These results demonstrate that cells from human amniotic fluid can be differentiated through a pluripotent state into functional cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2614436994,"Zooplankton feeding activity is hypothesized to attenuate the downward flux of elements in the ocean. We investigated whether the zooplankton community composition could influence the flux attenuation, due to the differences of feeding modes (feeding on dispersed vs. aggregated particles) and of metabolic rates. We fed 5 copepod species—three calanoid, one harpacticoid and one poecilamastoid–microplankton food, in either dispersed or aggregated form and measured rates of respiration, fecal pellet production and egg production. Calanoid copepods were able to feed only on dispersed food; when their food was introduced as aggregates, their pellet production and respiration rates decreased to rates observed for starved individuals. In contrast, harpacticoids and the poecilamastoid copepod Oncaea spp. were able to feed only when the food was in the form of aggregates. The sum of copepod respiration, pellet production and egg production rates was equivalent to a daily minimum carbon demand of ca. 10% body weight-1 for all non-feeding copepods; the carbon demand of calanoids feeding on dispersed food was 2–3 times greater, and the carbon demand of harpacticoids and Oncaea spp. feeding on aggregates was >7 times greater, than the resting rates. The zooplankton species composition combined with the type of available food strongly influences the calculated carbon demand of a copepod community, and thus also the attenuation of vertical carbon flux."

All patients had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C disease and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class A-B function. In-field control (IFC), overall survival (OS), prognostic factors, and toxicity were evaluated.In this study of 89 patients, the 3-year IFC rate was 78.1%, and the 1-year and 3-year OS rates were 45.9% and 24.3%, respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that CTP class, the presence of main portal vein tumor thrombosis, and the presence of extrahepatic spread were independent predictors of OS. The expected median OS values among patients with ≥2, 1, and 0 predictors were 4.2, 8.6, and 26.4 months, respectively (p <0.001).SABR may be useful for patients with advanced HCC, and patient selection could be based on the CTP classification, main portal vein tumor thrombosis, and extrahepatic spread."
https://openalex.org/W2616147945,"We use age-structured models for VZV transmission and reactivation to reconstruct the natural history of VZV in Norway based on available pre-vaccination serological data, contact matrices, and herpes zoster incidence data. Depending on the hypotheses on contact and transmission patterns, the basic reproduction number of varicella in Norway ranges between 3.7 and 5.0, implying a vaccine coverage between 73 and 80% to effectively interrupt transmission with a 100% vaccine efficacy against infection. The varicella force of infection peaks during early childhood (3–5 yrs) and shows a prolonged phase of higher risk during the childbearing period, though quantitative variations can occur depending on contact patterns. By expressing the magnitude of exogenous boosting as a proportion of the force of infection, it is shown that reactivation is well described by a progressive immunity mechanism sustained by a large, though possibly below 100%, degree of exogenous boosting, in agreement with findings from other Nordic countries, implying large reproduction numbers of boosting. Moreover, magnitudes of exogenous boosting below 40% are robustly disconfirmed by data. These results bring further insight on the magnitude of immunity boosting and its relationship with reactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2616229279,"The input function (IF) is a core element in the quantification of Translocator protein 18 kDa with positron emission tomography (PET), as no suitable reference region with negligible binding has been identified. Arterial blood sampling is indeed needed to create the IF (ASIF). In the present manuscript we study individualization of a population based input function (PBIF) with a single arterial manual sample to estimate total distribution volume (VT) for [18F]FEPPA and to replicate previously published clinical studies in which the ASIF was used.The data of 3 previous [18F]FEPPA studies (39 of healthy controls (HC), 16 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 18 with Alzheimer's disease (AD)) was reanalyzed with the new approach. PBIF was used with the Logan graphical analysis (GA) neglecting the vascular contribution to estimate VT. Time of linearization of the GA was determined with the maximum error criteria. The optimal calibration of the PBIF was determined based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the IF and the agreement range of VT between methods. The shape of the IF between groups was studied while taking into account genotyping of the polymorphism (rs6971).PBIF scaled with a single value of activity due to unmetabolized radioligand in arterial plasma, calculated as the average of a sample taken at 60 min and a sample taken at 90 min post-injection, yielded a good interval of agreement between methods and optimized the area under the curve of IF. In HC, gray matter VTs estimated by PBIF highly correlated with those using the standard method (r2 = 0.82, p = 0.0001). Bland-Altman plots revealed PBIF slightly underestimates (~1 mL/cm3) VT calculated by ASIF (including a vascular contribution). It was verified that the AUC of the ASIF were independent of genotype and disease (HC, PD, and AD). Previous clinical results were replicated using PBIF but with lower statistical power.A single arterial blood sample taken 75 minute post-injection contains enough information to individualize the IF in the groups of subjects studied; however, the higher variability produced requires an increase in sample size to reach the same effect size."
https://openalex.org/W2615056316,"The maturation of the cortical gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) are described as sequential processes following multiple, but distinct rules. However, neither the mechanisms driving brain maturation processes, nor the relationship between GM and WM maturation are well understood. Here we use connectomics and two MRI measures reflecting maturation related changes in cerebral microstructure, namely the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) and the T1 relaxation time (T1), to study brain development. We report that the advancement of GM and WM maturation are inter-related and depend on the underlying brain connectivity architecture. Particularly, GM regions and their incident WM connections show corresponding maturation levels, which is also observed for GM regions connected through a WM tract. Based on these observations, we propose a simple computational model supporting a key role for the connectome in propagating maturation signals sequentially from external stimuli, through primary sensory structures to higher order functional cortices."
https://openalex.org/W2616240550,"Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is prevalent worldwide and causes megaloblastic anemia and neurologic deficits. While the anemia can be treated, the neurologic deficits can become refractive to treatment as the disease progresses. Therefore, timely intervention is critical for a favorable outcome. Moreover, the metabolic basis for the neuro-pathologic changes and the role of cobalamin deficiency in the pathology still remains unexplained. Using a transcobalamin receptor / CD320 knockout mouse that lacks the receptor for cellular uptake of transcobalamin bound cobalamin, we aimed to determine whether cobalamin deficiency in the central nervous system produced functional neurologic deficits in the mouse that would parallel those observed in humans. Our behavioral analyses indicate elevated anxiety and deficits in learning, memory and set-shifting of a spatial memory task in the KO mouse. Consistent with the behavioral deficits, the knockout mouse shows impaired expression of the early phase of hippocampal long-term potentiation along with reduced expression of GluR1, decreased brain mass and a significant reduction in the size of nuclei of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Our study suggests that the CD320 knockout mouse develops behavioral deficits associated with cobalamin deficiency and therefore could provide a model to understand the metabolic and genetic basis of neuro-pathologic changes due to cobalamin deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2616637751,"ILEI (FAM3C) is a secreted factor that contributes to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cell biological process that confers metastatic properties to a tumor cell. Initially, we found that ILEI mRNA is highly expressed in melanoma metastases but not in primary tumors, suggesting that ILEI contributes to the malignant properties of melanoma. While melanoma is not an epithelial cell-derived tumor and does not undergo a traditional EMT, melanoma undergoes a similar process known as phenotype switching in which high (micropthalmia-related transcription factor) MITF expressing (MITF-high) proliferative cells switch to a low expressing (MITF-low) invasive state. We observed that MITF-high proliferative cells express low levels of ILEI (ILEI-low) and MITF-low invasive cells express high levels of ILEI (ILEI-high). We found that inducing phenotype switching towards the MITF-low invasive state increases ILEI mRNA expression, whereas phenotype switching towards the MITF-high proliferative state decreases ILEI mRNA expression. Next, we used in vitro assays to show that knockdown of ILEI attenuates invasive potential but not MITF expression or chemoresistance. Finally, we used gene expression analysis to show that ILEI regulates several genes involved in the MITF-low invasive phenotype including JARID1B, HIF-2α, and BDNF. Gene set enrichment analysis suggested that ILEI-regulated genes are enriched for JUN signaling, a known regulator of the MITF-low invasive phenotype. In conclusion, we demonstrate that phenotype switching regulates ILEI expression, and that ILEI regulates partial phenotype switching in MITF-low melanoma cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2616835939,"This paper reflected on the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in Bangladesh, which is spreading rapidly in low-income countries. The rationale of constructing more health centers for addressing NCDs was assessed in this paper by determining the relationship between prevalence of NCDs, particularly hypertension and diabetes, and distance to health facilities.From BDHS (Bangladesh Health and Demographic Survey) 2011 data set, 7544 samples were analyzed to demonstrate association between Non-communicable diseases (NCD) and distance from respondents' home to health facilities like hospitals, community clinics, pharmacies or doctors' chambers, and community facilities like market, post office or cinema hall. Bivariate analysis was conducted between accessibility to health facilities and prevalence of the diseases. The causal relationship between the spatial effects and the prevalence of the diseases were analyzed by applying Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) was fitted.Fitting linear mixed effect models, we found that hypertension and diabetes react differently with various spatial effects. Distance from home to hospital had significant effect (P < 0.001) on hypertension showing people living further from the facilities or town centers seemed to be less hypertensive, whereas diabetes showed no such affiliation.Higher prevalence of diabetes (40.9%) over hypertension (26.5%) in people aging 35 or higher, have appeared to have caused the difference, which concluded that each non-communicable disease should be dealt to its own merit for policy making instead considering as a group of diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2614276829,"Post-endoscopic sphincterotomy bleeding is a common complication of biliary sphincterotomy, and the incidence varies from 1% to 48%. It can be challenging to localize the bleeder or to administer various interventions through a side-viewing endoscope. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors of post-endoscopic sphincterotomy bleeding and the outcome of endoscopic intervention therapies. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 513 patients who underwent biliary sphincterotomy in Mackay Memorial Hospital between 2011 and 2016. The blood biochemistry, comorbidities, indication for sphincterotomy, severity of bleeding, endoscopic features of bleeder, and type of endoscopic therapy were analyzed. Post-endoscopic sphincterotomy bleeding occurred in 65 (12.6%) patients. Forty-five patients had immediate bleeding and 20 patients had delayed bleeding. The multivariate analysis of risk factors associated with post-endoscopic sphincterotomy bleeding were liver cirrhosis (P = 0.029), end-stage renal disease (P = 0.038), previous antiplatelet drug use (P<0.001), and duodenal ulcer (P = 0.023). The complications of pancreatitis and cholangitis were higher in the bleeding group, with statistical significance. Delayed bleeding occurred within 1 to 7 days (mean, 2.5 days), and 60% (12/20) of the patients received endoscopic evaluation. In the delayed bleeding group, the successful hemostasis rate was 71.4% (5/7), and 65% (13/20) of the patients had ceased bleeding without endoscopic hemostasis therapy. Comparison of different therapeutic modalities showed that cholangitis was higher in patients who received epinephrine spray (P = 0.042) and pancreatitis was higher in patients who received epinephrine injection and electrocoagulation (P = 0.041 and P = 0.039 respectively). Clinically, post-endoscopic sphincterotomy bleeding and further endoscopic hemostasis therapy increase the complication rate of pancreatitis and cholangitis. Realizing the effectiveness of each therapeutic modalities and appropriate management of different levels bleeding are important."
https://openalex.org/W2951678575,"It is estimated that over 1.5 million lung nodules are detected annually in the United States. Most of these are benign but frequently undergo invasive and costly procedures to rule out malignancy. A risk predictor that can accurately differentiate benign and malignant lung nodules could be used to more efficiently route benign lung nodules to non-invasive observation by CT surveillance and route malignant lung nodules to invasive procedures. The majority of risk predictors developed to date are based exclusively on clinical risk factors, imaging technology or molecular markers. Assessed here are the relative performances of previously reported clinical risk factors and proteomic molecular markers for assessing cancer risk in lung nodules. From this analysis an integrated model incorporating clinical risk factors and proteomic molecular markers is developed and its performance assessed on a subset of 222 lung nodules, between 8mm and 20mm in diameter, collected in a previously reported prospective study. In this analysis it is found that the molecular marker is most predictive. However, the integration of clinical and molecular markers is superior to both clinical and molecular markers separately.

Utilization of health care services has been an important determinant of maternal and child outcomes. The vast majority of maternal and child deaths could be prevented if women utilize the available life lines. The study objective was to determine utilization of maternal and child health care services among women of child bearing age in Western Nigeria.A community based, cross sectional study was done in Oshodi/Isolo Local Government Area among women of child bearing age (15-49 years) with at least one child under five years. Multistage sampling was used to select 371 respondents. Data was collected with a structured, pretested, interviewer administered questionnaire and analyzed with Epi info 3.5.1. Summary and inferential statistics were done. Level of significance was set at 5%(p<0.05).Of the 371 respondents interviewed, the health facility was used for antenatal care (74.3% n = 276), delivery (59.9% n = 222), postnatal services (77.9% n = 289), family planning services (28.8% n = 107), immunization (95.1% n = 353), growth monitoring (77.4% n = 287), nutritional services (64.7% n = 240) and treatment of childhood illness (49.6% n = 184). Only 31.5% (n = 117) of the respondents practiced exclusive breastfeeding and 82% (n = 263) of the mothers used oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea management. Maternal education significantly influenced utilization. In addition maternal age, employment status, number of children, spouse employment and educational status played significant roles.Utilization of maternal and child health services among respondents was above national average but not optimal, especially family planning services, exclusive breastfeeding and curative services for children.

https://openalex.org/W2615763242,"Purpose To determine corneal Q value and its related factors in Chinese subjects older than 30 years. Design Cross sectional study. Methods 1,683 participants (1,683 eyes) from the Handan Eye Study were involved, including 955 female and 728 male with average age of 53.64 years old (range from 30 to 107 years). The corneal Q values of anterior and posterior surfaces were measured at 3.0, 5.0 and 7.0mm aperture diameters using Bausch & Lomb Orbscan IIz (software version 3.12). Age, gender and refractive power were recorded. Results The average Q values of the anterior surface at 3.0, 5.0 and 7.0mm aperture diameters were -0.28±0.18, -0.28±0.18, and -0.29±0.18, respectively. The average Q value of the anterior surface at the 5.0mm aperture diameter was negatively correlated with age (B = -0.003, p<0.01) and the refractive power (B = -0.013, p = 0.016). The average Q values of the posterior surface at 3.0, 5.0, and 7.0mm were -0.26±0.216, -0.26±0.214, and -0.26±0.215, respectively. The average Q value of the posterior surface at the 5.0mm aperture diameter was positively correlated with age (B = 0.002, p = 0.036) and the refractive power (B = 0.016, p = 0.043). Conclusion The corneal Q value of the elderly Chinese subjects is different from that of previously reported European and American subjects, and the Q value appears to be correlated with age and refractive power."
https://openalex.org/W2615736180,"Background The significant rise in the prevalence of obesity coincides with the considerable increase in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) currently being observed worldwide. The components of MS are not static and their dynamics, such as the order of their occurrence, or the time of exposure to them are, as yet, unknown but could well be clinically relevant. Our objective was to study the dynamic behaviour of MS and its components in a large population-based cohort from a Mediterranean region. Methods and findings Our study employed a retrospective cohort (between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2012) made up of individuals from the general population in a region in the northeast of Catalonia, Spain. Given that most of the explicative variables of the risk of having MS were time dependent and, therefore, the risk was not proportional, we used the Andersen-Gill (AG) model to perform a multivariate survival analysis and inferences were performed using a Bayesian framework. Thirty-nine percent of the participants developed MS; 44.6% of them with a single limited episode. Triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, together with obesity, are components associated with the first occurrence of MS. Components related to the metabolism of glucose are associated with a medium risk of having a first episode of MS, and those related to blood pressure are associated with a lower risk. When the components related to blood pressure and the metabolism of glucose appear first, they determine the appearance of the first episode of MS. The variables concerning the persistence of MS are those that correspond to clinical conditions that do not have well-established drug treatment criteria. Conclusions Our results suggest that the components related to the metabolism of glucose and to high blood pressure appear early on and act as biomarkers for predicting MS, while the components related to obesity and dyslipidaemia, although essential for the development of MS, appear later. Making lifestyle changes reduces the conditions associated with the persistence of MS."
https://openalex.org/W2614629226,"Background The long-term aim of developing laser based particle acceleration towards clinical application requires not only substantial technological progress, but also the radiobiological characterization of the resulting ultra-short and ultra-intensive particle beam pulses. After comprehensive cell studies a mouse ear tumour model was established allowing for the penetration of low energy protons (~20 MeV) currently available at laser driven accelerators. The model was successfully applied for a first tumour growth delay study with laser driven electrons, whereby the need of improvements crop out. Methods To optimise the mouse ear tumour model with respect to a stable, high take rate and a lower number of secondary tumours, Matrigel was introduced for tumour cell injection. Different concentrations of two human tumour cell lines (FaDu, LN229) and Matrigel were evaluated for stable tumour growth and fulfilling the allocation criteria for irradiation experiments. The originally applied cell injection with PBS was performed for comparison and to assess the long-term stability of the model. Finally, the optimum suspension of cells and Matrigel was applied to determine applicable dose ranges for tumour growth delay studies by 200 kV X-ray irradiation. Results Both human tumour models showed a high take rate and exponential tumour growth starting at a volume of ~10 mm3. As disclosed by immunofluorescence analysis these small tumours already interact with the surrounding tissue and activate endothelial cells to form vessels. The formation of delimited, solid tumours at irradiation size was shown by standard H&E staining and a realistic dose range for inducing tumour growth delay without permanent tumour control was obtained for both tumour entities. Conclusion The already established mouse ear tumour model was successfully upgraded now providing stable tumour growth with high take rate for two tumour entities (HNSCC, glioblastoma) that are of interest for future irradiation experiments at experimental accelerators."
https://openalex.org/W2615739552,"Background Although Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is closely associated with the development of peptic ulcer, its involvement in pathophysiology in the lower intestinal tract and gastrointestinal (GI) motility remains unclear. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a gut hormone produced in the lower intestinal tract and involved in GI motility. Here, we investigated the effect of H. pylori infection on the link between GLP-1 expression and motility of the GI tract. Methods C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with a H. pylori strain. Twelve weeks later, the H. pylori-infected mice underwent H. pylori eradication treatment. GI tissues were obtained from the mice at various time intervals, and evaluated for the severity of gastric inflammatory cell infiltration and immunohistochemical expression of GLP-1 and PAX6 in the colonic mucosa. Gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) was measured by administration of carmine-red solution. Results GLP-1 was expressed in the endocrine cells of the colonic mucosa, and PAX6 immunoreactivity was co-localized in such cells. The numbers of GLP-1- and PAX6-positive cells in the colon were significantly increased at 12 weeks after H. pylori infection and showed a positive correlation with each other. The GITT was significantly longer in H. pylori-infected mice than in non-infected controls and showed a positive correlation with GLP-1 expression. When H. pylori-infected mice underwent H. pylori eradication, GITT and PAX6/GLP-1 expression did not differ significantly from those in untreated H. pylori-infected mice. Conclusions H. pylori infection may impair GI motility by enhancing the colonic GLP-1/PAX6 expression."

Methods All patients undergoing first time ERCP at a tertiary referral center between December 2010 and October 2013 were retrospectively included. PEP was defined according to the Atlanta Classification. Results 404 patients were included in the final analysis. The risk to develop PEP was increased in patients after inadvertent cannulation of the pancreatic duct (odds ratio 7.468 (2.792–19.975); p&lt;0.001), which occurred in 37.4% of the patients. Inadvertent cannulation occurred significantly more frequently in patients with difficult cannulation of the papilla duodeni major (odds ratio 7.3; p&lt;0.001).

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia among children worldwide, and nasopharyngeal colonization precedes infection. Objective We investigated whether providing early MV at 18 weeks of age reduced pneumococcal colonization and/or density up to 9 months of age. Method The study was conducted in 2013–2014 in Guinea-Bissau. Pneumococcal vaccine was not part of the vaccination program. Infants aged 18 weeks were block-randomized 2:1 to early or no early MV; at age 9 months, all children were offered MV as per current policy. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken at baseline, age 6.5 months, and age 9 months. Pneumococcal density was determined by q-PCR. Prevalence ratios of pneumococcal colonization and recent antibiotic treatment (yes/no) by age 6.5 months (PR6.5) and age 9 months (PR9) were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variance estimates while the pneumococcal geometric mean ratio (GMR6.5 and GMR9) was obtained using OLS regression. Results Analyses included 512 children; 346 early MV-children and 166 controls. At enrolment, the pneumococcal colonization prevalence was 80% (411/512). Comparing early MV-children with controls, the PR6.5 was 1.02 (95%CI = 0.94–1.10), and the PR9 was 1.04 (0.96–1.12). The GMR6.5 was 1.02 (0.55–1.89), and the GMR9 was 0.69 (0.39–1.21). Early MV-children tended to be less frequently treated with antibiotics prior to follow up (PR6.5 0.60 (0.34–1.05) and PR9 0.87 (0.50–1.53)). Antibiotic treatment was associated with considerably lower colonization rates, PR6.5 0.85 (0.71–1.01) and PR9 0.66 (0.52–0.84), as well as lower pneumococcal density, GMR6.5 0.32 (0.12–0.86) and GMR9 0.52 (0.18–1.52). Conclusion Early MV at age 18 weeks had no measurable effect on pneumococcal colonization prevalence or density. Higher consumption of antibiotics among controls may have blurred an effect of early MV. Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov NCT01486355"
https://openalex.org/W2581030038,"Network models are widely used to describe complex signaling systems. Cellular wiring varies in different cellular contexts and numerous inference techniques have been developed to infer the structure of a network from experimental data of the network's behavior. To objectively identify which inference strategy is best suited to a specific network, a gold standard network and dataset are required. However, suitable datasets for benchmarking are difficult to find. Numerous tools exist that can simulate data for transcriptional networks, but these are of limited use for the study of signaling networks. Here, we describe SiGNet (Signal Generator for Networks): a Cytoscape app that simulates experimental data for a signaling network of known structure. SiGNet has been developed and tested against published experimental data, incorporating information on network architecture, and the directionality and strength of interactions to create biological data in silico. SiGNet is the first tool to simulate biological signaling data, enabling an accurate and systematic assessment of inference strategies.

https://openalex.org/W2615603768,"Objective This nation-wide register-based study investigated how often substance use disorders (SUD) and co-morbid disorders occurred in affected families compared to control families. Method A total of N = 2504 child and adolescent psychiatric participants who were born between 1969 and 1986 and were registered in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (DPCRR) had a mental disorder before the age of 18 and developed SUD at some point during their life-time. In addition, N = 7472 controls without any psychiatric diagnosis before age 18 and matched for age, sex, and residential region were included. Psychiatric diagnoses of the first-degree relatives were also obtained. A family load component was assessed. Results SUD occurred significantly more often in case families than in control families. SUD risk factors included SUD, depression, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, or conduct disorders in the family. Furthermore, male sex, more recent year of birth, and living in the capital city of Copenhagen were also significantly associated with having SUD. The family load explained 30% of the SUD manifestation in the case-probands. The findings in the total SUD group were mostly replicated in the two major subgroups of pure alcohol or multiple substance use disorders. Discussion These findings based on a very large and representative dataset provide additional evidence for the strong family aggregation and further risk factors in SUD. The pattern of risk factors is largely the same for the total group of SUD and the major subgroups of pure alcohol and multiple substance use disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2616971501,"In the last two decades, many studies have focused on the muscles and dense connective tissues located in the suboccipital region.

Anatomical dissection was performed on 35 head-neck specimens. The existence of the second terminations of the suboccipital muscles was confirmed and various types of the TBNL were observed in this study. The second terminations originated from multiple suboccipital muscles including the rectus capitis posterior minor (RCPmi), rectus capitis posterior major (RCPma) and obliquus capitis inferior (OCI) muscles, merged and terminated at the TBNL. The overall incidence of the second terminations of the suboccipital muscles was 34.29% and it varied among the various suboccipital muscle origins. 28.57% of the second terminations originated from the RCPma; 11.43% was from the RCPmi and 8.57% was from the OCI. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the existence of second terminations and the particular type of the TBNL. 95% of the arcuate type of the TBNL was accompanied with the second terminations which attached to their turning part, whereas only 10% of all the radiate type of the TBNL was accompanied with the second terminations. This study for the first time described the second terminations originating from multiple suboccipital muscles and demonstrated the relationship with the various types of the TBNL. We speculated that the second terminations maintain the arcuate TBNL and transfer tensile forces to the Myodural Bridge (MDB), thereby modulating the physiological functions of the MDB."
https://openalex.org/W2614196754,"The analysis of the network structure of the functional connectivity data constructed from fMRI images provides basic information about functions and features of the brain activity. We focus on the two features which are considered as relevant to the brain activity, the criticality and the constraint regarding energy consumptions. Within a wide variety of complex systems, the critical state occurs associated with a phase transition between distinct phases, random one and order one. Although the hypothesis that human brain activity is also in a state of criticality is supported by some experimental results, it still remains controversial. One issue is that experimental distributions exhibit deviations from the power law predicted by the criticality. Based on the assumption that constraints on brain from the biological costs cause these deviations, we derive a distribution model. The evaluation using the information criteria indicates an advantage of this model in fitting to experimental data compared to other representative distribution models, the truncated power law and the power law. Our findings also suggest that the mechanism underlying this model is closely related to the cost effective behavior in human brain with maximizing the network efficiency for the given network cost."
https://openalex.org/W2615613341,"The role of Pulmonary and Activation-Regulated Chemokine (PARC) in the physiopathology of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not fully understood. The aim of the present study is to analyze the expression of PARC in lung tissue and its relationship with the vascular remodeling of the systemic and pulmonary arteries of COPD subjects.To achieve this objective, protein and gene expression experiments, together with ELISA assays, were performed on the lung tissue, intercostal arteries and serum samples from COPD patients, non-obstructed smokers (NOS) and never-smokers (NS).A total of 57 subjects were included in the analysis (23 COPD, 18 NOS and 16 NS). In the comparisons between groups, a significantly increased lung protein expression of PARC was observed in the COPD group compared to the NOS group (1.96±0.22 vs. 1.29±0.27, P-adjusted = 0.038). PARC was located predominantly in the smooth muscle cells of the remodeled pulmonary muscular arteries and the macrophage-rich area of the alveolar parenchyma. No differences were detected in PARC gene expression analyses. The protein content of PARC in the intercostal arteries were similar between groups, though little remodeling was observed in these arteries. Circulating levels of PARC were numerically higher in patients with COPD compared to NOS and NS.The results of the present study suggest an increased lung protein expression of PARC in COPD subjects. This protein was mainly localized in the smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary muscular arteries and was associated with the severity of intimal thickening, indicating its possible role in this remodeling process."
https://openalex.org/W2615268617,"The secreted cysteine proteinase SpeB is an important virulence factor of group A streptococci (GAS), whereby SpeB activity varies widely among strains. To establish the degree to which SpeB activity correlates with disease, GAS organisms were recovered from patients with pharyngitis, impetigo, invasive disease or acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and selected for analysis using rigorous sampling criteria; >300 GAS isolates were tested for SpeB activity by casein digestion assays, and each GAS isolate was scored as a SpeB-producer or non-producer. Highly significant statistical differences (p < 0.01) in SpeB production are observed between GAS recovered from patients with ARF (41.5% SpeB-non-producers) compared to pharyngitis (20.5%), invasive disease (16.7%), and impetigo (5.5%). SpeB activity differences between pharyngitis and impetigo isolates are also significant, whereas pharyngitis versus invasive isolates show no significant difference. The disproportionately greater number of SpeB-non-producers among ARF-associated isolates may indicate an altered transcriptional program for many rheumatogenic strains and/or a protective role for SpeB in GAS-triggered autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2616007631,"Radiologists have used margin characteristics based on routine visual analysis; however, the attenuation changes at the margin of the lesion on CT images have not been quantitatively assessed. We established a CT-based margin analysis method by comparing a target lesion with normal lung attenuation, drawing a slope to represent the attenuation changes. This approach was applied to patients with invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (n = 40) or bacterial pneumonia (n = 30). Correlations among multiple regions of interest (ROIs) were obtained using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values. CT visual assessment, margin and texture parameters were compared for differentiating the two disease entities. The attenuation and margin parameters in multiple ROIs showed excellent ICC values. Attenuation slopes obtained at the margins revealed a difference between invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma and pneumonia (P<0.001), and mucinous adenocarcinoma produced a sharply declining attenuation slope. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, pneumonia had an ill-defined margin (odds ratio (OR), 4.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26-18.52; P = 0.02), ground-glass opacity (OR, 8.55; 95% CI, 2.09-34.95; P = 0.003), and gradually declining attenuation at the margin (OR, 12.63; 95% CI, 2.77-57.51, P = 0.001). CT-based margin analysis method has a potential to act as an imaging parameter for differentiating invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma and bacterial pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2615761877,"In many fields of science, there is the need of assessing the causal influences among time series. Especially in neuroscience, understanding the causal interactions between brain regions is of primary importance. A family of measures have been developed from the parametric implementation of the Granger criteria of causality based on the linear autoregressive modelling of the signals. We propose a new Bayesian method for linear model identification with a structured prior (GMEP) aiming to apply it as linear regression method in the context of the parametric Granger causal inference. GMEP assumes a Gaussian scale mixture distribution for the group sparsity prior and it enables flexible definition of the coefficient groups. Approximate posterior inference is achieved using Expectation Propagation for both the linear coefficients and the hyperparameters. GMEP is investigated both on simulated data and on empirical fMRI data in which we show how adding information on the sparsity structure of the coefficients positively improves the inference process. In the same simulation framework, GMEP is compared with others standard linear regression methods. Moreover, the causal inferences derived from GMEP estimates and from a standard Granger method are compared across simulated datasets of different dimensionality, density connection and level of noise. GMEP allows a better model identification and consequent causal inference when prior knowledge on the sparsity structure are integrated in the structured prior."
https://openalex.org/W2615268635,"Hierarchical organizations of information processing in the brain networks have been known to exist and widely studied. To find proper hierarchical structures in the macaque brain, the traditional methods need the entire pairwise hierarchical relationships between cortical areas. In this paper, we present a new method that discovers hierarchical structures of macaque brain networks by using partial information of pairwise hierarchical relationships. Our method uses a graph-based manifold learning to exploit inherent relationship, and computes pseudo distances of hierarchical levels for every pair of cortical areas. Then, we compute hierarchy levels of all cortical areas by minimizing the sum of squared hierarchical distance errors with the hierarchical information of few cortical areas. We evaluate our method on the macaque brain data sets whose true hierarchical levels are known as the FV91 model. The experimental results show that hierarchy levels computed by our method are similar to the FV91 model, and its errors are much smaller than the errors of hierarchical clustering approaches."
