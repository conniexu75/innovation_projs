https://openalex.org/W2047642636,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals coordinate developmental patterning and have essential physiological roles in mature organisms. Here we describe the first known small-molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling-dorsomorphin, which we identified in a screen for compounds that perturb dorsoventral axis formation in zebrafish. We found that dorsomorphin selectively inhibits the BMP type I receptors ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6 and thus blocks BMP-mediated SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, target gene transcription and osteogenic differentiation. Using dorsomorphin, we examined the role of BMP signaling in iron homeostasis. In vitro, dorsomorphin inhibited BMP-, hemojuvelin- and interleukin 6-stimulated expression of the systemic iron regulator hepcidin, which suggests that BMP receptors regulate hepcidin induction by all of these stimuli. In vivo, systemic challenge with iron rapidly induced SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and hepcidin expression in the liver, whereas treatment with dorsomorphin blocked SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, normalized hepcidin expression and increased serum iron levels. These findings suggest an essential physiological role for hepatic BMP signaling in iron-hepcidin homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2040418090,"The dopamine system is thought to be involved in making decisions about reward. Here we recorded from the ventral tegmental area in rats learning to choose between differently delayed and sized rewards. As expected, the activity of many putative dopamine neurons reflected reward prediction errors, changing when the value of the reward increased or decreased unexpectedly. During learning, neural responses to reward in these neurons waned and responses to cues that predicted reward emerged. Notably, this cue-evoked activity varied with size and delay. Moreover, when rats were given a choice between two differently valued outcomes, the activity of the neurons initially reflected the more valuable option, even when it was not subsequently selected."

https://openalex.org/W2070758111,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a nuclear enzyme that is rapidly activated by DNA strand breaks and signals the presence of DNA lesions by attaching ADP-ribose units to chromatin-associated proteins. The therapeutic applications of PARP inhibitors in potentiating the killing action of ionizing radiation have been well documented and are attracting increasing interest as a cancer treatment. However, the initial kinetics underlying the recognition of multiple DNA lesions by PARP1 and how inhibition of PARP potentiates the activity of DNA-damaging agents are unknown. Here we report the spatiotemporal dynamics of PARP1 recruitment to DNA damage induced by laser microirradiation in single living cells. We provide direct evidence that PARP1 is able to accumulate at a locally induced DNA double strand break. Most importantly, we observed that the rapid accumulation of MRE11 and NBS1 at sites of DNA damage requires PARP1. By determining the kinetics of protein assembly following DNA damage, our study reveals the cooperation between PARP1 and the double strand break sensors MRE11 and NBS1 in the close vicinity of a DNA lesion.

Maintenance of genome stability is essential to successfully complete cellular division and avoid severe consequences, such as carcinogenesis and cell death (1O'Driscoll M. Jeggo P.A. Nat. Rev.

Thus, the DNA damage response includes enzyme activities responsible for the detection, signaling, and repair of damaged DNA as well as the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis that collectively maintain genomic stability (1O'Driscoll M. Jeggo P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that the MRN complex is the primary DSB sensor that recruits signaling proteins at DSB sites (2Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Kitagawa R. Melander F. Kastan M.B. Bartek J.

Concomitantly, chromatin-associated proteins rapidly become poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in the vicinity of DNA lesions (5Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L.

The involvement of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the repair of DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) by base excision repair has long been recognized (6Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). However, evidence is accumulating that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is also involved in the repair of DSBs by either nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) (7Wang M. Wu W. Wu W. Rosidi B. Zhang L. Wang H.

As a result, cells deficient in proteins involved in these DNA repair pathways are exceedingly sensitive to PARP inhibition (9McCabe N. Turner N.C. Lord C.J. Kluzek K. Bialkowska A. Swift S.

Nature. 2005; 434: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (3660) Google Scholar). The major mammalian poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, PARP1, is activated upon binding to DNA double and single strand breaks, where it synthesizes large amounts of negatively charged ADP-ribose polymers (PAR) (5Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Only a few other PARPs have been studied, but their characterization will probably reveal additional functions of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (6Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). The rapid metabolism of PAR is important to release PARP1 from DNA strand breaks (12Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and allows the assembly of repair proteins at sites of DNA lesions (13Haince J.-F.

Persistence of PARP1 and other poly-(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins on DNA will otherwise impede the progression of subsequent signaling and repair pathways (8Hochegger H. Dejsuphong D. Fukushima T. Morrison C. Sonoda E. Schreiber V. Zhao G.Y. Saberi A. Masutani M. Adachi N. Koyama H. de Murcia G. Takeda S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1305-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). On the other hand, failure to generate poly(ADP-ribose) in response to DNA damage by either chemical inhibition or the absence of PARP1 enzyme increases the cellular sensitivity to genotoxic stress (11Bryant H.E. Schultz N. Thomas H.D. Parker K.M. Flower D. Lopez E. Kyle S. Meuth M. Curtin N.J. Helleday T. Nature. 2005; 434: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (3660) Google Scholar). This suggests that PAR itself is a key DNA damage signaling molecules (13Haince J.-F. Kozlov S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Hendzel M.J. Lavin M.F. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16441-16453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 14Aguilar-Quesada R. Munoz-Gamez J.A. Martin-Oliva D. Peralta A. Valenzuela M.T. Matinez-Romero R.

The repair of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation occurs in the context of chromatin, and it is becoming clear that proteins involved in chromatin remodeling play an integral role in DNA repair (15Kruhlak M.J. Celeste A. Dellaire G. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Muller W.G. McNally J.G. Bazett-Jones D.P. Nussenzweig A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Despite increasing evidence for the interplay between ATM and PARP1 (13Haince J.-F. Kozlov S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Hendzel M.J. Lavin M.F. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16441-16453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 14Aguilar-Quesada R. Munoz-Gamez J.A. Martin-Oliva D. Peralta A. Valenzuela M.T. Matinez-Romero R. Quiles-Perez R. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. de Almodovar M.R. Oliver F.J. BMC Mol. Biol. 2007; 8: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), an important issue still incompletely resolved is the temporal and spatial relationships among these factors. To address this question in a real time in vivo approach, we investigated the early steps of DNA damage signaling involving PARP1 and the MRN complex proteins MRE11 and NBS1 following local microirradiation. In this study, we report the initial kinetics underlying the DNA damage recognition by PARP1 at sites of laser-induced DNA damage using live cell imaging analysis. The analysis shows that PARP1 rapidly accumulates on induced DSBs and that PARP1 promotes the recruitment of MRE11 and NBS1 to these DNA lesions. Moreover, we also provide data showing that MRE11 and PARP1 can interact. The results presented suggest a mechanism by which PAR-binding interaction may contribute to the initial damage signaling that leads to the recruitment of MRE11 to DNA strand breaks. Expression Plasmid—An expression construct of full-length human PARP1 was obtained by cloning a 3.0-kbp SalI-XbaI polymerase chain reaction fragment, amplified from hPARP1 cDNA (ATCC Image Clone 519-3735) with the following primer set: forward (5′-ACGCGTCGACATGGCGGAG-TCTTCGGATAA-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTC-TAGAATTACCACAGGGAGGTCTTA-3′), in frame to the 5′ end of pEGFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech). Expression of this construct in living cells generates a fluorescently tagged PARP1 (GFP-PARP1). The same strategy was applied to generate a full-length PARP1 with the GFP tag in the C terminus (PARP1-GFP). The expression construct was obtained with the following primer set: forward (5′-CCGCTCGAGGATGGCGGAGTCTTCGGATAA-3′) and reverse (5′-CCCCCCGGGCCTCCAGAACCTGAACCCCACAGGGAGGTCTTAAA-3′), in frame to the 3′ end of pEGFP-N3 expression vector (Clontech). All constructs sequences were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Cellular localization of fluorescently tagged proteins was assessed in living cells, and expression levels were verified by Western blotting. Cell Culture—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from PARP1-deficient mice (A1) and human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Normal MEFs (C3H10T1/2) were maintained in basal Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C, under a 5% CO2 controlled atmosphere in a humidified incubator. Transient expression of fluorescently tagged PARP1 was performed in PARP1-deficient MEFs (A1) using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. YFP-MRE11 and GFP-NBS1 were transiently transfected in both normal (C3H10T1/2) and PARP1-deficient (A1) cell lines under the same conditions. Antibodies and Immunofluorescence—PAR synthesis was detected with the rabbit anti-PAR 96-10 antibody. Nuclear foci of DNA damage were visualized using phospho-specific antibodies against ATM S1981 (10H11.E12; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and H2AX S139 monoclonal antibody (JBW301; Upstate Biotechnology). Endogenous mouse and human PARP1 was detected using monoclonal antibody C2-10; MRE11 was detected with monoclonal antibody (clone 12D7; GeneTex). Induction of a single DSB in SK-N-SH cells was performed through transfection of the I-SceI expression vector pCBASce using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed immediately after microirradiation (less than 5 min) or at the indicated time points with 4.0% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were immunostained with combinations of antibody specified in the figure legends. Coverslips were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline prior to a 30-min incubation with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorophore. Finally, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were counterstained with DAPI or Hoechst 33258 to stain DNA. Cells were observed using a Zeiss microscope (Axioplan IIM) equipped with a CoolSnapHQ cooled CCD camera. Z-series confocal image sets were collected with a pinhole aperture set to 1.0 Airy units. Images were collected using a 1.3 numerical aperture ×40 PlanFluor objective. The measurement of fluorescence intensity and colocalization was performed using MetaMorph 6.0 (Universal Imaging) software. Composite figures of collected images were assembled in Adobe Photoshop. Two-photon Microirradiation—We carried out laser microirradiation by modifying a previously described method (16Bradshaw P.S. Stavropoulos D.J. Meyn M.S. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were labeled with 1 μm 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine overnight. Cells were placed in fresh medium, exposed to 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 for 1 h, and then placed on the stage of a Zeiss LSM510 NLO laser-scanning confocal microscope. DSBs were generated along a 1-μm-wide region across nucleus of a single living cell by excitation of the Hoechst 33258 dye using a near-infrared 780-nm titanium-sapphire laser line. The laser output was set to 10% (unless stated otherwise), and we used 10 iterations to generate localized DSB clearly traceable with a ×40 objective. Protein accumulation within the laser path was compared with an undamaged region within the same microirradiated cell. Therefore, each cell provides a reference unirradiated region that provides high sensitivity to detect and measure small changes in the concentration of fluorescently tagged proteins. For microirradiation, we selected cells with low expression levels and normalized the fluorescence intensity in the microirradiated area to the initial fluorescence in the whole nucleus in order to compensate for photobleaching during acquisition. The average accumulation ± S.E. of fluorescently tagged proteins from at least 10 cells from three independent experiments was plotted. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—FRAP experiments were conducted essentially as described (17Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 18McDonald D. Carrero G. Andrin C. de Vries G. Hendzel M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). FRAP analysis was carried out with living HeLa cells transfected with PARP1-GFP fusion proteins. A laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510) equipped with a 488-nm laser light and a 40 × 1.3 numerical aperture objective was used to perform all photobleaching experiments. Fluorescence recovery was monitored over a 40-s period. Data obtained for recovery were corrected for the background intensity and loss of total fluorescence. Chromatin Fractionation—Normal MEF cells and PARP1-deficient cells were treated or not with etoposide (50 μm). One hour later, cells were biochemically fractionated, and MRE11 retention assays were performed as described (19Andegeko Y. Moyal L. Mittelman L. Tsarfaty I. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38224-38230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation, PAR-binding Assays, and MRE11 Exonuclease Assays—SK-N-SH cells were treated or not with etoposide (50 μm). One hour later, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete™ protease inhibitors), and endogenous PARP1 and MRE11 were immunoprecipitated essentially as described (13Haince J.-F. Kozlov S. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Hendzel M.J. Lavin M.F. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16441-16453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) using the anti-PARP1 monoclonal antibody (clone F1-23) or the anti-human MRE11 monoclonal antibody (clone 12D7; GeneTex). Induction of a single DSB in cells was performed through electroporation of the I-SceI expression vector pCBASce, and ChIP was performed with monoclonal antibodies against PARP1 (clone F1-23) as previously described (20Rodrigue A. Lafrance M. Gauthier M.C. McDonald D. Hendzel M. West S.C. Jasin M. Masson J.Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The recombinant MRE11 and MRE11 R/A mutant proteins were produced from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, using the Bacto-Bac expression system (Invitrogen) and purified as described (21Boisvert F.M. Dery U. Masson J.Y. Richard S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). PAR-binding affinity was assayed on purified recombinant proteins following separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.05-μm pore seize). Membranes were incubated with 32P-labeled automodified PARP1 or 32P-labeled purified PAR, washed extensively, and subjected to autoradiography or analyzed by Cerenkov counting using an InstantImager system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). MRE11 exonuclease assays were conducted in a reaction mixture containing 100 nm DNA in MOPS buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 60 mm KCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MnCl2) and the indicated amount of PAR. After 5 min at 37 °C, the indicated amount of MRE11 was added, and incubation was continued for 1 h. Reaction products were analyzed by 10% urea-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Dynamics of PARP1 Recruitment to DNA Damage Lesions—We carried out live cell imaging analysis using MEFs derived from the PARP1 mutant mice and complemented with a functional GFP-tagged PARP1 protein (Fig. 1a). Proper expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1b). Confocal analyses of transiently transfected cells confirmed the nuclear localization of cells expressing physiological levels of PARP1 tagged with GFP at either its N or C terminus (Fig. 1c). Immunofluorescence quantification established that the level of fluorescently tagged PARP1 expressed in PARP1-deficient cells is comparable with levels of endogenous PARP1 in two different wild-type cell lines (Fig. 1, d and e). To study the recruitment of PARP1 to DNA lesions in living cells, we employed an innovative microirradiation process using near-infrared (780-nm) multiphoton excitation of the Hoechst 33258 dye in living cells that have incorporated 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine into their DNA (Fig. 2a) (15Kruhlak M.J. Celeste A. Dellaire G. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Muller W.G. McNally J.G. Bazett-Jones D.P. Nussenzweig A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 22Meldrum R.A. Botchway S.W. Wharton C.W. Hirst G.J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Laser-induced microirradiation produces a variety of DNA lesions, including SSBs, and base damage, but it is best known for its ability to produce DSBs. Moreover, sensitization of cells by 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation promotes the formation of DSB upon local irradiation (23Lukas C. Falck J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). This technique allows the introduction of high levels of DSBs without the toxicity associated with the UV-based laser irradiation approach (15Kruhlak M.J. Celeste A. Dellaire G.

The top panels show the photobleaching of Hoechst 33258 dye following microirradiation. PARP1-deficient cells transiently expressing physiological levels of PARP1-GFP (bottom) were microirradiated with a 780-nm laser line (10% of maximum laser output) to induce DSBs. The numbers at the bottom right of each image indicate elapsed time (s). Bar, 5 μm. c, the graph shows a plot of intensity versus time illustrating the increase in the concentration of both PARP1-GFP and GFP-PARP1 immediately following DSBs induction. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. from at least 10 cells for each construct. d, differential interference contrast (DIC) images were collected to monitor nuclear membrane integrity and cellular viability 2 min after laser microirradiation. Immunofluorescence shows localization of both PARP1-GFP and PAR polymer after laser microirradiation. The arrow indicates the region where DSBs were introduced (1-μm-wide region).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To monitor the recruitment of PARP1 to DNA lesions, time lapse images have been collected immediately after microirradiation and over a 2-min period. We consistently observed that the recruitment of PARP1 at localized DNA breaks starts less than 1 s after laser microirradiation, and the time required for half-accumulation (t½) at DNA damage sites was 1.580 ± 0.150 s (Fig. 2, b and c). Quantitative fluorescence analysis indicates that the concentration of PARP1-GFP inside the laser path is nearly twice that of the nucleoplasm (Fig. 2c). These results confirm that PARP1 is not confined to a defined subnuclear structure but can migrate to sites of DNA breakage following exposure to DNA-damaging agents (25Yung T.M. Sato S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39686-39696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The nuclear membranes of the microirradiated cells were intact, and cells remained viable during the experiment as defined by differential interference contrast images taken 2 min after the recorded time periods (Fig. 2d). Additionally, the presence of PARP1-GFP at sites of damage correlated with increased levels of PAR (Fig. 2d), which clearly reflects PARP enzymatic activity. Thus, from these data and the previously reported view that PARP1 is a DNA break sensor (12Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 26Kim J.S. Krasieva T.B. Kurumizaka H. Chen D.J. Taylor A.M. Yokomori K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), we conclude that PARP1 is one of the first molecules that is recruited to DNA breaks induced by laser microirradiation. FRAP Measurements of Chromatin-bound and Free PARP1 after DNA Damage—To gain a better understanding of the interaction between PARP1 and DNA breaks, we applied FRAP analysis to measure the rate of PARP1-GFP exchange between the microirradiated region and the undamaged neighboring nucleoplasm (Fig. 3a). For quantitative analysis, fluorescence recovery in the bleached area, and intensities in nuclear regions as well as the background signal were quantified with minimal laser power. FRAP measurements revealed that the PARP1-GFP within the laser tracks had both reduced mobility and recovered up to 78% of the original relative level within 30 s (Fig. 3b). This indicates that a fraction of PARP1-GFP becomes transiently immobilized in microirradiated regions. Dose-dependent Recruitment of PARP1 to Laser-generated DSB Sites—To determine the amount of PARP1-GFP recruited by the laser microirradiation, we directly analyzed the intensity of fluorescence accumulation at DNA damage sites by increasing the laser power. Increasing laser intensity, from 5% to 30%, led to an augmentation of PARP1 incorporation, which occurred over a broader distance across the laser trajectories (Fig. 4a), indicating that recruitment of PARP1 to localized DNA damage regions is highly dependent on the extent of DNA damage. The laser output set to 10% produced the sharpest redistribution of PARP1-GFP to DSB areas, whereas a decrease in energy yielded only partial recruitment, and increased laser power gave a dispersed pattern outside the laser path (Fig. 4a). For all experiments described in this study, we routinely employed low laser power level, which consistently produced detectable focused DSBs, as outlined by γ-H2AX staining (Fig. 4b) (15Kruhlak M.J.

Together, these results indicate that there is a direct relation between the extent of γ-H2AX accumulation, the level of PAR synthesis, and the laser power level used to induce DSB (Fig. 4c).

Thus, to further define the spatial and temporal role of PAR synthesis in the early signaling of DNA damage formation, we analyzed cells that were fixed following multiphoton laser microirradiation in order to visualize endogenous PARP1 activation in human SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 5a). Immediately after microirradiation (less than 5 min), the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and the localization and extent of DSB formation in a defined subnuclear region was studied by co-immunostaining for histone H2AX phosphorylation (γ-H2AX), activated ATM (phosphoserine 1981), and PARP1 and PAR synthesis. Immunofluorescence analysis established that endogenous PARP1 protein instantaneously concentrated within local “track” of DNA damage and was detectable for at least 30 min"

Detachment of cells from the substratum triggers the clearance of rafts from the plasma membrane through caveolin-dependent internalization. The small GTPase Arf6 and microtubules also regulate Rac-dependent cell spreading and migration, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that endocytosis of rafts after detachment requires F-actin, followed by microtubule-dependent trafficking to recycling endosomes. When cells are replated on fibronectin, rafts exit from recycling endosomes in an Arf6-dependent manner and return to the plasma membrane along microtubules. Both of these steps are required for the plasma membrane targeting of Rac1 and for its activation. These data therefore define a new membrane raft trafficking pathway that is crucial for anchorage-dependent signalling."

A simplified treatment of the protein homeostasis network and a formalism for how this network of competing pathways interprets protein folding kinetics and thermodynamics provides a framework for understanding cellular protein trafficking. We illustrate how folding and misfolding energetics, in concert with the adjustable biological capacities of the folding, degradation, and export pathways, collectively dictate an adaptable standard for protein export from the ER. A model of folding for export (FoldEx) establishes that no single feature dictates folding and transport efficiency. Instead, a network view provides insight into the basis for cellular diversity, disease origins, and protein homeostasis, and predicts strategies for restoring protein homeostasis in protein-misfolding diseases."

After correct folding, secretory glycoproteins are transported to the Golgi complex via the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) by vesicular transport. ER export of some proteins is facilitated by cargo receptors. The most completely characterized cargo receptor is the type 1 membrane lectin ERGIC-53, which, together with ERGL, VIP36, and VIPL, constitutes the family of leguminous type (L-type) lectins (8Nufer O.

Thus, these three lectins have distinct localizations within the early secretory pathway, pointing to disparate functions despite the structural similarities of their CRDs (supplemental Fig. S1). To understand the molecular function of these lectins, it is essential to know the sugar recognition features of their CRDs in detail. In a previous study (10Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi Y. Takahashi N.

In the present study, we used the FAC method to comprehensively and quantitatively analyze the sugar recognition of ERGIC-53 and VIPL in comparison with that of VIP36. Furthermore, on the basis of the recently reported crystal structure of VIP36 (22Satoh T. Cowieson N.P. Hakamata W. Ideo H. Fukushima K. Kurihara M. Kato R. Yamashita K. Wakatsuki S. J. Biol.

Protein Expression—The DNA fragments for residues 1–275 and 1–304, corresponding to the signal sequences and the CRDs of human ERGIC-53 and VIPL, respectively, were cloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pDNA3.1 vector (GE Healthcare) with a C-terminal poly-His tag moiety. HEK293 cells transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% minimum Eagle's medium 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm sodium pyruvate at 37 °C with 10% CO2 in humidified air. To enhance the expression levels, 2 mm butyrate was added 2 days before harvesting the medium. The poly-His fusion proteins were purified from the cultured medium with a Ni2+-Sepharose high performance column (GE Healthcare). The proteins were further purified using a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The CRD of human VIP36 encoding amino acid residues 45–296 was mutated using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) with the following primers: D261G, 5′-GCCGGCACCGGCGGCCTGTCTGACAATC-3′; and 168K169, 5′-CCCAATGATGAGAAGACCACTGAGCGC-3′. The wild-type or mutant VIP36-CRD with a C-terminal poly-His tag moiety was expressed by Escherichia coli as described previously (10Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi Y. Takahashi N. Arata Y. Kasai K.I. Ihara Y.

In the previous study, we conducted FAC analyses of VIP36-CRD immobilized on a HiTrap NHS-activated column (GE Healthcare). However, ERGIC-53-CRD immobilized by this procedure did not show any sugar-binding affinity, presumably because the lysine residues located near the sugar-binding site were unavoidably involved in the amine coupling, rendering the CRD inactive. For this reason, in the present study the recombinant CRDs were immobilized through their histidine tag for FAC analyses except for experiments to examine pH dependence of sugar binding of VIPL and VIP36 (and its mutant). Hence, recombinant proteins were immobilized on a Ni2+-Sepharose high performance or a HiTrap NHS-activated column following the manufacturer's instructions. After immobilization, the Sepharose beads were packed into a stainless steel column (4.0 × 10 mm; GL Sciences). The PA oligosaccharide library was constructed as described previously (10Kamiya Y.

As a new member of this library, Manα1–6(Manα1–3)Manα1–6(Glcα1–3Manα1–2Manα1–2Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-PA (designated as GM7) was produced by digestion of GlcMan9GlcNAc2-PA using 30 milliunits of α-1,2-mannosidase (Seikagaku Kogyo Co.) for 1 nmol of the oligosaccharide in 100 μl of 0.1 m citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 24 h and subsequently isolated by high performance liquid chromatography using a TSK gel Amide-80 column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Consequently, the PA sugar library used in the present study contained 18 kinds of high-mannose-type oligosaccharides. PA oligosaccharides were dissolved at a concentration of 10 nm in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0–8.0) or 10 mm MES (pH 5.5–6.5), both containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2, and applied onto the column at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min at 20 °C. The elution profile was monitored by the fluorescence intensity at 400 nm (excitation at 320 nm). The retardation compared with the control oligosaccharide was computed using the difference of each elution volume, Vf. The dissociation constant, Kd (=1/Ka), of the lectins for Man9GlcNAc2-PA (M9) was determined by the concentration-dependent analysis using Equation 1 as described previously (24Arata Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3068-3077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), [A]0·(Vf-V0)=Bt-Kd·(Vf-V0)(Eq. 1) where [A]0, V0, and Bt are the initial concentration of the PA oligosaccharide, the elution volume of the control sugar, and the total amount of immobilized lectins in the column, respectively. The elution profile was monitored by UV absorption at 300 nm to avoid possible quenching caused by the relatively high concentration of the PA sugar. For the determination of V0, 50 μm p-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside was used. Kd was calculated based on the retardation Vf – V0 measured at concentrations of 5–80 μm M9. The relative affinity of each oligosaccharide was calculated under conditions where [A]0 is negligibly small compared with Kd using Equation 2. Vf-V0=Bt/Kd(Eq. 2) To determine V0, (GlcNAcβ1–6(GlcNAcβ1–4)(GlcNAcβ1–2)Manα1–6)(GlcNAcβ1–4)(GlcNAcβ1–2(Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4)Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-PA and Neu5Acα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4(Neu5Acα2–8Neu5Acα2–3)Galβ1–4Glc-PA were used as control sugars for the analyses of VIPL-CRD and the other CRDs, respectively. Ka values are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Sugar-binding Properties—Fig. 1B shows typical elution profiles of a series of PA oligosaccharides after application to the immobilized VIPL-CRD column at pH 7.4. From the retardation volume, relative affinities of the individual PA oligosaccharides could be estimated. In a similar way, the FAC data were collected for ERGIC-53-CRD and VIP36-CRD. Ka values were first determined for M9 from the linear plot of [A]0(Vf – V0) versus (Vf – V0) according to Equation 1 and then for all other PA oligosaccharides on the basis of their relative affinities. The Ka values obtained for the 18 different PA oligosaccharides at pH 7.4 are summarized in Fig. 1C. The results show that the sugar-binding specificity pattern of the VIPL-CRD is strikingly similar to that of the VIP36-CRD. Both VIPL and VIP36 bound high-mannose-type oligosaccharides retaining the D1 trimannosyl branch: glucosylation and mannose trimming of this branch significantly impaired binding, whereas trimming of the D2 and D3 branches nominally affected the interaction (Fig. 1C). A key finding is that the pH dependence of sugar binding was considerably different for VIP36 and VIPL (Fig. 2). VIP36-CRD exhibits a bell-shaped pH dependence of binding to M9 with an optimal pH of ∼6.5 as reported previously (10Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi Y. Takahashi N. Arata Y. Kasai K.I. Ihara Y. Matsuo I. Ito Y. Yamamoto K. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37178-37182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas the Ka of VIPL for this oligosaccharide steadily increased with increasing pH from 5.5 to 7.5 (Fig. 2). A similar tendency of sugar-binding properties of VIPL was shown in previous cell binding assays (11Yamaguchi D. Kawasaki N. Matsuo I. Totani K. Tozawa H. Matsumoto N. Ito Y. Yamamoto K. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ERGIC-53 bound high-mannose-type oligosaccharides with lower affinities than those observed for VIPL and VIP36 and showed a moderate tendency to bind larger oligosaccharides (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, ERGIC-53 is insensitive to either glucosylation or removal of the mannose residue at the non-reducing terminal of the D1 branch. Collectively, the three L-type lectins exhibit distinct sugar-binding properties despite the structural similarity of their CRDs. Molecular Basis of Carbohydrate-binding Specificity—We attempted to identify the amino acid residues accounting for the differences in the sugar-binding properties of the lectins on the basis of the recently reported crystal structures of the VIP36-CRD in comparison with that of the rat ERGIC-53-CRD (22Satoh T. Cowieson N.P. Hakamata W. Ideo H. Fukushima K. Kurihara M. Kato R. Yamashita K. Wakatsuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28246-28255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The structure of the VIP36-CRD with mannosyl ligands indicated that the D1 branch is accommodated in a pocket neighboring the Ca2+-binding site with canonical interactions of Man-C with Asp-131 and Asn-166, which are widely conserved among L-type lectins (supplemental Fig. S2) (22Satoh T. Cowieson N.P. Hakamata W. Ideo H. Fukushima K. Kurihara M. Kato R. Yamashita K. Wakatsuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28246-28255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This explains why the existence of Man-C is a prerequisite for the preferential binding to all three lectins. In VIP36-CRD, Man-D1 makes contacts with Ser-96 and Asp-261, putatively leading to steric hindrance between Glu-98 and the non-reducing terminal glucose residue. Although Ser-96 is conserved in ERGIC-53 and VIPL, Asp-261 is substituted with glycine in ERGIC-53 but not VIPL. Inspection of the crystal structures indicates that this amino acid substitution resulted in the lack of the protrusive side chain, rendering the putative sugar-binding pocket of ERGIC-53 significantly shallower (supplemental Fig. S2D). We speculated that abolishing the structural constraint by the Asp-261 side chain may enable conformational rearrangement of the D1 outer branch, avoiding the steric crash of the glucose residue in VIP36-CRD. To test this, we produced a D261G-mutated VIP36-CRD and examined its sugar-binding specificity. The FAC data in Fig. 1C indicate that the mutant VIP36-CRD can now bind the monoglucosylated high-mannose-type oligosaccharides. These findings suggest that the high specificity of VIP36 and VIPL for the deglucosylated D1 branch is governed by the single aspartate residue in their sugar-binding pockets. The pH dependence of sugar binding is a unique property of the L-type lectins. Like ERGIC-53 (8Nufer O. Mitrovic S. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15886-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), VIPL effectively binds oligosaccharides under neutral conditions but not at lower pH, whereas VIP36 exhibits a bell-shaped pH dependence of binding to M9 with a lower pH optimum (10Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi Y. Takahashi N. Arata Y. Kasai K.I. Ihara Y. Matsuo I. Ito Y. Yamamoto K. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37178-37182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Previous mutagenesis studies have suggested that ionization of the histidine residue located in the loop participating in the Ca2+ coordination, i.e. His-178 of human ERGIC-53 (His-186 in rat), is responsible for the decrease in their sugar binding below pH 7.0 (9Appenzeller-Herzog C. Roche A.C. Nufer O. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12943-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The corresponding histidine (His-188) is conserved in VIPL-CRD and therefore is likely to be responsible for the decrease in affinity of this lectin upon lowering the pH. The bell-shaped pH dependence of VIP36 cannot be attributed to a single titratable group. Inspection of the crystal structure of VIP36 suggests that all titratable groups in and around the sugar-binding site are conserved in VIPL. It is noteworthy, however, that there exists an extra lysine residue (Lys-166) near the putative sugar-binding site of VIPL-CRD (supplemental Fig. S1). This inspired us to design a mutant VIP36-CRD in which a lysine residue is inserted into the corresponding position, i.e. between Glu-168 and Thr-169. FAC analysis demonstrated that this mutant, designated as 168K169, retained the sugar-binding selectivity of the wild type (Fig. 1C) but no longer exhibited the bell-shaped pH dependence: rather, it showed a steady increase in affinity for M9 with increasing pH, very much like VIPL (Fig. 2). The three-dimensional model of VIP36-CRD complexed with Man8GlcNAc2Asn based on the crystal structure indicates that the Glu168-Thr169 segment is not in direct contact with the ligand (supplemental Fig. S2) (22Satoh T. Cowieson N.P. Hakamata W. Ideo H. Fukushima K. Kurihara M. Kato R. Yamashita K. Wakatsuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28246-28255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This suggests that the insertion of the lysine indirectly influences the affinity at higher pH, accounting for the differences in the pH dependence of sugar binding between VIP36 and VIPL. Functional Implications—In the present study, we have established the sugar-binding specificities and pH dependence of VIPL, ERGIC-53, and VIP36. Like VIP36, VIPL specifically interacts with the deglucosylated trimannose in the D1 branch, whereas ERGIC-53 binds high-mannose-type oligosaccharides with broad specificity. Unexpectedly, in our FAC analysis, ERGIC-53 did not discriminate between the monoglucosylated and deglucosylated oligosaccharides, although a previous study indicated that this lectin exhibits impaired binding to glycoprotein cargo after treatment of cells with the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine (12Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that castanospermine treatment gives rise to di- and/or triglucosylated oligosaccharides, which may not fit into the sugar-binding site of ERGIC-53-CRD. How can the sugar-binding properties established in the current study be translated into function? We propose the following working model for the function of the three lectins. VIPL binds deglucosylated high-mannose-type glycoproteins immediately after their exit from the calreticulin/calnexin cycle given its ER localization and its high selectivity for binding the D1 branch, provided glucoses are removed. Thereby, VIPL may protect the folded glycoproteins from demannosylation by ER mannosidases and interaction with the EDEM (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein) family of mannose-binding proteins. Demannosylation and binding to EDEMs is a key step in ER-associated degradation of newly synthesized glycoproteins (27Molinari M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Hence, interaction with VIPL may prevent the degradation of folded proteins. Because VIPL is a resident protein of the ER, its interaction with secretory glycoproteins must be transient, but how is cargo released from VIPL for ER export? A known mechanism of cargo release involves a drop in pH, as exemplified by transport receptors cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes. There is no indication, however, of pH differences within the ER. Overexpression of VIPL is known to redistribute ERGIC-53 to the ER, suggesting interaction and functional interplay between these two lectins (8Nufer O. Mitrovic S. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15886-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Neve E.P. Svensson K. Fuxe J. Pettersson R.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 70-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the VIPL-bound glycoproteins are handed over to ERGIC-53. At first glance, such a process seems difficult to imagine because the glycan affinity of the ERGIC-53-CRD is lower than that of the VIPL-CRD. In vivo, however, ERGIC-53 forms homohexamers (28Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bächi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), which may considerably increase its glycan affinity. Moreover, the binding of cargo glycoproteins to ERGIC-53 can be enhanced by protein-protein interactions, as exemplified by cathepsin Z, which binds not only through a high-mannose-type glycan but also by a β-hairpin loop nearby (13Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ERGIC-53 forms a complex with MCFD2, providing an additional possibility for protein-protein interactions as known for coagulation factors V and VIII. The cooperative binding to glycan and polypeptide appears to be the basis for the selective cargo receptor function of ERGIC-53. In the absence of protein-protein interaction sites, ERGIC-53 may facilitate glycoprotein transport with only low efficiency via its lectin function. This notion is supported by the finding that ER-Golgi transport of numerous glycoproteins carrying N-glycans is slightly retarded when active ERGIC-53 is locked in the ER. 6S. Mitrovic, K. Bucher, and H. P. Hauri, unpublished data. It is conceivable that the up-regulation of ERGIC-53 under ER stress enhances the export capacity of glycoprotein cargo (27Molinari M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 28Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bächi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The broad specificity of ERGIC-53 for larger high-mannose-type glycans may be advantageous for efficient removal of proteins from the ER in this case of emergency. The current data on VIP36 confirm our previous conclusions regarding the function of VIP36 (10Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi Y. Takahashi N. Arata Y. Kasai K.I. Ihara Y. Matsuo I. Ito Y. Yamamoto K. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37178-37182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Hauri H. Appenzeller C. Kuhn F. Nufer O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because of a slightly acidic pH optimum corresponding to the luminal pH of the Golgi and selectivity for the D1 branch, VIP36 may retrieve misfolded glycoproteins back to the ER that have inadvertently escaped quality control in the ER. VIP36 is therefore postulated to act in post-ER quality control. In conclusion, the L-type lectins VIPL, ERGIC-53, and VIP36 share structural similarities in their CRDs but exhibit distinct sugar-binding specificities and affinities, which can be finely tuned by sensing pH. The combination of sugar specificity and pH dependence is proposed to provide the molecular basis for different functions of the three lectins in transport and quality control of glycoproteins. Our findings also reveal that the carbohydrate specificities of these lectins can be switched by single amino acid substitutions. We thank Professors Ken-ichi Kasai (Teikyo University) and Yoichiro Arata (Josai University) for useful discussion and Professor Soichi Wakatsuki and Dr. Tadashi Satoh (High Energy Accelerator Research Organization) for providing the atomic coordinates of the three-dimensional structural model for binding between VIP36-CRD and high-mannose-type glycans.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The activation of plexins by semaphorins initiates a variety of signaling processes that involve several small GTPases of the Ras and Rho families (14Kruger R.P. Aurandt J. Guan K.L. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Finally, all B-class plexins can interact with the receptor tyrosine kinases Met and ErbB-2 (25Giordano S. Corso S. Conrotto P. Artigiani S. Gilestro G. Barberis D. Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Nat.

Thus, plexin-B1 appears to be able to mediate different and sometimes opposite effects depending on the cellular context. The aim of this study was to define mechanisms, that determine the cellular responses to plexin-B1 activation. Antibodies and Reagents—The following antibodies were commercially obtained: mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) and goat polyclonal LARG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany); mouse monoclonal anti-VSV and mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich); anti-ErbB-2[Y1248], anti-Met[Y1234/1235], and anti-pAkt[S473] (Cell Signaling Technology, Frankfurt, Germany); mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and anti-Rac1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Millipore, Billerica); mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA and anti-ErbB-2 (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany); mouse monoclonal anti-Met (Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen); and goat polyclonal anti-plexin-B1 (R & D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). Plasmids—Eukaryotic expression plasmids carrying the cDNAs of PDZ-RhoGEF, Sema4D, (Myc)-RhoA, and Met were described previously (21Swiercz J.M. Kuner R. Behrens J. Offermanns S. Neuron. 2002; 35: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 26Swiercz J.M. Kuner R. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). VSV-plexin-B1 was kindly provided by L. Tamagnone (University of Torino, Torino, Italy). Full-length sequences of human Met and ErbB-2 were inserted into pLNCX2 vector (Clontech). Cell Culture and Immunoprecipitation Studies—HEK293 cells were cultured as described previously (21Swiercz J.M. Kuner R. Behrens J. Offermanns S. Neuron. 2002; 35: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 were cultured according to American Type Cell Culture Collection protocols. For immunoprecipitation, HEK293 cells were collected 48 h after transfection and lysed for 30 min in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 μg/ml of each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzosulfonylfluorid-hydrochloride, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm NaF). Proteins from cell extracts were precipitated with anti-VSV-G-agarose affinity gel. HEK cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate method, and siRNAs were transfected using MATra reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (IBA, Goettingen, Germany). Determination of Activated Cellular Rho and Rac—The amount of activated cellular Rho was determined by precipitation with a fusion protein consisting of GST and the Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin (GST-RBD) or the Rac1-binding domain of PAK as described (32Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and clarified cell lysates were incubated with GST-RBD at 4 °C for 50 min. The beads were then washed four times with the respective lysis buffer. The bead pellets were finally resuspended in 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. THE proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and GTPases were detected using a specific antibody against RhoA and Rac1, respectively. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Precipitated proteins and cell lysates were separated using SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Dassel, Germany) and blocking of nonspecific binding sites with 5% milk in TBST. The blots were probed with appropriate antibodies, and the proteins were visualized using an ECL system (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany and Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany). Wound Healing Assay—Wounding was performed with a 10-μl tip that was cut longitudinally. The recordings were performed immediately after wounding and after 24–48 h, using a motor-controlled Leica DC 350 FX camera connected to the Leica Microscope CTR MIC and operated by the Leica software FW4000. For statistical analysis, the wound distance from each well was measured in duplicate at two randomly defined wound gap locations per frame recorded per experiment, and at least three independent scratch-wound experiments were used for calculations. Transwell Assay—Cell migration was assayed using polystyrene Transwell inserts (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) with pore sizes of 0.8 μm. Cell concentration was adjusted to 2 × 105 cells/ml of medium, and 500 μl were added. The inserts were then placed in wells of a 24-well plate. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C at 5% CO2 for 12 h (MDA-MB-468 cells) or 24 h (MCF7 cells). The inserts were removed, and the cells on top of the insert were removed. Cells that had migrated to the bottom of the inserts were then fixed in methanol, stained with 1% toluidine blue in 1% sodium tetraborate for 1 h, and counted. Small Interfering RNAs—The target sequence for siRNAs specific to ErbB-2 and Met used in this study were published before (33Faltus T. Yuan J. Zimmer B. Kramer A. Loibl S. Kaufmann M. Strebhardt K. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 786-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 34Maeda A. Nakashiro K. Hara S. Sasaki T. Miwa Y. Tanji N. Yokoyama M. Hamakawa H. Oyasu R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The sequence of the siRNA used to suppress plexin-B1 expression was ACCACGGUCACCCGGAUUC. A control siRNA, CGCGUAGAAGAUGAAGUUG, was purchased from IBA (Goettingen, Germany). Northern Blot Analysis—Primers used for amplification of a plexin-B1 human cDNA fragment that served as a probe for Northern blot analysis were 5′-CCTCCGAGAGGCACCTGACTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCGTGCCATCCTCCTCCAG-3′ (antisense). The probe used for detection of PDZ-RhoGEF mRNA was a purified 941-bp fragment from a BamHI digest of PDZ-RhoGEF human cDNA. Northern blot analysis using total RNA (10 μg) derived from the respective cell lines was performed as described previously (35Worzfeld T. Puschel A.W. Offermanns S. Kuner R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Equal loading of the lanes was confirmed by comparing the intensities of the 18 S ribosomal RNA bands on the denaturing agarose gel. Production and Purification of Recombinant Sema4D—Generation of Lec3.2.8.1 Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the extracellular part of human Sema4D (residues 1–657 followed by a lysine residue and a C-terminal histidine tag for purification) was described previously (36Love C.A. Harlos K. Mavaddat N. Davis S.J. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Esnouf R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recombinant soluble Sema4D was purified by metal ion affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Concentration of purified soluble Sema4D was determined by comparison to a bovine serum albumin standard on Coomassie stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Activity of purified soluble Sema4D was routinely verified by measuring ErbB-2 phosphorylation in plexin-B1 transfected HEK cells by Western blot analysis after 20 min of exposure to 150 nm purified Sema4D. Production of Soluble Sema4D—HEK cells were transfected with a construct expressing the N-terminal portion of Sema4D in a secretion vector (pSecTag2-Hygro). 3 h after transfection, the cells were placed in serum-free medium. 48 h after transfection, Sema4D-containing medium was gathered and used for stimulation. For control, HEK cells were transfected with “empty” pSecTag2-Hygro and processed as described above. Retroviral Infections—Recombinant retroviruses were constructed by subcloning full-length human cDNA of ErbB-2 and Met into the retroviral expression vector pLNCX2 (Clontech), which carries a neomycin phosphotransferase cassette. A retroviral expression vector carrying the cDNA of human placenta alkaline phosphatase (pLAPSN) served as a control. The DNA constructs were transfected into the packaging cell line PT67 (Clontech) using calcium phosphate. Transfected PT67 cells were selected with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) for 14 days. Viral supernatants were collected, filtrated through a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore) and used to infect 3 × 105 cells in a 10-cm dish in the presence of 6 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). The infected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml geneticin for 14 days. Statistical Analysis—The data are given as the mean values ± S.D. The statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t test. The levels of significance are: *, <0.05; **, <0.01; ***, <0.001. It has been shown that Sema4D-induced plexin-B1 activation can result either in activation or inhibition of RhoA (20Driessens M.H. Hu H. Nobes C.D. Self A. Jordens I. Goodman C.S. Hall A. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), Sema4D stimulation of HEK cells expressing plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF and kept at 0.5 or 1.5% FBS led to a strong RhoA activation, which was accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1 and endogenous ErbB-2 and which could be blocked by the ErbB-2 inhibitor AG1478 (Fig. 1, left and middle panels). We did not detect Sema4D-induced RhoA activation in cells transfected with Met and pretreated with AG1478 at low serum concentrations (Fig. 1A, left panels), although Met became activated as indicated by its phosphorylation on tyrosine residue 1234/1235 and was able to mediate plexin-B1 phosphorylation. However, at intermediate and high serum concentrations resulting in higher basal RhoA activity, the inhibition of ErbB-2 and the expression of Met led to an inhibition of RhoA activity in response to Sema4D (Fig. 1A, middle and right panels). This inhibitory effect could be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a, which has been shown to inhibit Met at nanomolar concentration (25Giordano S. Corso S. Conrotto P. Artigiani S. Gilestro G. Barberis D. Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 37Morotti A. Mila S. Accornero P. Tagliabue E. Ponzetto C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas plexin-B1-mediated RhoA activation requires ErbB-2, the inhibition of RhoA activity through plexin-B1 appears to involve Met. Expression of increasing amounts of Met in HEK cells that endogenously express ErbB-2 resulted in a decreased interaction between plexin-B1 and ErbB-2 as determined by coprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1B). At the same time, interaction between plexin-B1 and Met increased. This was accompanied by a decrease in Sema4D-induced ErbB-2 phosphorylation and RhoA activation, whereas Sema4D-induced Met phosphorylation increased (Fig. 1C). At high Met expression levels, Sema4D induced RhoA inactivation (Fig. 1C). This suggests that ErbB-2 and Met compete for plexin-B1 and that the stoichiometry of plexin-B1, ErbB-2, and Met in the plasma membrane determines whether Sema4D-induced plexin-B1 activation involves ErbB-2 or Met and results in RhoA activation or inhibition. Our data suggest that Sema4D-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1 by the receptor tyrosine kinases ErbB-2 and Met is an important regulatory mechanism in plexin-B1 signaling and that the identity of the receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates phosphorylation of plexin-B1 greatly affects the cellular response to plexin-B1 activation by Sema4D. To test whether this holds true also in cellular systems endogenously expressing the components of plexin-B1-mediated signaling systems, we analyzed the two plexin-B1-expressing breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468, of which MCF-7 expresses ErbB-2 but not Met, whereas MDA-MB-468 expresses only Met but not ErbB-2 (Fig. 2A). Endogenous plexin-B1 interacted either with ErbB-2 or with Met in MCF-7 or MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively (Fig. 2B). In starved MCF-7 cells stimulation with Sema4D led to an activation of RhoA (Fig. 2C), which could be blocked by the ErbB-2 inhibitor AG1478 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, stimulation of Met-expressing MDA-MB-468 cells with Sema4D led to RhoA inhibition (Fig. 2D), an effect that was sensitive to the Met inhibitor K252a (Fig. 2D). The involvement of plexin-B1 in the regulation of RhoA activity in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells is demonstrated by the block of Sema4D-induced RhoA regulation in both cell lines after siRNA-mediated knockdown of plexin-B1 expression (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). Plexin-B1 can bind activated Rac upon stimulation by Sema4D (18Vikis H.G. Li W. He Z. Guan K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12457-12462Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Vikis H.G. Li W. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Driessens M.H. Hu H. Nobes C.D. Self A. Jordens I. Goodman C.S. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), thereby competing with other Rac-binding proteins like PAK (19Vikis H.G. Li W. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both in MCF7 as well as in MDA-MB-468 cells, Sema4D induced a decrease in the amount of activated Rac1 bound to the Rac-binding domain of PAK (supplemental Fig. S2A). Thus, in contrast to the regulation of RhoA, the binding of active Rac was obviously not differentially influenced by ErbB-2 and Met. The role of ErbB-2 and Met in plexin signaling was further analyzed by suppression of ErbB-2 and Met expression using siRNAs (Fig. 2, E and F). Sema4D-mediated RhoA activation in MCF7 cells was fully abolished after suppression of ErbB-2 expression, whereas cells expressing control and Met siRNAs showed a normal response (Fig. 2E). In MDA-MB-468 cells, we found that expression of control or ErbB-2-specific siRNA had no effect on Sema4D-mediated RhoA deactivation, whereas cells in which Met expression had been suppressed did not show Sema4D-dependent, plexin-B1-mediated RhoA inhibition (Fig. 2F). Because Met and ErbB-2 strongly influence the downstream signaling events of plexin-B1 activation, we tested whether the receptor tyrosine kinases affect the regulation of migratory activity by Sema4D using Transwell migration assays. In untreated (data not shown) and control siRNA transfected MCF-7 cells Sema4D induced an increase in migration (Fig. 3A), whereas stimulation of untreated or control siRNA transfected MDA-MB-468 with Sema4D led to an inhibition of migration (data not shown and Fig. 3B). Transfection of MCF-7 cells with Met-specific siRNA had no effect on the promigratory activity of Sema4D, whereas inhibition of ErbB-2 expression completely blocked Sema4D-induced migration of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, transfection with Met-specific but not ErbB-2-specific siRNA resulted in the complete inhibition of Sema4D-induced anti-migratory effects on MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, we found that pharmacological inhibitors of Met and ErbB-2 had analogous effects (data not shown). Both in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, the effects of Sema4D on cell migration were completely blocked after siRNA-mediated knockdown of plexin-B1 (supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). We then evaluated the role of ErbB-2 and Met in plexin-B1-mediated regulation of cell migration using a scratch wound healing assay. Interestingly, Sema4D stimulated wound closure in MCF-7 monolayers (Fig. 4, A and D), whereas it inhibited closure of wounds in MDA-MB-468 cell monolayers (Fig. 4, E and H). The stimulatory effect of Sema4D in MCF-7 cells was completely blocked in cells transfected with ErbB-2-specific siRNA (Fig. 4, B and D), whereas transfection with control or Met-specific siRNA had no effect (Fig. 4, C and D). In contrast, Sema4D induced inhibition of wound healing in MDA-MB-468 cell monolayers transfected with siRNA directed against ErbB-2 (Fig. 4, F and H), and this effect could be blocked by the suppression of Met expression (Fig. 4, G and H). Thus, Sema4D not only regulates migratory activity of single cells but also influences collective cell migration. Interestingly, in both cases, the presence of ErbB-2 appears to be required for Sema4D-induced stimulation of migratory activity, whereas Sema4D inhibits migration in the presence of Met. To confirm the critical role of either ErbB-2 or Met in determining the cellular response to Sema4D, we exchanged the receptor tyrosine kinases between MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. ErbB-2-expressing MCF-7 cells were infected with retroviruses carrying a control cDNA or wild type Met cDNA, whereas Met expressing MDA-MB-468 cells were infected with viruses carrying control or wild type ErbB-2 cDNAs (Fig. 5A). We then suppressed the expression of the receptor tyrosine kinases present in native cells using siRNAs directed against ErbB-2 and Met, respectively (Fig. 5B). In Met-infected MCF-7 cells and ErbB-2-infected MDA-MB-468 cells, plexin-B1 interacted with both receptor tyrosine kinases. However, after siRNA-mediated suppression of the expression of the endogenous kinase, plexin-B1 interacted with Met in MCF-7 and with ErbB-2 in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 5C). Consistent with our previous observations, Sema4D induces RhoA activation or inactivation in control infected MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, and its effects on RhoA activity were blocked by knockdown of ErbB-2 or Met, respectively (Fig. 5, D and E). However, when MCF-7 cells were manipulated to express Met instead of ErbB-2, the effect of Sema4D was inverted, and Sema4D induced RhoA deactivation (Fig. 5D). Similarly, substitution of Met by ErbB-2 in MDA-MB-468 changed the Sema4D effect from RhoA inactivation to activation (Fig. 5E). Because Sema4D has recently been shown to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway via Rho and Rho-kinase (38Basile J.R. Gavard J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34888-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of Sema4D to induce Akt activation. Interestingly, Sema4D was able to induce Akt phosphorylation only in MCF7 cells but not in MDA-MB-468 cells (supplemental Fig. S2B). Akt activation in MCF7 cells could be blocked by treatment of cells with an siRNA directed against ErbB-2. This indicates that activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway by Sema4D requires ErbB-2. We then tested whether the exchange of receptor tyrosine kinases also leads to a conversion of Sema4D-induced effects on migration. The promigratory effect of Sema4D on control MCF-7 cells was blocked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ErbB-2 (Fig. 6A). When expression of ErbB-2 was suppressed in MCF-7 cells stably expressing Met, Sema4D induced an inhibition of migratory activity (Fig. 6A). Similarly, the inhibitory effect of Sema4D on migration of control infected MDA-MB-468 cells was converted into a stimulatory effect in MDA-MB-468 cells expressing ErbB-2 and transfected with Met-specific siRNA (Fig. 6B). Finally we evaluated the effects of ErbB-2 and Met exchange on plexin-B1-mediated regulation of cell migration in the wound healing assay. In Met-transfected MCF-7 cells that are depleted of ErbB-2 using ErbB-2-specific siRNA, we observed an inhibition of wound closure in response to Sema4D (Fig. 6C), whereas the inhibitory effect of Sema4D on migration of MDA-MB-468 cells was converted into a stimulatory effect in cells expressing ErbB-2 and transfected with Met-specific siRNA (Fig. 6D). These data show that Sema4D can have opposite effects on Rho activity and cell migration, which are mediated by the specific interaction of plexin-B1 with receptor tyrosine kinases ErbB-2 and Met. The replacement of ErbB-2 by Met converts Sema4D from a RhoA-stimulating, promigratory mediator into a RhoA-inhibiting antimigratory mediator and vice versa. The cellular effects of semaphorins are quite versatile, and in many cases it has been reported that a particular semaphorin can induce different and sometimes even opposing effects depending on the cellular context. One possible mechanism underlying the versatility of semaphorin functions is the ability of their receptors to interact with various proteins to form multimolecular receptor complexes. In recent years it has been shown that the Sema4D receptor plexin-B1 can interact with the receptor tyrosine kinases Met and ErbB-2 and that both plexin-B1 and the receptor tyrosine kinases become tyrosine phosphorylated upon activation by Sema4D. Here we show that plexin-B1-mediated activation and inactivation of the small GTPase RhoA requires ErbB-2 and Met, respectively. In breast carcinoma cells, which express plexin-B1, the cellular effects of Sema4D were determined by the identity of the expressed receptor tyrosine kinase. Although the presence of ErbB-2 resulted in Sema4D-induced RhoA activation and stimulation of migratory activity, opposite effects of Sema4D were observed in cells expressing Met. There is much evidence that Sema4D binding to plexin-B1 induces RhoA activation through the RhoGEF proteins PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG, which stably interact with the C terminus of plexin-B1 (21Swiercz J.M. Kuner R. Behrens J. Offermanns S. Neuron. 2002; 35: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 22Perrot V. Vazquez-Prado J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 12085-12090Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that plexin-B1 can mediate inhibition of RhoA via the Sema4D-dependent recruitment of p190RhoGAP into the semaphorin receptor complex (30Barberis D. Casazza A. Sordella R. Corso S. Artigiani S. Settleman J. Comoglio P.M. Tamagnone L. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4689-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We could confirm that Sema 4D-dependent plexin-B1 activation can lead to opposing effects on RhoA activity, and we demonstrate that the identity of the receptor tyrosine kinase determines the net effect on RhoA activity. Although ErbB-2 is required for RhoA activation (26Swiercz J.M. Kuner R. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), preferential interaction of plexin-B1 with Met results in the inhibition of RhoA. It is currently not known how p190RhoGAP and PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG activities are regulated by plexin-B1. In the case of p190RhoGAP, the ligand-dependent association with plexin-B1 may be an important step (30Barberis D. Casazza A. Sordella R. Corso S. Artigiani S. Settleman J. Comoglio P.M. Tamagnone L. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4689-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG can be regulated by direct tyrosine phosphorylation (39Chikumi H. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12463-12473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); however, we have previously shown that tyrosine phosphorylation is unlikely to be involved in plexin-B1-mediated RhoGEF activation (26Swiercz J.M. Kuner R. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). How phosphorylation of plexin-B1 regulates activation of PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG remains to be clarified. Cell migration is a complex process that can be regulated at various levels. It involves the detachment of adhesions, the formation of polarized cellular protrusions, the formation of new adhesive structures, as well as the actomyosin-based cell body contraction (40Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3836) Google Scholar). The Rho family GTPases Rho and Rac have been shown to play key roles in the regulation of cellular migration (41Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 42Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms regulating RhoA activity during cell migration are not well described, RhoA activity appears to be stimulated and inhibited in a coordinated and spacially restricted fashion during cell migration, and it has been recently shown that RhoA activity is particularly high in the leading edge as well as in the retracting tail of migrating cells (43Pertz O. Hodgson L. Klemke R.L. Hahn K.M. Nature. 2006; 440: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Sema4D can influence cell migration in a dual fashion. Under certain conditions, Sema4D inhibits cell migration through the inhibition of integrin function, a process that involves R-RasGAP activity or p190RhoGAP-dependent RhoA inhibition (28Barberis D. Artigiani S. Casazza A. Corso S. Giordano S. Love C.A. Jones E.Y. Comoglio P.M. Tamagnone L. Faseb. J. 2004; 18: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Oinuma I. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Barberis D. Casazza A. Sordella R. Corso S. Artigiani S. Settleman J. Comoglio P.M. Tamagnone L. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4689-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, activation of plexin-B1 has promigratory effects that are independent of R-RasGAP activity but require the activation of RhoA and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (8Basile J.R. Barac A. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5212-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 31Basile J.R. Afkhami T. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In breast carcinoma cells expressing either ErbB-2 or Met, we observed that Sema4D had promigratory or antimigratory effects, respectively. This is consistent with the observation that the promigratory effects of Sema4D on endothelial cells were Met-independent (8Basile J.R. Barac A. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5212-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The promigratory effect of Sema4D in MCF7 cells was accompanied by Sema4D-induced RhoA and Akt activation. This would be consistent with a model in which RhoA-mediated signaling results in Akt activation to promote cellular migration as recently demonstrated for the promigratory effect of Sema4D on endothelial cells (38Basile J.R. Gavard J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34888-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the response to Sema4D could be converted by exchanging the two receptor tyrosine kinases, indicating that the expression of ErbB-2 or Met alone determines the effect of Sema4D on migratory activity. In cells expressing both receptor tyrosine kinases, ErbB-2 and Met may compete for mediating Sema4D effects, and their relative expression level may decide on the cellular net effect of Sema4D. The ability of Sema4D to stimulate migration in the presence of ErbB-2 correlated with its ability to activate RhoA, whereas in the presence of Met Sema4D induced preferentially an inhibition of RhoA. It is not clear whether the differential regulation of RhoA activity mediates the opposite effects of Sema4D on migration in the presence of ErbB-2 and Met. It is also conceivable that the downstream signaling cascades of the respective tyrosine kinases that are induced by Sema4D (25Giordano S. Corso S. Conrotto P. Artigiani S. Gilestro G. Barberis D. Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 26Swiercz J.M. Kuner R. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or unknown signaling components that may be recruited to plexin-B1 through ErbB-2- and Met-specific phosphorylation of particular tyrosine residues are involved in the differential regulation of cell migration by Sema4D. There is increasing evidence that extracellular mediators can induce diverse cellular effects depending on the composition of their heteromultimeric receptor complexes. Netrin1 for instance functions as a chemoattractant by activating homodimers of its receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer). However, when DCC dimerizes with another Netrin1 receptor, Unc5, binding of Netrin1 has chemorepellant effects (44Round J. Stein E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The ability to induce opposite effects in various cells has also been described for several semaphorins (see Introduction and Refs. 45Kolodkin A.L. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 117: 115-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Polleux F. Morrow T. Ghosh A. Nature. 2000; 404: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 47Schwamborn J.C. Fiore R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 30923-30926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the opposing cellular responses to particular semaphorins are ill defined. Recently, Sema6D was shown to induce promigratory and anti-migratory effects through its receptor plexin-A1 that depend on the association of plexin-A1 with either the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 or the receptor tyrosine kinase-like transmembrane protein Off-track (48Toyofuku T.

Our data show that Sema4D exerts different biological activities because of the differential association of its receptor plexin-B1 with the receptor tyrosine kinases Met and ErbB-2. The formation of heteromultimeric receptor complexes in a combinatorial manner together with the employment of different signaling pathways allows an increase in the versatility of the ligand response and may also provide a mechanism for signal integration whose complexities are just beginning to be understood.

https://openalex.org/W2086844275,"Cellular senescence plays an important role in tumor suppression. p53 tumor suppressor has been reported to be crucial in cellular senescence. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this regard, a cDNA microarray assay was performed to identify p53 targets involved in senescence. Among the many candidates is DEC1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that has been recently shown to be up-regulated in K-ras-induced premature senescence. However, it is not clear whether DEC1 is capable of inducing senescence. Here, we found that DEC1 is a novel target gene of the p53 family and mediates p53-dependent premature senescence. Specifically, we showed that DEC1 is induced by the p53 family and DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. We also found that the p53 family proteins bind to, and activate, the promoter of the DEC1 gene. In addition, we showed that overexpression of DEC1 induces G(1) arrest and promotes senescence. Moreover, we found that targeting endogenous DEC1 attenuates p53-mediated premature senescence in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, overexpression of DEC1 induces cellular senescence in p53-knockdown cells, albeit to a lesser extent. Finally, we showed that DEC1-induced senescence is p21-independent. Taken together, our data provided strong evidence that DEC1 is one of the effectors downstream of p53 to promote premature senescence."

Here we provide definitive genetic and biochemical evidence that the functional endorepellin receptor is the α2β1 integrin. Notably, the specific endorepellin binding to the receptor was cation-independent and was mediated by the α2I domain. We show that the anti-angiogenic effects of endorepellin cannot occur in the absence of α2β1. Microvascular endothelial cells from α2β1-/- mice, but not those isolated from either wild-type or α1β1-/- mice, did not respond to endorepellin. Moreover, syngeneic Lewis lung carcinoma xenografts in α2β1-/- mice failed to respond to systemic delivery of endorepellin. In contrast, endorepellin inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in the wild-type mice expressing integrin α2β1.

Here we have further investigated the endorepellin-α2β1 integrin interactions by using cell-free experiments with a soluble form of the α2β1 integrin, by in vitro assays of endothelial cells deficient in the integrin α1or α2 subunits, by siRNA knockdown of the integrin α2 subunit, and in syngeneic tumor xenografts growing in mice lacking the α2β1 integrin receptor. We report a novel cation-independent binding between endorepellin and integrin α2 I domain and show that integrin α2β1 is necessary for recruitment of endorepellin to the vasculature and for its anti-angiogenic properties both in vitro and in vivo. The presented studies increase both the knowledge about this specific angiogenesis inhibitor and angiogenesis in general. Cell Lines and Reagents—HUVEC at passages 1-6, HT1080, and LLC cells were cultured under standard conditions. Human recombinant endorepellin and LG3 harboring a His6 tag at their C termini were purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column as previously described (7Mongiat M. Sweeney S.

The soluble ectodomain heterodimer of the α2β1 integrin was generated as previously described (21Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12274-12284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The recombinant production of the oligo-His-tagged integrin α2 I domain was carried out similar to the glutathione S-transferase-tagged α2 I domain (22Eble J.A. Tuckwell D.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 376: 77-85Crossref Google Scholar). The binding activity of both integrin constructs was tested on collagen I and rhodocetin, a high affinity α2β1 integrin-specific antagonist (21Eble J.A.

Binding Assays with Recombinant α2β1 Integrin and α2I Domain—A binding assay of soluble α2β1 integrin to immobilized collagen I or endorepellin in the presence of either 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and integrin-activating antibody 9EG7 or 10 mm EDTA was performed as previously published (21Eble J.A.

For the reciprocal binding assays, recombinant α2β1 integrin ectodomain heterodimer or oligo-His-tagged integrin α2 I domain was coated onto a microtiter plate at 5 μgml-1 in Tris-buffered saline/magnesium/manganese buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 1% BSA in Tris-buffered saline/magnesium/manganese buffer, the wells were incubated with endorepellin at the indicated concentrations or with 10 μgml-1 CB3[IV], both in blocking buffer. This soluble collagen IV fragment harbors the α2β1 integrin-binding site (23Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Eble J.A. Golbik R. Mann K. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and was used as positive control. After washing, bound integrin ligands were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.4) for 10 min and quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal rabbit antibodies against endorepellin and CB3[IV] as primary antibodies and secondary alkaline phosphatase-coupled antibodies directed against rabbit immunoglobulins. The plates were read at 405 nm. Cell Adhesion and Actin Disassembly Assays—CC2-treated chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 100 μgml-1 rat tail collagen I (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed with PBS, and 104 HUVEC were seeded. After 24 h, the medium was changed to serum-free M199 for 30 min prior to treatment with 150 nm endorepellin, 150 nm endorepellin, and 1 μm human recombinant integrin α2 I domain or 1 μm human recombinant integrin α2 I domain alone for 30 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and M199 containing the prior incubated reagents were added for 25 min at 37 °C. The nuclei and actin stress fibers were visualized by DAPI and fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin staining, respectively (14Bix G. Fu J. Gonzalez E. Macro L. Barker A. Campbell S. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Kim J.K. Höök M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For quantification of cell adhesion, the cells were counted by their DAPI staining. For quantification of actin stress fibers, 80-100 randomly selected cells of each group were analyzed. The assays were performed in triplicate. siRNA Transfection of HUVEC and HT1080 Cells—HUVEC/HT1080 were plated at subconfluent density on 12-well culture plates (Nunc). The cells were allowed to grow in complete medium until ∼70% confluence. Following washing, the cells were transfected with two validated siRNA constructs (Ambion Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), targeting different regions of the integrin α2 mRNA. siRNA1 (antisense 5′-3′, UCUGAAAGUUGUCUCCUCCtt) and siRNA2 (antisense 5′-3′, AACACUUCCUGUUGUUACCtt) target exons 10 and 24/25, respectively. The cells were transfected for 48-72 h using siPORT lipid transfection agent with the two siRNA, either alone or in combination at 125-150 nm. Migration Assay of α2 Knockdown Endothelial and Fibrosarcoma Cells—HUVEC and HT1080 cells were transfected with the optimal concentrations of siRNA, and the time span was analyzed by immunoblotting. HUVEC and HT1080 that were treated with siPORT alone were used as a control. Both control and α2 siRNA-treated cells were preincubated with various concentrations of endorepellin for 30 min prior to migration through a collagen I-coated polycarbonate membrane, with 8-μm pores in a 48-well Boyden chamber (Neuroprobe Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). About 8 × 103 HUVEC or HT1080 cells were loaded into the upper chamber and allowed to migrate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 4-6 h ± VEGF165 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at a concentration of 10 ng ml-1 in the lower chambers as a chemo-attractant for HUVEC, and heat-inactivated medium conditioned by HT1080 as a chemo-attractant for HT1080. Immunofluorescence Analysis of α2β1 Knockdown Cells—HUVEC and HT1080 cultured for 24 h on lysine-treated eight-well slides coated with rat tail collagen I (100 μgml-1) (BD Biosciences) were transfected with the two validated α2 siRNA constructs (150 mm each). The cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 s. The cells were rinsed in PBS and then blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Polyclonal anti-α2 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to wells at a 1:50 dilution in 5% BSA/PBS for 1 h. Primary antibody was detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti IgG (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The nuclei were visualized using DAPI. All of the images were acquired on an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Genotyping of Integrin α1 and α2 Null Mice and Isolation of Lung Microvascular Endothelial Cells—Tail genomic DNA was subjected to PCR in 20 μl of reaction volume with 1.25 mm MgCl2 and 1 pmol ml-1 each primer using a mix of three primers. Primer sequences were as follows: α1β1+/+, 5′-ggttggtgactaaagttgatcc-3′; α1 β1-/-, 5′-ggaacttcctgactaggggagg-3′; α1 β1 common, 5′ttttcacactcatgaaatcttgttg-3′; α2 β1+/+, 5′-cttgtctaatggctattgc-3′; α2 β1-/-, 5′-tggcttttcttcctcctatgg-3′; and α2 β1common, 5′-aagttgctcgcttgctcta-3′. Lung microvascular endothelial cells were isolated from wild-type or integrin null mice as previously described (25Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lung vasculature was perfused with PBS, 2.5 mm EDTA followed by 0.25% trypsin, 2.5 mm EDTA via the right ventricle. The lungs were removed and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The visceral pleura was subsequently trimmed, and the perfusion was repeated. Primary endothelial cells were recovered and grown o in EGM-2-MV containing 5% fetal calf serum (Clonetics). The cells at passages 2-4 were used for the experiments. Syngeneic Tumor Xenografts and Quantification of Tumor Angiogenesis—Female integrin α2 β1-/- and α2 β1+/+ mice in C57Bl/6 background were injected subcutaneously with 106 LLC cells. On the day tumors became visible, the mice were randomized into two groups, and one group received intraperitoneal injections of human recombinant endorepellin, whereas the other received vehicle (PBS) alone (20Bix G. Castello R. Burrows M. Zoeller J.J. Weech M. Iozzo R.A. Cardi C. Thakur M.T. Barker C.A. Camphausen K.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2006; 98: 1634-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Tumor sectioning and immunostains were performed as previously described (20Bix G. Castello R. Burrows M. Zoeller J.J. Weech M. Iozzo R.A. Cardi C. Thakur M.T. Barker C.A. Camphausen K.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2006; 98: 1634-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: rat anti-mouse CD31 monoclonal antibody (BD, Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and mouse anti His6 monoclonal (ABM, Vancouver, Canada). Both antibodies were diluted 1:100. The epitopes were revealed by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti rat IgG and rhodamine-conjugated goat-anti mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) secondary antibodies. Sections were counter-stained with DAPI. Sections from three different tumors in each group were stained with CD31, and pictures were taken at 20× magnification to cover the entire tumor section with a fixed exposure of 500 ms. The acquired images (n = 30-50) were quantified using the Image J software package (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All of the statistical analyses were carried out with SigmaStat for Windows version 3.10 (Systat Software, Inc., Port Richmond, CA). The results were compared by using the two-sided Student's t test, and the differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. The Soluble α2β1 Integrin Ectodomain Interacts Specifically with Endorepellin in a Cation-independent Manner—To investigate the molecular interaction between endorepellin and the α2β1 integrin, we utilized a soluble heterodimeric α2β1 integrin. This soluble receptor consists of the ectodomain of both α2 and β1 integrin subunits noncovalently associated by the dimerizing motif of the two transcription factors Fos and Jun, respectively (21Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12274-12284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This soluble integrin binds with high affinity collagen types I, II, and IV as the native integrin and has been successfully utilized in various protein/protein interaction assays (21Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12274-12284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Using this approach, together with a battery of monoclonal antibodies against the α2 I domain, the precise mapping of the disintegrin rhodocetin, an RGD-independent ligand of the α2β1 integrin, on the α2 I domain was determined (22Eble J.A. Tuckwell D.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 376: 77-85Crossref Google Scholar). We conducted several binding studies using endorepellin and the soluble α2β1 integrin. Unexpectedly, when endorepellin was utilized as the immobilized ligand, there was no significant binding to the soluble α2β1 (Fig. 1A). Under identical experimental conditions, immobilized collagen I readily bound to the soluble α2β1 receptor, and this interaction was enhanced by the activating monoclonal antibody 9EG7 and abolished by the addition of EDTA (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when endorepellin was used as a soluble ligand, it significantly bound to the immobilized α2β1 (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, binding levels were found to be identical in the presence or absence of EDTA. As an internal positive control, we used the CB3 fragment of collagen IV, which harbors the α2 I domain-binding site (23Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Eble J.A. Golbik R. Mann K. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The binding of CB3[IV] to immobilized α2β1 receptor was robust and significantly reduced by EDTA (Fig. 1B). When a range of concentrations of endorepellin was added to α2β1-coated plates in the presence of Mn2+ (1 mm) or EDTA (10 mm), binding curves were almost identical, confirming the cation-independent interaction (Fig. 1C). Next, we determined whether endorepellin/α2β1 interaction was mediated by the α2 I domain, the region of the integrin known to bind collagen (26Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). When increasing concentrations of soluble endorepellin were added to the microtiter plates at the concentrations shown (Fig. 1D), a saturable binding of endorepellin to the α2 I domain was observed, albeit at lower levels than the whole heterodimeric integrin ectodomain (Fig. 1D) in agreement with our previous studies (14Bix G. Fu J. Gonzalez E. Macro L. Barker A. Campbell S. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Kim J.K. Höök M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Functional Block of Endorepellin Activity by Soluble α2β1 Integrin and Its α2 I Domain—Having established a physical interaction between the soluble α2β1 integrin and endorepellin, we next wished to prove whether this interaction would have a biological meaning using live endothelial cells. Utilizing a highly sensitive functional assay (14Bix G. Fu J. Gonzalez E. Macro L. Barker A. Campbell S. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Kim J.K. Höök M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), we found that actin stress fiber disassembly evoked by a short exposure to endorepellin could be almost completely abolished by preincubating endorepellin with either soluble α2β1orthe α2 I domain (Fig. 2, A-F). Notably, similar effects were obtained using the terminal LG module, LG3, of endorepellin (supplemental Fig. S1), which is the active binding site for the integrin (19Gonzalez E.M. Reed C.C. Bix G. Fu J. Zhang Y. Gopalakrishnan B. Greenspan D.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7080-7087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To further corroborate these finding, we quantified the total number of attached cells, as an adhesion assay on collagen I. The number of adherent endothelial cells was drastically (p < 0.001) reduced when incubated with endorepellin (Fig. 2G). However, this effect was abrogated by the soluble ectodomain of the α2β1 integrin and significantly reduced (p < 0.05) by preincubation with the α2 I domain (Fig. 2G). Collectively, these findings prove that the physical interaction between endorepellin and soluble α2β1 integrin translates into a functional block of endorepellin angiostatic activity on endothelial cells. Integrin α2β1 Is Vital for Normal Migration of Endothelial and Fibrosarcoma Cells through Collagen I—To further investigate the functional role of α2β1integrin, we took a gene targeting approach using validated siRNA to knockdown the α2 subunit in HUVEC and HT1080, a cell line that depends on α2β1 as the main collagen I receptor (21Eble J.A.

Immunoblotting of cell lysates revealed almost complete knockdown of the integrin expression in HUVEC (∼5% of control levels) when the cells were transfected with two siRNA constructs each at a concentration of 150 nm targeting different regions of the α2 mRNA (Fig. 3A). Similarly high levels of knockdown were also seen in HT1080 transfected at 50 and 100 nm concentrations (Fig. 3B). The results were confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis that showed an almost complete loss of the α2 signal in the transfected HUVEC and HT1080 as compared with controls (Fig. 3, C and D, respectively). Migration of HUVEC through collagen I was used as a test for functionality because this is a critical process required for angiogenesis in vivo (27Davis G.E. Senger D.R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Knockdown of the α2 subunit caused a profound inhibition of migration, especially at higher dosages (Fig. 3E). The inhibition of HUVEC migration in the cells deficient in α2β1 was equal to that observed by endorepellin treatment, suggesting that this receptor is crucial for migration of endothelial cells. This further stresses the importance of this integrin in the migratory ability of HUVECs in vitro. However, in vivo, the lack of α2β1 integrin (see below) did not delay the process of tumor angiogenesis, a phenomenon that has also been observed in mutant mice lacking other integrins (28Hynes R.O. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Similarly, the HT1080 devoid of the α2β1 integrin showed a ∼75% inhibition of migration, and these levels of inhibition did not appreciably change by progressively increasing endorepellin concentration, in contrast to untreated controls (Fig. 3F). Collectively, these data point to a central role for the α2β1 integrin in regulating the migration of both HUVEC and HT1080 through collagen. Genetic Requirement of α2β1 for Endorepellin-mediated Angiostatic Activity—Next, we conducted in vitro angiogenic assays utilizing lung microvascular endothelial cells isolated from wild-type or mutant animals lacking either the α1 (25Pozzi A.

The genotype of the wild-type and the two genetically engineered mice is shown in Fig. 4A. Wild-type cells showed the highest levels of VEGF-driven migration through collagen I and displayed a complete inhibition of migration when preincubated with endorepellin (Fig. 4B). Under unchallenged experimental conditions, both α1β1-/- and the α2β1-/- endothelial cells showed a reduced migration as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4B). However, α2β1-/- endothelial cells showed a greater decline in migratory ability than the α1β1-/- cells (45% versus 30%). These data are in agreement with siRNA experiments shown above and suggest that the α2β1-/- integrin is a key receptor for VEGF-induced chemotactic migration, a main biological process in angiogenesis (27Davis G.E. Senger D.R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 30Senger D.R. Claffey K.P. Benes J.E. Perruzzi C.A. Sergiou A.P. Detmar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Most importantly, only the wild-type and the α1β1-/- microvascular endothelial cells showed a complete inhibition of migration when preincubated with endorepellin, whereas the α2β1-/- endothelial cells were totally unresponsive (Fig. 4B). These data provide robust genetic evidence that the inhibition of migration caused by endorepellin requires the presence of the α2β1 integrin receptor. Next, we tested the wild-type and mutant endothelial cells in actin disassembly assays (14Bix G. Fu J. Gonzalez E. Macro L. Barker A. Campbell S. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Kim J.K. Höök M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although endothelial cells from wild-type and α1β1-/- mice responded well to endorepellin by showing rapid actin disassembly, the endothelial cells from α2β1-/- mice were totally unresponsive to endorepellin (Fig. 4C). Notably, the same drastic disassembly of stress fibers vis-à-vis their respective controls was elicited by recombinant LG3 (supplemental Fig. S2). These findings corroborate the migration data and further prove that the effects of endorepellin fail to occur in the absence of α2β1 integrin and are not mediated by the α1β1 integrin. Endorepellin Inhibits Tumor Growth and Angiogenesis and Localizes to the Tumor Vasculature Only in the Presence of the α2β1 Integrin Receptor—To prove that endorepellin in vivo activity is mediated by the α2β1 integrin, we utilized a syngeneic animal model in which LLC xenografts were generated in wild-type and α2β1-/- mice with an identical genetic (C57Bl/6) background. After the tumor xenografts became palpable, the animals were randomized and treated with intraperitoneal injections of recombinant endorepellin. Notably, the tumor xenografts growing in the α2β1-/- animals that were treated with endorepellin grew as well as those that were treated with vehicle alone (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the LLC xenografts growing in the wild-type background responded well to systemic endorepellin treatment (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S3). In two additio"

We have now examined the roles of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-dependent gene expression, side chain oxysterol biosynthesis, and cholesterol precursors in the short term regulation of ER cholesterol levels and HMGR activity. We found that SREBP-dependent gene expression is not required for the response to changes in cell cholesterol of either the pool of ER cholesterol or the rate of cholesterol esterification. It was also found that the acute proteolytic inactivation of HMGR triggered by cholesterol loading required the conversion of cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol. High levels of exogenous 24,25-dihydrolanosterol drove the inactivation of HMGR; lanosterol did not. However, purging endogenous 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, lanosterol, and other biosynthetic sterol intermediates by treating cells with NB-598 did not greatly affect either the setting of their ER cholesterol pool or the inactivation of their HMGR. In summary, neither SREBP-regulated genes nor 27-hydroxycholesterol is involved in setting the ER cholesterol pool. On the other hand, 27-hydroxycholesterol, rather than cholesterol itself or biosynthetic precursors of cholesterol, stimulates the rapid inactivation of HMGR in response to high levels of cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W2021938872,"Brain insults are a major cause of acute mortality and chronic morbidity. Given the largely ineffective current therapeutic strategies, the development of new and efficient therapeutic interventions is clearly needed. A series of previous investigations has shown that the noble and anesthetic gas xenon, which has low-affinity antagonistic properties at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, also exhibits potentially neuroprotective properties with no proven adverse side effects. Surprisingly and in contrast with most drugs that are being developed as therapeutic agents, the dose-response neuroprotective effect of xenon has been poorly studied, although this effect could be of major critical importance for its clinical development as a neuroprotectant. Here we show, using ex vivo and in vivo models of excitotoxic insults and transient brain ischemia, that xenon, administered at subanesthetic doses, offers global neuroprotection from reduction of neurotransmitter release induced by ischemia, a critical event known to be involved in excitotoxicity, to reduction of subsequent cell injury and neuronal death. Maximal neuroprotection was obtained with xenon at 50 vol%, a concentration at which xenon further exhibited significant neuroprotective effects in vivo even when administered up to 4 h after intrastriatal NMDA injection and up to at least 2 h after induction of transient brain ischemia."

A number of studies have investigated the factors controlling pluripotency of mouse ES (mES) cells (4Chambers I. Smith A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7150-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Self-renewal of mES cells is sustained by signals mediated by the cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (5Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donaldson D.D. Wong G.G. Moreau J. Stahl M. Rogers D.

However, exposure of cells to serum is also required for LIF-mediated maintenance of self-renewal (11Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Treatment of mES cells with the bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) BMP2 and BMP4 or with growth differentiation factor 6 can substitute for serum. The ability of BMP/growth differentiation factor 6 to promote self-renewal requires co-stimulation with LIF (11Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). BMP induces the expression of inhibitor of differentiation (Id) genes through activation of Smad signaling, and the Id gene products suppress expression of genes involved in the induction of neural differentiation (11Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Thus, BMP suppresses neural differentiation and, in combination with LIF, is sufficient to sustain self-renewal of mES cells without the need for feeder cells or serum factors. Wnt signaling was shown to play a role in the regulation of self-renewal of both mouse and human ES cells independently of LIF/STAT3 signaling (12Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Wnt proteins play roles in the regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, and differentiation and in the maintenance of cell polarity (13Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). The binding of Wnt protein to its cognate receptor, Frizzled, results in the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3. This in turn leads to the stabilization and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and to changes in gene transcription. Signaling by this canonical Wnt pathway has been suggested to result in downstream activation of expression of the homeoprotein Nanog, a transcription factor that is essential for maintenance of the inner cell mass and of ES cell pluripotency (14Chambers I.

The activation of Nanog sustains ES cell self-renewal without the use of feeder cells or treatment with LIF (12Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are ubiquitously present in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface. The HS polysaccharide chains of the proteoglycans are covalently attached to several core proteins (16Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). HS chains are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus by several enzymes, including members of the EXT protein family. The chains consist of repeating disaccharide units of d-glucuronic acid-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine that are modified differentially by epimerization and sulfation (16Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). A large number of physiologically important molecules can bind to specific sulfated regions of HS chains (17Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that HS chains regulate biological functions by interacting with various extracellular signaling molecules, such as members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, Wnt/Wingless (Wg), Hedgehog (Hh), and BMP (18Lin X. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 6009-6021Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, for example, analyses of mutations of the EXT family genes tout-velu (ttv), sister of ttv (sotv), and brother of ttv (botv) have indicated that HS chains are required for signaling and distribution of Hh, Wg, and Decapentaplegic (the functional ortholog of mammalian BMP2 and BMP4) during embryogenesis and wing development (19Bornemann D.J.

Thus, there is evidence that HS chains have essential functions in development, however, it is not yet clear what role HS chains play in the regulation of early embryogenesis and in ES cells. Our current understanding suggests that HS chains may contribute to the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal by regulating the activities of several signaling pathways, such as LIF/STAT3, BMP/Smad, and Wnt/β-catenin. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of HS chains to the regulation of ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency. We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knockdown EXT1, which is required for HS chain elongation. Transfected mES cells grew more slowly than untreated control cells and differentiated into extraembryonic endoderm even in the presence of LIF and serum. This is the first demonstration of the importance of HS chains for the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of mES cells. Cell Culture and TransfectionR1 (27Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R.

We generated siRNA expression plasmids targeting EXT1 and EGFP as negative control by inserting of the corresponding double strand DNAs into the BamHI-HindIII site of pSilencer 3.1-H1 (Ambion). The sequences used for RNAi were designed as described previously (29Ui-Tei K. Naito Y. Takahashi F. Haraguchi T. Ohki-Hamazaki H. Juni A. Ueda R. Saigo K.

For transient knockdown of EXT1 mRNA by RNAi, siRNA expression plasmids for EXT1 were transfected into mES cells as follows. Prior to transfection, the mES cells were harvested, replated at 1 × 106 cells on gelatin-coated feeder-free 60 mm tissue culture dishes (Iwaki) in ES medium with LIF, and incubated for 16 h. On day 1, the cells were transfected with an siRNA expression plasmid (2 μg per culture dish) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). On day 2, the cells were harvested and replated at 3 × 106 cells on gelatin-coated feeder-free 60 mm tissue culture dishes in ES medium with LIF and 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). In general, puromycin selection of transfected cells was carried out for 24 h. On day 3 (2 days after transfection), the cells were harvested and analyzed as described below. For differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs), the cells were transferred on day 3 to low-cell-binding 60 mm dishes (Nunc) and cultured in ES medium without LIF. The numbers of small noncystic EBs and large EBs filled with cystic cavity were counted by microscopic examination. EBs were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 10 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Merck). For morphological observation and real time PCR analysis of differentiation markers, the cells were replated on day 2 and incubated with puromycin for 3 days. For exogenous activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, the cells were treated with 2 μm 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxine (BIO; R&D Systems), a specific pharmacological inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 or 1-methyl-6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxine (MeBIO;R&D Systems), an inactive analog of BIO during transfection and culture. FACS AnalysisTwo days after transfection, mES cells were harvested and the cell suspension was incubated with mouse IgM negative isotype control (Chemicon), anti-HS antibody 10E4 (Seikagaku Corp.) or anti-chondroitin sulfate (CS) antibody 2H6 (Seikagaku Corp.) diluted in FACS buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS). After washing, the cell suspension was incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) diluted in FACS buffer. Cell sorting and analysis were performed using a FACSAria Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences). High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis of Unsaturated DisaccharidesTwo days after transfection, mES cells were harvested and fluorometric post-column HPLC analysis of unsaturated disaccharides from HS chains was performed as reported previously (30Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Molecular Size Analysis of HS ChainsOne day after transfection, mES cells were harvested, replated at 1.5 × 106 cells per well in 6-well 0.2% gelatin-coated plates and incubated in sulfate-free ES medium with LIF, puromycin and 100 μCi/ml Na235SO4 (ARC). After labeling for 24 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then treated with 1 mg/ml trypsin (WAKO) for 10 min at 37 °C. The trypsin was neutralized with 2 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation, the supernatants were treated with 0.5 m NaOH at 4 °C overnight and neutralized with 1 m acetic acid. The labeled galactosaminoglycans were eliminated by chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Corp.) digestion, desalted in a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) and resistant HS chains were isolated by anion exchange chromatography on HiTrap DEAE FF (GE Healthcare) using sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1.0 m NaCl as the eluent. The sizes of the purified HS chains were analyzed by gel chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column (GE Healthcare) (1 × 44 cm) and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 m NaCl. Fractions (1 ml/fraction) were collected and analyzed for radioactivity using a scintillation counter. The purity of the labeled HS was determined by sensitivity to enzyme digestion with 5 milliunits of heparitinase I and II (Seikagaku Corp.) and heparinase (Seikagaku Corp.). Estimations of molecular mass values were derived from fractionation of several Dextran molecular size markers (Sigma) by gel chromatography and staining with orsinol solution. Proliferation AssayTwo days after transfection, mES cells were harvested and replated in triplicate at 0.8 × 104 cells per well in 96-well 0.2% gelatin-coated plates in ES medium with LIF. Cell counting kit-8 (Dojindo) was added after 0 h, 24 h or 48 h and incubated further for 2 h. The soluble formazan product was measured at 450 nm. Self-renewal AssayTwo days after transfection, mES cells were harvested and replated at 1 × 104 cells per gelatin coated 60 mm tissue culture dish in ES medium with LIF. For detection of undifferentiated cells, cells were fixed and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-nitro blue tetrazolium (Nacalai Tesque) 5 days after replating. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) positive colonies were counted by microscopic examination. Colonies of tightly packed and flattened AP-positive cells were counted as undifferentiated, and colonies of mixtures of unstained and stained cells and entirely unstained cells with flattened irregular morphology were considered differentiated. ImmunoblottingTwo days after transfection, the culture solution for the mES cells was replaced with serum-free ES medium without LIF for 4 h and the cells were stimulated for 20 min with one of the following: 15% FBS, 1000 units/ml LIF, 10 ng/ml BMP4 (R&D Systems), 40 ng/ml basic FGF (Upstate Biotechnology) or 15% FBS plus 1000 units/ml LIF. For depletion of HS chains, mES cells were incubated with 5 milliunits of heparitinase I and II and heparinase for 2 h before extrinsic stimulation. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, protease inhibitors). To isolate nuclear extracts, cells were first suspended in 100 μl of buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors). After incubation for 15 min on ice, 12.5 μl of 5% Nonidet P-40 was added, the suspension was vortexed for 10 s, and incubated for a further 5 min on ice. The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 s. The supernatant was removed and the pellets, comprising the nuclear extracts, were washed with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2). The purity of the cell fractionation (cytosol and nucleus) was confirmed in Western blot analysis using an anti-Yes monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) and an anti-Lamin B1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); these antibodies are specific for the cytosol and nucleus, respectively. Only low levels of cross-contamination were observed (<1%). Ten micrograms of cell lysates or nuclear extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with antibodies to STAT3 (BD Biosciences), phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr-705 BD Biosciences), ERK-1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated ERK-1/2 (Thr-183 and Thr-185; Sigma), Akt (BD Biosciences), phosphorylated Akt (Ser-472 and Ser-473; BD Biosciences), phosphorylated Smad1 (Ser-463 and Ser-465; Cell Signaling Technology), Yes (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phosphorylated Src family (Tyr-416; Cell Signaling Technology), β-actin (Sigma), β-catenin (Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated β-catenin (Ser-33/37/Thr41; Cell Signaling Technology), Lamin B1, Oct3/4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Nanog (ReproCELL). The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). After washing, the membranes were developed with ECL Plus reagents (GE Healthcare). For detection of phosphorylated Yes, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, protease inhibitors) and immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-Yes monoclonal antibody and protein G Magnetic Beads (New England Biolabs); this approach was adopted as this is the only commercially available anti-phosphorylated Src family antibody that cross-reacts with phosphorylated Yes. Luciferase Reporter Assay and ImmunostainingTransactivation of β-catenin on T-cell-specific factor (Tcf) was determined with a luciferase reporter assay. siRNA expression plasmid (2 μg) was cotransfected with reporter plasmid such as, TOPFLASH (2 μg, containing three Tcf binding sites, Upstate Biotechnology) or FOPFLASH (2 μg, containing inactive Tcf binding sites, Upstate Biotechnology) and pCH110 (0.2 μg, containing β-galactosidase, GE Healthcare) as control of transfection efficiency using Lipofectamine 2000 as described above. Cell lysates were prepared 3 days after transfection and luciferase activity was measured with Dual-Light® System (Applied Biosystems). Luminescence was measured with a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by β-galactosidase activity. Relative luciferase activity is defined as the ratio of luciferase activity of TOPFLASH to that of FOPFLASH. For immunostaining of β-catenin, mES cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin 3 days after transfection. After washing and subsequent blocking, cells were stained with an anti-β-catenin antibody. After washing, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon) and counterstained with propidium iodide (BD Biosciences). Immunofluorescence images were taken using an LSM5Pascal confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) with ×40/1.3 objectives at room temperature. 125I-Labeled Wnt3a Binding AssayTwo micrograms of recombinant mouse Wnt3a (R&D Systems) were iodinated with 100 μCi of 125I-sodium (ARC) using iodogen-precoated reaction tubes (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. Radiolabeled Wnt3a was separated from unincorporated 125I-sodium on a PD-10 column. The specific activity of the radiolabeled Wnt3a was 1.85 × 104 cpm/ng protein. For the binding assay, mES cells were harvested 2 days after transfection and replated in triplicate at 5 × 105 cells per well in 24-well 0.2% gelatin-coated plates. The cells were allowed to attach for 3 h and then washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer (serum-free ES medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.1% sodium azide). After incubating with 80 ng/ml 125I-labeled Wnt3a either alone or in the presence of 100 μg/ml heparin (Sigma) in binding buffer for 3 h at 4 °C, the cells were gently washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer and lysed with 0.2 n NaOH. The amount of radiolabeling in each extract was counted with a gamma counter (Aloka). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) AnalysisHeparin (Nacalai Tesque) was dialyzed against distilled water using an MWCO3500 membrane (SpectroPore) and lyophilized. Then the heparin was conjugated with a monovalent linker molecule to prepare the ligand conjugate for the immobilization of heparin on the gold-coated chip as previously described (31Suda Y. Arano A. Fukui Y. Koshida S. Wakao M. Nishimura T. Kusumoto S. Sobel M. Bioconjug. Chem. 2006; 17: 1125-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The surface of the gold-coated chip (SUDx-Biotec) was oxidatively washed with UV ozone cleaner (Structure Probe Inc.) for 20 min. The chips were then immersed in 1 μm of the ligand-conjugate in 50% (v/v) methanol solution overnight at room temperature with gentle agitation to prepare Sugar Chips with immobilized heparin. The Sugar Chips were washed sequentially with water, PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and water, and dried at room temperature. The Sugar Chip with immobilized heparin was set on a prism with refraction oil (nD = 1.518, Cargill Laboratories Inc.) in an SPR apparatus (SPR670M, Moritex). The SPR measurements were performed at room temperature in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and using Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA as the running buffer at a flow rate of 15 μl/min. The kinetic binding parameters were calculated using the software of the manufacturer. We performed binding of BSA or von Willebrand factor (vWF) A1 to heparin, as negative and positive controls, respectively (supplemental data 1) (apparent association and dissociation rate constants ka (m-1 s-1) and kd (s-1) of vWF A1, 3.51 × 103, 4.38 × 10-3, respectively; apparent equilibrium constant KD (nm) for binding of vWF A1 to heparin, 1248.1). RT-PCR and Real Time PCRTotal RNA was isolated from mES cells by TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and subsequently reverse transcribed using an oligo-dT primer (Invitrogen) and a SuperscriptII first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Primer sets for PCR amplification are listed insupplemental data 2. All cDNAs were amplified in quantitative ranges, which were confirmed by examining various cycles for the samples giving maximum levels of signals in each primer sets. Primers sets and probes for real time PCR are listed insupplemental data 3. Real time PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM® 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The relative amounts of each mRNA were normalized by β-actin mRNA in the same cDNA. HS Chains Are Reduced by Knockdown of EXT1 mRNAHereditary multiple exostosis is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of benign cartilage-capped tumors at the juxta-epiphyseal regions of long bones (32Wicklund C.L.

It is associated with mutation of either EXT1 or EXT2, which encode glycosyltransferases possessing both d-glucuronic acid and GlcNAc-transferase activities that are necessary for HS chain elongation (33Lind T.

Previous work by our group has shown that fluid flow stimulates important functional changes in cells through protein expression regulation. Peroxiredoxins (PRX) are a family of antioxidant enzymes but have yet to be investigated in response to shear stress. Studies have shown that oscillatory shear stress (OS) increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in endothelial cells, whereas laminar shear stress (LS) blocks this response. We hypothesized that PRX are responsible for the anti-oxidative effect of LS. To test this hypothesis, bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were subjected to LS (15 dyn/cm2), OS (±5 dyn/cm2, 1 Hz), or static conditions for 24 h. Using Western blot and immunofluorescence staining, all six isoforms of PRX were identified in BAEC. When compared with OS and static, exposure to chronic LS up-regulated PRX 1 levels intracellularly. LS also increased expression of PRX 5 relative to static controls, but not OS. PRX exhibited broad subcellular localization, with distribution in the cytoplasm, Golgi, mitochondria, and intermediate filaments. In addition, PRX 1 knock down, using specific small interference RNA, attenuated LS-dependent reactive oxygen species reduction in BAEC. However, PRX 5 depletion did not. Together, these results suggest that PRX 1 is a novel mechanosensitive antioxidant, playing an important role in shear-dependent regulation of endothelial biology and atherosclerosis.

In vitro studies have established that OS is a potent stimulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in endothelial cells, and quantitative measurements by our group showed a significant increase in both OS-dependent superoxide (O2·¯) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production (9Harrison D.

Antioxidant defense systems are critical to the protection of cellular macromolecules. They work to maintain a reductive cytosolic environment using both catalytic and non-enzymatic processes (13Mates J.M. Perez-Gomez C. De Castro I.N. Clin. Biochem. 1999; 32: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been hypothesized that antioxidants are likely to regulate intracellular hydrogen peroxide in a localized manner. Production of H2O2 occurs where needed for intracellular signaling, while hydrogen peroxide molecules diffusing away from the site of action are destroyed (14Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Recently, a new group of ubiquitous antioxidant proteins has been acknowledged in yeast, plant, and animal cells. The peroxiredoxins (PRX) are thiol specific-, non-selenium-containing enzymes that use redox-active cysteines to reduce peroxides and eliminate ONOO2·¯. They are produced at high levels in the cell, having been reported to comprise 0.1-1% of soluble protein in mammalian cells (15Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). Based on conserved cysteine residues, six isoforms of peroxiredoxins (PRX 1-6) have been identified in mammalian systems, and a variety of investigations have described their functional roles in vascular remodeling, cancer, and pulmonary and neurodegenerative diseases (16Kinnula V.L.

Kang S.W. Nature. 2005; 435: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, no study has yet explored the role of shear stress on PRX regulation in endothelial cells. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that shear stress alters PRX function by regulating protein expression and localization, which in turn affect the redox status of endothelial cells. Our studies show that all six forms of PRX are abundantly expressed in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and that atheroprotective LS increased intracellular PRX 1 levels compared with atherogenic OS. In addition, PRX 1 knockdown experiments implicated PRX 1, but not PRX 5, as an important regulator of shear-dependent cellular redox state. Endothelial Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells were obtained from Cell Applications Inc. Cells were maintained in a standard humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), heparin sodium (American Pharmaceutical Partners), endothelial cell growth supplement (isolated by us), and minimum non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). BAEC from passage 8-15 were used in the following experimental protocols. Shear Stress Studies—BAEC were grown to confluent monolayers in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) and were subsequently exposed to static (ST) culture conditions or arterial levels of shear stress via cone-and-plate shear apparatus. Atheroprotective LS at 15 dynes/cm2 was simulated by rotating a Teflon cone (0.5° cone angle) unidirectionally in medium as previously described by us (20Go Y.M. Boo Y.C. Park H. Maland M.C. Patel R. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Darley-Usmar V. Jo H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1574-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To mimic unstable atherogenic OS, the cone was rotated bidirectionally in medium using a stepping motor (Servo Motor) and computer program (DC Motor Company). Endothelial cells were exposed to OS at ±5 dynes/cm2 with directional changes of flow at 1 Hz frequency (7Sorescu G.P. Sykes M. Weiss D. Platt M.O. Saha A. Hwang J. Boyd N. Boo Y.C. Vega J.D. Taylor W.R. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31128-31135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). All shear stress studies were performed in low serum (0.5% fetal bovine serum) growth medium for 24 h. Preparation of Whole Cell Lysate—Following experimental treatment, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% SDS). The lysate was further homogenized by sonication. The protein content of each sample was determined by Bio-Rad DC assay. Immunoblotting—Aliquots of cell lysate (20-40 μg of protein each) were resolved by size on 12.5 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Protein expression was detected by a chemiluminescence method, and the intensities of immunoreactive bands were determined via densitometry using the NIH Image program (21Boo Y.C. Sorescu G. Boyd N. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Du J. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3388-3396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies specific for PRX 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Lab Frontier), phospho-endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (Ser1177) (Cell Signaling Technology), total endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (BD Biosciences), and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Immunocytochemistry—Following shear stress exposure or static culture, BAEC in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. Primary antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin was applied overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were labeled with Hoechst stain in 3% bovine serum albumin for 15 min at room temperature. To identify mitochondria, cells were incubated with 100 nm Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) in growth medium for 15 min at 37 °C prior to fixation. All cells were mounted using the Prolong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes), and fluorescence images were collected via confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). Primary antibodies specific for PRX 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Lab Frontier), the Golgi marker GM 130 (Transduction Laboratories), and the intermediate filament marker vimentin (Sigma) were used. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Annealed siRNA duplexes and Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) transfection agent were applied to BAEC for 48-72 h according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Control non-silencing siRNA (sense, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt; antisense, 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAtt) (Qiagen), Alexa Fluor 546-labeled control non-silencing siRNA (Qiagen), bovine PRX 1 siRNA (sense, 5′-GUGCUUCUGUGGAUUCUCAtt; antisense: 5′-PhoUGAGAAUCCACAGAAGCACtt) (MWG), and bovine PRX 5 siRNA (sense, 5′-GUGGCAUGUCUGACCGUUAtt; antisense, 5′-PhoUAACGGUCAGACAUGCCACtt) (MWG) were used. Hydrogen Peroxide Detection—Using a horseradish peroxidase-linked Amplex Red fluorescence assay, intracellular hydrogen peroxide production was measured via extracellular leakage of H2O2 from conditioned BAEC as previously described (12McNally J.S. Davis M.E. Giddens D.P. Saha A. Hwang J. Dikalov S. Jo H. Harrison D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H2290-H2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were exposed to either static culture conditions or shear stress in low serum culture medium. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer and incubated with 5 μm Amplex UltraRed (Molecular Probes) and 0.1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase type II (Sigma-Aldrich) in Krebs-Ringer phosphate for 40 min. To identify the hydrogen peroxide-specific signal, control samples were coincubated with 500 units/ml catalase. Triplicate readings were taken in a 96-well plate using 100-μl samples of medium, and fluorescence was detected via plate reader at excitation and emission of 530 and 580 nm, respectively. Hydrogen peroxide levels were calculated in terms of catalase-inhibitable signal and were normalized to cellular protein as measured by the Bio-Rad DC assay. H2O2 concentrations were estimated using a standard curve. Statistical Analysis—For all quantitative data collected, statistical analysis was assessed by Student's t test using the Microcal Origin statistical package. A significant difference between control and treatment groups was defined as p < 0.05 for three or more independent experiments. LS Up-regulates PRX 1 Expression in Cell Lysates—Our previous work established that fluid shear stress critically affects endothelial cell function by regulating protein expression patterns. The PRX family is undeniably significant to cellular physiology and pathology but remains understudied in the fluid flow field. This led us to investigate whether shear stress regulates the intracellular expression of mammalian PRX in BAEC. To this end, total BAEC lysates were collected after 24 h of static culture, LS (15dynes/cm2), or OS (±5dynes/cm2) and analyzed by Western blot using PRX-specific antibodies. In these studies, ST, cells cultured under no shear stress, were used as a control for the shear system. As previously described, physiologically “normal” arterial endothelial cells are not exposed to chronic static conditions but, rather, experience continuous fluid flow. Therefore, LS is a more relevant control, representing a healthy state, which we will compare with OS, the disease state. With this in mind, all six PRX were detected in BAEC, and densitometric analysis indicated the level of PRX 1 was significantly increased by LS compared with OS and static controls. In addition, PRX 5 expression was significantly increased by LS with respect to static conditions but was not statistically different from OS (Fig. 1). Endothelial cell alignment and phosphorylated endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and total endothelial nitric-oxide synthase were included as internal controls. These findings suggest that PRX 1 is mechanosensitive and likely to play an important role in shear-dependent cell biology. PRX Exist in Various Subcellular Locations throughout BAEC—Via Western blots, we have thus far found that shear stress regulates PRX 1 and 5 expression in BAEC. Based on the large number of PRX family members, we hypothesized that individual PRX likely play important roles in specific subcellular compartments. To investigate the intracellular distribution of PRX, confocal immunofluorescence staining studies were performed. This study revealed data consistent with Western blot analysis of shear-induced protein expression in BAEC. Image analysis of staining intensities indicated that PRX 1 increased after 24 h of LS compared with OS and static conditions (Fig. 2A). In addition to the shear dependence, Fig. 2 also shows that PRX members exhibited assorted staining patterns. This result raised two interesting questions: 1) Are PRX located in specific subcellular locations and 2) does shear stress alter this subcellular localization? To clearly characterize the location of each PRX within specific subcellular compartments, colocalization staining was performed in static BAEC using PRX-specific antibodies and organelle-specific markers for Golgi (GM 130), endoplasmic reticulum (KDEL receptor, data not shown), lysosome (cathepsin S, data not shown), intermediate filament (vimentin), and mitochondria (Mitotracker). PRX 1 staining (green) overlapped with the Golgi marker staining (red), shown as yellow in the merged image (Fig. 3A), suggesting that PRX 1 exists in the Golgi apparatus. In addition, PRX 2, 4, 5, and 6 also appeared to be found in the Golgi (Fig. 3, B and E-G). The PRX 3 staining pattern was distinctly different from other PRX, showing clear colocalization with the mitochondria marker (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, PRX 2 staining revealed colocalization with the intermediate filament marker (Fig. 3C). In addition to these subcellular localizations, PRX 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 were also expressed in the cytosol (Fig. 3, A-C and E-G). Next, we examined whether shear stress stimulated expression of PRX members in other subcellular locations. Subcellular location did not appear to change in response to shear stress, although Golgi were located upstream of the direction of flow after chronic LS, consistent with previous reports (Fig. 2, A, B, and D-F). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that PRX are abundantly expressed throughout the subcellular organelles of endothelial cells. PRX 1 Prevents Oxidative Stress in Endothelial Cells Exposed to LS—PRX 1 is a prominent antioxidant, and our data indicate its expression is highly up-regulated by LS (22Immenschuh S. Baumgart-Vogt E. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 768-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Consequently, we investigated whether PRX 1 was responsible for the decreased ROS levels in endothelial cells exposed to LS. The depletion of individual PRX from cellular systems provides a useful tool to study the functional role of each PRX isoform. Here, specific siRNAs were used to knock down either PRX 1 or PRX 5 protein levels in order to investigate PRX-dependent ROS accumulation. Western blots with isoform-specific PRX antibodies were used to determine the efficacy and specificity of these siRNAs. Compared with non-silencing siRNA and Alexa Fluor 546-labeled non-silencing siRNA (50 nm each), 48 h of treatment of BAEC with PRX 1 siRNA dramatically reduced (by 75% of non-silencing control) expression of PRX 1 at a concentration as low as 10 nm (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, 10 nm PRX 5 siRNA also effectively reduced PRX 5 expression (by 90% of non-silencing control). Via Western blots, the specificity of PRX 1 and 5 siRNAs was assessed by examining the expression of all other PRX family members (Fig. 4, A and B). Using isoform-specific PRX antibodies, we found that these siRNAs had no significant effect on other PRX, indicating that they exclusively targeted PRX 1 or 5, respectively, among all PRX family members (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, PRX 1 and 5 siRNAs were confidently used at 10 nm concentration in subsequent functional studies. It has been well established that chronic exposure of endothelial cells to OS stimulates, while LS inhibits, ROS production (10Hwang J. Saha A. Boo Y.C. Sorescu G.P. McNally J.S. Holland S.M.

Hsiai T.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Utilizing an Amplex Red assay in the presence or absence of catalase, we verified that hydrogen peroxide levels were 87% less in BAEC exposed to LS compared with those treated with OS (Fig. 5A). Using a standard hydrogen peroxide dose curve, we also found that the relative hydrogen peroxide levels following static culture, LS, and OS were consistent with expected cellular concentrations (Fig. 5B). To determine whether PRX 1 was responsible for the LS-dependent decrease in ROS levels in BAEC, we knocked down PRX 1 using PRX 1 siRNA as indicated above (Fig. 4A). PRX 1 depletion significantly increased catalase-inhibitable hydrogen peroxide by 2-fold above non-silencing controls in static-, LS-, and OS-treated BAEC (Fig. 5C). To investigate whether this was a global effect of mechanosensitive PRX family members, we also knocked down PRX 5 using PRX 5-specific siRNA. However, when compared with non-silencing controls, PRX 5 depletion had no significant effect on hydrogen peroxide levels in any group. Taken together, these data suggest that PRX 1 is a critically important regulator of ROS levels in both a basal and shear-dependent manner. Through protein expression analysis and subsequent functional studies, we have discovered PRX 1 as a mechanosensitive antioxidant. Data to support this concept include: 1) PRX 1 is up-regulated intracellularly by chronic LS compared with OS, 2) PRX exhibit broad staining patterns in BAEC and localize in important cellular structures, 3) ROS production is significantly reduced in cells exposed to chronic LS, and 4) this effect can be attenuated by PRX 1 depletion, but not PRX 5 depletion. Through this work, we reveal for the first time that PRX are regulated by shear stress in endothelial cells. Previous studies have shown that other antioxidants are also controlled by shear stress. LS has been shown to up-regulate antioxidant genes, including endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, CuZn superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, and thioredoxin (25Topper J.N.

In addition, Chen et al. (30Chen X.L. Varner S.E. Rao A.S. Grey J.Y. Thomas S. Cook C.K. Wasserman M.A. Medford R.M. Jaiswal A.K. Kunsch C. J. Biol.

They have also noted that such genes are regulated through a conserved, shear-sensitive antioxidant response element. In support of our finding that PRX 1 expression is LS-dependent, recent work has shown that PRX 1 is a target gene of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key transcription factor that binds to antioxidant response element (31Kim Y.-J. Ahn J.-Y. Liang P. Ip C. Zhang Y. Park Y.-M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies indicate that cells possess an elaborate system of shear-responsive antioxidants and that each may play an independent role to mediate oxidative stress and modulate redox-sensitive signaling pathways. The ubiquitous nature of the PRX family itself exemplifies this concept. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed PRX throughout the cellular milieu of BAEC, colocalizing with the cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and intermediate filaments. These observations were consistent with previously reported localization studies in other cell types, but we are the first to report an apparent PRX 2 colocalization with vimentin (32Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 33Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). This costaining of PRX 2 with vimentin suggests that it may be located in the intermediate filament, but further studies will be necessary to confirm this finding. Although detection of PRX in the Golgi body likely reflects protein processing or packaging, localization within other organelles indicates that PRX may act both globally and in a site-specific manner to regulate ROS in endothelial cells. In the endothelium, ROS, such as O2·¯ and H2O2, arise from several sources, including NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, mitochondrial oxidase, cytochrome P450, and uncoupled nitric-oxide synthase (34Suzuki Y. Wang W. Vu T.H. Raffin T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Weber C. Erl W. Pietsch A. Strobel M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Weber P.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At relatively low concentrations, ROS play critical roles in redox signaling and normal cell function. However, higher concentrations of ROS induce oxidative damage of DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids (36Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 37Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

This damage has been shown to critically affect cellular function and apoptosis when it occurs in mitochondria, lysosomes, and nuclei (39Terman A. Gustafson B. Brunk U.T. J.

In addition, cytosolic proteins modified by ROS have been shown to affect local cell signaling and, collectively, the redox status of the cell (11Sorescu G.P. Song H. Tressel S.L. Hwang J. Dikalov S.

Ubiquitous distribution of PRX in BAEC may reflect diverse sources of ROS throughout the cells and provide protection for important macromolecules and structures against local ROS production. In addition, widespread allocation of PRX may be important for comprehensive management of the overall oxidative state of cells. Several studies have shown that oxidative stress is regulated by shear stress in endothelial cells (10Hwang J. Saha A. Boo Y.C. Sorescu G.P. McNally J.S. Holland S.M. Dikalov S. Giddens D.P.

We have previously published that both LS and OS stimulate ROS production acutely but the ROS transiently elevated by LS returns to basal levels within a few hours (10Hwang J. Saha A. Boo Y.C.

However, unlike LS, OS continues to increase ROS production, maintaining elevated levels as long as cells are exposed to OS (10Hwang J. Saha A. Boo Y.C. Sorescu G.P. McNally J.S. Holland S.M.

This study demonstrates that endothelial cells exposed to chronic LS express much more PRX 1 compared with OS and static conditions. These findings suggest that PRX 1 is up-regulated by LS and that this may be responsible for LS-mediated decrease in ROS levels. As previously determined by electron spin resonance spectrometry and dichlorofluorescein-diacetate methods, endothelial cells exposed to OS produce significantly more superoxide and hydrogen peroxide than those in static culture (10Hwang J.

Here, we used Amplex Red assay as an independent method to measure ROS levels in BAEC. Consistent with our previous reports, OS increased and LS decreased ROS production (Fig. 5A). The ROS measured by this assay was inhibitable by catalase, indicating that H2O2 is the primary ROS component. PRX 1 is the most abundant and ubiquitously distributed member of mammalian PRX (22Immenschuh S. Baumgart-Vogt E. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 768-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Our current study demonstrated that PRX 1 is dramatically up-regulated by chronic LS compared with OS and is located in the cytoplasm and Golgi. Knock down of PRX 1 using siRNA resulted in significantly higher ROS levels in BAEC exposed to LS, OS, and static conditions, whereas PRX 5 depletion did not. Although PRX 1 knock down did not fully abolish the antioxidative outcome of LS, its significant effect was somewhat surprising considering the presence of other PRX family members and additional mechanosensitive antioxidant pathways. In addition, PRX 5 depletion studies provide further evidence that PRX 1 is crucial to shear-dependent ROS regulation. Altogether, these results indicate that chronic exposure to LS up-regulates PRX 1 expression in order to keep ROS levels low in endothelial cells. In summary, we have shown that shear stress regulates expression of the PRX family and that PRX 1 plays a critical role in regulating ROS levels in endothelial cells. Furthermore, this discovery of PRX 1 as a mechanosensitive antioxidant may contribute important insights into endothelial cell biology and vascular diseases.

The generation of a polarized epithelium depends on the establishment of cell-cell contacts that induce the formation of the adherens junctions followed by assembly of the tight junctions (1Farquhar M.G.

Biol. 2006; 22: 207-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Adherens junctions mechanically link adjacent cells, whereas tight junctions seal intercellular contacts and limit paracellular movement of fluid and solutes. These tight junctions can vary in tightness in different organs and even in different parts of the same organ. For example, renal epithelia are less permeable than intestine epithelia and the renal collecting duct is less permeable than the proximal tubule (3Turner J.R. Am. J.

Several membrane-inserted proteins which are involved in formation and maintenance of intercellular junctions have been identified. Occludin, JAM-1 and claudins are cell adhesion molecules of the tight junctions (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 2Shin K.

It is a heterodimer with an α subunit and a glycosylated β subunit. The former subunit contains the catalytic site, whereas the latter subunit is necessary for normal pump maturation and trafficking (13Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J.

This enzyme generates ion gradients important for the regulation of cell osmolality, membrane potential, cell volume, intracellular pH, and intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Further, by producing a transmembrane Na+ gradient, this pump drives vectorial transport of a number of solutes across epithelia. Finally, it plays a role in intracellular signaling by a mechanism which is independent of ion transport, but similar to ion transport by this pump is sensitive to ouabain (17Pierre S.V. Xie Z. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 46: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An additional role for this enzyme, also independent of its ion-pumping function, is to facilitate adhesion between adjoining cells of various epithelia. Indeed, the β2 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase was first described as an adhesion protein in glial cells (AMOG) in the rat brain (12Gloor S. Antonicek H. Sweadner K.J. Pagliusi S. Frank R. Moos M.

Recent studies indicate that as the mature monolayer develops, the degree of N-glycosylation of adhesion molecules is altered. The complexity of N-glycans linked to E-cadherin is decreased in densely populated MDCK cell cultures when compared with sparsely populated MDCK cell cultures (20Liwosz A. Lei T. Kukuruzinska M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23138-23149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, the relative molecular weight of N-glycans linked to the N-cadherin decreases as nonconfluent RPE cells become confluent (21Youn Y.H. Hong J. Burke J.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Also, during development of cell-cell adhesion of epithelial GE11 cells, GnT 2The abbreviations used are: GnTN-acetylglucosamine-glycosyltransferaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumYFPyellow fluorescent proteinFBSfetal bovine serumPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidYFP-β1the fusion protein between the yellow fluorescent protein and the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunitPBSphosphate-buffered salineRTreverse transcription. -III, the enzyme that stops branching of N-glycans is up-regulated (22Iijima J.

These data suggest that changes in the structure of the N-glycans linked to adhesion molecules might be expected to affect intercellular adhesion. Because N-glycans linked to the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit are required for the initial steps of formation of intercellular contacts (11Vagin O. Tokhtaeva E. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39573-39587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is possible that complexity of N-glycans of this subunit also changes with development of cell-cell junctions and a specific N-glycan structure is necessary for normal cell to cell adhesion. To examine these issues, we altered the extent of N-glycan branching either by exposure of MDCK cells in culture to swainsonine, an inhibitor of N-glycan branching, or by post-transcriptional silencing the gene encoding GnT-III, a critical N-glycan stop-branching enzyme, using RNA interference and assessed the impact of these perturbations on cell-cell adhesion. The results of these studies demonstrate that prevention of N-glycan branching by swainsonine tightens and stabilizes cell-cell junctions. Conversely, increased N-glycan branching due to partial silencing of the gene encoding GnT-III, loosens cell-cell contacts. Consistent with these observations, the normal development of cell-cell adhesion is associated with reduced complexity of N-glycans of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit and other adhesion proteins. These changes correlate with increased expression of GnT-III, the enzyme that reduces branching, and decreased expression of GnT-IVC and GnT-V, enzymes that promote branching. These results suggest tightness of cell junctions can be modulated through modification of N-glycans. The tightening and stabilizing effects of swainsonine are attenuated in a cell line expressing the unglycosylated mutant of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit; findings indicating that the structure of the N-glycans linked to this subunit is important for normal cell-cell adhesion. Construction of MDCK Stable Cell Lines—Stable cell lines expressing a fusion protein with YFP linked to the N terminus of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit (YFP-β1) and mutated YFP-β1 fusion protein lacking three N-glycosylation sites (N123) were obtained as described previously (11Vagin O. Tokhtaeva E. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39573-39587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Vagin O. Turdikulova S. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43159-43167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Non-transfected MDCK cells and cells expressing YFP-β1 and N123 were grown in Corning Costar polyester transwell inserts (Corning Inc.) in 6-well plates in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Cellgro). Primary Antibodies—The following monoclonal antibodies were used for Western blot analysis: against E-cadherin (Alexis Biochemicals), against the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit, clone M17-P5-F11 (Affinity Bioreagents), against GFP, clones 7.1 and 13.1, that also recognized YFP (Roche Applied Sciences), against β1-integrin (BD Transduction Laboratories), and against the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (Novus Biologicals, Inc). Also, a polyclonal antibody against polycystin-2 (Chemicon International) was used. Cell Culture—Cells were grown in DMEM (Cellgro Mediatech) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, 8 mg/liter phenol red, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS unless specified otherwise. Isolation of Basolateral or Total Plasma Membrane Proteins of MDCK Cells using Surface-specific Biotinylation—Cells were maintained for 6 days after becoming confluent in transwell inserts. Biotinylation of surface proteins was performed according to previously described procedures (24Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kroepfl J.F. Gardinier M.V. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were biotinylated with EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) that was added either into the well only (basolateral surface of the tight cell monolayers) or into both insert and well (total surface of the dispersed cells). After quenching the biotinylation reaction, cells were washed and then lysed by incubation with 200 μl of 0.15 m NaCl in 15 mm Tris pH 8.0 with 1% Triton X-100 and 4 mm EGTA. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C. To isolate surface-biotinylated proteins, the cell extract was incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) in a total volume of 1 ml of 0.15 m NaCl in 15 mm Tris, pH 8.0 with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 4 mm EGTA at 4 °C with continuous rotation for 60 min. The bead-adherent complexes were washed three times on the beads, and then proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol in 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8) for 5 min at 80 °C. Preparation of Crude Microsomal Membranes from Kidney and Intestine—Rabbit kidney and small intestine were homogenized with a tight Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, Millwille, NY). The homogenate was collected, layered onto a 42% sucrose solution, and spun in a Beckman SW28 swinging bucket rotor at 25,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The fraction at the interface of buffer/sucrose was collected and diluted to a total volume of 15 ml in buffer A. This membrane-enriched fraction was collected by centrifugation in a Beckman 75Ti rotor (35,000 rpm, 4 °C, 1 h). The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm PIPES/TRIS buffer containing 2 mm EGTA and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 by homogenization with a 2 ml of Teflon homogenizer (Wheaton). Protein concentration was determined by the modified Lowry protein Assay reagent (Pierce). The typical protein concentration was 5-10 μg/μl. The membranes were aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopic images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope and LSM 510 software, version 3.2. Western Blot Analysis of the Total and Plasma Membrane Resident Proteins of MDCK Cells and Microsomal Membranes from Kidney and Small Intestine—To equalize the amounts of proteins in cell extracts, the confluent cells from one well insert and the dispersed cells from three well inserts were collected in 200 μl of the lysis buffer. Samples containing 20 μl of the MDCK cell extract mixed with 15 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, or 1 μg of microsomal membrane proteins in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, or biotinylated proteins eluted from the agarose-streptavidin beads were loaded onto 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using MES/SDS running buffer (0.05 m MES, 0.05 m Tris base, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA free acid, pH 7.3), transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and detected by Western blot analysis using the appropriate primary antibody and the anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-rat IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega) as a secondary antibody. Alkaline phosphatase was detected using nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate in alkaline phosphatase buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0). Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry using Kodak 1D 3.6 software. Analysis of N-glycans of the E-cadherin and the Na,K-ATPase β1 Subunit using Endoglycosidases—MDCK cells, either dispersed or organized into tight monolayers, were biotinylated as described above. The biotinylated proteins adherent to agarose-streptavidin beads obtained from a single well insert (tight monolayers) or three well inserts (dispersed cells) were treated with the following glycosidases: 30 milliunits/ml EndoH (Prozyme) or 30,000 units/ml PNGase F (New England Biolabs). The reaction mixtures containing bead-adherent biotinylated proteins of MDCK cells, the appropriate buffers and detergents in the total volume of 50 μl were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then the reaction mixtures were diluted with 30 μl of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated for 5 min at 80 °C. The aliquots were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels followed by Western blot analysis using the appropriate antibodies. Treatment of MDCK Cells by Tunicamycin, Swainsonine, and Sialidase—The MDCK cell monolayers, grown on the transwell inserts for 4 days after the cells became confluent, were incubated with 1 μg/ml tunicamycin C2 homolog (Sigma) for 48 h, or 2 μg/μl swainsonine (Sigma) for 48 h, or 5 units/μl sialidase (Prozyme) for 18 h. Paracellular Permeability of Cell Monolayers—MDCK cell monolayers grown on transwell porous inserts were incubated in DMEM without phenol red and without FBS (Cellgro Mediatech) that was added into the well (lower chamber) and insert (upper chamber). ™he fluorescent membrane-impermeable dye, BCECF free acid (10 μm), was added into the lower chamber. Accumulation of the dye in the upper chamber was determined by taking 50-μl aliquots, diluting them in 3 ml of PBS, pH 7.2 and measuring the fluorescence intensity every 30 min during cell incubation at room temperature for 2 h. Accumulation of BCECF in the upper chamber reflects paracellular flux of the dye through the monolayer since this dye is membrane-impermeable and, therefore, can penetrate the monolayer only between the cells. The slope of the linear regression of the fluorescence intensity plotted versus time was used as a measure of the paracellular permeability. Typically, the paracellular permeability of the tight monolayer is about 100-fold less than the paracellular permeability of subconfluent cells or cells incubated in Ca2+-free buffer where cell junctions are fully disrupted (supplemental Fig. S1). Reverse Transcription (RT) Real-time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA from MDCK cells, either sparsely plated, or organized into the tight monolayers, was isolated using RNAqueous (Ambion). Typical RNA concentrations were 100-200 ng/μl. The RNA was measured for purity and stability with a Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies). 2000 ng of total RNA in total 40 μl of volume were converted to cDNA by use of Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen) and an oligo(dT) 12-18 primer (Invitrogen), according to the to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 μl of RT product was amplified by real-time PCR using the SYBR Premix ExTaq Perfect Real-Time PCR kit (TaKaRa), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primers used are shown in supplemental Table S1. Real-time PCR was performed in eight-well strips using a DNA Engine Opticon 2 (MJ Research). The cycle of threshold (Ct) was determined for each primer set. The efficiency of amplification was determined by generating a standard curve for each primer pair using a corresponding PCR product as a template. The PCR products were purified by using the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The range of PCR product concentrations was chosen for each primer set so that the standard curve included the values of Ct observed for the RNA samples isolated from both tight monolayers and dispersed cells. The resulting values of Ct were plotted against the logarithm of the PCR product copy number (supplemental Fig. S2). Quantification of the mRNA levels in the tight monolayers relative to that in the dispersed cells was performed as described previously (26Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25872) Google Scholar) using the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit mRNA as a reference. The cycle of threshold for the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit (Ct) was 13.3 ± 0.38 and 13.2 ± 0.25 in the dispersed cells and tight monolayers, respectively. All reactions were carried out in duplicates, and three separate mRNA isolations were performed. GnT-III and GnT-IVC Gene Silencing using siRNA—MDCK cells were grown on porous well inserts for 2 days after becoming confluent in the regular DMEM with 10% FBS. Two then cells were rinsed with the medium without FBS and antibiotics and transfected with the dicer-substrate siRNA (IDT). The sequences of siRNAs are shown in supplemental Table S2. 100 pmol of siRNA were added to 250 μl of serum-free DMEM. In a separate tube, 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were added to 250 μl of serum-free DMEM. Diluted siRNA and Lipofectamine were incubated at room temperature for 5 min, then mixed with each other and incubated for additional 20 min. The mixture was diluted with 1.5 ml of serum-containing DMEM and added to the cells (1.5 ml to the lower chamber and 0.5 ml to the upper chamber). The efficiency of transfection was close to 100% as detected by using a fluorescently labeled transfection control (IDT) (supplemental Fig. S3). The next day, the medium was changed to regular serum-containing DMEM. The transfection procedure was repeated 2 days later. The measurement of the paracellular permeability was performed on the day 6 after cells became confluent. A parallel sample of siRNA-treated cells was used for a Western blot analysis of the glycosylation status of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit. Another parallel sample was used to isolate RNA for determination of the levels of mRNA of GnT-III and GnT-IVC using the RT real-time quantitative PCR. Three independent transfection experiments for each siRNA were performed. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test (GraphPad Prism 4 software and Microsoft Excel). Statistical significance is specified in the figure legends. Branching of N-glycans Is Reduced with Development of Cell-Cell Junctions—MDCK cells sparsely plated on the porous well inserts (Fig. 1A, dispersed cells) spread over the surface, replicate, and migrate. Cell migration is abruptly inhibited after formation of the confluent monolayer (Fig. 1A, Day 0). However, cells of the confluent monolayer continue to divide over about a week until they reach a critical density and stop replicating. They increase in number 6-fold, decrease in horizontal dimensions 2.4-fold (Fig. 1A, Day 6) and increase in height about 6-fold (not shown). In parallel, cells of the monolayer developed competent tight junctions as detected by a gradual decrease in paracellular permeability to the membrane-impermeable dye, BCECF free acid, which reaches its minimum on day 3 and is maintained until day 6 (Fig. 1B). The maturation process is accompanied by stabilization of adherens junctions as seen by the gradual increase in the fractions of the E-cadherin and the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit that were retained in the cells after treatment of cells with non-ionic detergent (Fig. 1C). This was associated with a gradual increase in gel mobility of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit (Fig. 1C). In agreement with previously published results (20Liwosz A. Lei T. Kukuruzinska M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23138-23149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), gel mobility of E-cadherin was also increased in the tight cell monolayers as compared with the dispersed cells (Fig. 1C). Also, gel mobility of E-cadherin and the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit was greater in rabbit kidney that contains relatively tight epithelia as compared with the leaky epithelium of small intestine (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). These results suggest that there is a correlation between the tightness of epithelia in both cultured cells and animal tissues and gel mobility of E-cadherin and the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit. A similar correlation was detected for several other cellular glycoproteins, β1-integrin (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4), Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and polycystin-2 (not shown), suggesting that the N-glycosylation status of cellular glycoproteins is different in tight and leaky epithelia. Consistent with this interpretation, deglycosylation of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit from the dispersed cells and tight monolayers using PNGase F resulted in the products having the same gel mobility (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 6, bottom panel, dashed arrow). Similarly, deglycosylated E-cadherin from the dispersed cells and tight monolayers migrated to the same position on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 6, top panel, dashed arrow). Also, deglycosylated renal and intestinal E-cadherin and Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit had the same gel mobility (not shown).FIGURE 3The complex type N-glycans of E-cadherin and the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit have fewer branches or shorter branches in the tight MDCK cell monolayers as compared with the dispersed MDCK cells. Plasma membrane proteins isolated from the dispersed cells or tight cell monolayers were treated with glycosidases, EndoH or PNGase F, followed by Western blot analysis. In the dispersed cells, surface E-cadherin is susceptible to EndoH (compare lanes 2 and 3, top panel), indicating that E-cadherin contains at least one hybrid or high-mannose N-glycan. The product of EndoH cleavage migrates more slowly (lane 3, dotted arrow) than the PNGase F product (lane 1, dashed arrow), indicating that E-cadherin also contains at least one complex N-glycan. The plasma membrane fraction of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit of the dispersed cells is resistant to EndoH (compare lanes 2 and 3, bottom panel), indicating that the glycoprotein contains only complex N-glycans. In the membrane fractions isolated from the tight monolayers (lanes 4-6), susceptibility to glycosidases of E-cadherin and the Na,K-ATPaseβ1 subunit is the same as in dispersed cells (lanes 1-3), showing that the type of N-glycosylation of both E-cadherin and the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit does not change during formation of the tight monolayer from the dispersed cells. The EndoH products of both E-cadherin and Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit of dispersed cells migrate more slowly (lane 3, dotted arrows) than the corresponding proteins of the tight monolayers (lane 5, solid arrows) indicating that the composition of complex-type N-glycans becomes less complex during formation of the tight monolayer from the dispersed cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is known that virtually all types of N-linked glycans are removed from glycoproteins by PNGase F, while glycoproteins containing complex N-glycans are resistant to EndoH cleavage.

One enzyme that may help to remove oxidized phospholipids from cells is intracellular type II platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH (II)), which hydrolyzes oxidatively fragmented fatty acyl chains attached to phospholipids. Overexpression of PAF-AH (II) in cells or tissues was previously shown to suppress oxidative stress-induced cell death. In this study we investigated the functions of PAF-AH (II) by generating PAF-AH (II)-deficient (Pafah2-/-) mice. PAF-AH (II) was predominantly expressed in epithelial cells such as kidney proximal and distal tubules, intestinal column epithelium, and hepatocytes. Although PAF-AH activity was almost abolished in the liver and kidney of Pafah2-/- mice, Pafah2-/- mice developed normally and were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type mice. However, mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Pafah2-/- mice were more sensitive to tert-butylhydroperoxide treatment than those derived from wild-type mice. When carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was injected into mice, Pafah2-/- mice showed a delay in hepatic injury recovery. Moreover, after CCl4 administration, liver levels of the esterified form of 8-iso-PGF2α, a known in vitro substrate of PAF-AH (II), were higher in Pafah2-/- mice than in wild-type mice.

Polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing lipids are recognized as targets of oxidative damage, readily undergoing peroxidation upon exposure to free radicals. Peroxidation of lipids can greatly alter the physicochemical properties of membrane lipid bilayers, resulting in severe cellular dysfunction. In addition, a variety of lipid byproducts evolve from lipid peroxidation, some of which can exert adverse biological effects (5Kinnunen P.K. Chem. Phys.

It is assumed that these chemically modified lipids are preferentially hydrolyzed by cellular phospholipase A2 that mainly hydrolyzes fatty acyl chains attached to the sn-2 position of phosphoglycerides, the position where polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains are generally attached. One of the candidate enzymes responsible for the release of oxidized fatty acyl chains from the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids is thought to be platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) 2The abbreviations used are: PAF-AHplatelet-activating factor (PAF)-acetylhydrolasePAF-AH (II)intracellular type II PAF-AHMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastst-BuOOHtert-butylhydroperoxide8-iso-PGF2α8-iso-prostaglandin F2αPCphosphatidylcholineES cellsembryonic stem cells.

These unusual sn-2 acyl groups are generated by oxidative cleavage of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acyl groups. Recently it has been reported that oxidatively modified phospholipids such as esterified F2-isoprostanes (24Stafforini D.M. Sheller J.R. Blackwell T.S. Sapirstein A. Yull F.E. McIntyre T.M.

These suppressive effects of plasma PAF-AH are thought to be due to its ability to hydrolyze PAF and PAF-like oxidized phospholipids. Four percent of the Japanese population lack plasma PAF-AH, and such a deficiency or decrease in plasma PAF-AH activity may be associated with severe asthma (31Stafforini D.M. Numao T. Tsodikov A.

The amino acid sequence of PAF-AH (II) does not show any similarity to any subunit of PAF-AH (I) but significant identity with plasma PAF-AH. PAF-AH (II) is N-myristoylated at the N terminus and is distributed in both the cytosol and membranes like other N-myristoylated proteins (38Matsuzawa A. Hattori K. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PAF-AH (II) exhibits a substrate specificity that is very similar to plasma PAF-AH. PAF-AH (II) can hydrolyze phospholipids with short to medium length sn-2 acyl chains including truncated chains derived from oxidative cleavage of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acyl groups. However, the activity of this enzyme toward phospholipids with two long (14-18 carbons) fatty acyl chains is negligible (39Min J.H. Wilder C. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Paul L. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry (Mosc). 2001; 40: 4539-4549Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40Inoue T. Sugimoto A. Suzuki Y. Yamamoto M. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13233-13238Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We and another group have demonstrated that overexpression of PAF-AH (II) suppresses oxidative stress-induced cell death. Moreover, PAF-AH (II) translocates from the cytosol to the membrane during oxidative stress (38Matsuzawa A. Hattori K. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 41Marques M. Pei Y. Southall M.D. Johnston J.M. Arai H. Aoki J. Inoue T. Seltmann H. Zouboulis C.C.

These results strongly suggest that PAF-AH (II) functions as an antioxidant phospholipase. Unlike intracellular type I PAF-AH, PAF-AH (II) is conserved in many organisms, including mammals, frog, fishes, nematodes, and even in yeast. We have shown that the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue of mammalian PAF-AH (II) is expressed in epithelial cells of C. elegans and plays an important role in epithelial morphogenesis (40Inoue T. Sugimoto A. Suzuki Y. Yamamoto M. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13233-13238Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because PAF is not present in C. elegans (42Satouchi K. Hirano K. Sakaguchi M. Takehara H. Matsuura F. Lipids. 1993; 28: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it is not likely that PAF-AH (II) functions as a PAF-degrading enzyme. In this study we generated PAF-AH (II)-deficient (Pafah2-/-) mice by targeted disruption to elucidate the physiological and pathological functions of intracellular PAF-AH (II) in mammals. Generation of Pafah2-/- Mice—Pafah2 genomic clones were isolated from a mouse 129/SvJ genomic library in the Lambda FIXII vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A replacement-type targeting vector was constructed; the short arm containing a 1.0-kilobase fragment in intron 7 and the long arm containing a 9.2-kilobase SpeI fragment spanning exons 10-11 were inserted into the XhoI and NotI sites, respectively, of the vector pPolIIshort-neobpA-HSVTK. Exons 8-9, which include catalytic motif (GXSXV), were replaced by a neomycin-resistant cassette. The targeting vectors were linearized and electroporated into E14Tg2a embryonic stem cells (ES cells) (43Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). G418-resistant colonies were screened for homologous recombinants by PCR. Candidates of homologous recombinants were verified by Southern blot analysis using fragments at the 5′-end of the genes, external to the targeting vectors as probes. Chimeric mice were generated by injection of the ES cells into C57BL/6 blastocysts followed by transfer to foster mothers and back-crossed to C57BL/6 mice. Genotypes were determined by PCR and/or Southern blot analysis of the tail DNA samples. All experiments reported here were performed with mice derived from six to eight generations of backcross-breeding to C57BL/6 mice. Western Blot Analysis—Murine tissues were homogenized in quadruple volumes (w/v) of SET buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose) with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation at 1000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatants were used as the total protein extracts. The protein concentrations of samples were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Each total protein extract (20 μg/lane) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) in TTBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20) and incubated with the specific monoclonal mouse anti-PAF-AH (II) antibody TI10 (44Bae K. Longobardi L. Karasawa K. Malone B. Inoue T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26704-26709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (GE Healthcare), PAF-AH (II) was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting detection system, GE Healthcare). Histological and Immunohistochemical Analyses—Mice under anesthesia were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline. Tissues were dissected and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Paraffin sections (5 μm) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemistry, paraffin sections (5 μm) were boiled in a microwave oven in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Subsequent immunodetection was performed using the monoclonal antibody TI10 and Vector M.O.M. peroxidase immunodetection kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The sections were also counterstained with hematoxylin. Enzyme Assays—Mouse tissue samples were homogenized in SET buffer followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the soluble fraction. Mouse blood samples were obtained by retro-orbital bleeding. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation of the blood at 1800 × g for 10 min. Peritoneal exudate macrophages were suspended in SET buffer and disrupted by sonication for 3 periods of 4 s at 10-s intervals using a Branson Sonifer. The soluble fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 20 min. PAF-AH activity of the tissue soluble fraction and the plasma were measured as previously described (45Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidized phospholipid-hydrolyzing activity was measured as follows. The standard incubation system for assay comprised 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 10 nmol of 1-palmitoyl, 2-azeraoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC), and the sample in a total volume of 0.125 ml. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1.25 ml of chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v) followed by adding 0.125 ml of water and 6 nmol of 1,2-dimyristoyl PC as internal standard. The lipids in the organic phase were extracted and analyzed by a Quattro Micro tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with an electrospray ion source, as described previously (46Tanaka M. Kishi Y. Takanezawa Y. Kakehi Y. Aoki J. Arai H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Lipid extracts were reconstituted in 2:1 chloroform/methanol, and the samples were introduced by means of a flow injector into the electrospray ion source chamber at a flow rate of 4 μl/min in a solvent system of acetonitrile/methanol/water (2:3:1; v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) ammonium formate (pH 6.4). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive and negative scan modes. The flow rate of the nitrogen drying gas was 12 liters/min at 80 °C. The capillary and cone voltages were set at 3.7 kV and 30 V, respectively. PAF Degradation Assay—PAF degradation by cultured peritoneal macrophages was measured as described (47Ohshima N. Ishii S. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9722-9727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Peritoneal exudate macrophages were obtained by washing the peritoneal cavity with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 3 days after intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of sterile 4% thioglycollate. After centrifugation at 250 × g, the cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Biowest, Nuaille, France). They were cultured in 24-well plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, non-adherent cells were removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with Tyrode's buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 0.49 mm MgCl2, and 0.37 mm NaH2PO4) containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) and 0.1% of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA) and then incubated with 2 nm [acetyl-3H]PAF (795.5 Gbq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA for 30-120 min at 37 °C. The medium was recovered, and the lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method (48Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The radioactivity of liberated [3H]acetate in the aqueous phase was counted with a liquid scintillation counter (Tri-Carb 3100TR, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Preparation of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts and Cell Viability Assay—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from E13.5 embryos and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Biowest, Nuaille, France), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and maintained in 5% CO2. Cells were plated at 2×104/well in 96-well plates and then exposed to varying concentrations of tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BuOOH, Sigma) for 6 h. Eighteen hours after treatment, cell viability was measured using 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt (WST-8), which is converted to water-soluble formazan by mitochondrial dehydrogenase (Cell Counting Kit-8, Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). The relative number of surviving cells was determined in quadruplicate by estimating the value of untreated cells as 100%. To determine the distribution of PAF-AH (II) between the cytosol and membranes in MEFs, MEFs were harvested after the t-BuOOH treatment (100 μm) and disrupted by sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to separate the cytosol (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions. Both the cytosol and membrane fractions (7 μg protein) were analyzed by immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody TI10 as described above. Measurement of 8-Isoprostaglandin F2α—8-Isoprostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α) was measured as previously described (49Yoshida Y. Itoh N. Hayakawa M. Piga R. Cynshi O. Jishage K. Niki E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 208: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Liver was homogenized (Polytron homogenizer, PT-3100) with saline (liver/saline = 1:3, w/w), and the aliquot (300 μl) was diluted with saline (1700 μl). Internal standard 8-iso-PGF2α-d4 (100 ng) and 1 ml of methanol were added to this solution followed by the reduction of hydroperoxides with excessive amount of sodium borohydride at room temperature for 5 min under nitrogen. Then the reduced sample was mixed with 1 m KOH in methanol (1 ml) under nitrogen and incubated for 30 min in the dark at 40 °C in a shaker. The sample was centrifuged (3000 × g, for 10 min, at 4 °C), and the supernatant was diluted with 4-fold volume of water (pH 3) and acidified (pH 3) using 2 n HCl. The acidified sample was centrifuged (3000 × g, for 10 min, at 4 °C), and the supernatant was subjected to the following solid phase extraction. C18 cartridge was preconditioned with 2 ml of methanol and 2 ml of water (pH 3). The sample was loaded to the cartridge at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the cartridge was washed with 10 ml of water (pH 3) and 10 ml of acetonitrile/water (15:85, by volume). An elution was performed with 4 ml of hexane/ethyl acetate/isopropyl alcohol (30:65:5, by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elute was then applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min to NH2 cartridge preconditioned with hexane (5 ml). The cartridge was washed sequentially with 5 ml of hexane/ethyl acetate (30:70, by volume) and 5 ml of acetonitrile, and an elution was performed with 5 ml of ethyl acetate/methanol/acetic acid (10:85:5, by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The solution was evaporated under nitrogen, and 30 μl of the silylating agent, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, was added to the dried residue. The solution was vigorously mixed by a vortex mixer for 1 min and incubated for 60 min at 60 °C to obtain the trimethylsilyl esters and ethers. This solution was diluted with 70 μl of acetone, and then an aliquot of this sample was injected into the gas chromatograph (GC 6890 N, Agilent Technologies Co. Ltd.) equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (5973 Network, Agilent Technologies Co. Ltd.). A fused-silica capillary column (HP-5MS, 5% phenyl methyl siloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm, Agilent Technologies Co. Ltd.) was used. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Temperature programming was performed from 60 to 280 °C at 10 °C/min. The injector temperature was set at 250 °C, and temperatures of the transfer line to the mass detector and ion source were 250 and 230 °C, respectively. Electron energy was set at 70 eV. The identification of 8-iso-PGF2α was conducted by their retention times and mass patterns (m/z = 571, 481), and ions at 481 were selected for quantification 8-iso-PGF2α using the internal standard 8-iso-PGF2α-d4 (m/z = 485). Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced Acute Hepatic Injury—Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.3 or 1 ml/kg body weight of CCl4 dissolved in olive oil (total volume 10 ml/kg body weight). At 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h after injection, blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding under light ether anesthesia with heparinized capillary tubes. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1800 × g for 10 min. Plasma alanine transferase activity was evaluated using a Transaminase CII Testwako kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). At each time point livers were excised and subjected to histological examination. Statistics—Statistical analyses were performed with Student's t test setting the significance at p < 0.05. PAF-AH (II) Is Expressed in Epithelial Tissues—Western blot analysis showed that PAF-AH (II) was expressed essentially in all the tissues, most abundantly in the liver, kidney, intestine, and testis (Fig. 1A). Immunohistochemical studies revealed that PAF-AH (II) was predominantly expressed in epithelial cells such as hepatocytes, kidney tubules, Bowman's capsule epithelium, and intestinal column epithelium (Fig. 1B). In contrast, endothelial and interstitial cells showed low expression of PAF-AH (II). No staining of PAF-AH (II) was detected in the tissues of null mutant mice (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence double staining of kidney sections with antibodies to PAF-AH (II) and nephron segment markers (aquaporin-1 and aquaporin-2) revealed that PAF-AH (II) was expressed in proximal tubules, distal tubules, and thick ascending limbs of Henle but not in the collecting ducts or thin loops of Henle (supplemental figure). Generation of Pafah2-/- Mice—To investigate the role of PAF-AH (II) in vivo, we generated PAF-AH (II) mutant mice by targeted disruption. Mice lacking the PAF-AH (II) gene (Pafah2) were produced by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells using the strategy outlined in Fig. 2. The targeting vector was constructed to replace exons 8-9 of the Pafah2 gene with a neomycin-resistance gene. Targeted embryonic stem cell clones and subsequent germ line transmissions were detected by PCR and Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis of kidney homogenates revealed that PAF-AH (II) protein was absent in homozygous mutants, and heterozygous mutants expressed about half the amount of PAF-AH (II) protein detected in wild-type mice (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the expression of PAF-AH (II) from the normal allele is not altered due to decreased amounts of total PAF-AH (II) protein. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of kidney mRNA revealed that Pafah2 mRNA was absent in homozygous mutants (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that the introduced mutation eliminated expression of PA"

In resting cells, PDK1 is known to be constitutively active and is further activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr9 and Tyr373/376) following the treatment of the cell with insulin or pervanadate. However, little is known about the mechanisms for this additional activation of PDK1. Here, we report that the SH2 domain of Src, Crk, and GAP recognized tyrosine-phosphorylated PDK1 in vitro. Destabilization of PDK1 induced by geldanamycin (a Hsp90 inhibitor) was partially blocked in HEK 293 cells expressing PDK1-Y9F. Co-expression of Hsp90 enhanced PDK1-Src complex formation and led to further increased PDK1 activity toward PKB and SGK. Immunohistochemical analysis with anti-phospho-Tyr9 antibodies showed that the level of Tyr9 phosphorylation was markedly increased in tumor samples compared with normal. Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of PDK1 on Tyr9, distinct from Tyr373/376, is important for PDK1/Src complex formation, leading to PDK1 activation. Furthermore, Tyr9 phosphorylation is critical for the stabilization of both PDK1 and the PDK1/Src complex via Hsp90-mediated protection of PDK1 degradation. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) appears to play a central regulatory role in many cell signalings between phosphoinositide-3 kinase and various intracellular serine/threonine kinases.

One of the key features of multicellular organisms is that all cells are able to adjust to changes in the surrounding environment. A diverse set of environmental cues utilize intracellular protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascades to rapidly and reversibly transduce their signals from their plasma membrane receptors to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) 3The abbreviations used are: PDK13-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1PKBprotein kinase BSH2Src homology 2SH3Src homology 3siRNAsmall interfering RNAGSTglutathione S-transferase17-AAG17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycinPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateWTwild type. was originally identified as an upstream kinase for protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) (1Alessi D.R.

PDK1(-/-) mice die at embryonic day 9.5 with multiple abnormalities, whereas hypomorphic PDK1 mice are viable (6Lawlor M.A. Mora A. Ashby P.R. Williams M.R. Murray-Tait V. Malone L. Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3728-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these mice are 40–50% smaller than control animals due to small cell size, but not cell number, providing genetic evidence that PDK1 is essential for mouse embryonic development and regulates cell size (6Lawlor M.A. Mora A.

PDK1 possesses an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (8Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B.

Phosphorylation of PKB by PDK1 is dependent upon prior activation by phosphoinositide 3-kinase and the production of the second messengers, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, which bind to the pleckstrin homology domains of PDK1 and PKB. These lipids do not activate either PKB or PDK1 but instead recruit and co-localize these kinases at the plasma membrane, allowing PDK1 to activate PKB (3Fayard E. Tintignac L.A. Baudry A. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5675-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Although the importance of PDK1 in insulin signaling has been well characterized, the regulatory mechanism of PDK1 activity remains controversial. At the plasma membrane, PDK1 adopts the appropriate conformation for optimal activation (10Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol.

A previous report demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser241 in the activation loop was necessary for PDK1 activity (12Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). There is convincing evidence that PDK1 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to several growth factors (13Park J. Hill M.M.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6642-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Studies with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate indicate that full activation of PDK1 requires phosphorylation at Tyr373/376 in HEK 293 cells (13Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that in HEK 293 cells, insulin-mediated regulation of PDK1 activity is accomplished by an Src family kinase (13Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Casamayor A. Alessi D.R. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6642-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of how Src kinases contribute to tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated PDK1 activation has not yet been elucidated. In the current study, we have investigated the molecular basis for PDK1 regulation by using the SH2-containing proteins, Src, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and Grb2. We show that the SH2 domain of Src, Crk, and GAP recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated PDK1 in vitro. Using deletion mutants of Src, we confirm that the SH2 domain of Src is responsible for the interaction between PDK1 and Src in HEK 293 cells. Using site-directed mutants of PDK1, we show that although conversion of Tyr9 to Phe completely disrupted PDK1-Src complex formation, mutation of Tyr373/376 to Phe led to moderate binding of PDK1 and Src. Based on results from phosphopeptide binding assays, phosphorylation of PDK1 on Tyr9 appears to act as a docking site for the binding of Src, leading to PDK1 activation. Consistent with previous reports (16Wei Q. Xia Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18081-18086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J.

This destabilization was partially blocked in HEK 293 cells expressing PDK1-Y9F. Co-expression of Hsp90 enhanced PDK1-Src complex formation and led to further increases in PDK1 activity, resulting in the activation and phosphorylation of AGC protein kinases. Furthermore, knockdown of Hsp90 by siRNA inhibited PDK1 activity and PDK1/Src binding. With the help of anti-phospho-Tyr9 antibodies, these events were evaluated in the various cancer tissues. Thus, these data show that PDK1 activity is further regulated by the SH2 protein Src through the formation of a Src-PDK1-Hsp90 complex. Reagents—Anti-Myc 9E10 and anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody were produced from hybridomas. Anti-PDK1, anti-PKB, and anti-phospho-SGK (Thr256) antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-GST and anti-Hsp90 antibody were from Stressgene. Anti-FLAG and anti-actin antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-phospho-PKB (Thr308) antibody was from Cell Signaling. Anti-phospho-PDK1 (Tyr9 or Tyr373/376) antibody has been described previously (13Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibody were from Calbiochem, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep IgG antibody was obtained from Sigma. Sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) was purchased from Sigma. Construction of Expression Vectors—Myc-tagged full-length PDK1 (Myc-PDK1) and the phosphorylation site mutants (Myc-PDK1-Y9F and Myc-PDK1-Y373F/Y376F) were the same as reported previously (13Park J.

The collection of GST-SH2 protein expression constructs has been previously described (18Roche S. McGlade J. Jones M. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4940-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). HA-tagged c-Src constructs (HA-Src) were prepared by amplifying the cDNA of HEK 293 cells with primers 5′-CG GGA TCC ATG GGG AGC AGC AAG and 3′-G GAA TTC CTA TAG GTT CTC TCC. The PCR products were subcloned between BamHI and EcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3-HA. The deletion mutants of Src were constructed in pcDNA3-HA expression vector by a standard PCR-cloning strategy (HA-Src-ΔSH2 and HA-Src-ΔSH3). The mutants at Lys295 (kinase-deficient HA-Src KD K295M) and Tyr527 (constitutive active HA-Src-CA Y527F) were created by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer with pcDNA3 HA-Src WT as template. The FLAG-Hsp90 construct has been described previously (19Park K.A. Byun H.S. Won M. Yang K.J. Shin S. Piao L. Kim J.M. Woon W.H. Junn E. Park J. Seok J.H. Hur G.M.

All constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Sequences of the mutagenic oligonucleotides are available upon request. Cell Culture and Stimulation—Stable cell lines expressing the Myc-tagged PDK1 WT, PDK1-Y9F, or PDK1-Y373F/Y376F were derived from HEK 293 cells and the same as reported previously (13Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 1 μg/ml puromycin and transfected using jetPEI (Q-biogene) or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) reagent by following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The transfection mixture was removed after 24 h of incubation, and cells were serum-starved for 16 h before stimulation for 15 min with 0.1 m pervanadate prepared with 0.2 mm H2O2 (20Posner B.I.

Pretreatment with 1 μm lactacystin (Alexis), 1 μm PSI (Alexis) or 5 nm MG132 (Calbiochem) were done for 1 h before cell stimulation. For RNA interference, human Hsp90α/β siRNA and a scrambled RNA duplex as a control were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the Hsp90α/β siRNA or a control siRNA using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Expression of GST Fusion Protein in Bacterial System and GST Pull-down Assay—The GST-SH2 fusion protein was isolated from BL21DE3 cells transformed with GST-SH2 expression construct. Briefly, bacteria were initially grown at 37 °C for 2 h (A600 = 0.5–0.7) and subsequently induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Promega) for 6 h at 30 °C. Cells were lysed using a sonicator (Beckman) in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 120 mm NaCl, 7 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The GST-SH2 fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (21Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). For GST pull-down assays, 2 μg of the indicated purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with 500 μg of lysates overexpressing Myc-PDK1 WT for 2 h at 4 °C, following which the beads were washed three times in wash buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% SDS). After removing the supernatant in the final wash, samples were resuspended in 25 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, and the proteins retained on the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The bound PDK1 was detected by anti-PDK1 antibody. Binding was compared with that of 10% of the lysates added to the binding reactions. The incubated GST fusion proteins were determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining solution (0.25% Coomassie Blue G-250, 10% methanol, and 10% acetic acid). Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay for PDK1—HEK 293 cells were placed on ice and extracted with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 μm microcystin-LR. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and Myc-PDK1 protein was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of cell-free extracts with anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody immobilized on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The immune complexes were washed once with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, followed by lysis buffer and finally with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). In vitro kinase assays were performed for 60 min at 30 °C in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 30 μl of immunoprecipitates in kinase buffer, 100 μm Suntide (RRKDGATMKTFCGTPE) as substrate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (Alexis), and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1,000–2,000 cpm/pmol; Amersham Biosciences). Reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm and processed as described previously (13Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For detection of endogenous complexes, endogenous Src was immunoprecipitated from 4 mg of HEK 293 cell-free extracts with 1 μg of anti-Src antibody. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Preparation of Crude Plasma Membrane Fractions—HEK 293 cells were treated as described and then placed on ice. After washing once in ice-cold PBS, cells were scraped in 500 μl of ice-cold fractionation buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μm microcystin LR, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine and then homogenized by passing with a 1-ml Dounce homogenizer by passing 15 times. Homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min to separate the cytosolic fraction (supernatant) from organelles (pellet). The resulting supernatant centrifuged at 106,000 × g for 60 min in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor to separate cytosolic S100 fraction (supernatant) from plasma membrane P100 fraction (pellet). The P100 pellet was resuspended in fractionation buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and the protein concentration was determined. A defined concentration of protein from each fraction was then used for kinase assay and immunoblotting. Immunohistochemistry—We purchased a human cancer tissue array slide with paraffin sections from BioMax. Histostain-Plus kits (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions for the immunohistochemistry of tissue array (22Elias J.M. Margiotta M. Gaborc D. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1989; 92: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, paraffin sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. The slide was submerged in peroxidase quenching solution for 10 min. After it was washed twice with PBS for 5 min, it was added with 2 drops of Reagent A for blocking and incubated for 30 min. Following two washes with PBS, the primary antibody, anti-Tyr(P)9 antibody, was applied at 4 °C overnight. Then biotinylated secondary antibody, Reagent B, was added after rinsing with PBS. It was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. It was rinsed with PBS and dropped with enzyme-conjugated Reagent C. After it was washed with PBS, DAB chromogen, and a mixture of Reagent D1, D2, and D3, it was dropped, and signals were observed with a florescence microscope. Then the reaction was stopped with distilled water, and pictures were taken with a florescence microscope. Statistical Analysis—Quantification of Western blot analysis was done by using the Tina version 2.1 program (Raytest Isotopenmegerate). Briefly, the relative intensity (area × density) of bands of interest was quantitated by a densitometer. The background value from a blank band was subtracted. The results were calculated as the ratio change compared with the corresponding control bands. Data are presented as means ± S.D. of the three independent experiments. The results were analyzed by Student's t test (SPSS version 12.0 software, SPSS Inc.). p < 0.05 (*) was considered significant, and p < 0.01 (**) was highly significant compared with corresponding control values. In Vitro Association of Tyrosine-phosphorylated PDK1 with SH2 Domain-containing Proteins—It has been reported that PDK1 becomes phosphorylated following stimulation of cells with pervanadate or insulin (13Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Additionally, coexpressed v-Src or IR induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDK1 in HEK 293 cells or L6 myoblasts (13Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Formisano P. Beguinot F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10803-10814Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to investigate the possible interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated PDK1 and proteins containing an SH2-phosphotyrosine binding domain (24Pawson T. Cell. 2004; 116: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). SH2 domains of various proteins (Src, Lck, Fyn2, phospholipase Cγ, p85, Crk, Syp, GAP, Nck, Grb2, and Vav) were expressed as GST fusion proteins and tested for their ability to specifically bind to immunoprecipitated Myc-PDK1 from pervanadate-treated HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1). Incubation of the GST-SH2 domain with immunoprecipitated Myc-PDK1 followed by recovery of bound PDK1 on glutathione-Sepharose beads revealed that PDK1 and the GST-SH2 domain from Src, Crk, or GAP associate in vitro (Fig. 1, lanes 3, 11, and 15). In contrast, PDK1 displayed negligible binding with SH2 domains from other proteins or GST alone (Fig. 1, lanes 2, 4, and 5). Binding of Src to PDK1 Requires Phosphorylation of Tyr9—HEK 293 cells were used to investigate the regulation of PDK1 by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway. As previously reported, three tyrosine residues (Tyr9 and Tyr373/376) on PDK1 are phosphorylated in response to pervanadate in vivo (13Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To further confirm an interaction between the Src SH2-domain and tyrosine-phosphorylated PDK1, we examined the ability of wild type HA-Src to bind to a Myc-tagged PDK1 in vitro and in vivo. No interaction between Src and PDK1 was detected when lysates from HEK 293 cells overexpressing HA-Src or Myc-PDK1 were mixed (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). However, tyrosine-phosphorylated PDK1 interacted with HA-Src in vivo when both are coexpressed in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2A, lane 4, Co-expression), suggesting that binding of PDK1 to Src is indirect and may require additional protein molecules to facilitate this interaction in vivo. Coexpressed Y9F-PDK1 disrupted the formation of Src-PDK1 complex, whereas co-expression of Y373F/Y376F-PDK1 results in partial inhibition of complex formation (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). Furthermore, Tyr9 phosphorylation was still detected in bound Y373F/Y376F-PDK1, whereas Tyr373/376 phosphorylation was completely blocked in bound Y9F-PDK1, indicating that Tyr9 phosphorylation is important for Src-PDK1 complex formation (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). To further evaluate the binding specificity of this interaction, synthetic phosphopeptide beads were employed (13Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to the 14 or 17 amino acids surrounding Tyr(P)9 or Tyr(P)373/376, respectively, were prepared, immobilized on Affi-Gel 15, and then incubated with the selected GST-SH2 proteins (Src, Fyn2, and Crk). As illustrated in Fig. 2B, the recovery of bound GST-SH2 domain on phosphopeptide beads revealed that there was strong interaction between Src/Crk and Tyr(P)9 peptide, consistent with previous results (Fig. 1). However, no interaction with p373/376 peptide was observed. Taken together, these results indicated that the formation of Src-PDK1 complex requires Tyr9 phosphorylation of PDK1 and the help of additional molecules. SH2 Domain of Src Is Responsible for the Binding to Myc-PDK1 in HEK 293 Cells—Previous authors have demonstrated that SH3 domains are involved in mediating protein-protein interactions together with SH2 domains in a cooperative manner (25Latour S. Roncagalli R. Chen R. Bakinowski M. Shi X. Schwartzberg P.L. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 26Donaldson L.W. Gish G. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Forman-Kay J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14053-14058Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of each domain from Src on the formation of Src-PDK complexes, SH2 or SH3 deletion mutants, a kinase-dead mutant, and a constitutive active mutant were prepared (Fig. 3A). To eliminate difficulties with levels or protein expression in a transient transfection system, Myc-PDK1-stable HEK 293 cells were used. Coexpression of these mutants in HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing Myc-PDK1 revealed that the SH2 domain of Src was required for the association of Src and PDK1 (Fig. 3B, lane 5). Of note, binding of the SH3 deletion mutant of Src to Myc-PDK1 was significantly reduced compared with Src WT (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 6). Strikingly, a constitutive active version of Src formed a tighter complex with Myc-PDK1 compared with Src WT (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, there was almost no interaction between kinase-dead Src and Myc-PDK1, indicating that the interaction between Src and PDK1 requires the SH2 domain and Src catalytic activity of Src. Hsp90 Inhibitors Promote PDK1 Destabilization, Leading to Disruption of Hsp90/PDK1 Complexes—Our data to date suggest that PDK1 binding to Src requires additional protein molecules (Fig. 2A). Previous authors have demonstrated that inhibition of PDK1 binding to Hsp90 triggers proteasome-dependent degradation of PDK1 (17Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This allowed us to investigate the possible involvement of Hsp90 in modulating PDK1-Src complex formation. First, we tested whether geldanamycin, an Hsp90 inhibitor, altered PDK1 stability in our experimental setting. Treatment of HEK 293 cells stably expressing PDK1 WT, PDK1-Y9F, or PDK1-Y373F/Y376F with geldanamycin showed that PDK1 stability was affected in PDK1 WT cell line (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–3), consistent with previous reports (17Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In contrast, PDK1 stability was not affected in the PDK1-Y9F cell line (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6), whereas levels of PDK1 were reduced by 30% at 24 h in the PDK1-Y373F/Y376F cell line (Fig. 4A, lanes 7–9). We then monitored the levels of PDK1-Hsp90 complex in the above experiment. When we normalized the amount of Hsp90 co-immunoprecipitating to the total amount of Hsp90 in each cell line, the association of Hsp90 with PDK1 WT or PDK1-Y373F/Y376F was reduced upon treatment of cells with geldanamycin, whereas the interaction with PDK1-Y9F was almost unchanged (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, decreased binding of PDK1-Y9F/Hsp90 compared with PDK1 WT/Hsp90 was observed when the expression level of PDK1 WT and PDK1-Y9F were normalized (Fig. 4E). However, the interaction level between PDK1 (WT, Y9F, and Y373F/Y376F) and Hsp90 was not affected upon treatment of cells with geldanamycin (Fig. 4E). Treatment of cells with 17-AAG, a second Hsp90 inhibitor, gave a similar results (data not shown).

Although acetate is produced in the hydrogenosomes of a number of anaerobic microbial eukaryotes such as Trichomonas vaginalis, no acetate producing enzyme has ever been identified in these organelles. Acetate production is the last unidentified enzymatic reaction of hydrogenosomal carbohydrate metabolism. We identified a gene encoding an enzyme for acetate production in the genome of the hydrogenosome-containing protozoan parasite T. vaginalis. This gene shows high similarity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae acetyl-CoA hydrolase and Clostridium kluyveri succinyl-CoA:CoA-transferase. Here we demonstrate that this protein is expressed and is present in the hydrogenosomes where it functions as the T. vaginalis acetate:succinate CoA-transferase (TvASCT). Heterologous expression of TvASCT in CHO cells resulted in the expression of an active ASCT. Furthermore, homologous overexpression of the TvASCT gene in T. vaginalis resulted in an equivalent increase in ASCT activity. It was shown that the CoA transferase activity is succinate-dependent. These results demonstrate that this acetyl-CoA hydrolase/transferase homolog functions as the hydrogenosomal ASCT of T. vaginalis. This is the first hydrogenosomal acetate-producing enzyme to be identified. Interestingly, TvASCT does not share any similarity with the mitochondrial ASCT from Trypanosoma brucei, the only other eukaryotic succinate-dependent acetyl-CoA-transferase identified so far. The trichomonad enzyme clearly belongs to a distinct class of acetate:succinate CoA-transferases. Apparently, two completely different enzymes for succinate-dependent acetate production have evolved independently in ATP-generating organelles.

Apparently, two completely different enzymes for succinate-dependent acetate production have evolved independently in ATP-generating organelles. Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent sexually transmitted parasite with annually over 100 million cases worldwide. This parasite is an aerotolerant anaerobe that lacks mitochondria, the characteristic energy producing organelle of most eukaryotic organisms. However, trichomonads do contain other double membrane-bound organelles (1Honigberg B.M. Volkmann D. Entzeroth R. Scholtyseck E. J.

S. A. 2004; 101: 10368-10373Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These hydrogenosomes convert pyruvate into acetate and carbon dioxide, resulting in hydrogen formation and ATP production (10Müller M. Mettrick D.F. Desser S.S. Parasites - Their World and Ours. Elsevier, Amsterdam1982Google Scholar, 11Müller M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 465-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 12Steinbüchel A. Müller M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Upon entry into the hydrogenosome, pyruvate is oxidatively decarboxylated by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO, 3The abbreviations used are: PFOpyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductaseASCTacetate:succinate CoA-transferaseTvASCTT. vaginalis acetate:succinate CoA-transferaseUTRuntranslated region. EC 1.2.7.1), yielding carbon dioxide and acetyl-CoA. The electrons released in the oxidation of pyruvate by PFO are transferred to ferredoxin and subsequently to protons, producing hydrogen gas. The acetyl-CoA formed by PFO is converted into acetate by an acetate:succinate CoA-transferase (ASCT), which transfers the CoA-group from acetyl-CoA to succinate. The succinyl-CoA derived from this reaction is then converted back into succinate by succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS, EC 6.2.1.4), thereby producing ATP (12Steinbüchel A. Müller M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). ATP production in hydrogenosomes occurs exclusively via substrate level phosphorylation, using this ASCT/SCS cycle. ASCT is the only enzyme involved in T. vaginalis hydrogenosomal carbohydrate metabolism that has never been identified. In fact, acetate is not only produced in the hydrogenosomes of the parabasalid T. vaginalis, but also in the hydrogenosomes of certain ciliates (e.g. Nyctotherus ovalis), amoeboflagellates (e.g. Psalteriomonas lanterna) and in chytridiomycete fungi (e.g. Neocallimastix) (3Müller M.

However, the enzyme responsible for acetate formation has never been identified in any hydrogenosomal organism. pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase acetate:succinate CoA-transferase T. vaginalis acetate:succinate CoA-transferase untranslated region. In addition to hydrogenosomes, ASCT activity is also known to be present in the anaerobically functioning mitochondria of metazoa that produce acetate, such as those of the parasitic helminths Fasciola hepatica and Ascaris suum (15McLaughlin G.L. Saz H.J. deBruyn B.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol B. 1986; 83: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 16Saz H.J. deBruyn B. de Mata Z. J. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 694-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, ASCT activity has been identified in the strictly aerobically functioning mitochondria of procyclic forms of the trypanosomatid Trypanosoma brucei (17Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ASCT/SCS cycle is the only catabolic pathway present in both mitochondria and hydrogenosomes. Identification of genes encoding mitochondrial or hydrogenosomal ASCT could therefore provide valuable information to unravel the evolutionary relation between these organelles. The formation of acetate from acetyl-CoA as an end product of energy metabolism is observed in many prokaryotes and in a few eukaryotic species, all predominantly living in anaerobic or hypoxic environments (18Tielens A.G.M. Van Hellemond J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Van Hellemond J.J. van der Klei A. van Weelden S.W. Tielens A.G.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Besides the formation of acetate by ASCT activity (Fig. 1, reaction 1), three alternative pathways for acetate production from acetyl-CoA have been identified: (i) acetate can be produced from acetyl-CoA via a two-step mechanism in which acetyl-phosphate occurs as an intermediate, involving the enzymes phosphate acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.8) and acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1), as occurs in many eubacteria (Fig. 1, reaction 2) (20Brown T.D. Jones-Mortimer M.C. Kornberg H.L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 102: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar); (ii) acetate can be produced from acetyl-CoA via an acetyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.13, also known as acetate thiokinase) a process that concomitantly produces ATP from ADP in a reaction that is known to occur in several archaea and in the amitochondriate protists Giardia intestinalis and Entamoeba histolytica, (Fig. 1, reaction 3) (21Reeves R.E. Warren L.G. Susskind B. Lo H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 726-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sanchez L.B. Müller M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); (iii) furthermore acetate can be produced via hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA catalyzed by an acetyl-CoA hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.1), as is present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (23Buu L.M. Chen Y.C. Lee F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17203-17209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Lee F.J. Lin L.W. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7413-7418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, reaction 4). The first gene encoding a eukaryotic ASCT was identified in T. brucei (25Rivière L. van Weelden S.W. Glass P. Vegh P. Coustou V. Biran M. Van Hellemond J.J. Bringaud F. Tielens A.G.M. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45337-45346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This gene showed high sequence similarity to mammalian succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase (SCOT, EC 2.8.3.5). However, no sequence homolog of this ASCT gene from T. brucei could be detected in the T. vaginalis genome data base at TIGR. On the other hand, we could identify in the T. vaginalis data base another candidate for acetate production by BLAST searches using the sequence of acetyl-CoA hydrolase from S. cerevisiae (ACH1) (van Weelden, PhD thesis, Utrecht University, 2005). Earlier studies showed that some of the gene products of the acetyl-CoA hydrolase/transferase family actually function as CoA transferases (26Witkowski A. Witkowska H.E. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 379-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Söhling B. Gottschalk G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 871-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the expression, localization, and enzymatic function of this acetyl-CoA hydrolase/transferase homolog in T. vaginalis. We describe the first hydrogenosomal ASCT enzyme and demonstrate that it has a completely independent origin compared with the mitochondrial ASCT from T. brucei. Purification of Native TvASCT—T. vaginalis NIH-C1 strain (ATCC 30001) was cultured as described (28Diamond L.S. J. Parasitol. 1957; 43: 488-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and trichomonads from 120 ml of culture were collected by centrifugation at 1300 × g for 3 min and washed in 150 mm NaCl solution before being homogenized by ultrasonication (Soniprep 150) in 1.4 ml of milliQ water. Subsequently 100 μl of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added, and the homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used for purification of TvASCT by column chromatography. MonoQ anion exchange chromatography was performed with a monoQ HR5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden). The column was equilibrated with 15% (v/v) glycerol in 20 mm Hepes pH 8.3, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, after which 1 ml of supernatant was loaded. UV absorption was recorded at 254 nm and fractions of 2 ml were collected during the entire run. The column was eluted for 10 min with 15% (v/v) glycerol in 20 mm Hepes pH 8.3, followed by a linear gradient increasing from 0 mm NaCl to 200 mm NaCl in 64 min, and from 200 mm NaCl to 1 m NaCl in 24 min. ASCT Activity Assay—The activity of ASCT was determined by a radioactive assay as described before (17Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In brief, the assay mix contained 1 mm [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (0.2 MBq, Amersham Biosciences), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm succinate (pH 7.4), and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. The assay was started by addition of the lysate, incubated at 20 °C for 30 min, and terminated by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (6% w/v, final concentration). Reaction products were then separated by anion-exchange chromatography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Gene Identification and Recombinant Expression—BLAST searches (29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) for acetyl-CoA hydrolase related sequences in the available T. vaginalis TIGR genome data base were performed using acetyl-CoA hydrolase from S. cerevisiae (ACH1 YBL015W) as a template. Based on the obtained sequence (corresponding to contig 921979, annotated in GenBank™ as XM_001330141) two specific oligonucleotides containing BamHI and PstI sites (underlined) at the initiating methionine and 90-bp downstream of the stop codon, respectively, were designed: 5′-TATAGGATCCATGTTGTCATCATCTTCACGTGCTATC-3′ and 5′-TATACTGCAGAAATTATACCACATTCCCACCCTC-3′. PCR amplification was performed and the predicted 1600-bp DNA fragment was purified from the gel and ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3.1+ and the bacterial expression vector pQE30. The sequences of the resulting constructs were verified by sequencing. TvASCT (in pCDNA 3.1+) was transfected into CHO K-1 cells using Lipofectamine Reagent (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), following the standard, manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Antibody Preparation—Recombinant TvASCT (in pQE30) was expressed by M15 (pREP4) Escherichia coli and purified from inclusion bodies by subsequent lysis with lysosyme (1 mg/ml), sonication (Soniprep 150), and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed two times with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 time with PBS only, after which the pellet was dissolved in 8 m urea, 50 mm glycine, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Solubilized recombinant TvASCT was loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel (9%) and 400 mg of the 57-kDa recombinant protein was excised. The excised protein was confirmed to be TvASCT by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on Q-TOF2 (see below), after which antisera against TvASCT were raised in rabbits by Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). Western Blot Analysis—Samples for Western blot analysis were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7 or 10% gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked with PBS-Tween (0.05%, v/v) containing 5% (w/v) dried milk powder and incubated with 1:10,000 diluted anti-TvASCT rabbit serum in PBS-Tween (0.05%, v/v) containing 5% (w/v) dried milk powder. Subsequently, blots were washed three times with PBS-Tween (0.05%, v/v), followed by incubation with 1:10,000 GAR/IgG(H+L)/PO immunoconjugate (Nordic Immunology, Tilburg, The Netherlands or Sigma-Aldrich, München, Germany) in PBS-Tween (0.05%, v/v) containing 5% (w/v) dried milk powder. After washing three times more with PBS-Tween (0.05%, v/v), signals were visualized using Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Signals were detected and quantified using a Molecular Imager Chemidoc XRS System with Quantity One software (version 4.6.3) (Bio-Rad) or Lumi-Film Chemiluminescent Detection films (Roche Applied Science). Hydrogenosome isolation, two-dimensional electrophoresis, protein in-gel digestion with trypsin, mass spectrometry, and protein identification were carried out as described (30Pütz S. Gelius-Dietrich G. Piotrowski M. Henze K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Neighbor-Net Analysis—Protein sequences were retrieved from GenBank™ and aligned using ClustalW (31Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). Protein LogDet distances (32Lockhart P.J. Steel M.A. Hendy M.D. Penny D. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 605-612PubMed Google Scholar) were calculated with the LDDist program (33Thollesson M. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 416-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All gapped positions in the alignment were removed. The network of sequence similarity was constructed with Neighbor-Net (34Bryant D. Moulton V. Algorithms Bioinform. Proc. 2002; 2452: 375-391Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and visualized with Splitstree (35Huson D.H. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). The dataset is available upon request. Selectable Transformation of T. vaginalis Strain T1—The TvASCT gene was amplified with the specific primers described above but containing NdeI and BamHI sites and introduced into plasmid pTagvag2 (36Hrdý I. Hirt R.P. Dolezal P. Bardonova L. Foster P.G. Tachezy J. Embley T.M. Nature. 2004; 432: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) between a Tvα-SCS 5′-UTR and a Tvmalic enzyme 3′-UTR to yield pTagvagASCT. T. vaginalis T1 cells were electroporated with pTagvagASCT and selected in TYM medium supplemented with G418 (Sigma-Aldrich). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was purified from T. vaginalis cells with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was transferred to HybondN nylon membrane (GE Healthcare, München, Germany) and hybridized with the radioactively labeled coding sequences of TvASCT or TvActin. Signals were detected on SR imaging plates with a FLA3000 Fluorescence scanner version 1.8E and quantified with the Image Gauge software (version 3.0) (Fuji Photo film Co., Düsseldorf, Germany). Detection of ASCT Candidate Gene—Four different enzymes are known to catalyze the conversion of acetyl-CoA into acetate (Fig. 1). The T. vaginalis genome was analyzed for the presence of homologs of the acetate:succinate CoA transferase of T. brucei, acetate kinases and acetyl-CoA synthetases of several organisms, and acetyl-CoA hydrolase of S. cerevisiae. For the first three acetate producing enzymes no significant sequence homologs could be detected in the data base, only for the latter one, the acetyl-CoA hydrolase, significant hits were found. Four high-scoring segment pairs (TVAG_395550, TVAG_113870, TVAG_164890, TVAG_393850) were identified with an open reading frame of 1569 bp encoding a polypeptide of 523 amino acids. The calculated molecular mass of this protein is 57 kDa with a theoretical pI of 7.99 (ProtParam tool). Computer analysis of the predicted protein revealed 55% sequence identity to acetyl-CoA hydrolase from S. cerevisiae. Data base searches with the derived amino acid sequence of this acetyl-CoA hydrolase homolog from T. vaginalis produced no significant matches to typical eukaryotic homodimeric CoA-transferases from eukaryotes such as succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase from human or acetate:succinate CoA-transferase from T. brucei. However, significant similarity was observed with a family of proteins of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. These proteins are annotated as acetyl-CoA hydrolase/acetyl-CoA transferase/succinyl-CoA: CoA-transferase (Fig. 2). Here we define the T. vaginalis homolog of this family of proteins as T. vaginalis acetate:succinate CoA-transferase (TvASCT), as our further experiments showed that this T. vaginalis gene codes for an acetate:succinate CoA transferase. Anti-TvASCT Antibody Generation—For Ab generation TvASCT was expressed in E. coli, which resulted in minor amounts of soluble TvASCT and predominantly in insoluble TvASCT in inclusion bodies. Neither the complete lysate containing all soluble proteins, nor soluble TvASCT purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) showed any detectable ASCT activity. This is in contrast to recombinant expression of the Clostridium kluyveri succinyl-CoA:CoA transferase (cat1), in E. coli, which was active, even though measured enzyme activities were very low (27Söhling B. Gottschalk G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 871-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TvASCT purified from inclusion bodies was subsequently used for antibody generation, which resulted in rabbit sera containing polyclonal antibodies against TvASCT. These antibodies specifically recognized the purified recombinant His tag TvASCT, the recombinant His tag TvASCT in a total lysate of transfected E. coli, and also the native T. vaginalis ASCT in a total lysate (Fig. 3). On the other hand, these antibodies did not recognize any other protein present in a total lysate of E. coli transfected with an empty vector. To further confirm the specificity of the anti-TvASCT antibodies, proteins of the complete hydrogenosomal fraction of T. vaginalis were separated on a two-dimensional gel, blotted and probed with the TvASCT antiserum. This resulted in specific detection of only TvASCT (Supplementary data) because the spots detected were confirmed to be TvASCT by ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. Expression and Subcellular Localization of TvASCT—Two specific oligonucleotides were designed against the open reading frame in contig 921979. This ORF corresponds to the T. vaginalis gene XM_001330141 in GenBank™. A 1569-bp fragment could be amplified by PCR using T. vaginalis cDNA. The fragment was isolated and sequence analysis confirmed the amplification of the TvASCT gene. This result clearly demonstrates that the gene is expressed at the mRNA level. ASCT activity in T. vaginalis has been localized to hydrogenosomes (12Steinbüchel A. Müller M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and therefore, the TvASCT protein sequence is expected to contain a mitochondrial-like targeting sequence, as the import system into hydrogenosomes is comparable to that of mitochondria (37Bradley P.J. Lahti C.J. Plümper E. Johnson P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3484-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 38Häusler T. Stierhof Y.D. Blattner J. Clayton C. Eur. J.

The eight N-terminal amino acids of TvASCT (Fig. 2) and of its three paralogs in the T. vaginalis genome (Supplemental data), strongly fit the consensus of hydrogenosomal targeting sequences (40Carlton J.M.

Johnson P.J. Science. 2007; 315: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The programs TargetP (41Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar), WoLF Psort (42Horton P. Park K.J. Obayashi T. Fujita N. Harada H. Adams-Collier C.J. Nakai K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar), and MitoPred (43Guda C. Guda P. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W372-W374Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) predicted TvASCT to contain a mitochondrial targeting sequence. Therefore TvASCT expression at the protein level was investigated in purified hydrogenosomes. Hydrogenosomal proteins of T. vaginalis were separated by isoelectric focusing in the first dimension and by SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Two 57-kDa protein spots were excised from the Coomassie-stained gels, digested with trypsin and analyzed by ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS (Supplemental data). Sequenced peptides were compared with the T. vaginalis genome data base (TIGR) and all originated from the same ORF in contig 921979 (Table 1). A Western blot of cellular fractions probed with anti-TvASCT antibody showed strong accumulation of TvASCT in the hydrogenosomal fraction (Fig. 4). These observations clearly demonstrate that the TvASCT protein is expressed and located inside hydrogenosomes. The TvASCT gene encodes a protein with ASCT activity.TABLE 1Peptide sequences of protein spots S54 and S55Mass (Da)SequenceaPeptide sequences identified from the described 57-kDa protein spots by mass spectrometry after two-dimensional-gel separation of isolated hydrogenosomal proteins from T. vaginalisTvASCTbThe position of the identified peptides in the amino acid sequence of the TvASCT protein as encoded on contig 9219791114CAYEPYLAK16–241033AEDTIPIFK28–361750SIGWSGFTPVGDPK40–531331VVPIALAEYVEK54–651459IIIELNTAIPSFK179–1911557TSLTLSQWDK326–3351252LYDNFDFYR336–3441670AISNSPE353–3591304LVNGLGGSGDFLR391–4031489EYLNLAIQATQPK481–493a Peptide sequences identified from the described 57-kDa protein spots by mass spectrometry after two-dimensional-gel separation of isolated hydrogenosomal proteins from T. vaginalisb The position of the identified peptides in the amino acid sequence of the TvASCT protein as encoded on contig 921979 Open table in a new tab Expression of TvASCT in CHO Cells—CHO K1 cells were transfected with TvASCT, and the cells were harvested after 24 h. The cells transfected with TvASCT showed a 15-fold increase in ASCT activity, whereas cells containing the empty vector showed no increased ASCT activity (Fig. 5). The amount of ASCT protein in transfected CHO cells was, however, very low and the average ASCT activity was 7 nmol/min per mg protein, which is two orders of magnitude lower than the ASCT activity in T. vaginalis cells (Fig. 6). The observed conversion of a minute amount of acetyl-CoA by untransfected CHO cells might be caused by side activity of the mammalian succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase (SCOT, EC 2.8.3.5) (Ref. 17Van Hellemond J.J.

Wild-type T. vaginalis (WT), T. vaginalis transfected with TvASCT (ASCT), and T. vaginalis transfected with TvFrataxin (Frataxin) were analyzed for TvASCT expression at the level of mRNA transcripts, protein, and enzyme activity by Northern blots, Western blots, and ASCT activity assays, respectively. TvASCT in wild-type T. vaginalis was normalized to 100%, which corresponded to an ASCT activity of 405 nmol/min·mg protein (±101). Shown are the means + S.D. of four measurements in two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Overexpression of TvASCT in T. vaginalis—T. vaginalis T1 cells were transfected with TvASCT in pTagvag2 to yield strain TvtagvagASCT and were selected for transient transformation with G418. Expression of TvASCT was quantified on mRNA, and protein levels in TvtagvagASCT as well as wt T.vaginalis and TvtagvagFrataxin cells (pTagvagFrataxin was kindly provided by Jan Tachezy, Prague) as controls and total cell lysates were assayed for ASCT activity. TvASCT transcript and protein levels in TvtagvagASCT cells were increased to 409 ± 136% and 518 ± 171% of the wild type, respectively, while they remained largely unchanged in Frataxin-overexpressing controls (101 ± 10% and 95 ± 21%, respectively) (Fig. 6). ASCT activity in TvtagvagASCT was raised to 426 ± 54% of the wild type activity and again remained unchanged in TvtagvagFrataxin (115 ± 10%) (Fig. 6). Co-elution of ASCT Activity and TvASCT Protein in Different Protein Purifications—Three principally different column chromatography methods for protein purification were performed using complete T. vaginalis lysates. Fractions were collected and tested for both ASCT activity using an enzyme assay, and for the presence of the TvASCT protein by Western blot. In all experiments, using chromatography based on anion exchange, isoelectrofocusing and size exclusion, the elution pattern of ASCT activity corresponded to that of the TvASCT protein (Fig. 7 and Supplemental data). In all three purification methods ASCT was highly purified as it eluted in fractions containing only a small percentage of the total amount of protein. Combination of the anion exchange and electrofocusing columns could not be used for further purification of the ASCT enzyme since this always resulted in a complete loss of ASCT activity that could not be regained in reconstitution experiments (not shown). In diluted lysates TvASCT activity always declined rapidly, although native TvASCT was stable for days at 4 °C in total cell lysate or during incubation for 15 min at 55 °C, while precipitation with 37.5% (NH4)2SO4 resulted in only 10% activity loss (not shown). Succinate Dependence and Apparent Km for Succinate of TvASCT—Regarding the fact that TvASCT shows a high similarity to the protein family of acetyl-CoA hydrolases/transferases, the succinate dependence of TvASCT was re-examined. Using our specific and sensitive radioactive enzyme assay, in which substrates and end products were identified by anion exchange chromatography, we confirmed that TvASCT is succinate dependent, and therefore, is a true acetate:succinate CoA-transferase and not a hydrolase (Fig. 8, panel A and Ref. 12Steinbüchel A. Müller M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the affinity for succinate of the TvASCT enzyme as determined in a total T. vaginalis lysate, resulted in an apparent Km of 0.36 mm (±0.03) (Fig. 8, panel B) and in an apparent Km of 0.75 mm (±0.05) for TvASCT purified by anion exchange chromatography. Such partially purified enzyme preparations were also used to confirm that TvASCT activity is succinate-dependent (not shown). The apparent Km values were calculated using direct linear plots in EZ-fit (44Perrella F.W. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Recently, the draft genome sequence of T. vaginalis was published (40Carlton J.M. Hirt R.P. Silva J.C. Delcher A.L. Schatz M. Zhao Q. Wortman J.R. Bidwell S.L. Alsmark U.C. Besteiro S.

The Supporting Online Material (SOM) of that manuscript (Table S22) shows a list of all hydrogenosomal proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and ASCT is the only enzyme lacking a complete annotation. Here we demonstrate that the homolog of the acetyl-CoA hydrolase/transferase protein family, present in the T. vaginalis genome data base, functions as the missing ASCT of T. vaginalis, for the following reasons. Firstly, heterologous expression of TvASCT in CHO cells resulted in the expression of an active ASCT enzyme albeit at a very low level when compared with T. vaginalis cells (Fig. 5). Second, homologous overexpression of TvASCT in T. vaginalis resulted in a more than 4-fold increase in TvASCT mRNA and protein levels and also ASCT activity (Fig. 6) Third, upon protein fractionation, using different chromatographic methods, the elution pattern of the activity of ASCT matched with the protein pattern of the acetyl-CoA hydrolase/transferase homolog (Fig. 7 and Supplemental data). Fourth, the T. vaginalis homologs of the acetyl-CoA hydrolase/transferase family contain a hydrogenosomal targeting signal (Fig. 2 and Supplemental data) and we have demonstrated the expression and hydrogenosomal localization of the gene product of at least one of these gene copies (Fig. 3). Finally, no homologs of any of the other known types of acetate producing enzymes (see Fig. 1) are present in the T. vaginalis genome, whereas multiple copies of homologs to the acetyl-CoA hydrolase/transferase protein family have been detected (Supplemental data). Taken together, the total of all our analyses clearly demonstrates that the gene product of this acetyl-CoA hydrolase/transferase homolog functions as the hydrogenosomal ASCT. Therefore, this gene can now be annotated as the T. vaginalis ASCT (TvASCT). TvASCT is thereby the first hydrogenosomal acetate-producing enzyme to be identified in any organism. The reason for the observed loss of activity during subsequent purification steps and the poor heterologous expression of TvASCT are unknown. In this respect it is unknown yet whether or not TvASCT might need a cofactor or post-translational modification for maximal activity. Even though TvASCT belongs to a protein family, which contains acetyl-CoA hydrolases as well as acetyl-CoA transferases, it is a true ASCT, because it converts acetyl-CoA to acetate in a succinate-dependent way (Fig. 8, panel A). This is consistent with the earlier reported characteristics of acetate production in T. vaginalis (12Steinbüchel A. Müller M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). By measure of similarity, ASCT from T. vaginalis hydrogenosomes belongs to a family of proteins annotated as either acetyl-CoA hydrolases or acetyl- or succinyl-CoA transferases. However, it shares no similarity whatsoever with the functionally equivalent mitochondrial SCOT sequences from trypanosomes (25Rivière L. van Weelden S.W. Glass P. Vegh P. Coustou V. Biran M.

A sequence similarity network of acetyl-CoA hydrolase/transferase family sequences (Supplemental data) displays two well defined major groups. Both groups contain prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic sequences. Some proteobacteria (Rhodoferax ferrireducens, Geobacter sp.or Bordetella parapertussis) and firmicutes (Clostridium difficile) are represented in both groups, suggesting an ancient prokaryotic gene duplication. The eukaryotic sequences are divided into two major clusters. All animal sequences form a monophyletic cluster in one of the two major groups of the network, while T. vaginalis, D. discoideum, and the fungi form a separate distinct cluster that is strongly associated with a set of δ-proteobacterial homologs in the other. Functional annotation of most sequences in the network is based on sequence similarity rather than on any biochemical characterization and both major clusters contain sequences annotated as acetyl-CoA transferases, acetyl-CoA hydrolases, and acetyl-CoA transferase/hydrolase family members. Only four of these annotations are supported by biochemical data. The enzyme of the crustacean Artemia franciscana has 4-hydroxybutyrate transferase activity (45Oulton M.M. Amons R. Liang P. MacRae T.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4962-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), while three enzymes of the other major cluster are succinyl-CoA transferase (C. kluyveri) (27Söhling B. Gottschalk G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 871-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), acetyl-CoA hydrolase (S. cerevisiae) (23Buu L.M. Chen Y.C. Lee F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17203-17209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and ASCT (T. vaginalis) (this study), respectively. Thus clustering does not strictly correlate with function in this gene family. Surprisingly, TvASCT does not share any similarity with the mitochondrial ASCT from T. brucei, the only other eukaryotic ASCT identified so far. Furthermore, trypanosomatid ASCT is kinetically different from TvASCT, as demonstrated by their different apparent Km values for succinate; 2.8 ± 0.4 mm for Leishmania mexicana ASCT (17Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and 0.75 ± 0.05 mm for TvASCT. Apparently, two completely different enzymes for succinate-dependent acetate production have evolved independently in ATP-generating organelles. The identification of TvASCT does not only illuminate the identity of the last, unidentified hydrogenosomal protein involved in carbohydrate metabolism, but it also means the identification of a completely different, second class of succinate-dependent acetyl-CoA transferases in eukaryotes.

https://openalex.org/W2035119913,"Both the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)/Smad and the prolactin/JAK/STAT pathway are critical to the proper development, maintenance, and function of the mammary epithelial tissue. Interestingly, opposing physiological effects between these two signaling pathways are prominent in the regulation of mammary gland development. However, the exact nature of the biological network existing between the Smad and STAT signal transduction pathways has remained elusive. We identified a novel regulatory cross-talk mechanism by which TGFβ-induced Smad signaling acts to antagonize prolactin-mediated JAK/STAT signaling and expression of target genes. Furthermore, we found activin, another member of the TGFβ family, to also efficiently block STAT5 signaling and β-casein expression in mammary epithelial cells. Our results indicate that ligand-induced activation of Smad2, -3, and -4 by activin and TGFβ leads to a direct inhibition of STAT5 transactivation and STAT5-mediated transcription of the downstream target genes, β-casein and cyclin D1, thereby blocking vital processes for mammary gland growth and differentiation. Finally, we unveiled the mechanism by which these two signaling cascades antagonize their effects, and we found that activated Smads inhibit STAT5 association with its co-activator CREB-binding protein, thus blocking STAT5 transactivation of its target genes and leading to inhibition of mammary gland differentiation and lactation."

These ligands are believed to transduce the signal through the receptor-activated transcription factors Smad2 and Smad3. However, the roles of smad2/3 genes in development of zebrafish embryos are largely unknown because the presence of multiple smad2/3 genes and their maternal expression have hampered the investigation of their developmental roles. We generated potent and specific dominant-negative forms of zebrafish Smad2, Smad3a, and Smad3b by mutating multiple amino acids. Overexpression of these mutants abolished mesendoderm induction by ectopic Nodal signaling in zebrafish embryos. Expression of dominant-negative smad2/3 abrogated Smad2/3 activities in wild-type embryos and caused various mesendodermal defects similar to those in Nodal-deficient embryos. Smad2/3-deficient cells transplanted into the blastodermal margin of wild-type hosts preferentially differentiated into ectodermal tissues rather than mesendodermal tissues, supporting the idea that response of cells to mesendoderm inducers requires Smad2/3 activities. Interference with Smad2/3 activities in Zoep, Moep, and MZoep mutant embryos resulted in more severe mesendodermal defects.

However, the roles of Smad2 and Smad3 in early development of vertebrate embryos have not been well understood. Genetic studies in mice revealed somewhat controversial results about the function of Smad2 in mesoderm induction. Two groups demonstrated independently that smad2 homozygous mutant mouse embryos fail to undergo gastrulation and lack mesoderm (7Nomura M. Li E. Nature. 1998; 393: 786-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 8Weinstein M. Yang X. Li C. Xu X. Gotay J. Deng C.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9378-9383Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), whereas another group reported that the absence of Smad2 causes the entire epiblast to adopt an extraembryonic mesodermal fate (9Waldrip W.R. Bikoff E.K. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Robertson E.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Another surprising finding is that smad2-deficient cells with the epiblast of chimeric mouse embryos extensively colonize mesodermal and ectodermal populations (10Tremblay K.D. Hoodless P.A. Bikoff E.K. Robertson E.J. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 3079-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although smad3 knock-out mice develop to term without obvious embryonic defects (11Zhu Y.

Vincent S.D. Oxburgh L. Robertson E.J. Bikoff E.K. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 1717-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In Xenopus embryos dorsally expressing a dominant-negative mutant (P445H or D450E) of mammalian smad2 or smad3, mesoderm induction still occurs, although the axis is truncated with partial loss of head structures (15Hoodless P.A. Tsukazaki T. Nishimatsu S. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 364-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which argues that Smad2/3 activities may not be essential for mesendoderm induction in this species. The zebrafish genome expresses at least three smad2/3 genes, i.e. smad2, smad3a, and smad3b (16Dick A. Mayr T. Bauer H. Meier A. Hammerschmidt M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Pogoda H.M. Meyer D. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 334-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Their transcripts are abundant in fertilized eggs and throughout blastulation. Even though large-scale mutagenesis screens have been performed in zebrafish (18Driever W. Solnica-Krezel L. Schier A.F.

Two major impediments hinder the study of the developmental roles of smad2/3 genes by gene knockdown or mutagenesis: (a) the presence of maternal transcripts and proteins that are difficult to remove and (b) the functional redundancy of different smad2/3 genes. In this study, we created dominant-negative mutants of smad2, smad3a, and smad3b, all of which efficiently inhibited TGF-β signaling in vitro. Interference with Smad2/3 activities by overexpressing these mutant forms in zebrafish embryos blocked mesendoderm induction and altered the cell fate of blastodermal marginal cells. Our data indicate that Smad2 and Smad3 play important roles in the mesendoderm by mediating Nodal and non-Nodal signaling during zebrafish embryogenesis. Fish Embryos—The Tuebingen and AB strains were used. Embryos were incubated in Holtfreter's solution at 28.5 °C and staged according to Kimmel et al. (21Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8418) Google Scholar). Adult oep-/- (one-eyed pinhead) fish were obtained by rescuing MZoep embryos (which were laid by oep-/- females mating with oep-/- males) with wild-type oep mRNA. Zoep embryos were generated by crossing oep+/- females with oep-/- males, and Moep embryos were generated by crossing oep-/- females with wild-type males. Generation of Dominant-negative Forms of Zebrafish smad2/3—To generate corresponding dominant-negative alleles, the coding sequences of zebrafish smad2, smad3a, and smad3b were individually amplified by PCR using an upper primer without base substitutes and a lower primer containing base substitutes (underlined below). The primer sequences, which contain an added restriction site, protective bases, and the Kozak sequence (all in lowercase), are as follows: smad2, 5′-ggaattccaccATGTCCTCCATCTTGCCTTTC-3′ (upper primer) and 5′-ccgctcgagTTAGGCCATAGCGGAGCAGCGTACGGAGGGGGAGCCCATCTGGGTCAGAACCTTGTCCAGCCACTGGAGGTGCCCGTTCAGATG-3′ (lower primer); smad3a, 5′-ggaattccaccATGTCAATTTTACCTTTCAC-3′ (upper primer) and 5′-ccgctcgagTTATGCCACAGCGGAGCAGCGGATGGAGGGGGAGCCCATCTGAGTGAGTACTTTGTCCAGCCACTGCAGATGCCCGTTAAGGTG-3′ (lower primer); and smad3b, 5′-ggaattccaccATGTCTATATTGCCTTTCAC-3′ (upper primer) and 5′-ccgctcgagCTATGCCACGGCGGAGCAGCGAAGGTTTGGAGAGCCCATCTGAGTGAGCACCTTGTCCAGCCACTGCAGGTGCCCGTTGAGATG-3′ (lower primer). The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of expression vector pXT7 to generate recombinant plasmid pXT7-dnsmad2, pXT7-dnsmad3a, or pXT7-dnsmad3b. The correct plasmids were identified first by restriction analysis and then by sequencing. These plasmids were used for synthesizing mRNA in vitro. For expression in mammalian cells, the insert in these plasmids was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pCMV5-HA vector to generate plasmid pCMV5-dnsmad2, pCMV5-dnsmad3a, or pCMV5-dnsmad3b, respectively. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—Hep3B cells were cultured at 37 °C in minimum Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and a supply of 5% CO2. Cells were transfected using the polyethyleneimine-mediated transfection method in 24-well plates. The basal transfection plasmid mixture consisted of 100 ng of ARE-luciferase or BRE-luciferase, 15 ng of Renilla, and 35 ng of Fast2. The other components in the transfection plasmid mixtures included 35 ng of constitutively active ALK4, 70 ng of constitutively active BMPR1A, 135 ng (+) or 270 ng (++) of dominant-negative smad2/3a/3b, or 70 ng of smad2/3a/3b. 36 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed with passive lysis buffer. The luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany).

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6078-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For testing morpholino oligonucleotide efficacy, the 5′-UTR and a portion of the coding sequence of zebrafish smad2, smad3a, or smad3b were amplified by PCR and inserted in-frame into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech), resulting in expression plasmid ps2-5′UTR-GFP, ps3a-5′UTR-GFP, or ps3b-5′UTR-GFP, respectively. The DNA of these plasmids was injected alone or co-injected with a corresponding morpholino oligonucleotide. Whole-mount in Situ Hybridization—Digoxigenin-UTP- or fluorescein-UTP-labeled antisense RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription. Whole-mount in situ hybridization followed the standard procedure. Transplantation—Embryos, which were used as donors at later stages, were injected between the one- and two-cell stages with 20 ng of dextran tetramethylrhodamine (Molecular Probes) alone or in combination with 600 pg of dominant-negative smad3b mRNA. Donor and host embryos were dechorionated by treatment in Holtfreter's solution containing 6 mg/ml Pronase MS before transplantation. Approximately 20-50 cells were sucked from the animal pole of a donor at the oblong-to-sphere stages and transplanted into the blastodermal margin of wild-type host embryos at the same stage. Locations of transplanted cells in the hosts were determined by fluorescence stereomicroscopy at the shield stage. Distribution of transplanted cells in the hosts was observed and photographed at 24-26 h post-fertilization (hpf) using a Leica MZ16F fluorescence stereomicroscope. Embryos Injected with smad2/3 Morpholino Oligonucleotides Develop without Observable Defects—Zebrafish smad2, smad3a, and smad3b transcripts are present in one-cell embryos, suggesting that these genes are maternally expressed (16Dick A. Mayr T. Bauer H. Meier A. Hammerschmidt M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Pogoda H.M. Meyer D. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 334-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To study their functions during early development of zebrafish embryos, we first tried to use antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (25Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar) to block translation of each smad2/3 gene. We examined the efficacy of these morpholino oligonucleotides by co-injection with a corresponding gene's 5′-UTR-GFP expression construct and found that smad2-MO1, smad3a-MO1, smad3b-MO1, and smad3b-MO2 were effective (Fig. 1A). Embryos injected with smad2-MO1, smad3a-MO1, smad3b-MO1, or smad3b-MO2 alone displayed different degrees of growth retardation and neural degeneration (Fig. 1, B-E). (Images for smad3b-MO1 injection are not shown.) When co-injected with smad2-MO1, smad3a-MO1, and smad3b-MO2, embryos showed more severe growth retardation (Fig. 1F). We suspected that these morpholino oligonucleotides-induced phenotypes might be caused by off-targeting via p53 activation (23Robu M.E. Larson J.D. Nasevicius A. Beiraghi S. Brenner C. Farber S.A. Ekker S.C. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e78Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Then, we co-injected the smad2/3 morpholino oligonucleotides with a p53 morpholino oligonucleotides. The co-injected embryos showed normal morphology without any apparent mesodermal defects (Fig. 1, C-F). We assume that the inability of smad2/3 knockdown to block mesoderm induction and to cause any developmental defects could be due to the presence of maternal Smad2/3a/3b proteins as well as redundant functions of zygotic smad2/3 products. Generation of Dominant-negative Alleles of Zebrafish smad2, smad3a, and smad3b—We then developed an alternative approach using dominant-negative forms of Smad2/3 as used previously in Xenopus (15Hoodless P.A. Tsukazaki T. Nishimatsu S. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 364-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that mammalian Smad2 mutants carrying an S465A and/or S467A mutation within the SXS motif at their C terminus act as dominant-negative forms to block TGF-β signaling by stably binding to the TGF-β type I receptor and by preventing translocation of Smad2-Smad4 complexes into the nucleus (26Abdollah S. Macias-Silva M. Tsukazaki T. Hayashi H. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 27Souchelnytskyi S. Tamaki K. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28107-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The Smad2(P445H) mutant or its equivalent Smad3 mutant also functions as a dominant-negative allele to inhibit TGF-β signaling by preventing recruitment of Smad4 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to form a transcription activation complex (15Hoodless P.A. Tsukazaki T. Nishimatsu S. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 364-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By placing three mutant amino acids corresponding to P445H/S465A/S467A of mammalian Smad2 into a single molecule, we created dominant-negative forms of zebrafish Smad2, Smad3a, and Smad3b (Fig. 2A). Their effects on TGF-β signaling transduction were tested in mammalian Hep3B cells using the (ARE)3-luciferase reporter system, which uses three copies of the ARE in the Mix.2 promoter (28Huang H.C. Murtaugh L.C. Vize P.D. Whitman M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The expression of this reporter was stimulated by expression of the constitutively active TGF-β receptor ALK4, but this effect was efficiently inhibited by cotransfection of dominant-negative smad2, smad3a, or smad3b (Fig. 2, B-D). Reporter expression was also induced by transfection of zebrafish smad2, smad3a, or smad3b, which was attenuated by cotransfection of dominant-negative smad3b (Fig. 2, E-G) or the other two mutants (data not shown). These results indicate that all three Smad2/3 mutant forms are able to inhibit TGF-β signaling. BMP signals, which are mediated by Smad1/5/8, also play important roles in early patterning of vertebrate embryos, but their roles differ from those of Smad2/3-mediated TGF-β signals (29De Robertis E.M. Kuroda H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 30Schier A.F. Talbot W.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 561-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To test whether the Smad2/3 mutant forms would also interfere with BMP signal transduction, we used the BRE-luciferase reporter system, which has BREs in the promoter (31Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Induction of BRE-luciferase expression by the constitutively active BMP receptor ALK1 was not disturbed by cotransfection of dominant-negative smad3b (e.g. Fig. 2H) or other mutant alleles (data not shown). These results indicate that the inhibitory effects of the dominant-negative Smad2/3 mutants are restricted to Smad2/3-mediated TGF-β signaling. Mesendoderm Induction by Nodal Signals Absolutely Requires Smad2/3 Activities—Nodal signals play a pivotal role in mesendoderm induction (3Tian T. Meng A.M. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 672-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Overexpression of sqt or the constitutively active form (tar*) of acvr1b/taram-a induces ectopic expression of mesoderm and endoderm markers (32Rebagliati M.R. Toyama R. Fricke C. Haffter P. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 33Renucci A. Lemarchandel V. Rosa F. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether our dominant-negative mutants could block the mesendoderm induction activity of sqt or tar* in vivo. When injected with either 0.5 pg of sqt or 5 pg of tar* mRNA, >90% (n > 30) of the embryos displayed dramatic induction of the expression of the organizer-specific marker goosecoid (gsc) and of the mesoderm marker no tail (ntl) (Fig. 3, A-P). In addition, embryos injected with 5 pg of tar* mRNA also showed induction of the endoderm marker sox32 (Fig. 3, Q-W). When the same amount of sqt or tar* mRNA was co-injected with 600 pg of dominant-negative smad2 or smad3b mRNA, however, none of the embryos exhibited induction of gsc, ntl, or sox32 expression. Compared with wild-type embryos, the co-injected embryos had reduced expression of those markers, as did the embryos injected with dominant-negative smad2 or smad3b mRNA alone. Thus, Smad2/3 activities are essential for mesendoderm induction by Nodal signals in zebrafish embryos. Interference with Smad2/3 Activities Inhibits Development of Mesendodermal Tissues in Wild-type Embryos—Next, we investigated the roles of Smad2/3 in the development of zebrafish embryos by injecting mRNAs encoding dominant-negative Smad2/3 into one-cell stage embryos. Injection with an mRNA encoding any of the dominant-negative Smad2/3 mutant forms (Smad2, Smad3a, and Smad3b) or with a mixture of three mRNAs caused similar embryonic defects at 24 hpf (Fig. 4, A-C). The affected embryos could be morphologically classified into two groups. Embryos in the first group showed closer or fused eyes and a slightly curved notochord (Fig. 4A), resembling Zoep mutants (34Schier A.F. Neuhauss S.C. Helde K.A. Talbot W.S. Driever W. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 327-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Zhang J. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The majority of the affected embryos from single injections could be placed in this group (Fig. 4B). Embryos in the second group lacked the head mesoderm, the notochord, anterior somites, and the endoderm, resembling cyc/sqt (36Feldman B. Gates M.A. Egan E.S. Dougan S.T. Rennebeck G. Sirotkin H.I. Schier A.F. Talbot W.S. Nature. 1998; 395: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and MZoep mutants (37Gritsman K. Zhang J. Cheng S. Heckscher E. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). A much higher proportion of embryos co-injected with dominant-negative smad2, smad3a, and smad3b mRNAs, each at a dose of 600 pg, belonged to the second group, suggesting that these mutant forms have the same effect. As in Zoep or MZoep embryos, the expression of the axial mesoderm/ventral neural tube marker sonic hedgehog (shh) was partially or completely lost (Fig. 4C and data not shown). Furthermore, some of the embryos in both groups also had smaller heads. The zebrafish oep locus encodes a membrane-anchoring protein (35Zhang J. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), which acts as the coreceptor for Nodal (3Tian T. Meng A.M. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 672-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38Yeo C. Whitman M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Zoep mutants have maternal oep mRNA but are unable to zygotically express oep mRNA, resulting in an insufficient amount of Nodal signals during early embryogenesis (37Gritsman K. Zhang J. Cheng S. Heckscher E. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). MZoep mutants lack maternal as well as zygotic wild-type oep mRNA and thus are deficient in Nodal signaling (37Gritsman K. Zhang J. Cheng S. Heckscher E. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The similarity between dominant-negative smad2/3-induced and MZoep phenotypes suggests that Smad2/3 activities are required for maternal and zygotic Nodal signaling in mesendoderm induction. To further test the specificity of dominant-negative Smad2/3 in vivo, dominant-negative smad3b mRNA was co-injected with smad3a, smad3b, or smad2 to see if dominant-negative smad3b-induced defects could be rescued. As demonstrated previously (16Dick A. Mayr T. Bauer H. Meier A. Hammerschmidt M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Pogoda H.M. Meyer D. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 334-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 39Sun Z. Jin P. Tian T. Gu Y. Chen Y-G. Meng A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 40Xiong B. Rui Y. Zhang M. Shi K. Jia S. Tian T. Yin K. Huang H. Lin S. Zhao X. Chen Y. Chen Y-G. Lin S.C. Meng A. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 225-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), overexpression of smad3a and smad3b caused embryonic dorsalization, which was characterized by a smaller trunk and tail at 24 hpf, whereas smad2 overexpression had no visible effect on embryonic development. As shown in Fig. 4D, none of the co-injected embryos showed MZoep-like phenotypes, and the ratio of Zoep-like embryos dramatically dropped. On the other hand, the ratio of dorsalized embryos induced by smad3b or smad3a overexpression decreased when co-injected with dominant-negative smad3b. These effects were confirmed by examination of shh expression (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data suggest that dominant-negative smad3b (and dominant-negative smad2/3a) specifically inhibits Smad2/3 functions in vivo. To confirm and extend the effect of dominant-negative Smad2/3 on mesendoderm induction, we examined a set of specific markers by whole-mount in situ hybridization following injection with 600 pg of dominant-negative smad3b mRNA. As shown in Fig. 5 (A-B′), the expression of the shield-specific markers gsc and floating head (flh) was reduced or eliminated in the injected embryos at the shield stage. The injected embryos at the bud stage were missing the shield-derived anterior axial mesodermal (polster) that was labeled by hgg1 expression (Fig. 5, C and C′). ntl is expressed at the shield stage throughout the germ ring, in which cells give rise to mesodermal and endodermal tissues at later stages (Fig. 5D), and its expression in the dorsal germ ring was apparently eliminated in dominant-negative smad3b-injected embryos (Fig. 5D′). Accordingly, the expression of the endoderm markers sox17 and sox32/casanova was inhibited during mid-gastrulation in the injected embryos (Fig. 5, E-F′). Dominant-negative smad3b-induced type II (MZoep-like) embryos did not express shh in the ventral brain and anterior notochord at 26 hpf (Fig. 5, G and G′), and they did not express myoD in the head mesoderm at 48 hpf (H and H′). Furthermore, the ventral mesoderm marker vent showed reduction at the shield stage (Fig. 5, I and I′), and the ventral marker gata1, which labels hematopoietic progenitors, was also reduced at 24 hpf (J and J′), suggesting that development of ventral mesodermal tissues also requires Smad2/3 activities. We conclude that mesendodermal development absolutely requires Smad2/3 functions. In contrast, the ventral ectoderm marker gata2, which is activated by ventral BMP signals, showed expansion (data not shown), implying that Smad2/3 activities play a role in antagonizing the epidermis-inducing activity of BMP signaling. Smad2/3-abrogated Cells in the Blastodermal Margin Differentiate Predominantly into Neural Tissues Instead of Mesendodermal Tissues—Previous studies have demonstrated that a deficiency in Nodal signaling in mouse embryos results in excessive embryonic ectoderm at the expense of mesoderm (41Zhou X. Sasaki H. Lowe L. Hogan B.L. Kuehn M.R. Nature. 1993; 361: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 42Conlon F.L. Lyons K.M. Takaesu N. Barth K.S. Kispert A. Herrmann B. Robertson E.J. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1919-1928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in zebrafish leads to transformation of dorsal mesoderm progenitors into neural fates (36Feldman B. Gates M.A. Egan E.S. Dougan S.T. Rennebeck G. Sirotkin H.I. Schier A.F. Talbot W.S. Nature. 1998; 395: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 43Sampath K. Rubinstein A.L. Cheng A.M. Liang J.O. Fekany K. Solnica-Krezel L. Korzh V. Halpern M.E. Wright C.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 44Feldman B. Dougan S.T. Schier A.F. Talbot W.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 531-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the interference with Smad2/3 functions similarly leads to change in the mesodermal fate of cells in the blastodermal margin of zebrafish embryos. To address this question, we transplanted labeled cells from the animal pole area of a donor embryo at the oblong-dome stages into the blastodermal margin of a wild-type host embryo. Donor embryos were either wild-type or injected with 600 pg of dominant-negative smad3b mRNA. We found that, at 24 hpf, donor wild-type cells gave rise predominantly to mesendodermal cells, including primarily pharyngeal endoderm, notochord, muscle, and blood cells as well as some ectodermal cells (Fig. 6, E-G). For example, 40.9 and 81.8% (n = 22) of host embryos had labeled wild-type cells in the notochord and muscle, respectively. The transplanted wild-type cells also differentiated into neurons and epidermal cells in 45.5% of the host embryos, which were located mainly in the head region, with fewer in the trunk region. In contrast, dominant-negative smad3b-injected cells contributed to the neural tube in 75% (n = 40) of the host embryos, with a large number of injected cells in the head or trunk region or throughout the neural tube (Fig. 6, H-J). We found only 1 of 40 embryos that had two dominant-negative smad3b-injected cells integrated into the notochord. In addition, 32.5% of the host embryos had labeled muscle cells, most of which appeared in the posterior trunk. Taken together, these data suggest that when Smad2/3 activities are inhibited, blastodermal marginal cells preferentially commit to neural fate instead of mesendodermal fate. Thus, Smad2/3 activities are essential for mediating mesendoderm-inducing signals such as Nodal signals. Interference with Smad2/3 Activities in Zoep and Moep Mutants Leads to Loss of More Mesodermal Tissues—Zoep mutants are missing the anterior axial mesoderm, endoderm, and floor plate, but have a notochord and paraxial mesoderm (34Schier A.F. Neuhauss S.C. Helde K.A. Talbot W.S. Driever W. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 327-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that, in Zoep mutants, Smad2/3 could be activated by Nodal signaling in the presence of maternal Oep and that activated Smad2 and Smad3 are sufficient for formation of the trunk mesoderm. We thus expected that overexpression of dominant-negative smad2/3 deteriorates defects in Zoep mutant embryos. We tested this hypothesis by injecting 600 pg of dominant-negative smad3b mRNA into one-cell progeny of oep+/- females and oep-/- males. Of the uninjected embryos used in this experiment, about half (47.4%, n = 95) were Zoep mutants, and the remaining were wild type. At 24 hpf after injection, 48% (n = 177) of the embryos had MZoep-like phenotypes; 32.2% showed Zoep-like phenotypes; and 19.8% appeared normal morphologically (Fig. 7, A-C). To confirm the effect, the injected embryos were examined for shh expression by whole-mount in situ hybridization. We noted that 30.8% (n = 52) of the injected embryos were missing shh expression in the ventral brain and in most of the notochord, a phenotype typical of MZoep mutants; 38.5% of the embryos lacked the ventral brain domain of shh expression, as did Zoep mutants; and the other had a normal shh expression pattern (Fig. 7C). Thus, compared with dominant-negative smad3b injection into wild-type embryos, the ratio of MZoep-like embryos markedly increased when Zoep embryos were injected with dominant-negative smad3b. We suggest that the amount of activated Smad2/3 in Zoep embryos is less and that interference with dominant-negative smad3b transforms Zoep embryos into MZoep embryos more efficiently. We took another approach to test the importance of Smad2/3 activity in mesendoderm induction. By crossing oep-/- females with wild-type (oep+/+) males, we obtained a genetically homogeneous Moep population. Although these embryos lack maternally supplied oep mRNA or its protein product, they do not have detectable abnormalities (37Gritsman K. Zhang J. Cheng S. Heckscher E. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). When injected with 600 pg of dominant-negative smad3b mRNA, 43.5% (n = 69) of the embryos showed MZoep-like morphology, with partial loss of the head at 24 hpf; 39.1% of the embryos were Zoep-like; and only 17.4% of the embryos looked normal (Fig. 7, D and E). These phenotypes were confirmed by shh expression (Fig. 7F). Apparently, interference with Smad2/3 activities by dominant-negative smad3b induced a higher ratio of MZoep- and Zoep-like embryos from Moep embryos than from wild-type embryos, suggesting that Moep embryos have less amounts of Smad2/3 activities. Smad2/3 Proteins May Mediate Non-Nodal Signaling in Mesoderm Induction—To test whether Smad2/3 might have functions in addition to Oep-dependent TGF-β/Nodal signals, we investigated whether overexpression of dominant-negative smad3b in MZoep embryos worsens their anomalies. We obtained MZoep embryos by mating oep-/- females with oep-/- males. The dominant-negative smad3b-injected MZoep embryos had a shortened trunk with 8.5 somites on average (n = 40), whereas uninjected MZoep embryos from the same batch had 16.4 somites (n = 30) (Fig. 7, G and H). This phenomenon was also observed in MZoep mutant embryos treated with the small compound SB431542 (39Sun Z. Jin P. Tian T. Gu Y. Chen Y-G. Meng A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which specifically inhibits ALK4/5/7-mediated TGF-β signaling. Our results support the idea that Oep-independent non-Nodal signals mediated by Smad2/3 play a role in mesoderm induction, particularly in posterior mesoderm formation. In this study, we generated potent and specific dominant-negative alleles of zebrafish smad2, smad3a, and smad3b. Using these mutants, we demonstrated that Smad2/3 activities are required for mesendoderm induction and that Nodal signals exert their biological effects during embryonic development depending on Smad2/3 activities. It appears that injection with dominant-negative smad3b mRNA gives rise to more MZoep-like embryos than injection with dominant-negative smad2 or smad3a mRNA (Fig. 4B). However, dominant-negative smad3b overexpression in mammalian cells also inhibits TGF-β signaling more efficiently than dominant-negative smad2 and smad3a (Fig. 2). The reason for the greater potency of dominant-negative Smad3b is not known. We are unable to speculate the relative importance of different smad2/3 genes for embryonic development in zebrafish. Nevertheless, the facts that smad2, smad3a, and smad3b mRNAs are all present in large amounts during early stages of embryonic development (16Dick A. Mayr T. Bauer H. Meier A. Hammerschmidt M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Pogoda H.M. Meyer D. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 334-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of their wild-type mRNAs can rescue mesendodermal defects induced by dominant-negative smad3b make us believe that these smad2/3 genes play redundant functions in zebrafish embryos. Like zebrafish sqt/cyc double mutants (36Feldman B. Gates M.A. Egan E.S. Dougan S.T. Rennebeck G. Sirotkin H.I. Schier A.F. Talbot W.S. Nature. 1998; 395: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), MZoep embryos are able to develop posterior mesodermal tissues (37Gritsman K. Zhang J. Cheng S. Heckscher E. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that other inducing signals are required for posterior mesoderm formation. We found that interference with Smad2/3 activities in MZoep embryos could further reduce the number of somites as observed at 24 hpf. It is likely that signals for posterior mesoderm induction, which may be other signals rather than Nodal signals, require Smad2/3 activities for their biological functions. One candidate could be derriere, a member of the TGF-β superfamily. In Xenopus, derriere plays a crucial role in mesodermal patterning and development of posterior regions (45Sun B.I. Bush S.M. Collins-Racie L.A. LaVallie E.R. DiBlasio-Smith E.A. Wolfman N.M. McCoy J.M. Sive H.L. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1467-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the zebrafish ortholog of Xenopus derriere has yet to be identified. Although BMP and zygotic Wnt signals have been found to play important roles in the development of ventral/tail mesodermal tissues (46Agathon A. Thisse C. Thisse B. Nature. 2003; 424: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 47Ramel M.C. Buckles G.R. Baker K.D. Lekven A.C. Dev. Biol. 2005; 287: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we could exclude the possibility that Smad2 and Smad3 mediate such functions of these signals because dominant-negative smad2/3 failed to block BMP signaling (see above) or β-catenin-induced bozozok expression (data not shown). The fact that interference with Smad2/3 activities or smad3b overexpression in MZoep embryos is still able to influence neural induction and patterning also supports the idea that Smad2/3 activities mediate non-Nodal signals in neural development. The dominant-negative forms of smad2/3, which harbor three mutant residues, specifically and efficiently inhibit Smad2/3 activities. We also made mutant forms of zebrafish Smad3b by mutating the two serine residues within the SXS motif at its C terminus or by substituting Pro401 with histidine only. These two mutant forms were much less effective in blocking mesendoderm induction of zebrafish embryos (data not shown). Dominant-negative Smad2/3 with three mutant residues may be used to investigate the tissue- or organ-specific roles of Smad2/3 activities through inducible expression systems, such as the heat shock-inducible (48Halloran M.C.

Mutation of 5 of 8 highly conserved residues in the pore helix/selectivity filter region inactivated the channel (C2533A, G2541A, G2545A, G2546A, and G2547A). Of the remaining three mutants, C2527A and R2543A were partially active and G2549A behaved like wild type receptor. Mutation of a putative glycine hinge residue in the S6 helix (G2586A) or a putative gating residue at the cytosolic end of S6 helix (F2592A) had minimal effects on function, although channel function was inactivated by G2586P and F2592D mutations. The mutagenesis data are interpreted in the context of a structural homology model of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor.

The mutagenesis data are interpreted in the context of a structural homology model of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3 Rs) 3The abbreviations used are: IP3Rinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptorIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateRyRryanodine receptorpSpicosiemens. 3The abbreviations used are: IP3Rinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptorIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateRyRryanodine receptorpSpicosiemens. are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane that are co-activated by IP3 and Ca2+ (reviewed in Ref. 1Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ released through these channels can activate a diverse array of physiological processes, depending on the amplitude and frequency of Ca2+ release (2Berridge M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The IP3R contains a ligand-binding domain in the N-terminal region (amino acids 226-576) and six transmembrane segments (S1-S6; amino acids 2276-2590) in the C-terminal region of the receptor (3Michikawa T.

Several key aspects of IP3R function remain to be addressed, including the identification of critical residues that line the channel conduction pore and the exact mechanism of the IP3-activated gating process. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ryanodine receptor picosiemens. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ryanodine receptor picosiemens. In common with many voltage-gated ion channels, the IP3R and its close relative the ryanodine receptor (RyR) contain a short luminal pore helix and a selectivity filter (1Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). In the IP3R, these are located between the S5 and S6 helices. Experimental evidence suggests that the minimal channel domain of the IP3R lies in the portion of the receptor encoded by the sequences distal to the S5 helix (5Ramos-Franco J. Galvan D. Mignery G. Fill M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previous mutagenesis studies of this region of the IP3R have focused on the selectivity filter sequence 2547GVGD2550 (numbering according to rat type-I IP3R). The results showed that the V2548I mutation increased conductance through the channel (6Boehning D. Joseph S.K. Mak D.D. Foskett J.K. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 117-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Dellis O. Dedos S.G. Tovey S.C. Taufiq U.R. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), that the D2550A mutation inactivated channel function (6Boehning D. Joseph S.K. Mak D.D. Foskett J.K. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 117-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and that the D2550E mutation decreased the divalent cation selectivity of the channel (6Boehning D. Joseph S.K. Mak D.D. Foskett J.K. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 117-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Examination of the sequences of all three IP3Rs and RyR isoforms from several species in the region of the putative pore helix and selectivity filter indicates the presence of 8 highly conserved residues. In the present study, we have examined the effect of mutating these conserved amino acids on IP3R function. The N-terminal ligand-binding domain and the channel domain of the receptor show a direct intersubunit interaction in the tetrameric channel (8Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A model for the gating mechanism of the IP3R channel has been proposed in which the N-terminal region of the receptor interacts with the channel domain at sites located in the cytosol-exposed S4-S5 linker (9Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The S4-S5 linker is an amphipathic helix lying parallel to the membrane and is proposed to lead to the constriction of the S6 porelining helix bundle at the cytosolic aspect of the membrane (9Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Long S.B. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain resulting from IP3 binding cause a mechanical movement of the S4-S5 linker that releases the constriction of the S6 helix bundle and allows Ca2+ ions to exit the channel (9Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In other ion channels, it has been suggested that the gating process is associated with the bending of the S6 helix at proline or glycine residues (11Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 12del Camino D. Holmgren M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Nature. 2000; 403: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). A conserved glycine (Gly2586) is present in the S6 helix of IP3Rs, and we have investigated its putative role as a molecular hinge in the present study. The possible gating role of a bulky hydrophobic residue (Phe2592) at the constricted cytosolic end of the S6 helix has also been investigated. Cys2610 and Cys2613 in the sequence context 2610CFIC2613 of the C-terminal tail downstream of the transmembrane region has previously been shown to be essential for channel function (9Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The intervening Phe2611 and Ile2612 residues are completely conserved in all IP3R and RyR isoforms. The functional importance of these conserved residues has also been examined in the present study. The results presented here define some of the essential residues for channel function in the pore helix/selectivity filter/S6 helix segment of the IP3R. The data are interpreted in the context of a structural homology model of the IP3R. 4P. C. da Fonseca and E. P. Morris, manuscript in preparation. Although the results confirm the critical importance of residues that are presumed to be located at the entrance and exit of the selectivity filter, they also indicate that residues that are more distant from the pore may also be important for the functional integrity of the channel. Several different mutations in the pore that caused partial effects on channel function also produced unanticipated changes in Ca2+ regulation of the receptor. The data suggest that the putative glycine hinge and hydrophobic gate do not function as predicted or that alternative residues fulfill these roles. The study also confirms the specific importance of Cys2610 and Cys2613 in channel function rather than the sequence context of the intervening conserved residues. Expression Cloning—The cDNA encoding the IP3R type-I in pCMV3 was a kind gift of Dr. Thomas Südhof (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). All amino acid numbering is with reference to the rat type-I IP3R (15Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The splice variant used in this study was SI (-), SII (+), SIII (-). All point mutants were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) utilizing a cassette encompassing the BstBI/XbaI fragment of the type-I IP3R in pBluescript (Invitrogen). Mutants were confirmed by sequencing, and the BstBI/XbaI-digested inserts were subcloned into the full-length IP3R. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were grown on 100- or 150-mm plates (Sarstedt) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 0.04 mg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen) until 70-80% confluent. Transfections typically were done overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. LT-1 (Mirus) and NovaFECTOR (VennNova, Inc.) were used together during transfections, and each was added at a cationic lipid/DNA ratio of 1:1. Transfections typically involved 5 and 20 μg of DNA for 100- and 150-mm plates, respectively. Co-transfections were done on 100-mm plates with 5 μg of IP3R and 5 μg of SERCA2b. After 16 h, serum containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added, and cells were allowed to grow for 48-72 h. DT40 cells were cultured, and stable cell lines were prepared as described (16Khan M.T. Bhanumathy C.D. Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32983-32990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Wagner L.E. Betzenhauser M.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of DT40 cells was carried out using experimental conditions described previously (17Wagner L.E. Betzenhauser M.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), except that nucleofection reagents (Amaxa) were employed. Identification of transfected cells was facilitated by cotransfection with the red fluorescent protein plasmid pHcRed1-N1 (BD Biosciences) (17Wagner L.E. Betzenhauser M.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Preparation of Microsomal Vesicles—COS-7 cells were harvested in isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA). The cell suspension was then lysed by 6-8 passes through a 26½-gauge needle. Lysates were spun at 750 × g for 5 min. The KCl concentration was brought up to 600 mm, and the supernatants were spun at 115,000 × g for 50 min. The pellets were resuspended in resuspension buffer A for flux assays (500 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 120 mm KCl, 50 μm EGTA). 45Ca2+ Flux Assays—Assays were performed as previously described (18Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomal vesicles prepared from COS-7 expressing SERCA2b and IP3R were incubated for 25 min at 30 °C in a 200 nm Ca2+ buffer (unless stated otherwise) supplemented with ATP and an ATP-regenerating system, 45Ca2+, and 2 μm ruthenium red. 45Ca2+ uptake was estimated in the absence of any addition or in the presence of 10 μm IP3 or 1 μm A23187. After incubation, microsomes were vacuum-filtered over a 0.3-μm filter (Millipore Corp.) and washed (150 mm KCl). Filters were counted in Budget-Solve complete counting mixture (Research Products International, Corp.). An unpaired Student's t test was used to assess statistical significance of differences in flux assays of the various mutant constructs. GraphPad QuickCalcs software (available on the World Wide Web) was used for all statistical analyses. Digital Imaging of [Ca2+]i in Intact Cells—Transfected DT40-TKO cells were washed once in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HEPES-PSS), containing 5.5 mm glucose, 137 mm NaCl, 0.56 mm MgCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Cells were then resuspended in bovine serum albumin HEPES-PSS with 1 μm Fura-2/AM (Teflabs Inc., Austin, TX), placed on a 15-mm glass coverslip in a low volume perfusion chamber, and allowed to adhere for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were perfused continuously for 10 min with HEPES-PSS before experimentation to allow complete Fura-2 de-esterification. Cytosolic [Ca2+] imaging was performed as described previously (17Wagner L.E. Betzenhauser M.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Fura-2 imaging of COS-7 cells was carried out as published previously (19Bhanumathy C.D. Nakao S.K. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3722-3730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Single-channel Recordings—DT40 cells stably transfected with either the wild type or mutant type-I IP3R were rinsed twice with bath solution and placed onto a 35-mm plastic tissue culture dish and allowed to adhere for 10 min. Recording electrodes were created from borosilicate glass capillary pipettes (Warner Instruments) using a laser pipette puller and fire-polished to a final resistance between 10 and 20 megaohms. Cell membrane resistances were greater than 5 gigaohms, and capacitances were greater than 8 picofarads. IP3R single-channel currents were recorded in the whole cell patch clamp configuration. Records were digitized at a sampling frequency of 20 kHz using an Axopatch 200B and Pclamp 9 software and filtered at 5 kHz with a four-pole Bessel filter. Bath solution contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 500 μm BAPTA, 270 μm CaCl2 ([Ca+2]free = 228 nm), pH 7.1. Pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 100 μm BAPTA, 48.7 μm CaCl2 ([Ca+2]free = 187 nm), pH 7.1. Homology Modeling—Details on the building of the models of the IP3R pore in its closed and open conformations are described elsewhere. 4P. C. da Fonseca and E. P. Morris, manuscript in preparation. In brief, these models resulted from a comprehensive amino acid sequence analysis of IP3R and its comparison with the sequences from RyR and K+ channels. The resulting sequence comparisons were used for the construction of homology models using the crystal structures of KirBac1.1 (Protein Data Base accession number 1P7B (20Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar)) and MthK (Protein Data Base accession number 1LNQ (21Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar)) as templates for closed and open conformations, respectively. Subsequently, the two models were subjected to energy minimization protocols. Role of Conserved Residues in the Pore Helix and Selectivity Filter—IP3Rs and RyRs share the greatest sequence homology in the C-terminal channel domains. In common with other voltage-gated channels, the IP3R pore domain is made up of four structurally conserved regions, notably an outer helix (S5), a pore helix, a selectivity filter, and a pore-lining inner helix (S6). Sequence alignments of all three IP3R isoforms and the type-I RyR in the region encoding the putative pore helix, selectivity filter, and inner helix are shown in Fig. 1. In our initial studies, we focused on several highly conserved residues in the pore helix and selectivity filter region, between residues 2533 and 2550 (Fig. 1). In order to aid in the interpretation of the data, we have utilized a homology model of the pore region of the IP3R in its closed state constructed using the KirBac1.1 channel as a template. 4P. C. da Fonseca and E. P. Morris, manuscript in preparation. The locations of the conserved residues in this model are shown in Fig. 2, except for Asp2550, which is not shown, since it was not investigated in the present studies. We have previously shown that the mutation D2550A functionally inactivates the channel (22Boehning D. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13509-13512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Homology model of the IP3R pore region. Homology models of the pore region of the IP3R have been calculated using KirBac1.1 as a template.4 The eight conserved residues of the pore helix/selectivity filter region that have been mutated in the present study are color-coded.

B, homology model viewed along the membrane with two subunits removed to reveal the selectivity filter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test if mutations of the conserved residues to alanine affect function, we employed a 45Ca2+ flux assay using microsomal vesicles prepared from COS-7 cells co-transfected with various mutant IP3R constructs along with the Ca2+ pump, SERCA2b. The assay measures the activity of transfected rather than endogenous IP3Rs and has been described in detail elsewhere (8Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The first lane in Fig. 3B shows the IP3-mediated inhibition of 45Ca2+ flux in microsomes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected only with SERCA2b (no recombinant IP3Rs) and confirms the negligible contribution from endogenous IP3Rs in this assay (9Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The eight pore helix and selectivity filter conserved residue mutants studied here (C2527A, C2533A, G2541A, R2543A, G2545A, G2546A, G2547A, and G2549A) were transiently expressed in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 3A). When co-expressed with type-III IP3Rs, all mutants were found to form hetero-oligomers as detected by co-immunoprecipitation assays (data not shown). The 45Ca2+ flux data in Fig. 3B indicate that the alanine substitutions fell into two groups: mutants that had a complete loss of function and mutants that displayed no loss of function or had conditional effects dependent upon the type of amino acid substitution (summarized in Fig. 1). The mutations that were entirely nonfunctional were C2533A, G2541A, G2545A, G2546A, and G2547A (Fig. 3B). In the homology model, Cys2533 and Gly2541 are located at the two ends of the pore helix (Fig. 2B). A mutation analogous to C2533A in RyR1 has been shown to be unresponsive to caffeine when expressed in dyspedic 1B5 myotubes (23Hurne A.M. O'Brien J.J. Wingrove D. Cherednichenko G. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36994-37004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mutations analogous to the IP3R mutant G2541A in mouse RyR2 (G4820A), rabbit RyR2 (G4822A), or human RyR1 (G4890R) showed diminished sensitivity to caffeine (24Zhao M.C. Li P. Li X.L. Zhang L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31760-31771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Crystal structures indicate that the pore helix makes strong interactions with the selectivity filter in KcsA channels (28Cordero-Morales J.F. Cuello L.G. Zhao Y. Jogini V. Cortes D.M. Roux B. Perozo E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and with the S5/S6 helices in KCNQ1 K+ channels (29Seebohm G. Westenskow P. Lang F. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. 2005; 563: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It seems likely therefore that mutation of the highly conserved residues Cys2533 and Gly2541 of the pore helix could also alter the structure of these other domains and cause the observed functional impairments. According to the homology model, Gly2545, Gly2546, Gly2547, and Gly2549, along with Val2548, would make up the selectivity filter of the IP3R (Fig. 2). As described above, the substitution of these glycine residues by alanine results in nonfunctional channels (Fig. 3B). Mutation of other ion channels in this region has been shown to have major effects on ion conduction (30MacKinnon R. Yellen G. Science. 1990; 250: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 31Yellen G. Jurman M.E. Abramson T. MacKinnon R.

However, an alanine mutation of the adjacent glycine (corresponding to the IP3 R Gly2546) in RyR2 retained a K+ conductance of 500 pS compared with 700 pS for the wild type receptor and also retained a normal sensitivity to caffeine (24Zhao M.C.

In recent studies, a mutation analogous to G2547A in Drosophila IP3R (G2630S) has been shown to be nonfunctional when analyzed in planar lipid bilayer experiments using Ba2+ as the current carrier (35Srikanth S. Wang Z. Tu H. Nair S. Mathew M.K. Hasan G. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3634-3646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the basis of the available data, it would appear that the severity of the effects of mutating the three adjacent glycines in IP3Rs is greater than the effects seen in RyRs, at least for the positions corresponding to Gly2546 and Gly2547. It would be premature to conclude that these differences reflect differences in the structure of the pore of the two channels. A bulkier isoleucine residue in the selectivity filter of RyRs replaces Val2548 in IP3Rs. This may contribute to a greater stability of the selectivity filter of RyRs and a higher resistance to alanine substitution of the preceding glycines. Additionally, the apparent discrepancies between the effects of these mutations in IP3R and equivalent mutations in RyR could also be related to the widely different assay procedures and experimental conditions used to monitor channel function (see below). Within the selectivity filter, the only mutant that showed no loss of function was G2549A (Fig. 3B). Mutation of the Asp2550 position to alanine or asparagine completely inactivates the IP3R channel (22Boehning D. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13509-13512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fact that the adjacent Gly2549 is tolerant to alanine substitution at this critical location suggests that this residue may be located in a somewhat flexible region that is not at the narrowest part of the pore. This is consistent with the fact that in the homology model, the residues Gly2545, Gly2546, and Gly2547 of each subunit of the tetrameric assembly form interactions with the equivalent residue of adjacent subunits, but Gly2549 does not seem to form such interactions and therefore is likely to have higher radial flexibility. 4P. C. da Fonseca and E. P. Morris, manuscript in preparation. However, only a limited flexibility is predicted, since substitution of bulkier residues, such as G2549C or G2549W, completely inactivates channel flux (Fig. 3B). It is noteworthy that mutations to alanine of the analogous position in mouse or rabbit RyR2 also did not affect caffeine responses or single-channel conductance measured with K+ as current carrier (24Zhao M.C. Li P. Li X.L. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen SRW J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Du G.G. Guo X. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31760-31771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the substitution of a glutamate at the corresponding position in human RyR1 completely inactivates the channel (27Avila G. O'Connell K.M. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 36Du G.G. Khanna V.K. Guo X. MacLennan D.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Two of the alanine mutants showed partial function in the 45Ca2+ flux assays (Fig. 3B). Cys2527 and Arg2543 had 49 and 87% of the functional activity of wild type receptors, respectively. It should be noted that the partial effects were independent of experimental variation in the protein expression of the mutant constructs (data not shown). In the homology model of the IP3R, Cys2527 is in a loop at the luminal end of the pore helix (Fig. 2). The possibility that Cys2527 and Cys2533 may form an intrasubunit disulfide bond appears unlikely, since the effect of mutating Cys2527 and Cys2533 on 45Ca2+ fluxes is not equivalent (Fig. 3B). By contrast, mutation of each cysteine in RyR1 completely inactivates caffeine responses (23Hurne A.M. O'Brien J.J. Wingrove D. Cherednichenko G. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36994-37004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but differential effects of the two mutants on other functional parameters, such as single-channel conductance, have not been examined. Complete inactivation of IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release was also reported for Cys2527 stably expressed in DT40 cells (37Higo T. Hattori M. Nakamura T. Natsume T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 2005; 120: 85-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although the R2543A is defined in this study as a partially functioning mutant because its response is statistically different from wild type receptors, this mutant nevertheless retains a significant functional activity. The Arg2543 residue is situated in the homology model at the C-terminal end of the pore helix (Fig. 2). The presence of four positive charges close to the permeation pathway of a divalent cation might be anticipated to strongly impede i"

CBMs bind to their ligands with high affinity and increase the efficiency of the catalytic components by targeting the enzymes to its substrate. Here we utilized a multidisciplinary approach to characterize each of the two family 16 carbohydrate-binding domain components of the highly active mannanase from the thermophile Thermoanaerobacterium polysaccharolyticum. These represent the first crystal structures of family 16 CBMs. Calorimetric analysis showed that although these CBMs demonstrate high specificity toward β-1,4-linked sugars, they can engage both cello- and mannopolysaccharides. To elucidate the molecular basis for this specificity and selectivity, we have determined high resolution crystal structures of each of the two CBMs, as well as of binary complexes of CBM16-1 bound to either mannopentaose or cellopentaose. These results provide detailed molecular insights into ligand recognition and yield a framework for rational engineering experiments designed to expand the natural repertoire of these targeting modules.

The turnover of photosynthetically fixed carbon through the action of microbial glycoside hydrolases has been estimated to be of the order of 1011 tons annually (1Coughlan M.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 13: 405-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consequently, glycoside hydrolases play a key role in the global carbon cycle, and their properties, if well harnessed, will enhance the release of substrates (monomeric sugars) critical to the use of cellulosic materials in the biofuel industry. For most glycoside hydrolases, such as bacterial cellulases and xylanases, the polypeptides are organized in a modular arrangement that usually consists of a catalytic domain and an associated carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). 2The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; PDB, Protein Data Bank; SeMet, selenomethionine. 2The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; PDB, Protein Data Bank; SeMet, selenomethionine. These modules may be joined through linkers that are rich in proline, serine, and threonine (2Ahsan M.M. Kimura T. Karita S. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5732-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The evolutionary rationale that led to these complex molecular architectures is currently unclear (3Bolam D.N. Xie H. White P. Simpson P.J. Hancock S.M. Williamson M.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2468-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that CBMs attain multivalency through multiplicity (4Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be hypothesized that multiple CBMs act synergistically to bind to their target ligand, leading to an increased accessibility of the catalytic domain to the target polysaccharide. This view is supported by studies on a recombinant double CBM, constructed by fusing family 1 CBMs of two Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolases via a linker peptide (5Linder M. Salovuori I. Ruohonen L. Teeri T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21268-21272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A 5–10-fold increase in the affinity for crystalline cellulose was observed for the double CBM compared with the individual modules, and similar results were observed for two CBMs of Cellulomonas fimi xylanase 11A (3Bolam D.N. Xie H. White P. Simpson P.J. Hancock S.M. Williamson M.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2468-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, in some arrangements, the affinity for substrates increases with multiplicity of CBMs, and this appears to occur frequently in hyperthermophiles and thermophiles (6Boraston A.B. Kwan E. Chiu P. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6120-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Contrary to these finding, a report on the product of a manA gene of Caldicellulosiruptor strain RT8B.4 with two N-terminal CBMs showed no relationship between binding affinity and multiplicity of CBMs (7Sunna A. Gibbs M.D. Bergquist P.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar conclusions were also obtained from studies based on a Thermotoga neapolitana xylanase flanked by two different CBMs (7Sunna A. Gibbs M.D. Bergquist P.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis that may explain multiplicity of CBMs in glycoside hydrolases is to increase the diversity of their target polysaccharides or substrates, because polysaccharides found in plant cell walls are heterogeneous in nature. The Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 xylanase 5 seems to support this hypothesis. In this polypeptide, there is a C-terminal family 22 and an N-terminal family 9 CBM, respectively (8Ito Y. Tomita T. Roy N. Nakano A. Sugawara-Tomita N. Watanabe S. Okai N. Abe N. Kamio Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6969-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The family 22 CBM binds to xylan, whereas the family 9 CBM binds to cellulose (4Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate-binding modules have been identified in over 100 β-1,4-glucanases (9Bolam D.N. Ciruela A. McQueen-Mason S. Simpson P. Williamson M.P. Rixon J.E. Boraston A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10Walden H. Taylor G.L. Lorentzen E. Pohl E. Lilie H. Schramm A. Knura T. Stubbe K. Tjaden B. Hensel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 861-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and aside from increasing the relative concentration of their respective enzymes on the surface of the substrate, they may also modify substrates into amorphous forms and thus make available to the catalytic domain a more easily degradable substrate (11Black G.W. Rixon J.E. Clarke J.H. Hazlewood G.P. Theodorou M.K. Morris P. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Din N. Forsythe I.J. Burtnick L.D. Gilkes N.R. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Southall S.M. Simpson P.J. Gilbert H.J. Williamson G. Williamson M.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This is perhaps the case for the two CBMs found in the highly active mannanase (ManA) of Thermoanaerobacterium polysaccharolyticum, because their removal compromises enzyme activity (14Cann I.K. Kocherginskaya S. King M.R. White B.A. Mackie R.I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The widespread association of CBMs with glycoside hydrolases suggests that enzyme adsorption play a critical role in the degradation of polysaccharides. Insoluble plant cell wall polysaccharides such as cellulose hold a lot of promise as future substrates for energy production. Understanding the mechanism of CBM-mediated adsorption to β-glucan may therefore be critical to our capacity to fully utilize energy crops as substrates for industrial processes, especially for the biofuels industry. In an effort to understand the influence of the T. polysaccharolyticum carbohydrate-binding modules on the enzymatic activity of the parental protein, we have used bioinformatics to delineate its two linker-less CBMs and carried out biochemical and structural studies on the resultant polypeptides. This represents the first comprehensive structure-thermodynamic analysis of family 16 carbohydrate-binding modules. Here we show that the first and second carbohydrate-binding modules from T. polysaccharolyticum (TpolCBM16-1 and Tpol-CBM16-2, respectively) display high affinity for β1,4-glucose and β1,4-mannose polymers and provide a quantitative assessment of ligand binding using isothermal titration calorimetry. We also present four different high resolution x-ray crystallographic structures as follows: 1) TpolCBM16-1, determined to resolution of 1.5 Å; 2) TpolCBM16-2, determined to 1.9 Å resolution; 3) the co-crystal structure TpolCBM16-1 bound to cellopentaose, determined to 1.2 Å resolution; and 4) the co-crystal structure of TpolCBM16-1 bound to mannopentaose, determined to 2.2 Å resolution. These structures demonstrate that each module contains a single cleft, with two aromatic residues located at the base and along one face and two stretches of polar residues on either side of this cleft, which constitutes the ligand-binding site. The molecular basis for both plasticity in ligand selectivity and specificity by these modules is discussed. Protein Expression and Purification—The genes encoding the first and second carbohydrate-binding module from T. polysaccharolyticum were cloned by PCR. To amplify the gene segment encoding TpolCBM16-1, a forward primer with the sequence 5′-CATATGgtaaacatggtgagcaaccggg, with an engineered NdeI restriction site (shown in capitals) preceding the start codon, and a reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGctaaacttccaccagatatacatcatcca, with an engineered XhoI site (shown in capitals) after a termination codon, were used with the manA gene as the template. The ManA TpolCBM16-2 was also amplified by PCR with forward primer (5′-CATATGtccaatttaatagtgaacggaacagc) and reverse primer (5′-CTCGAGctatacttcaacgagcgtgatattatcg). Note that these two primers also contained engineered NdeI and XhoI sites in the forward and reverse primers, respectively. Each TpolCBM16 encoding sequence was cloned into a TA cloning vector, pGEM-T (Promega), and sequenced to confirm the correctness of the coding sequence. Each gene was then removed and inserted into a modified pET-28 plasmid (Novagen) bearing an N-terminal polyhistidine tag and a thrombin digestion site preceding the inserted gene. The modification in the pET28 vector was the replacement of the gene encoding kanamycin resistance with that encoding ampicillin resistance. The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Escherichia coli expression strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with the appropriate expression vectors, and single colonies of transformed E. coli were used to inoculate 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Five hours following inoculation, the small scale culture was added to 1 liter of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) for growth at 37 °C. When the A600 nm of the culture reached 0.3, protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were further grown for 6 h. Bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation (4000 × g for 1 h) and resuspended in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Resuspended cells were disrupted by multiple passes through an Avestin C5 Emulsiflex French press cell, and insoluble aggregates and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation (15 000 × g for 1 h). Recombinant proteins were purified from the clarified supernatant by virtue of the N-terminal polyhistidine tag using a Talon resin column (Clontech) charged with cobalt chloride. Following elution from the cobalt affinity resin, the cleavable polyhistidine tag was removed using thrombin (1 unit/mg protein; GE Healthcare). The protein was further purified by anion exchange (5 ml HiTrap Q; GE Healthcare) and size exclusion chromatographies (Superdex 75 16/60; GE Healthcare) prior to crystallization. Site-specific variants were purified in essentially the same manner. Selenomethionine-incorporated TpolCBM1 was produced by the method of Van Duyne et al. (15Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) and purified in the manner described above except that 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to all of the buffers. The protein samples were estimated to be greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. Affinity Gel Electrophoretic Mobility Assays—Assays to monitor the binding of TpolCBM16-1 and TpolCBM16-2 to soluble substrates were performed as described by Tomme et al. (16Tomme P. Creagh A.L. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 35: 13885-13894Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) in the absence of SDS. 2-Mercaptoethanol was excluded from the loading buffer, and the proteins were not heated at 95 °C prior to loading to the gel. Complexes were resolved on a nondenaturing separating 12% polyacrylamide gel utilizing 0.1% of the following soluble polysaccharide substrates: carboxymethyl cellulose, locust bean gum (galactomannan polysaccharide), or xylan. In all experiments the same proteins were run simultaneously in the control gel without incorporated soluble substrates. The electrophoresis was carried out at 100 V at 4 °C for 3 h. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Measurements were made at 25 °C using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc, Northhampton, MA) following the manufacturer's recommended procedures. All samples were extensively dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and all ligands were dissolved in the same buffer. The protein sample (100–200 μm), in a 1.4399-ml reaction cell, was injected with 28 successive 10-μl aliquots of ligand (1–1.5 mm) at 300-s intervals. Based on the results from our crystallographic experiments, the number of binding sites was presumed to be one. Data were fitted by nonlinear regression using a single site model (MicroCal Origin), and thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the Gibbs free energy equation (ΔG = ΔH - TΔS), and the relation -RT lnKa =ΔG. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Initial crystallization conditions were established by the sparse-matrix sampling methods using commercial and homemade screens. Refinement of promising conditions yielded large crystals suitable for diffraction analysis. Crystals of TpolCBM16-1, Tpol-CBM16-2, TpolCBM16-1-cellopentaose, and Tpol-CBM16-1-mannopentaose complexes were all grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. For crystallization of native and SeMet-labeled TpolCBM16-1, 2 μl of protein sample (20 mg/ml, in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) was added to 2 μl of precipitant (3 m sodium formate, pH 7, 15% ethylene glycol) and equilibrated over a well containing the precipitant solution at 20 °C. Crystals grew within a week and reached a maximum size of 0.3 × 0.4 × 0.6 mm. As the crystallization precipitant proved to be suitable for cryo-protection, single crystals were harvested straight from the crystallization drop and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. Co-crystals TpolCBM16-1-cellopentaose complex were grown by adding 2 μl of protein sample (20 mg/ml, in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm cellopentaose) to 2 μl of precipitant (30% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 200 mm MgCl2) and equilibrating over a well containing the precipitant solution at 20 °C. Crystals grew within 3 days and reached a maximum size of 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm. Prior to flash-cooling, crystals were briefly soaked in the precipitant solution supplemented with either 20% methylpentane diol or glycerol. Co-crystals of the TpolCBM16-1-mannopentaose complex were grown by adding 2 μl of protein sample (20 mg/ml, in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm mannopentaose) to 2 μl of precipitant (1.6 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10% dioxane) and equilibrating the mixture over a well containing the precipitant solution at 20 °C. Crystals grew within 7 days and reached a maximum size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.4 mm. Prior to flash-cooling, crystals were briefly soaked in the precipitant solution supplemented with 25% glycerol. Initial screening with TpolCBM16-2 established sodium formate as a viable precipitant for crystallization. These crystals grew as thin needles and could not be improved upon despite extensive screening. Sequence gazing showed that Tpol-CBM16-2 contained a cysteine (Cys74) at a position occupied by Phe76 in TpolCBM16-1. Reasoning that Cys74 may be fairly reactive, TpolCBM16-2 was incubated with 1 mm of mercury(II) acetate, to cap this residue, prior to crystallization trials. Large single crystals of CBM16-2 were grown by adding 2 μl of protein sample (20 mg/ml, in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, plus 1 mm HgC2H4O2) to 2 μl of precipitant (3.5 m sodium formate, pH 7.0) and equilibrating over a well containing the precipitant solution at 20 °C. Prior to flash-cooling, crystals were briefly soaked in the precipitant solution supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol. Flash-cooled crystals of unliganded TpolCBM16-1 diffracted x-rays to a minimum Bragg spacing of 1.3 Å, using an insertion device x-ray beam line utilizing an ADSC Q4 CCD detector (IMCA-CAT-Sector 17ID, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL). These crystals occupied space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 57.4 Å, b = 77.8 Å, and c = 77.9 Å and contained two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. A 6-fold redundant data set was collected to a limiting resolution of 1.4 Å (overall Rmerge = 4.60, I/σ(I) = 3.6 in the highest resolution shell). Crystals of TpolCBM16-1-cellopentaose complex diffract x-rays beyond a Bragg spacing of1Åatan insertion device synchrotron beam line (SER-CAT Sector 22BM, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL). Crystals occupy space group P1 with unit cell parameters a = 32.5, b = 48.8 Å, c = 49.4 Å, α = 62.0°, β = 84.9°, and γ = 85.9°, with two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. A 4-fold redundant data set was collected to 1.2 Å resolution (overall Rmerge = 3.6, I/σ(I) = 6 in the highest resolution shell) utilizing a Mar 225 CCD detector. A 6-fold redundant data set was collected from crystals of TpolCBM16-1-mannopentaose complex (overall Rmerge = 3.9, I/σ(I) = 3.5 in the highest resolution shell) to a limiting Bragg spacing of 2.2 Å at an insertion device synchrotron beam line utilizing an ADSC Q4 CCD detector (IMCA-CAT-Sector 17ID, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL). Crystals occupy the trigonal space group P3221 with unit cell parameters a = b = 74.1, and c = 116.1 Å, with two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Flash-cooled crystals of unliganded TpolCBM16-2 occupy space group C2221 with unit cell parameters a = 90.4 Å, b = 90.5 Å, c = 139.4 Å, with four molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The a and b unit cell edges are coincidentally close, and the crystals demonstrate tetragonal pseudo-symmetry consistent with space group P4222, with two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. However, scaling of data in the higher symmetry space group results in a slight increase in merging statistics, and subsequent crystallographic refinement in the tetragonal setting resulted in a free R factor that stalls at 40%. Hence, the data were scaled in the orthorhombic setting and structure determination, and refinement was carried out in space group C2221. A 6-fold redundant data set was collected to a limiting resolution of 1.9 Å (overall Rmerge = 4.3, I/σ(I) = 12 in the highest resolution shell) utilizing a Mar 225 CCD detector (SER-CAT-Sector 22BM, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL). Phasing and Structure Determination—Although crystals of selenomethionine-substituted TpolCBM16-1 were grown under similar conditions, SeMet-labeled TpolCBM16-1 occupied a different space group (C2221, with one molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit), with unit cell parameters a = 56.4 Å, b = 96.8 Å, c = 73.6 Å. A 6-fold redundant data set was collected at a wavelength near the selenium absorption edge, to a limiting resolution of 1.7 Å (overall Rmerge = 5.5, I/σ(I) = 7 in the highest resolution shell) utilizing a ADSC Q4 CCD detector (IMCA-CAT-Sector 17ID, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL). The structure of SeMet TpolCBM16-1 was solved by single wavelength anomalous diffraction utilizing anomalous scattering from the three selenium-substituted methionine residues per monomer of TpolCBM16-1. Data were indexed and scaled using the HKL2000 package (17Otwinowski Z. Borek D. Majewski W. Minor W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 2003; 59: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). Selenium sites were identified, and heavy atom parameters were further refined using SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) yielding an initial figure of merit of 0.28–1.7 Å resolution (Table 1). Solvent flattening with RESOLVE further improved the quality of the initial map and permitted most of the main chain and 45% of the side chain residues to be automatically built by the software (21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The remainder of the model was fitted using XtalView (22McRee D.E. J. Struct.

Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Following rigid body refinement of the initial molecular replacement solution, the atomic model was subject to automatic rebuilding using ARP/wARP (25Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), resulting in a near complete trace of both molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The remainder of the model was fitted using XtalView (22McRee D.E. J. Struct.

The co-crystal structures of TpolCBM16-1-cellopentaose and TpolCBM16-1-mannopentaose were determined by molecular replacement using the final refined coordinates of native TpolCBM16-1 as a search probe. Clear density for the ligands could be observed in both co-crystal structures prior to crystallographic refinement. Cycles of manual rebuilding followed by crystallographic refinement were carried for each of the co-crystal structures. The respective ligands were manually built into the difference Fourier maps after the free R factors dropped below 30%. Cross-validation, using 5–7% of the data for the calculation of the free R factor (26Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The stereochemistry of the models was routinely monitored throughout the course of refinement using PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar) using the refined coordinates of the SeMet TpolCBM16-1 structure as a search probe. Multiple rounds of manual model building were interspersed with refinement using REFMAC5 (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar) to complete structure refinement. Cross-validation used 5% of the data in the calculation of the free R factor (26Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Despite extensive manual rebuilding and refinement, residues in two loop regions, bridging Tyr82 through Thr90 and Thr111 through Phe116, respectively, remain ill-defined and have not been modeled in the structure. Consequently, the free R factor of 30% for this structure is slightly higher than would be expected, given the resolution limit of 1.9 Å. The stereochemistry of the model was routinely monitored throughout the course of refinement using PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar). Crystal parameters, data collection parameters, and refinement statistics for each of the structures are summarized in Table 1. The refined coordinates have been deposited in the PDB with identification numbers 2ZEW (TpolCBM16-1), 2ZEX (TpolCBM16-1-cellopentaose), 2ZEY (TpolCBM16-1-mannopentaose), and 2ZEZ (TpolCBM16-2). Computational Procedures—All calculations were performed with MOE 2006.08 (Chemical Computing Group, Inc.), using either the MMFF94x or OPLS-AA force fields. Starting coordinates for the energy minimization of the TpolCBM16-1-cellopentaose and TpolCBM16-1-mannopentaose complexes (this study) and the cellopentaose-CBM complex from Cellulomonas fimi (PDB 1gu3), solved by Davies and co-workers (29Boraston A.B.

Biol. 2002; 319: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), were taken from the coordinates of the crystal structures, in which crystal waters were included. All atoms (solvent, CBM, and ligand) were energy-minimized until an energy gradient of 10-4 kcal/mol/Å2 was achieved. Interaction energy of the ligand with CBM and explicit solvent was then calculated using the MMFF94x force field, respectively. Delineation of the CBM Domain Boundaries—In a previous report (14Cann I.K. Kocherginskaya S. King M.R. White B.A. Mackie R.I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our delineation of TpolCBM16-1 and Tpol-CBM16-2 suggested that the two modules were separated by 23 amino acids; hence each repeat started with a highly conserved N terminus characterized by the seven amino acids SAVPEAA and ended with a highly conserved sequence LVEV (Fig. 1C).

We previously showed that N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a potent dipeptide γ-secretase inhibitor, causes differential accumulation of longer amyloid β-proteins (Aβs) within Chinese hamster ovary cells co-expressing β C-terminal fragment and wild-type presenilin 1 (C99/wtPS1 cells). In this study, we used sucrose density gradient centrifugation to fractionate the membranes from C99/wtPS1 cells that had been pretreated with DAPT. We found that accumulating Aβ46 localized exclusively to low density membrane (LDM) domains. Incubating the Aβ46-accumulating LDM domains at 37 °C produced Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ43, and β-amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain. The addition of L685,458 completely prevented β-amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain generation and resulted in a large decrease in the level of Aβ46 and the concomitant appearance of Aβ40 and Aβ43 but not Aβ42. Further addition of DAPT suppressed the production of Aβ40/43 and abolished the decrease in the amount of Aβ46. These data indicate that preaccumulated Aβ46 is processed by γ-secretase to Aβ40/43 but not to Aβ42 in the LDM domains. The amount of newly produced Aβ40 and Aβ43 was roughly equivalent to the decrease in the amount of Aβ46. Temporal profiles did not show a maximal concentration for Aβ43, suggesting that Aβ46 is processed to Aβ40 and Aβ43 through a nonsuccessive process. γ-Secretase cleaves the transmembrane domain of β-amyloid precursor protein at multiple sites referred to as γ-, ϵ-, and ζ-cleavage sites.

Aβ is produced from β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), through sequential cleavages by two membrane proteases referred to as β- and γ-secretases (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5092) Google Scholar). β-Secretase, or β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (2Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B.

Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar), is a membrane-bound aspartyl protease that cleaves APP in its luminal region, generating a 99-residue fragment (C99) called β C-terminal fragment (βCTF). βCTF in turn is cleaved in the middle of its transmembrane domain by γ-secretase, releasing Aβ and APP intracellular domain (AICD). Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that γ-secretase is also an aspartyl protease of high molecular weight protein complex (3Wolfe M.S. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which includes at least four distinct membrane proteins, presenilin (PS) 1 or 2, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2. In particular, PS1 or PS2 is believed to compose the catalytic site(s) of γ-secretase (4Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whereas the most abundantly secreted Aβ species is Aβ40, the minor, two-residue longer one, Aβ42, is by far the predominant species deposited in senile plaques (7Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Thus far, three causative genes for familial AD (FAD), APP, PS1, and PS2, have been identified, and the FAD mutations on those genes increase the proportion of Aβ42 relative to the total Aβ produced (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5092) Google Scholar). Because Aβ42 production or deposition is the key factor in the development of AD, the regulatory mechanisms of intramembrane cleavage at Aβ40 and Aβ42 sites (γ-cleavage sites) are a pivotal issue for understanding γ-secretase. Besides the γ-cleavage sites, cleavage sites near the membrane-cytoplasm boundary (ϵ-cleavage sites) have been identified by sequencing AICD produced by the cell-free Aβ and AICD generation system (8Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35235-35238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Most unexpectedly, the two AICD species generated in vitro do not start from position 41 or 43; the major species is AICD-(50–99), and the minor species is AICD-(49–99). FAD mutations on APP and PS1/2 increase the proportion of AICD-(49–99) and Aβ42 (9Sato T. Dohmae N. Qi Y. Kakuda N. Misonou H. Mitsumori R. Maruyama H. Koo E.H. Haass C. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Ishiura S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24294-24301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This suggests some relationship between Aβ42 and AICD-(49–99) and between Aβ40 and AICD-(50–99). Failure to detect any longer AICD and the presence of a variety of longer Aβs suggest that ϵ-cleavage precedes γ-cleavage (8Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35235-35238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 10Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and this involves a stepwise processing of longer Aβs (10Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Within cells, the expression of Aβ49 and Aβ48, the postulated counterparts generated by ϵ-cleavage, results in preferentially Aβ40 and Aβ42 production, respectively (11Funamoto S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Hirotani N. Saido T.C. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13532-13540Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, the potent dipeptide γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) causes intracellular accumulation of longer Aβ species, Aβ43 and Aβ46, which differentially accumulate in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing wild-type (wt) PS1. In contrast, Aβ45 and Aβ48 accumulate in the CHO cells expressing mutant (mt) PS2 (N141I) and mtPS1 (M233T), respectively (10Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N.

Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3952-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These observations led us to speculate that this process occurs through a stepwise (successive) processing mediated by γ-secretase of βCTF at every third residue. According to this model, Aβ40 should be generated through Aβ43/46 from Aβ49 generated by ϵ-cleavage. To test this model, we examined whether Aβ46 is processed to shorter Aβs in the low density membrane (LDM) domains. Cell Culture—CHO cells co-expressing wtPS1 and βCTF (C99/wtPS1 cells) (12Yagishita S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Ishiura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3952-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were maintained in F-12 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin, 250 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml blasticidin S (Invitrogen), and 200 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). In these cells, βCTF was inducibly expressed in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Invitrogen). Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies to Aβ used in this study were 82E1 (highly specific for Asp-1 of human Aβ) (IBL, Fujioka, Japan), BA27 (raised against Aβ-(1–40), highly specific for Aβ40), and BC05 (raised against Aβ-(35–43), specific for Aβ42). A polyclonal antibody UT421 (raised against the 20-residue cytoplasmic domain of APP; a gift of Dr. T. Suzuki, Hokkaido University) was used to detect βCTF and AICD. Monoclonal antibodies to caveolin, flotillin, and calnexin were purchased from BD Biosciences. Treatment with γ-Secretase Inhibitors—The γ-secretase inhibitors were {1S-benzyl-4R-[1S-carbamoyl-2-phenylethylcarbamoyl-1S-3-methylbutylcarbamoyl]-2R-hydroxy-5-phenylpentyl} carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (L685,458) (13Shearman M.S.

C99/wtPS1 cells were cultured for 2 h in the presence of 0.25 μm DAPT, and 1 μg/ml tetracycline was added. The cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline washes 6 h later. Isolation of CHAPSO-insoluble LDM Domains—The total membrane fraction was obtained as described previously (9Sato T. Dohmae N. Qi Y. Kakuda N. Misonou H. Mitsumori R. Maruyama H. Koo E.H. Haass C.

Briefly, harvested cells were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 140 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EGTA), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was suspended in buffer A, and the suspension was centrifuged again. The resulting pellet (the total membrane fraction) was homogenized in 10% sucrose in MES-buffered saline (MBS: 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% CHAPSO and various protease inhibitors. The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose (4 ml) by adding an equal volume of 70% sucrose in MBS, placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, and overlaid with 4 ml of 35% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose in MBS. The discontinuous gradient was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C on an SW41 Ti rotor (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). The interface of the 5/35% sucrose layers (fraction 2), each layer consisting of 5, 35, and 40% sucrose (fractions 1, 3, and 4, respectively), and the pellet (fraction P) were collected carefully. An aliquot from each fraction was subjected to Western blotting. Fraction 2 was diluted with buffer B (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA) and centrifuged. The resulting pellet was washed with buffer B, resuspended in buffer B, and stored at –80 °C. An aliquot from the suspension was subjected to protein determination. Aβ Production by LDM Domains—LDM domains at a protein concentration of 150 μg/ml in buffer B containing various protease inhibitors were incubated at 25 or 37 °C for the times indicated. The reaction was terminated by placing the sample tube on ice and immediately adding chloroform/methanol (2/1). After extraction of lipids with chloroform/methanol, the protein residues were extracted with formic acid, and the extracts were subjected to quantitative Western blotting. Western Blotting—To assess the levels of Aβ or AICD, the samples were run on conventional 16.5% acrylamide Tris/Tricine gels and subjected to Western blotting with 82E1, BA27, BC05, or UT421. To distinguish Aβ species, the samples were separated on SDS/urea gels as described previously, followed by Western blotting with 82E1 (12Yagishita S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Ishiura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3952-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, 11 and 12.5% acrylamide separation gels containing 8 m urea, pH 8.45, were used. The blots were developed by an enhanced chemiluminescence system, and intensities of the signals were quantified using an LAS-1000plus luminescent image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Other Methods—Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce). Predominant Accumulation of Aβ46 in LDM Domains—LDM domains, the cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains, also known as rafts, are assumed to be a site for Aβ production within the cells (15Wada S.

Several proteins involved in Aβ production, such as APP, Aβ (16Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y.

Ihara, unpublished observations. are found in the LDM domains. In particular, active γ-secretase components such as highly glycosylated mature nicastrin and Pen-2 (data not shown) appear to be enriched in the LDM domains (supplemental Fig. S1), and the LDM domains prepared in the presence of CHAPSO exhibit higher γ-secretase activity (15Wada S.

Shoji M. Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H. Younkin S.G. Golde T.E. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 9: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Because our previous study showed that treatment of C99/wtPS1 cells with a higher dose of DAPT causes intracellular accumulation of Aβ46 (12Yagishita S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Ishiura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3952-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we examined where the accumulating Aβ46 localizes in the cell. The total membrane fraction was obtained from DAPT-treated C99/wtPS1 cells and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the presence of 0.5% CHAPSO (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fraction 2 from the 5/35% interface represents the LDM domains and is characterized by the presence of caveolin and flotillin, well known markers for LDM domains (Fig. 1A). Aβ46 that accumulated within the cells localized exclusively to LDM domains (fraction 2), whereas βCTF and very small amounts of the remaining Aβ40 (and Aβ42) were partitioned almost equally to the LDM domains (fraction 2) and the cytosolic fraction (fraction 4) (Fig. 1, B and C). Aβ46 Is Processed to Aβ40/43 but Not to Aβ42—We investigated whether and how Aβ46 is processed by γ-secretase using the Aβ46-accumulating LDM domains. Before incubation, a large amount of Aβ46 was present, and other Aβ species were hardly detectable in the isolated LDM domains (Fig. 2, top panel, 2nd lane from left). Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the Aβ band representing the total Aβ shifted to a band with faster mobility (Fig. 2, top panel, 3rd lane from left). This suggests that Aβ46 is converted to an Aβ species that is shorter than Aβ46. Western blotting with BA27 or BC05 and analysis by SDS/urea gel system indicated that Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ43 together with AICD were produced during incubation. These results strongly suggest that both γ- and ϵ-cleavages proceed in parallel in the isolated LDM domains. We next examined the effects of L685,458, a transition state analogue inhibitor of γ-secretase, on the Aβ-producing LDM domains. As expected, L685,458 efficiently suppressed ϵ-cleavage of βCTF (Fig. 2, 2nd panel, 3rd lane from left). In contrast, the production of Aβ40/43 was not suppressed as shown by the conventional Tris/Tricine gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, top panel, 4th lane from left). Western blotting with BA27 or BC05 and SDS/urea gel electrophoresis confirmed that Aβ40 and Aβ43, but not Aβ42, were produced even in the presence of L685,458. Aβ46 was no longer detectable by either gel system after incubation (Fig. 2, top and bottom panels). These results strongly suggest that Aβ40 and Aβ43 are generated from preaccumulated Aβ46 but not from pre-existing βCTF, in the presence of L685,458, and that Aβ42 does not come from preaccumulated Aβ46. In contrast, incubation in the presence of DAPT led to minimal or no decrease in the level of Aβ46 (Fig. 2, top panel, 3rd lane from right). Instead, a very small amount of AICD and detectable amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ43 were produced. The combination of DAPT and L685,458 suppressed both the processing of Aβ46 (Fig. 2, top panel, 2nd lane from right) and the production of AICD, although trace amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ43 and a very small decrease in the amount of Aβ46 were still observed. DAPT Suppression of Aβ46 Processing—Dose-dependent effects of DAPT on the levels of Aβ produced were assessed. Isolated LDM domains were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μm L685,458 and various concentrations of DAPT (Fig. 3). The presence of L685,458 completely prevented the production of AICD (see the 2nd panel in Fig. 2). Increasing concentrations of DAPT gradually decreased the amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ43 in a similar pattern and increased those of Aβ46 left in the membrane. These reciprocal changes support the above interpretation that both Aβ40 and Aβ43 are processed from Aβ46, and the DAPT suppression of the processing indicates that it is mediated through γ-secretase. These results are consistent with our previous observations that DAPT but not L685,458 induces the intracellular accumulation of Aβ46 (and Aβ43) (10Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), possibly because DAPT preferentially blocks γ-cleavage, whereas L658,458 preferentially blocks ϵ-cleavage. It is possible that the lesser susceptibility of ϵ-cleavage and greater susceptibility of γ-cleavage to DAPT are presumably responsible for intracellular accumulation of Aβ43 and Aβ46. The distinct dose-dependent profiles for Aβ43 and Aβ46 may result from a small difference in the susceptibility of γ-cleavage to DAPT in producing Aβ43 or Aβ46. Time Course of Aβ46 Processing—To learn more about how Aβ46 is processed to Aβ43 and Aβ40, the time-dependent profiles were examined in the presence of 1 μm L685,458, which completely blocks new recruitment of βCTF (Fig. 4). Because Aβ46 was swiftly processed to Aβ40/43 and rapidly used up at 37 °C (data not shown), the samples were incubated at 25 °C for the times indicated, and the amount of each Aβ at each time point was quantified by quantitative Western blotting. Both Aβ40 and Aβ43 levels increased in a linear fashion for up to 10 min, and this increase was accompanied by an apparently exponential decrease in the amount of Aβ46. For representative numbers, the concentration of Aβ46 in the reaction mixture was 158 fmol/ml at 0 min, and this decreased to 20 fmol/ml at 20 min. Thus, the concentration of Aβ46 decreased by138 fmol/ml during the 20-min incubation. During the incubation, the concentrations of Aβ40 and Aβ43 increased to 70 and 39 fmol/ml, respectively. Thus, the sum of the newly produced Aβ was 109 fmol/ml, which accounts for most of the decrease in Aβ46. We reported previously that the DAPT treatment causes dose-dependent accumulation of longer Aβs, which accompanies a great decrease in Aβ40 within CHO cells co-expressing βCTF and various types of PS1/2 (10Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 12Yagishita S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Ishiura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3952-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the particular Aβ species that accumulate within the cells vary among the cell lines, a profound decrease in Aβ40 is invariably associated with a small but significant to a large increase in Aβ46, suggesting a close relationship between Aβ40 and Aβ46 production (10Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 12Yagishita S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Ishiura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3952-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results can be explained based on the stepwise (successive) cleavage hypothesis that Aβ49 generated by ϵ-cleavage is processed to Aβ46, and Aβ46 is then processed to Aβ43, and finally, Aβ43 is processed to Aβ40. Consistent with this model, blocking the cleavage at the midportion between γ- and ϵ-sites by a Trp stretch replacement remarkably suppressed the generation of Aβ40/42 (20Sato T. Tanimura Y. Hirotani N. Saido T.C. Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, we established an Aβ-producing system using the Aβ46-accumulating LDM domains. According to our data (15Wada S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Qi Y. Misono H. Shimada Y. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13977-13986Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and data from others (19Wahrle S. Das P. Nyborg A.C. McLendon C. Shoji M. Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H. Younkin S.G. Golde T.E. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 9: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), γ-secretase activity is enriched in LDM domains and accumulating Aβ46 localized predominantly to the LDM domains in DAPT-treated cells (Fig. 1B). The treatment of Aβ46-accumulating LDM domains with L685,458 completely suppressed the production of AICD, but Aβ40 and Aβ43 were still produced, and concomitantly, Aβ46 became undetectable (Fig. 2). Thus, it is plausible that preaccumulated Aβ46 was processed to Aβ43 and Aβ40. The quantification and time-dependent profiles of the produced and converted Aβ levels (Fig. 4) strongly support this explanation. Interestingly, L685,458 failed to block the γ-cleavage, that is the processing from Aβ46 to Aβ43 and Aβ40. This suggests that L685,458 preferentially inhibits ϵ-cleavage rather than γ-cleavage. This is consistent with our previous observation (10Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) that L685,458 does not induce accumulation of intracellular Aβs. In contrast, treatment with DAPT suppressed the overall processing of Aβ46 and caused leaky production of AICD, suggesting that in contrast to L685,458, DAPT preferentially inhibits γ-cleavage. These observations are consistent with those by Zhao et al. (21Zhao G. Cui M.Z. Mao G. Dong Y. Tan J. Sun L. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37689-37697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) that L685,458 specifically inhibits ϵ-cleavage and ζ-cleavage (cleavage between Ile-45 and Val-46), whereas DAPT preferentially inhibits γ-cleavage. Differential sensitivity to L685,458 and DAPT may be explained by differences in their γ-secretase-binding sites. L685,458 is a transition state analogue and directly targets the catalytic residue Asp on the transmembrane domains 6 and 7 of PS1 or 2 (22Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), whereas DAPT is a nontransition state analogue and does not target these residues (23Morohashi Y. Kan T. Tominari Y. Fuwa H. Okamura Y. Watanabe N. Sato C. Natsugari H. Fukuyama T. Iwatsubo T. Tomita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14670-14676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 24Sato C. Morohashi Y. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12081-12088Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because Aβ46 is likely an intermediate product, accumulating Aβ46 may remain to occupy the catalytic pore of γ-secretase and prevent L685,458 from entering the catalytic site. Thus, Aβ46 that occupies the catalytic site could be processed by γ-secretase despite the presence of L685,458. The association between accumulating Aβ46 and PS1 was shown by co-immunoprecipitation in compound E-treated cells (21Zhao G. Cui M.Z. Mao G. Dong Y. Tan J. Sun L. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37689-37697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These explain our observation that L685,458 failed to suppress Aβ46 processing. Moreover, the apparent suppression of ϵ-cleavage by L685,458 may be caused partly by pre-existing Aβ46, which prevents the entry of βCTF into the catalytic pore of γ-secretase. On the other hand, DAPT suppresses γ-secretase activity by binding to a different site from the catalytic site. Thus, pre-existing Aβ46 may not prevent the binding of DAPT to γ-secretase. Our results also provide a strong support to the notion that the Aβ40-producing process is separate from the Aβ42-producing process. The latter process was less sensitive to L685,458 than was the former. Our preliminary observations indicate that the accumulating Aβ45 in the LDM domains obtained from N141I mtPS2-transfected cells is not processed to Aβ42 by incubation, suggesting that both processes are functionally different from each other. Furthermore, the CHAPSO-solubilized reconstituted system for γ-secretase gave unexpected results. Aβ46, a putative precursor of Aβ40 and Aβ43, is undetectable, whereas Aβ45 is clearly detectable (25Kakuda N. Funamoto S. Yagishita S. Takami M. Osawa S. Dohmae N. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This again points to the possibility that the Aβ42-producing process is separate from the Aβ40-producing process. However, Zhao et al. (26Zhao G. Tan J. Mao G. Cui M.Z. Xu X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1234-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) recently reported that Aβ46 is an intermediate precursor of both Aβ40 and Aβ42. Inconsistency between their results and ours may have arisen from the differences in the assay systems for γ-secretase; Zhao et al. (26Zhao G. Tan J. Mao G. Cui M.Z. Xu X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1234-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) used either cell culture or a cell-free system using the total membrane fraction, whereas we used a cell-free system using the LDM domains. Most importantly, the pH (7.0) of our cell-free system differed from that of the system used by Zhao et al. (26Zhao G. Tan J. Mao G. Cui M.Z. Xu X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1234-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (pH 6.4). We found that Aβ processing at lower pH (pH 6.5) proceeds in a γ-secretase-independent manner by another protease, presumably involving cathepsin D, whose activity localized to fraction 4. 4S. Yagishita, M. Morishima-Kawashima, and Y. Ihara, unpublished observations. Thus, isolation of the LDM domains in our study may have successfully removed contaminating protease activities that are associated with the total membrane fraction. Two models could explain the mechanism of Aβ46 processing observed here. One is that Aβ46 is first processed to Aβ43, which is then processed to Aβ40. This is referred to here as the successive reaction model. The other mechanism is that Aβ40 and Aβ43 are simultaneously produced from Aβ46. This is referred to here as the nonsuccessive model. To determine which model is more plausible, we carefully examined the time-dependent profiles of the processing in the presence of L685,458 at 25 °C (see Fig. 4), because incubation at 25 °C made the reaction slow enough to accurately follow the production rates. The following successive reactions assume that these first-order reactions are catalyzed by the same γ-secretase: Aβ46 → Aβ43 → Aβ40. The concentration of the intermediate (Aβ43) is given by the following: [Aβ43]t = [Aβ46]0k1/k2 – k1 (exp(–k1t) – exp(–k2t)), where k1 and k2 are rate constants for the first and second reactions. The successive reactions differ from simple reactions and have unusual characteristics. The concentration extremum is detectable with an intermediate product. In this case, Aβ43 would reach a maximal concentration at t = (ln(k1/k2))/k1 – k2. Regarding Aβ40, the initial rate is zero, and an induction period is present. However, even careful observations did not enable us to detect such unusual characteristics. This suggests that processing of Aβ46 does not undergo successive reactions but that Aβ40 and Aβ43 are produced directly from Aβ46, presumably by releasing hexapeptide, IATVIV, and tripeptide, VIV, respectively. This kind of cleavage still follows the α-helical model for γ-cleavage (10Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Finally, we note that it remains unknown whether the nonsuccessive model proposed from our study on the LDM domains is applicable to the original cell-free system. In our experience, the CHAPSO-solubilized, reconstituted system appears to follow a nonsuccessive model, because the possible intermediate products did not achieve a maximal concentration during the time course of the study (25Kakuda N. Funamoto S. Yagishita S. Takami M. Osawa S. Dohmae N. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, various sized Aβs may have been produced independently from the ϵ-cleaved products, Aβ48 and Aβ49, apparently in a nonsuccessive manner. It is possible that the presence of an intact membrane and some as-yet unidentified components provide the properties of successive reactions originally postulated.

https://openalex.org/W2063816626,"Ferritin is a ubiquitous protein that sequesters iron and protects cells from iron toxicity. Caenorhabditis elegans express two ferritins, FTN-1 and FTN-2, which are transcriptionally regulated by iron. To identify the cis-acting sequences and proteins required for iron-dependent regulation of ftn-1 and ftn-2 expression, we generated transcriptional GFP reporters corresponding to 5 '-upstream sequences of the ftn-1 and ftn-2 genes. We identified a conserved 63-bp sequence, the iron-dependent element (IDE), that is required for iron-dependent regulation of a ftn-1 GFP reporter in intestine. The IDE contains two GATA-binding motifs and three octameric direct repeats. Site-directed mutagenesis of the GATA sequences, singly or in combination, reduces ftn-1 GFP reporter expression in the intestine. In vitro DNA mobility shift assays show that the intestine-specific GATA protein ELT-2 binds to both GATA sequences. Inhibition of ELT-2 function by RNA interference blocks ftn-1 GFP reporter expression in vivo. Insertion of the IDE into the promoter region of a heterologous reporter activates iron-dependent transcription in intestine. These data demonstrate that the activation of ftn-1 and ftn-2 transcription by iron requires ELT-2 and that the IDE functions as an iron-dependent enhancer in intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2042653712,"Several lines of evidence have implicated members of the developmentally important T-box gene family in cell cycle regulation and in cancer. Importantly, the highly related T-box factors Tbx2 and Tbx3 can suppress senescence through repressing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p19ARF and p21WAF1/CIP1/SDII. Furthermore, Tbx2 is up-regulated in several cancers, including melanomas where it was shown to function as an anti-senescence factor, suggesting that this may be one of the mechanisms by which T-box proteins contribute to the oncogenic process. However, very little is known about whether Tbx2 is regulated by p21-mediated stress-induced senescence signaling pathways. In this study, using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line known to overexpress Tbx2, we show that in response to stress induced by ultraviolet irradiation the Tbx2 protein is specifically phosphorylated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Using site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro kinase assays, we have identified serine residues 336, 623, and 675 in the Tbx2 protein as the p38 target sites and show that these sites are phosphorylated in vivo. Importantly, we show by Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and reporter assays that this phosphorylation leads to increased Tbx2 protein levels, predominant nuclear localization of the protein, and an increase in the ability of Tbx2 to repress the p21WAF1/CIP1/SDII promoter. These results show for the first time that the ability of Tbx2 to repress the p21 gene is enhanced in response to a stress-induced senescence pathway, which leads to a better understanding of the regulation of the anti-senescence function of Tbx2.

Naderi A. Soderberg C.L. Johnson M. Wu K. Wadum L. Couch V.L. Sellers T.A. Schaid D. Slezak J. Fredericksen Z. Ingle J.N. Hartmann L. Jenkins R.B. Couch F.J.

Takahashi S. Shirai T. Cancer Lett. 2005; 219: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), liver, (22Renard C.A. Labalette C. Armengol C. Cougot D. Wei Y. Cairo S. Pineau P.

Volodko N. Souchelnyskyi S. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which Tbx3 may be involved in oncogenesis has been suggested by a study that showed that Tbx3 can cooperate with oncogenic Myc and Ras to induce cellular transformation and suppress apoptosis through repression of p19ARF expression and p53 protein levels (24Carlson H. Ota S. Song Y. Chen Y. Hurlin P.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3827-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is also possible that Tbx2 and Tbx3 may contribute to the oncogenic process through their anti-senescence function, especially since a dominant negative form of Tbx2 has been shown to induce senescence in melanomas overexpressing Tbx2 (15Vance K.W. Carreira S. Brosch G. Goding C.R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Taken together, the above reports would suggest that the levels of Tbx2 and Tbx3 need to be tightly regulated during the cell cycle. Indeed a recent study by Bilican and Goding (25Bilican B. Goding C.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2358-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that Tbx2 protein levels are regulated during the various phases of the cell cycle, peaking at G2. In the same study the investigators show that changes in Tbx2 protein levels are not matched by changes in Tbx2 mRNA levels, suggesting that the protein may be regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Identifying signaling pathways, especially those involved in inducing senescence, that regulate Tbx2 levels and activity is therefore potentially important for the development of novel therapeutic targets to treat cancers by inhibiting Tbx2 function.Cellular senescence can be triggered by alterations of telomeres as well as in response to a variety of stresses, such as DNA damage caused by irradiation and cytotoxic drugs or chemically induced oxidative stress (26Roninson I.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2705-2715PubMed Google Scholar). The p38 pathway plays an important role in diverse cellular responses such as cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis (27Zarubin T. Han J. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar) and has also been identified as a senescence signaling pathway that is activated in response to both telomere-dependent and -independent senescence (28Iwasa H. Han J. Ishikawa F. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 29Haq R. Brenton J.D. Takahashi M. Finan D. Rottapel R. Zanke B.

It has previously been shown that in response to stress, p38 phosphorylates and stabilizes the p21 protein (31Kim G-Y. Mercer S.E. Ewton D.Z. Yan Z. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29792-29802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which is thought to be the major mediator of a senescence-like growth arrest after UV-induced DNA damage. The subsequent role and regulation of p21 in the DNA repair pathway is, however, unresolved. One line of evidence suggests that p21 levels are induced and that high levels of the protein are maintained in order to facilitate the effect of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in DNA repair (32McDonald E.R. II I Wu G.S. Waldman T. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2250-2255PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sheikh M.S. Chen Y.Q. Smith M.L. Fornace A.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1875-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, another line of evidence suggests that the activation of p21 is only transient and that p21 expression needs to decrease after the establishment of growth arrest in order to promote DNA repair by facilitating proliferating cell nuclear antigen recruitment to DNA repair sites (34Pan Z-Q.

Cell. 2003; 114: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although there is compelling evidence to suggest that the decrease in p21 levels seen in the latter scenario results from ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation (36Bendjennat M. Boulaire J. Jascur T. Brickner H. Barbier V. Sarasin A. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Cell. 2003; 114: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), there is also evidence to suggest that a decrease in p21 mRNA levels may be involved (37Wang J.A. Fan S. Yuan R.Q. Ma Y.X. Meng Q. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Here we show that in response to ultraviolet C (UVC) irradiation, Tbx2 is specifically phosphorylated by the p38 MAP kinase, which leads to an increase in Tbx2 protein levels, predominant nuclear localization of Tbx2, and an increase in the ability of Tbx2 to repress the p21 promoter. Furthermore, in response to UVC irradiation the increase in Tbx2 protein levels correlates inversely with p21 protein and mRNA levels. Taken together, the data suggest a possible mechanism by which p21 mRNA levels are repressed in response to UV-induced DNA damage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The wild-type (WT) p21-LUC reporter construct contains a 2.2-kb SacI-Hind III fragment of the human p21 promoter inserted upstream of a LUC reporter gene (38el Deiry W.S.

As has previously been described, the pCMV19.Tbx2 and pGEX.Tbx2 were constructed by cloning a full-length BamHI fragment of the mouse Tbx2 cDNA into the BamHI site of the pCMV19a and pGEX.2TK vectors (7Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The pGL3-Basic-p14ARF (642) luciferase construct was kindly provided by Dr. D. Holzschu (Ohio University, Athens, Ohio). Point mutations were introduced into full-length WT Tbx2 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange system and appropriate primer pairs.Cell Cultures and Transfection Assay—COS-7 monkey kidney, NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast, and HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MCF-7, human breast epithelial adenocarcinoma cells, were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids, and 0.01 mg/ml insulin. Cells were maintained in a 37 °C incubator (95.0% air/5% CO2, 65% humidity). Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and/or FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) for COS-7 cells and Transfectin (Bio-Rad) for NIH 3T3 cells, according to the manufacturers' instructions. Cells were plated at 0.5 × 105/ml in 35-mm dishes 1 day before transfection. For luciferase assays, COS-7 cells were transfected with 700 ng of the p21 or p14ARF luciferase reporter plasmid plus 200 ng of the Tbx2 expression plasmid or 200 ng of an empty vector plasmid. The vector pRL-TK containing the thymidine kinase promoter driving the expression of a Renilla reporter was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency (50 ng/transfection). Cells were cultured for 30 h, and extracts were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activities were measured using the Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo Labsystems, Franklin, MA). Firefly luciferase values were normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity and expressed relative to empty vector control. All transfections were performed in duplicate, and at least three independent experiments were done to confirm reproducibility. For transfected cells, UVC irradiation (254 nm, 40 J/m2) was performed using a UV Stratalinker 1800 apparatus (Stratagene) 30 h post-transfection. For cells expressing endogenous Tbx2, UVC irradiation was performed at 100 J/m2. For UVC treatment, the medium was completely removed and replaced immediately after irradiation. Pretreatment with the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Calbiochem) was at 10 μm for 30 min prior to UVC irradiation.Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from MCF-7 cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription of RNA (1 μg) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). Using 2 μl of cDNA, PCR was conducted with the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR master mix (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' protocol. Real-time PCR was performed on a LightCycler Version 3 (Roche Applied Science) using the following parameters: denaturation (15 min at 95 °C), annealing and amplification at 35 cycles (15 s at 94 °C; 20 s at 55 °C; 20 s at 72 °C), melting temperature (15 s at 65 °C), and a cooling step (30 s at 40 °C). Each DNA sample was quantified in duplicate, and a negative control without cDNA template was run with every assay to assess the overall specificity. Melting curve analyses were carried out to ensure product specificity, and data were analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCt method (39Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (24916) Google Scholar). Relative mRNA expression levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for each reaction with PCR efficiency correction calculated using the formula Ratio = (Etarget)CPtarget(control-sample)/(Eref)CPref(control-sample). E, real-time PCR efficiency, CP, crossing-point. Primers used to amplify the human Tbx2 (QT00091266) and p21 (QT00062090) were purchased from Qiagen. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward 5′-GAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTT-3′; reverse 5′-CAGGAGGCATTGCTGATGAT-3′).Western Blot Analyses—Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells using a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% deoxycholate, supplemented with 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride protease inhibitors (Sigma). Proteins were resolved on 7.5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as required and transferred to Hybond ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with appropriate primary antibodies and detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:5000) and visualized by ECL (Pierce). The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-Tbx2 62–2 antibody (1:2000), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p38 (1:1000) and anti-p38 (1:5000) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-Pk-Tag (SV5) antibody (1:3000) (Serotec, Oxford, UK), and rabbit polyclonal p21 (1:200) and mouse monoclonal α-tubulin (1:500) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA.Protein Expression and Purification—All glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain pLysS. Isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside induction was performed for 4 h at 37 °C. Fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences).p38 Protein Kinase Assays—Recombinant active p38α was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Kinase assays were performed in 40 μl of reaction volume (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 30 min under agitation. 25 ng of active p38 protein kinase were added to Tbx2 recombinant protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μm Ci diluted with 9 μl of 400 μm unlabeled ATP, 75 mm MgCl2) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Following the kinase reaction, beads were washed five times with 1 ml of reaction buffer, and 20 μl of protein denaturing buffer were added. Phosphorylation of Tbx2 by the p38 MAP kinase was detected by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis.Immunofluorescence—MCF-7 cells grown on glass coverslip slides 1 h after UVC irradiation were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature before permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse Tbx2 monoclonal antibody (62-2) at a dilution of 1:750 and then incubated with Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated in the dark with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, mounted on a slide with Mowial mounting medium (Hoescht, Germany) containing anti-fade (Sigma), and examined by fluorescent microscopy.RESULTSTbx2 Is Phosphorylated in Vivo—To determine whether the Tbx2 protein is regulated post-translationally by phosphorylation, protein extracts from MCF-7 cells were treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase and subjected to Western blot analyses. Fig. 1A shows that when probed with an antibody specific to the Tbx2 protein, the higher molecular weight band seen in the untreated sample disappears in the phosphatase-treated sample. These results suggest that the top band seen in the untreated sample represents phosphorylated Tbx2 and that the protein is phosphorylated in vivo.UVC-induced Phosphorylation of Tbx2—Having established that Tbx2 is phosphorylated in vivo, we next examined the Tbx2 protein sequence for potential phosphorylation sites using an on-line motif data base (au.expasy.org/tools/scan-prosite/). Thirteen serine-proline (SP) motifs (Fig. 1B), which are minimum potential target sites for phosphorylation by several kinases, including members of the MAP kinase family, were identified (40Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether Tbx2 is a target for stress-responsive kinase(s), COS-7 cells were transfected with a Tbx2 expression vector and exposed to increasing doses of UVC irradiation and protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting. Fig. 2A shows that with increasing doses of UVC irradiation there is an increase in phosphorylated Tbx2 from 10 J/m2. This observed increase in phosphorylated Tbx2 is consistent with the appearance of activated p38, as detected using an antibody specific for phosphorylated p38. To investigate whether there was a similar effect of UVC irradiation on the phosphorylation status of endogenous Tbx2, MCF-7 cells were exposed to a fixed dose of 100 J/m2 UVC and protein harvested at the indicated time points post-treatment (Fig. 2B). An increase in the phosphorylation status of Tbx2 was observed immediately after UVC radiation, with high levels persisting up to 180 min post-treatment. It is interesting to note that this effect is also seen for the lower Tbx2 band which, at the early time points, is probably due to post-translational modification(s) rather than post-transcriptional event(s). The dose of UVC irradiation selected in this experiment was based on previous results that showed that it consistently yielded high levels of phosphorylated Tbx2 in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Both the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways are strongly activated by a variety of cellular stresses, including UV irradiation (41Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2851) Google Scholar). To identify which of the two pathways was responsible for Tbx2 phosphorylation, we exposed cells to 100 J/m2 UVC irradiation in the presence or absence of SB203580, which specifically inhibits p38 while being ineffective against JNK. Based on earlier results, protein was harvested 60 min post-UVC irradiation and analyzed by Western blotting. The results show that the UVC-induced increase in Tbx2 phosphorylation is specifically via the p38 MAP kinase, as treatment with the SB203580 inhibitor significantly reduces this effect (Fig. 2C). We next investigated the effect of UVC irradiation on Tbx2 mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR. RNA extracted from MCF-7 cells at 0, 30, and 60 min post-UVC irradiation was amplified using primers specific for Tbx2, and Fig. 2D shows that Tbx2 mRNA levels increased immediately post-UVC irradiation with levels peaking at 30 min. Taken together, these results suggest that Tbx2 protein levels increase in response to UVC irradiation due to both a phosphorylation-dependent increase in the stability of the protein and an increase in mRNA levels.FIGURE 2UVC-induced phosphorylation of Tbx2. A, dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation status of transfected Tbx2 in response to UVC irradiation. COS-7 cells were transfected with a vector expressing SV5 epitope-tagged Tbx2 and UVC irradiated at the indicated dosages. Protein extracts were prepared 1 h post-treatment. To detect phosphorylated Tbx2, protein samples were analyzed on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and by Western blotting using an antibody to SV5. Levels of phospho-p38 and total p38 in these samples were assessed on a 12% SDS-PAGE and by Western blotting with appropriate antibodies. The bar graph compares the intensity of the upper and lower bands in each sample normalized to the p38 loading control. B, time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of endogenous Tbx2 in response to UVC irradiation. Protein extracts from MCF-7 cells at the indicated time points post-UVC irradiation (100 J/m2) were assayed as described in panel A. The proteins extracted from 0 to 30 min and 60 to 300 min post-UVC treatment were from different experiments and were therefore analyzed on separate gels. C, endogenous Tbx2 is phosphorylated in vivo by the p38 kinase. MCF-7 cells irradiated with UVC (100 J/m2) in the presence or absence of SB203580 (10 μm, 30 min prior to UVC irradiation), a highly specific inhibitor of the p38 family kinases. Protein extracts were assayed as described in panel A. D, Tbx2 mRNA levels increase in response to UVC irradiation. Quantitative real-time PCR of endogenous Tbx2 mRNA extracted from MCF-7 cells was performed at the indicated times post-UVC irradiation (100 J/m2). The levels of Tbx2 mRNA expression were normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Error bars represent standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tbx2 Is Phosphorylated by the p38 MAP Kinase at Three Serine Residues—To map the p38 phosphorylation sites, each of the thirteen candidate SP sites previously identified in the Tbx2 protein was individually mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. These proteins were expressed with a glutathione S-transferase tag and were used as substrates for in vitro p38α kinase assays. In these kinase assays the GST-Tbx2 fusion proteins were expressed as either N-terminal (1–371) or C-terminal (371–711) proteins (Fig. 3A). Glutathione S-transferase alone was used as a negative control. The results (Fig. 3B) indicate that the WT GST-Tbx2 fusion proteins (1–371) and (371–711) were both phosphorylated by the p38 MAP kinase. Although S192A and S342A had no effect on phosphorylation of the N-terminal portion of Tbx2, the S336A mutation abolished phosphorylation by the p38 kinase. The single mutations S623A and S675A reduced phosphorylation of the C terminus of Tbx2, and when both these sites were mutated, phosphorylation was severely reduced. Mutating the remaining eight potential p38 sites in the C terminus of Tbx2 had no effect on the phosphorylation of Tbx2 in these experiments (data not shown). These results show that Tbx2 is phosphorylated specifically by the p38 MAP kinase at Ser-336, Ser-623, and Ser-675 in vitro. To test whether these sites were phosphorylated in vivo, COS-7 cells were transfected with vectors expressing either SV5-tagged WT Tbx2 or a SV5-tagged Tbx2 S336A,S623A, S675A mutant, and the Tbx2 phosphorylation status was compared by Western blot analyses (Fig. 3C). Compared with WT Tbx2, which is expressed as two bands, the Tbx2 mutant is expressed as a single band that migrates with the lower WT Tbx2 band. These results suggest that serine residues 336, 623, and 675 are indeed targets for in vivo phosphorylation. Given that mutating these three serine residues results in the complete loss of the upper phosphorylated band, it would imply that they are critical for phosphorylation by an additional kinase(s). We next investigated whether these residues were phosphorylated in response to UVC irradiation. Cells were transfected with vect"
https://openalex.org/W1996642439,"The use of RNA interference has proven to be an effective means to study the function of genes. Constitutive synthesis of small interfering RNA molecules can be accomplished with the use of viral vectors expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Binding of shRNA to the target mRNA promotes transcript degradation. So far, little is known about the effects that shRNA induce in vivo. To determine the feasibility of using helper-dependent adenoviral vectors for expression of shRNA in liver, we have designed an shRNA construct to mouse fabp5 (fatty acid-binding protein 5). Intravenous administration of this vector resulted in approximately 75% silencing of fabp5. Increasing the dose of vector did not result in higher levels of silencing, indicating that there is a threshold for the level of knockdown that can be achieved. Synthesis of high levels of shRNA molecules did not alter the levels of cellular micro-RNA, such as miR-122 and let-7a, suggesting that the exportin-5 pathway was not affected. However, high level shRNA expression resulted in activation of the interferon response. Thus, an important consideration when using shRNA-based vectors in vivo is to closely monitor signs of interferon-stimulated gene expression, since a narrow window exists between gene silencing efficacy and nonspecific effects."
https://openalex.org/W1974952918,"Escherichia coli MutY has an important role in preventing mutations associated with the oxidative lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (OG) in DNA by excising adenines from OG·A mismatches as the first step of base excision repair. To determine the importance of specific steps in the base pair recognition and base removal process of MutY, we have evaluated the effects of modifications of the OG·A substrate on the kinetics of base removal, mismatch affinity and repair to G-C in an E. coli–based assay. Notably, adenine modification was tolerated in the cellular assay, whereas modification of OG resulted in minimal cellular repair. High affinity for the mismatch and efficient base removal required the presence of OG. Taken together, these results suggest that the presence of OG is a critical feature that is necessary for MutY to locate OG·A mismatches and select the appropriate adenines for excision to initiate repair in vivo before replication."

It is a metabolic disorder associated with dysfunction of several organs such as atherosclerosis, altered lipid metabolism, and liver injury. In this study we investigated the effect of Hcy on transcriptional regulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a potent chemokine, expression in hepatocytes. Hyperhomocysteinemia was induced in rats by a high-methionine diet for 4 weeks. MCP-1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly elevated in the liver tissue homogenate and in hepatocytes of hyperhomocysteinemic rats. The role of transcription factors in MCP-1 expression was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Activation of activator protein (AP)-1 but not nuclear factor κB was detected in the liver tissue of those rats. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with Hcy (50–200 μm) caused a significant increase in AP-1 activation followed by an increase in intracellular MCP-1 mRNA expression and an elevation of MCP-1 protein secreted into the culture medium. Hcy markedly increased the DNA binding activity of human recombinant AP-1 (c-Fos and c-Jun proteins). The presence of a sulfhydryl group in Hcy was essential for Hcy-induced AP-1 activation. When hepatocytes were transfected with decoy AP-1 oligodeoxynucleotide to inhibit AP-1 activation, Hcy-induced MCP-1 mRNA expression was abolished. Further analysis revealed that increased hepatic MCP-1 expression was positively correlated with the serum MCP-1 level. These results suggest that Hcy-induced MCP-1 expression in the liver is mediated via AP-1 activation, which may contribute to chronic inflammation associated with hyperhomocysteinemia.

The metabolism of methionine to Hcy generates a methyl group that serves as an important methyl donor in cell function (1Jacobsen D.W. Robinson K. Homocysteine and Vascular Disease. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands2000Google Scholar). The cellular homeostasis of Hcy is tightly regulated under physiological conditions. Factors that perturb the step(s) in the Hcy metabolic pathway(s) cause an increase in its cellular levels and lead to hyperhomocysteinemia (plasma Hcy level above 16 μm) (2Kang S.S. Wong P.W. Malinow M.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 279-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar).

It is increasingly recognized that abnormal lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses in the liver can elicit systemic inflammation, which in turn contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease (14Haukeland J.W.

MCP-1 is a potent chemokine for monocyte recruitment into the intima of the arterial wall or the other inflamed tissues (18Yla-Herttuala S. Lipton B.A. Rosenfeld M.E. Sarkioja T. Yoshimura T.

Higher plasma MCP-1 levels (20–35% increase) have been found in patients with stable angina pectoris, vasospasm, and acute coronary syndrome (20Hung M.J. Cherng W.J. Cheng C.W. Li L.F. Am. J. Cardiol. 2006; 97: 1429-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is suggested that an increase in the plasma MCP-1 level would increase the risk of myocardial infarction and death during acute coronary syndrome (21de Lemos J.A. Morrow D.A. Sabatine M.S.

In our recent study the expression of MCP-1 and several adhesion molecules are found to be elevated in the aorta of hyperhomocysteinemic rat (22Wang G. Woo C.W. Sung F.L. Siow Y.L. O K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Two transcription factors, namely, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activator protein (AP-1), play important roles in regulating MCP-1 expression in mammalian cells (23Yoshimura T. Yuhki N. Moore S.K.

Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2011-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). AP-1 and NF-κB are the redox-sensitive transcription factors regulating the expression of genes that are involved in apoptosis and cell proliferation in the liver (25Ahmed-Choudhury J. Russell C.L.

Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In human and rat genomes, the binding site for NF-κB is present in the enhancer region of MCP-1 gene, whereas the binding site for AP-1 is present in the promoter region (23Yoshimura T. Yuhki N. Moore S.K. Appella E. Lerman M.I. Leonard E.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 24Wang Y. Rangan G.K. Goodwin B. Tay Y.C. Harris D.C. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2011-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Activation of both or either one of these transcription factors can elicit MCP-1 gene expression (27Kanno K. Tazuma S. Nishioka T. Hyogo H. Chayama K. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2005; 50: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Wang N. Verna L. Hardy S. Forsayeth J. Zhu Y. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Both AP-1 and NF-κB are present in hepatocytes and can be activated in response to various stimuli (30Gao C. Jokerst R. Gondipalli P. Cai S.R. Kennedy S. Flye M.W. Ponder K.P. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1405-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Siendones E. Fouad D. Diaz-Guerra M.J. de la Mata M. Bosca L. Muntane J. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hcy-induced MCP-1 expression in vascular smooth cells and monocytes/macrophages appears to be mediated via NF-κB activation (29Wang G. Siow Y.L. O K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2840-H2847PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wang G. Siow Y.L. O K. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The effect of Hcy on AP-1 activation varies in different types of cells. For examples, Hcy inhibits AP-1 activation in endothelial cells and fibroblasts (33Drunat S. Moatti N. Demuth K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Suzuki Y.J. Lorenzi M.V. Shi S.S. Day R.M. Blumberg J.B. Free Radic. Biol.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Results from our previous study demonstrate that Hcy, at elevated concentrations, is able to stimulate cholesterol biosynthesis in hepatocytes leading to lipid accumulation in the liver (8Woo C.W. Siow Y.L. Pierce G.N. Choy P.C. Minuk G.Y. Mymin D. O K. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E1002-E1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if Hcy can induce inflammatory responses such as MCP-1 expression in hepatocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Hcy on transcriptional regulation of MCP-1 expression in the liver tissue of hyperhomocysteinemic rat. Our data revealed that Hcy could induce AP-1 activation and enhance MCP-1 production in hepatocytes. Inhibition of AP-1 binding to DNA by decoy oligodeoxynucleotide abolished Hcy-induced MCP-1 expression in hepatocytes. The in vitro protein-oligonucleotide binding assay showed that Hcy was able to directly increase the DNA binding of recombinant AP-1 (c-Fos and c-Jun proteins). Furthermore, a positive correlation between the liver MCP-1 expression and the serum MCP-1 level was observed in hyperhomocysteinemic rats. Our results suggest that Hcy-induced MCP-1 expression in the liver is mediated via AP-1 activation. Reagents—The wild type AP-1 and scrambled decoy oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys. The forward and reverse primers for amplification of MCP-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA were synthesized by Invitrogen. Human recombinant c-Fos, c-Jun, p50, and p65 were purchased from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). Animal Model—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) aged 8 weeks were fed the following types of diet for 4 weeks; 1) a control diet consisting of Lab Diet Rodent Diet 5001 (regular diet containing 0.43% methionine and 0.32% cysteine, wt/wt) (PMI Nutrition International, St Louis, MO), 2) a high methionine diet consisting of regular diet plus 1.7% (wt/wt) methionine, and 3) a high cysteine diet consisting of regular diet plus 1.2% (wt/wt) cysteine as described previously (8Woo C.W.

Hcy and cysteine concentrations in serum and livers were measured by using the IMx Hcy assay and high performance liquid chromatography, respectively (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL) (8Woo C.W.

All procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals published by Canadian Council on Animal Care and approved by the University of Manitoba Protocol Management and Review Committee. Cell Culture—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from rat liver as described previously (8Woo C.W. Siow Y.L. Pierce G.N. Choy P.C. Minuk G.Y. Mymin D. O K. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E1002-E1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, liver was perfused with phosphate-buffered saline via the portal vein at 3 ml/min for 15 min to remove blood cells followed by disassociation with 0.05% type I collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) in Hanks' buffered salt solution. Hepatocytes were harvested, filtered aseptically, and collected using differential centrifugation at low speed, 50 × g. The trypan blue test showed a typical >95% viability of hepatocytes isolated by this method. Hepatocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Hepatocytes were incubated for 24 h post-isolation before experiments (8Woo C.W.

Preparation of l-Hcy—l-Hcy was prepared from l-Hcy thiolactone (Sigma-Aldrich) by a method described previously (8Woo C.W. Siow Y.L. Pierce G.N. Choy P.C. Minuk G.Y. Mymin D. O K. Am. J.

In brief, l-Hcy thiolactone was dissolved and hydrolyzed in NaOH (5 m) to remove the thiolactone group (8Woo C.W. Siow Y.L. Pierce G.N. Choy P.C. Minuk G.Y. Mymin D. O K. Am. J.

The preparation was then neutralized with HCl. The concentration of l-Hcy in the preparation was quantified with the IMx Hcy assay. Freshly prepared l-Hcy was used in all the experiments. Decoy Oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) Transfection—Double-stranded ODNs (Sigma-Genosys) were prepared from complementary single-stranded phosphorothioate-bonded ODNs by melting at 95 °C for 5 min followed by a cool-down phase of 3 h to room temperature (38Polytarchou C. Hatziapostolou M. Papadimitriou E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40428-40435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The sequence of the single-stranded ODNs were 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ for wild type AP-1 and 5′-CATGTCGTCACTGCGCTCAT-3′ for scrambled ODN (underlined letters denote phosphorothioatebonded bases, and bold letters denote the consensus binding site) (39Fichtner-Feigl S. Strober W. Kawakami K. Puri R.K. Kitani A. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In brief, after the attachment of hepatocytes onto culture plates, cells were treated with 100 nm ODN with 4 μl of Oligofectamine® (Invitrogen) in fetal bovine serum-free medium for 4 h. After the delivery of ODN into hepatocytes, the medium containing the decoy ODN was replaced with fresh medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Hepatocytes were incubated for another 20 h before experiments. Reporter Plasmid Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays—A 144-bp rat MCP-1 promoter 5′-flanking region (–90 to +55) (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF079313) with either a wild type (pGL3-AP-1, TGACTCCAC) or a mutated (pGL3-AP-1-Mutant, TGGTACCAC) AP-1 element (Integrated DNA Technology, Inc., Coralville, IA) was inserted into pGL3 luciferase reporter vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) (24Wang Y. Rangan G.K. Goodwin B. Tay Y.C. Harris D.C. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2011-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were transfected with pGL3-AP-1 mutant, pGL3-AP-1 (wild type), or pGL3 vector (control) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 18 h. After transfection, cells were incubated with Hcy for 5 h followed by measuring the luciferase activity in the cell lysate using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a luminometer. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—ChIP was performed as previously described (40Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In brief, cross-linking of hepatic DNA was performed by treating a portion of liver with 1% formaldehyde. Nuclei were isolated, and sheared chromatin was prepared by sonication. The sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Fos and anti-c-Jun antibodies. Another aliquot of sheared chromatin without incubation with antibodies was prepared to normalize the amount of total DNA subjected to ChIP assay (termed mock IP). DNA was then isolated from the immunoprecipitate, and PCR was performed using primers specific for the MCP-1 promoter region with AP-1 binding consensus sequence. The sequences of the primers (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF079313) were 5′-CCCAGTAGTGGCTGGAAAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGTAAGCCAGAGGGTGGAG-3′ (reverse). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear proteins were prepared from rat livers or hepatocytes as previously described, and activation of AP-1 or NF-κB was determined by EMSA (8Woo C.W.

The reaction mixture was then separated in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (6%) and dried on a piece of filter paper followed by autoradiography. The specificity of binding of 32P-labeled AP-1 or NF-κB consensus sequence was examined by competition with 100-fold excessive unlabeled oligonucleotide or 32P-labeled mutant AP-1 consensus sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (8Woo C.W.

The supershift assay was performed by preincubating 2 μg of nuclear protein with 12 μg of c-Fos and/or c-Jun antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-253X and sc-45X) followed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (4%) electrophoresis (37Woo C.W.

For the in vitro binding assay, recombinant c-Fos and/or c-Jun or p50 and/or p65 (Active Motif) were incubated in the presence or absence of Hcy or cysteine in the binding buffer for 15 min at 25 °C before the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (41Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. II I Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). The autoradiograph was analyzed with UN-SCAN-IT gel (Silk Scientific Inc.). For the analysis of kinetic parameters of c-Fos/c-Jun binding to DNA, the area of the AP-1 bands and free probe on the filter paper was cut out according to the autoradiograph image, and radioactivity corresponding to each band was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of c-Fos/c-Jun dimer binding to DNA was calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis (42Suzuki F. Goto M. Sawa C. Ito S. Watanabe H. Sawada J. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29302-29308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Preliminary data showed that c-Fos/c-Jun dissociation followed first order kinetics. To calculate the dissociation constant (koff), a single-exponential dissociation rate equation [AP-1]t = [AP-1]0e–kdt was applied. The slope of the semi-log plot of the natural log of [AP-1]t/[AP-1]0 versus time (t) represented the dissociation constant of c-Fos/c-Jun dimer. Association constant (kon) was calculated based on the equation KD = koff/kon. Western Immunoblot Analysis—An aliquot of nuclear proteins (10 μg) prepared for the EMSA assay was subjected to Western immunoblot analysis (8Woo C.W. Siow Y.L. Pierce G.N. Choy P.C. Minuk G.Y.

Biol. 2006; 26: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, the nuclear proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins in the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was probed with anti-histone antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Ribonuclease Protection Assay—The MCP-1 mRNA expression was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis and ribonuclease protection assay (37Woo C.W. Siow Y.L. O K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 43Sung F.L. Slow Y.L. Wang G. Lynn E.G. O K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 216: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNAs were isolated from liver tissue or hepatocytes with TriZol reagent (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR analysis, 2 μg of total RNA was converted to cDNA. The cDNA with a sequence specific for MCP-1 was further amplified by using Taq-DNA polymerase. The sequences of the primers specific for rat MCP-1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number NM_031530) were: 5′-ATGCAGGTCTCTGTCACGCTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCTGTCATACTGGTCACTTC-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide under UV light with a gel documentation system (Quantity One analysis software, Bio-Rad). GAPDH was used as an internal standard to verify equal RT product loading for each experiment. Ribonuclease protection assay was performed with the BD Ribo-Quant™ Multi-Probe RNase Protection Assay System (BD Biosciences). Briefly, total RNA (10 μg) was hybridized with a 32P-end-labeled MCP-1 oligonucleotide probe (171 bp) overnight at 56 °C followed by ri"
https://openalex.org/W2041057168,"Precursor mRNA splicing is the process through which introns are removed from primary transcripts and the exons that encode amino acid sequences are joined together to generate mature, protein-coding mRNAs (1Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). This process must be extraordinarily precise to ensure accurate decoding of mRNA sequences into functional proteins during translation, but also remarkably flexible, with the ability to recognize and excise introns of variable lengths and sequences. Nearly 90% of human gene sequences consist of introns that must be removed through splicing, and the majority of mutations associated with hereditary human disease are linked to splicing defects (2Wang G.S. Cooper T.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar).Splicing takes place in the spliceosome, which is a complex of five small nuclear RNAs and associated core proteins and several hundred proteins that assembles on nascent pre-mRNAs during transcription. The splicing pathway is an exquisitely orchestrated series of assembly and conformational rearrangement events, punctuated by the chemical transformations of cleavage of phosphodiester bonds at exon/intron junctions and phosphodiester bond formation during exon ligation. In the first chemical step of splicing, the 5′-exon/intron boundary is cleaved through nucleophilic attack by the 2′-hydroxyl of a specific branch-point adenosine located within the intron to generate a 5′-exon fragment and a lariat intermediate that contains intron and 3′-exon sequences and the branched adenosine (Fig. 1). In the second chemical step, cleavage at the 3′-exon/intron boundary occurs through nucleophilic attack of the 3′-hydroxyl of the 5′-exon at the 3′-splice site, which ligates the exons and releases the intron in the form of a lariat. Self-splicing of certain Group II introns occurs through identical chemical steps in the absence of proteins, suggesting that the RNA components of the spliceosome also mediate catalytic chemistry. Since proteins are not essential for catalysis, spliceosomal proteins are likely to contribute to splicing fidelity and link splicing to other steps of mRNA biogenesis, transport, translation, and turnover.The splice sites at the exon/intron boundaries and the branch-point consensus sequences in pre-mRNA are only weakly conserved and are far too simple to specify splice sites uniquely. It has become clear that co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly itself helps to ensure accuracy as intron and exon sequences associate with specific proteins that are deposited onto nascent transcripts. Splice sites are also recognized by complementary base pairing with spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and proteins as splice sites are brought into the active site to proceed through the chemical steps of splice site cleavage and ligation.The human proteome is more diverse than can be explained by the complexity of the genome due to alternative splicing, which is the process of joining different combinations of exons to produce different mature mRNA sequences from the same primary transcript (Fig. 2). The ability to generate a variety of exon combinations from a single primary transcript through alternative splicing allows a single gene to encode multiple protein isoforms. By including particular exons, alternatively spliced mRNAs can encode protein isoforms with different membrane- or ligand-binding domains, altered covalent modification sites or compartmentalization signals, or modified protein or nucleic acid interaction surfaces. Alternative splicing also can down-regulate expression of a gene by introducing a premature stop codon into an mRNA that triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.FIGURE 2Alternative splicing. Exons that contain protein-coding sequences in the genome are indicated by colored rectangles. Precursor mRNAs contain protein-coding exon sequences separated by noncoding introns, which comprise ∼90% of the primary transcript sequence. A single gene can give rise to a variety of mature mRNAs, which each contain a subset of exons that are then translated into different protein isoforms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus, alternative splicing is a fundamental aspect of post-transcriptional gene regulation with significant functional and biomedical implications.

An RasGRP4-defective variant of the human MC line HMC-1 was used to create stable clones expressing green fluorescent protein-labeled RasGRP4 for monitoring the movement of this protein inside MCs after exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and for evaluating the protein's ability to control gene expression. RasGRP4 resided primarily in the cytosol. After exposure to PMA, RasGRP4 quickly translocated to the inner leaflet of the cell's plasma membrane. 15-30 min later, this signaling protein translocated from the plasma membrane to other intracellular sites. The translocation of RasGRP4 from the cytosol to its varied membrane compartments was found to be highly dependent on Phe548 in the protein's C1 DAG/PMA-binding domain. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 were activated during this translocation process, and c-kit/CD117 was lost from the cell's surface. Transcript-profiling approaches revealed that RasGRP4 profoundly regulated the expression of hundreds of genes in HMC-1 cells. For example, the expression of the transcript that encodes the interleukin (IL) 13 receptor IL-13Rα2 increased 61- to 860-fold in RasGRP4-expressing HMC-1 cells. A marked increase in IL-13Rα2 protein levels also was found. The accumulated data suggest RasGRP4 translocates to varied intracellular compartments via its DAG/PMA-binding domain to regulate signaling pathways that control gene and protein expression in MCs, including the cell's ability to respond to IL-13.

A common hematopoietic progenitor gives rise to macrophages, eosinophils, and MCs (24Valent P. Ashman L.K. Hinterberger W. Eckersberger F. Majdic O. Lechner K. Bettelheim P. Blood. 1989; 73: 1778-1785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, no mature tissue macrophage or peripheral blood eosinophil has been found that contains detectable amounts of RasGRP4 protein (20Yang Y. Li L. Wong G.W. Krilis S.A. Madhusudhan M.S.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The amino acid sequence of the primary isoform of hRas-GRP4 in MCs is <50% identical to that of its other family members. However, all RasGRPs contain an N-terminal domain that functions as a guanine nuclear exchange factor and a 50-mer C-terminal C1 domain analogous to that in protein kinases that is a diacylglycerol (DAG)/phorbol ester receptor (1Stone J.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The preferred small GTP-binding proteins in resting and activated MCs regulated by the signaling protein remain to be identified but recombinant mouse and human RasGRP4 can activate recombinant Ras efficiently in vitro in a cation-dependent manner (20Yang Y.

Contact-inhibited mouse 3T3 fibroblasts that have been artificially forced to express either mouse or human RasGRP4 morphologically resemble normal fibroblasts (20Yang Y. Li L. Wong G.W. Krilis S.A.

However, these transfectants undergo dramatic morphologic changes when exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), as others found with fibroblast transfectants that have been forced to express RasGRP1, RasGRP2, or RasGRP3. The PMA-treated, RasGRP4-expressing fibroblasts lose their contact inhibition and increase their rate of proliferation. The accumulated data suggest that the C1 domain in its C terminus is used to translocate this signaling protein to undefined compartments inside MCs where its target small GTP-binding proteins reside. In support of this conclusion, a truncated mRasGRP4 transcript isolated from C3H/HeJ mBMMCs encoded a protein that was unresponsive to PMA when expressed in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (23Li L. Yang Y. Wong G.W. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Data from our earlier in vitro studies have led to the conclusion that RasGRP4 probably is important in the intermediate to final stages of MC development. A variant (20Yang Y. Li L. Wong G.W. Krilis S.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Sali A. Stevens R.L. J. Biol.

Weiler D. Dewald G. Gleich G.J. Leuk. Res. 1988; 12: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) was identified that cannot express biologically active hRasGRP4 due to an inability to remove the U12-dependent intron 3 in its precursor transcript. Many populations of mature human and rodent MCs generate substantial amounts of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) when activated via calcium ionophore (26Lewis R.A. Soter N.A. Diamond P.T. Austen K.F. Oates J.A. Roberts L.J. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1627-1631PubMed Google Scholar). RasGRP4-defective HMC-1 cells express very little PGD2 (27Macchia L. Hamberg M. Kumlin M. Butterfield J.H. Haeggstrom J.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1257: 58-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) because of greatly diminished levels of hematopoietic type PGD2 synthase (28Li L. Yang Y. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4725-4729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using a transfection rescue approach, we induced these hRasGRP4-defective cells to express mRasGRP4 (20Yang Y. Li L. Wong G.W. Krilis S.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Sali A. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25756-25774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because the resulting transfectants markedly increased their expression of PGD2 synthase mRNA and protein and preferentially metabolized arachidonic acid to PGD2 when exposed to calcium ionophore (28Li L. Yang Y. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4725-4729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), RasGRP4 appears to regulate cyclooxygenase pathways in MCs. In support of these data, attenuation of rRasGRP4 mRNA and protein levels in the RBL-2H3 rat MC line using an RNA interference approach led to decreased levels of PGD2 synthase mRNA and protein (28Li L. Yang Y. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4725-4729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).We now describe the creation of new HMC-1 cell clones that contain different levels of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled normal and mutated hRasGRP4. Using these clones, we show that PMA regulates the movement of hRasGRP4 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and then to varied intracellular compartments. We show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 (also known as p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 or MAPK3) and ERK2 (also known as p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 or MAPK1) are activated during this PMA-mediated translocation process and that CD117 is lost from the cell's surface. The mechanisms by which RasGRP4 controls the development and function of MCs remain to be elucidated. Finally, we show that this intracellular signaling protein controls the expression of genes that encode hundreds of proteins in the HMC-1 MC line, including an IL-13 receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of HMC-1 Cell Clones Containing Varying Amounts of GFP-labeled hRasGRP4—To monitor the intracellular movement of hRasGRP4 inside a human MC, we placed the coding domain of a cDNA that encodes biologically active hRasGRP4 (see GenBank™ accession number AY048119) (20Yang Y. Li L. Wong G.W. Krilis S.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Sali A. Stevens R.L. J. Biol.

This expression system uses a cloning strategy that places PCR products in the vector to generate bioengineered fusion proteins that contain GFP at their C termini. The expected fusion protein produced by the transfectants is ∼30 kDa larger than wild-type ∼75-kDa hRasGRP4 because of the covalently linked reporter protein. Crameri and coworkers described the modified GFP gene (namely Cycle 3 GFP) in this vector (29Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). We chose cDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO for our studies, because Cycle 3 GFP can be expressed in most mammalian cells. Moreover, the reporter often results in a >40-fold increase in fluorescence intensity relative to that of replicate transfectants that express recombinant proteins labeled with wild-type GFP. The sense oligonucleotide 5′-CAGATGAACAGAAAAGACAGTAAGAGG-3′ and the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CGGAATCCGGCTTGGAGGATGCAGT-3′ were used in the PCR approach to generate the coding domain of the signaling protein, namely residues 215-2233 in the full-length cDNA. The resulting ∼2.1-kb cDNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and its nucleotide sequence was determined to confirm the absence of mutations. The hRasGRP4-expression vector was generated with the CT-GFP Fusion TOPO TA expression kit using the methodology recommended by Invitrogen. The TOP10 strain of Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) was transformed with the CT-GFP mock vector and the newly created hRasGRP4-CT-GFP vector using the One Shot (Invitrogen) chemical transformation procedure. A standard PCR/gel approach was then used with the T7 sense and GFP antisense oligonucleotides present in the CT-GFP Fusion TOPO TA expression kit to identify those bacterial colonies containing the appropriate construct.The RasGRP4-defective variant (20Yang Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25756-25774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) of the HMC-1 cell line (25Butterfield J.H. Weiler D. Dewald G. Gleich G.J. Leuk. Res. 1988; 12: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) was maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Because no transfection study of HMC-1 cells had been done with Nucleofector methodology before our studies were initiated, we carried out preliminary transfection experiments with Amaxa's Nucleofect-II device. We used several Nucleofection programs, as well as 2 μg of pmaxGFP control vector DNA and solution T, which are both present in the VCA-1002 Cell Line Nucleofector T kit (Amaxa). Approximately 40% of the resulting HMC-1 cells in our initial control transfection experiments contained GFP, as assessed by fluorescent microscopy, when the T20 program of the Nucleofect-II device was used (data not shown). Thus, 106 HMC-1 cells in their log phase of growth were transfected with nucleofection and 5 μg of linearized CT-GFP vector DNA with or without the hRasGRP4 insert. The resulting transfectants were grown as described above except for the addition of Geneticin (Invitrogen, 0.5 or 1.25 mg/ml depending on the cell density) to the culture medium on day 2 post-transfection to induce apoptosis of the non-transfectants. The two doses of the antibiotic were selected on the basis of the results of Geneticin-induced death curve experiments carried out on HMC-1 cells cultured at low and high densities.Once we had obtained sufficient numbers of hRasGRP4-expressing HMC-1 cells, we performed a limiting dilution clonal assay in which cells were suspended at a density of ∼5 cells/ml in culture medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin. One hundred microliters of this cell suspension was added to each chamber of flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One). After 4 days of culture, those wells that contained a single clone of cells were identified. These wells were re-examined by fluorescence microscopy at day 14 to identify clones that differed in their intracellular levels of GFP-labeled hRasGRP4. To confirm that the selected clones maintained their levels of hRasGRP4-GFP, each was subjected to a second limiting dilution cloning step.Generation of HMC-1 Cells That Express a Ser548 Mutant of hRasGRP4—Residue 548 in hRasGRP4 is Phe, and this amino acid is the eighth amino acid in the signaling protein's putative DAG/PMA-binding domain. The corresponding amino acid in hRasGRP1, hRasGRP2, and hRasGRP3 is Tyr, Ser, and Tyr, respectively. Because it has been concluded that this residue plays a critical role in the DAG/PMA-dependent translocation of other RasGRPs (30Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Bustelo X.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33465-33473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), a site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to convert Phe548 in hRasGRP4-GFP to Ser. The sense oligonucleotide 5′-CACACCTTCCATGAGGTCACCTCGCGAAAGCCTACCTTCTGCGACAG-3′, the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CTGTCGCAGAAGGTAGGCTTTCGCGAGGTGACCTCATGGAAGGTGTG-3′, and the QuikChange II XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) were employed to mutate nucleotides 1856-1858 in the expression construct noted above that encodes normal hRasGRP4-GFP. Plasmid transformation was performed following DpnI digestion of the template DNA. Colonies were screened by PCR, and the hRas-GRP4-GFP cDNAs in the resulting clones were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. After transformation for 7 days, the transfectants were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sorted for GFP expression using a MoFlo MLS Flow Cytometer (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO) equipped with a 488 nm argon-ion laser. Sorted cells were then expanded in culture medium supplemented with 500 ng/ml Geneticin to obtain the desired transfectants that express the Ser548 mutant of hRasGRP4-GFP.Evaluation of hRasGRP4 Expression in HMC-1 Cell Transfectants—The RasGRP4 gene is transcribed in the starting HMC-1 cell line used in our study, but these human leukemic MCs cannot express functional RasGRP4 protein due to an inability to remove intron 3 from its precursor transcript (20Yang Y.

Thus, reverse transcriptase PCR and SDS-PAGE immunoblot approaches were used to confirm that our newly generated HMC-1 cell clones contain appreciable amounts of biologically active hRasGRP4 mRNA and protein.For transcript analysis, total RNA was extracted from the parental HMC-1 cell line and the transfectants with the QIAamp RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen), which uses spin-column technology. A semi-quantitative, SuperScript one-step reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out with the Platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen) and the sense oligonucleotide 5′-AGAGGAAGTCCCACCAGGAA-3′ and the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CGGAACTCCAGGTAGGTAGGTGAG-3′, which correspond to nucleotide sequences in exons 2 and 6 of the hRas-GRP4 gene, respectively. For each sample, 100-500 ng of total RNA was placed in reverse transcriptase-containing buffer and incubated for 30 min at 50 °C. After a 2-min heat-denaturation step at 94 °C, each of the 30 cycles of the subsequent PCR steps consisted of a 2-min denaturing step at 94 °C, a 30-s annealing step at 59 °C, and a 1-min extension step at 72 °C. The resulting PCR products were heated at 72 °C for 10 min and then electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels. As internal controls, the same RNA samples also were evaluated in this semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis for their levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA using the oligonucleotides 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′ and 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′.The presence of ∼105-kDa biologically active hRasGRP4-GFP protein was then evaluated by an SDS-PAGE immunoblotting assay with an antibody to GFP (Invitrogen). In these experiments, cell lysates were boiled in SDS-sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The resulting solubilized proteins were resolved on precast NuPAGE 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), and the separated proteins were transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences/Amersham Biosciences). GFP-labeled positope protein (Invitrogen) was used as a positive control. The resulting protein blots were exposed to Tris-HCl-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk to minimize non-specific binding of the primary and secondary antibodies. The treated blots were then exposed to a 1000-fold dilution of the rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes) in the above blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a 1000-fold dilution of horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (DakoCytomation). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with Hyperfilm ECL radiographic film (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences/Amersham Biosciences) after the blots were exposed to ECL developing reagent.hRasGRP4-GFP Translocation and Colocalization Experiments—PMA stimulation of the varied HMC-1 cell clones was performed in 96-well plates. GFP- and hRasGRP4-GFP-expressing HMC-1 cells were placed in serum-free medium before exposure to PMA. Cell number and viability were determined before the HMC-1 cells were exposed to 1-1000 nm PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.003-0.01% Me2SO for 10, 30, and 60 min. The treated cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and washed again with PBS. All slides were treated with ImmunO (immuno-fluore mounting medium, MP Biomedicals, Aurora, Ohio). Confocal microscopy was performed with the Leica laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) DM IRE2 TCS SP2 AOBS using a 100×/1.4-0.7 PL APO oil immersion objective. GFP and hRasGRP4-GRP were detected using a 488 nm argon laser. Each image represents a single “Z” optical section. The images were prepared as figures using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CS.hRasGRP4-induced Phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in HMC-1 Cells—Control HMC-1 cells and their transfectants were evaluated before and after PMA exposure to determine if hRasGRP4 regulates the phosphorylation of ERK1 and/or ERK2.

PMA stimulation was performed in Microtest 96-well V-bottom plates (Sarstedt) at 106 cells/well. A number"
https://openalex.org/W2091603094,"Human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease (hAPE) initiates the repair of an abasic site (AP site). To gain insight into the mechanisms of damage recognition of hAPE, we conducted surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of its interaction with substrate DNA containing an abasic site (AP DNA). The affinity of hAPE binding toward DNA increased as much as 6-fold after replacing a single adenine (equilibrium dissociation constant, K(D), 5.3 nm) with an AP site (K(D), 0.87 nm). The enzyme-substrate complex formation appears to be thermodynamically stabilized and favored by a large change in Gibbs free energy, DeltaG degrees (-50 kJ/mol). The latter is supported by a high negative change in enthalpy, DeltaH degrees (-43 kJ/mol) and also positive change in entropy, DeltaS degrees (24 J/(K mol)), and thus the binding process is spontaneous at all temperatures. Analysis of kinetic parameters reveals small enthalpy of activation for association, DeltaH degrees++(ass) (-17 kJ/mol), and activation energy for association (E(a), -14 kJ/mol) when compared with the enthalpy of activation for dissociation, DeltaH degrees++(diss) (26 kJ/mol), and activation energy in the reverse direction (E(d), 28 kJ/mol). Furthermore, varying concentration of KCl showed an increase in binding affinity at low concentration but complete abrogation of the binding at higher concentration, implying the importance of hydrophobic, but predominantly ionic, forces in the Michaelis-Menten complex formation. Thus, low activation energy and the enthalpy of activation, which are perhaps a result of dipole-dipole interactions, play critical roles in AP site binding of APE."

Among the three previously identified ITIMs, both ITIMs containing tyrosine residues at position 843 (Tyr843) and 863 (Tyr863), respectively, are shown to be required for CD22 to recruit SHP-1 and regulate BCR signaling upon BCR ligation by anti-Ig antibody (Ab), indicating that CD22 has the SHP-1-binding domain at the region containing Tyr843 and Tyr863. Here we address the requirement of CD22 for SHP-1 recruitment and BCR regulation upon BCR ligation by antigen, which induces much stronger CD22 phosphorylation than anti-Ig Ab does. We demonstrate that the CD22 mutant in which both Tyr843 and Tyr863 are replaced by phenylalanine (CD22F5/6) recruits SHP-1 and regulates BCR signaling upon stimulation with antigen but not anti-Ig Ab. This result strongly suggests that CD22 contains another SHP-1 binding domain that is specifically activated upon stimulation with antigen. Both of the flanking sequences of Tyr783 and Tyr817 fit the consensus sequence of ITIM, and the CD22F5/6 mutant requires these tyrosine residues for SHP-1 binding and BCR regulation.

Later, Otipoby et al. examined SHP-1 recruitment to CD22 in B cells when CD22 is phosphorylated by BCR ligation, and demonstrated that both Tyr843 and Tyr863 but not Tyr783 are required for recruitment of SHP-1 to CD22 (17Otipoby K.L. Draves K.E. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44315-44322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This result indicated that the region containing Tyr843 and Tyr863 constitutes the SHP-1-binding domain of CD22, whereas ITIM containing Tyr783 is dispensable for SHP-1 recruitment. However, this study was done using B cells in which BCR is ligated by anti-Ig antibody (Ab) but not antigen. Recently, we demonstrated that BCR ligation by antigen induces stronger CD22 phosphorylation than anti-Ig Ab-induced BCR ligation through generation of a distinct BCR signaling (18Hokazono Y. Adachi T. Wabl M. Tada N. Amagasa T. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Weak CD22 phosphorylation upon stimulation with anti-Ig Ab was not due to quantitatively weak BCR signaling but rather due to qualitatively distinct signaling from that induced by antigen, because stimulation with anti-Ig Ab strongly phosphorylated various signaling molecules, including extracellular signal regulatory kinase (ERK), but only weakly phosphorylated CD22. Many anti-Ig Abs bind to the membrane-proximal part of BCR, whereas antigens bind to the antigen-binding site at the membrane-distal part of BCR. Therefore, we proposed that these anti-Ig Abs disrupt interaction between CD22 and BCR, thereby preventing phosphorylation of CD22 by BCR-associated kinase Lyn (19Smith K.G. Tarlinton D.M. Doody G.M.

Thus, SHP-1-binding sites in CD22 need to be examined in B cells after BCR ligation by antigens, because tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 is crucial for its binding to SHP-1. We here demonstrate that, in B cells stimulated with antigen but not anti-Ig Ab, the CD22 mutant in which both Tyr843 and Tyr863 are replaced by phenylalanine is capable of recruiting SHP-1 and negatively regulating BCR signaling, suggesting that CD22 contains another SHP-1 binding domain specifically activated by antigen stimulation other than that containing Tyr843 and Tyr863. Further, we demonstrate that Tyr783 at a previously defined ITIM (15Thomas M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1953-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) does not regulate phosphorylation of other tyrosines, such as Tyr843 and Tyr863, but plays an essential role, together with Tyr817, in SHP-1 binding and BCR regulation of the mutant CD22 carrying Tyr → Phe mutations at both Tyr843 and Tyr863. These results clearly indicate that the region containing Tyr783 and Tyr817 constitutes a novel SHP-1-binding site that is activated upon BCR ligation by antigen but not anti-Ig Ab. Retrovirus Vectors—The murine CD22 cDNA was obtained from pMX-CD22.2-REV (12Wakabayashi C. Adachi T. Wienands J. Tsubata T. Science. 2002; 298: 2392-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and was cloned into the bicistronic retrovirus vector pMXs-IG (23Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J.

Kitamura, University of Tokyo), allowing expression of both green fluorescent protein and CD22 (pMXs-CD22-IG). A tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation (Tyr → Phe mutation) at Tyr773, Tyr783, Tyr817, Tyr828, Tyr843, or Tyr863 was introduced to the CD22 cDNA by PCR using specific primers (supplemental Table S1). A pair of synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-GGCCGCCTATCCCTATGACGTGCCCGACTATGCCTGA-3′ and 5′-GGCCTCAGGCATAGTCGGGCACGTCATAGGGATAGGC-3′) encoding both hemagglutinin (HA) tag and a stop codon was annealed and inserted at the NotI site of the pMXs-IG vector containing wild type or mutant CD22 (Fig. 1). Cell Culture—The mouse B cell lines K46μv and BAL17IgM were described previously (12Wakabayashi C. Adachi T. Wienands J. Tsubata T. Science. 2002; 298: 2392-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm glutamine. The retrovirus packaging cell lines PLAT-E (a gift of Dr. T. Kitamura) (24Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar) and Phoenix (a gift of Dr. G. P. Nolan, Stanford University School of Medicine) (25Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin. For retrovirus transduction, the packaging cells were transfected with retrovirus vectors using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were cultured for 48 h, and the culture supernatant was collected. K46μv and BAL17IgM cells were incubated with the supernatant containing retrovirus for 4 h. Flow Cytometry—Cells were stained with (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl (NP)-conjugated phycoerythrin or the combination of biotinylated anti-mouse CD22 monoclonal Ab (mAb) Cy34.1 (BD Biosciences) and Cy5-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter LSR (BD Biosciences) or a CyAn (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—K46μv and BAL17IgM cells were stimulated with 0.2 μg/ml NP-conjugated bovine serum albumin (BSA), 25 μm pervanadate/H2O2 or 10 μg/ml anti-IgM Ab for 1, 3, and 10 min. Either unstimulated or stimulated cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4) and were immunoprecipitated with rat anti-HA mAb 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) or rabbit anti-SHP-1 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Total cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), rat anti-HA mAb 3F10, rabbit anti-SHP-1 Ab, mouse anti-Grb2 Ab (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), Abs to phosphorylated ITIMs containing Tyr843 and Tyr863, respectively (26Fujimoto M. Kuwano Y. Watanabe R. Asashima N. Nakashima H. Yoshitake S. Okochi H. Tamaki K. Poe J.C. Tedder T.F. Sato S. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), anti-β-tubulin mAb TUB2.1 (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan), anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-AKT Ab, followed by a reaction with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Ab (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), anti-mouse IgG Ab, or anti-rat IgG Ab (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Proteins were visualized by an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Mobilization—Cells were incubated in culture medium containing 5 mm Fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min. Cells were stimulated with 0.2 μg/ml NP-BSA or 10 μg/ml anti-IgM Ab and analyzed by flow cytometry using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter LSR (BD Biosciences). CD22 ITIMs Containing Tyr843 and Tyr863 Are Dispensable for CD22-mediated BCR Regulation—To investigate whether Tyr843 and Tyr863 are required for CD22-mediated signal regulation in antigen-stimulated B cells, we generated two retrovirus vectors expressing HA-tagged mutant CD22. One carries double Tyr → Phe mutations at both Tyr843 and Tyr863 (CD22F5/6), and the other carries triple Tyr → Phe mutations at Tyr783, Tyr843, and Tyr863 (CD22F2/5/6) (Fig. 1). Retrovirus expressing wild-type or mutant CD22 was transduced to the mouse B cell lines K46μv and BAL17IgM, both of which express membrane-bound IgM reactive to the hapten NP (12Wakabayashi C. Adachi T. Wienands J. Tsubata T. Science. 2002; 298: 2392-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Since K46μv but not BAL17IgM lacks expression of endogenous CD22 (12Wakabayashi C. Adachi T. Wienands J. Tsubata T. Science. 2002; 298: 2392-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we assessed expression of both transduced wild-type and mutated CD22 in K46μv and BAL17 transfectants by flow cytometry using anti-CD22 Ab and Western blotting using anti-HA Ab, respectively. In these transfectants, the expression levels of mutant CD22 molecules were comparable with that of wild-type CD22, and the expression levels of NP-reactive BCR were similar to those in the cells transduced with the empty vector alone (K46μv-vector and BAL17IgM-vector) (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). We stimulated K46μv-vector, K46μvCD22, K46μvCD22F5/6, and K46μvCD22F2/5/6 transfectants with an antigen NP-BSA and examined phosphorylation of cellular substrates. Surprisingly, antigen stimulation-induced phosphorylation of various cellular substrates was reduced in K46μvCD22F5/6 cells compared with K46μv-vector, and the reduction of phosphorylation by CD22F5/6 was as strong as that by wild-type CD22 (Fig. 2A). Further, CD22F5/6 reduced antigen-induced phosphorylation of both ERK and AKT as efficiently as wild-type CD22 (Fig. 2, B and C). These results strongly suggested that both Tyr843 and Tyr863 of CD22 are dispensable for CD22-mediated signal inhibition in antigen-stimulated K46μv cells. In contrast, expression of CD22F2/5/6 failed to reduce the phosphorylation levels of various cellular substrates, including ERK and AKT, in antigen-stimulated K46μv transfectants (Fig. 2), suggesting that Tyr783 is required for BCR regulation by CD22F5/6. We next examined association of mutant CD22 molecules with SHP-1 and, as a control, their association with Grb2. When K46μv transfectants were stimulated with NP-BSA, CD22F5/6 was phosphorylated and co-precipitated with both Grb2 and SHP-1 as efficiently as wild-type CD22 (5Poe J.C. Fujimoto M. Jansen P.J. Miller A.S. Tedder T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17420-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). This result indicated that both Tyr843 and Tyr863 are dispensable for recruiting SHP-1 to CD22 upon antigen stimulation. In contrast, CD22F2/5/6 was phosphorylated weakly and was not co-precipitated with SHP-1. Treatment with pervanadate/H2O2, a phosphatase inhibitor, phosphorylated CD22F2/5/6 as strongly as wild type CD22 and CD22F5/6 and induced efficient co-precipitation of Grb2 with CD22F2/5/6, probably due to the presence of Tyr828 responsible for Grb2 binding in this mutant (Fig. 3B). However, SHP-1 was co-precipitated with wild type CD22 and CD22F5/6 but not CD22F2/5/6, indicating that CD22F2/5/6 does not recruit SHP-1 even if strongly phosphorylated. Essentially the same result on SHP-1 recruitment was obtained in BAL17IgM transfectants (Fig. 3, C and D), although we could not determine the impact of mutant CD22 on BCR-mediated substrate phosphorylation in these cells due to expression of endogenous CD22. Taken together, CD22F5/6 carrying Y/F mutations at both Tyr843 and Tyr863 but not CD22F2/5/6 was able to regulate BCR signaling and recruit SHP-1 upon antigen stimulation. Thus, Tyr843 and Tyr863 are dispensable for CD22 to bind to SHP-1 and to regulate BCR signaling in antigen-stimulated B cells, and Tyr783 is involved in CD22-mediated BCR regulation, probably by serving as a binding site for SHP-1. Tyr783 Is Involved in CD22-mediated BCR Regulation without Influencing Phosphorylation of Other Tyrosine Residues in CD22—To address the role of Tyr783 in CD22-mediated signal regulation, we constructed the retrovirus vector encoding mutant CD22 containing a Tyr → Phe mutation at Tyr783 alone (CD22F2) (Fig. 1) and transduced the retrovirus vector to K46μv cells. The expression levels of CD22 and NP-reactive BCR on K46μvCD22F2 transfectants were similar to those on K46μvCD22 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). When the K46μvCD22F2 cells were stimulated with NP-BSA, CD22F2 was phosphorylated and associated with SHP-1 almost as efficiently as wild-type CD22 (Fig. 4A). Antigen-stimulated K46μvCD22F2 cells showed weaker ERK phosphorylation and weaker calcium mobilization than K46μv cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, CD22F2 recruited SHP-1 and regulated BCR signaling, probably because ITIMs containing Tyr843 and Tyr863 in CD22F2 recruited SHP-1 and regulated BCR signaling. However, antigen-stimulated K46μvCD22F2 cells showed stronger calcium mobilization than K46μvCD22 cells (Fig. 4C). This result indicated that CD22F2 regulated calcium signaling less efficiently than wild-type CD22 and suggested that Tyr783 is involved in the regulation of BCR signaling even in the presence of Tyr843 and Tyr863. In contrast, CD22F2 down-modulated ERK phosphorylation almost as strongly as wild-type CD22 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that activation of ERK is more sensitive to SHP-1-mediated signal regulation than calcium signaling. To address whether Tyr783 regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22, we examined phosphorylation of Tyr843 and Tyr863 using Abs that specifically recognize phosphorylated ITIMs containing Tyr843 and Tyr863, respectively (26Fujimoto M. Kuwano Y. Watanabe R. Asashima N. Nakashima H. Yoshitake S. Okochi H. Tamaki K. Poe J.C. Tedder T.F. Sato S. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of both Tyr843 and Tyr863 in CD22F2 in antigen-stimulated K46μv transfectants was comparable to that in wild-type CD22 (Fig. 4D), indicating that Tyr783 does not regulate phosphorylation of other tyrosines in the cytoplasmic region of CD22. Taken together, Tyr783 is involved in BCR regulation without influencing phosphorylation of other tyrosines in CD22. Both Tyr783 and Tyr817 Are Required for CD22-mediated Signal Regulation in the Absence of Tyr843 and Tyr863—We next asked whether the ITIM containing Tyr783 regulates BCR signaling alone or in combination with yet uncharacterized ITIM. Besides tyrosine residues at the previously defined ITIMs, CD22 contains three tyrosine residues at positions 773, 817, and 828 in the cytoplasmic region. Among these tyrosine residues, the flanking sequence of Tyr773 does not fit the consensus ITIM sequence at all. We thus constructed retrovirus vector encoding CD22 Tyr → Phe mutant containing only one tyrosine in the cytoplasmic region at Tyr783 (CD22F1/3/4/5/6), that containing two tyrosine residues at Tyr783 and Tyr817 (CD22F1/4/5/6), and that containing Tyr783 and Tyr828 (CD22F1/3/5/6) (Fig. 1), and K46μv cells were transduced with these vectors. The expression levels of both CD22 and NP-reactive BCR in these transfectants were similar to those of K46μvCD22 and K46μvCD22F5/6 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). When we stimulated the transfectants with an antigen NP-BSA, CD22F1/4/5/6 but not CD22F1/3/5/6 or CD22F1/3/4/5/6 negatively regulated both ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5A) and calcium mobilization (Fig. 5B), although both CD22F5/6 and CD22F1/4/5/6 regulated calcium signaling less efficiently than wild type CD22. CD22F1/4/5/6 and CD22F1/3/5/6 but not CD22F1/3/4/5/6 were phosphorylated as strongly as wild-type CD22 (Fig. 5C). However, SHP-1 was recruited by CD22F1/4/5/6 containing Tyr783 and Tyr817 but not CD22F1/3/5/6 containing Tyr783 and Tyr828 (Fig. 5C). These results indicated that Tyr783 alone is not able to recruit SHP-1 or regulate BCR and requires co-presence of Tyr817 for recruiting SHP-1 and regulating BCR in the absence of Tyr843 and Tyr863. Since the flanking sequence of Tyr817 (VTYSVI) fits ITIM ((I/V/L/S)XYXX(L/V/I)) (27Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), the sequence surrounding Tyr817 appears to be a functional ITIM and to serve as a binding site for SHP-1 in combination with ITIM containing Tyr783 in antigen-stimulated B cells. Both Tyr783 and Tyr817 Are Not Involved in BCR Regulation upon BCR Ligation by Anti-Ig Ab—We asked whether SHP-1 binding sites of CD22 in antigen-stimulated B cells is different from those in B cells in which BCR is ligated by anti-Ig Ab. When K46μv transfectants were stimulated with anti-Ig Ab, wild-type CD22 but not CD22F5/6 carrying Tyr → Phe mutations at both Tyr843 and Tyr863 co-precipitated SHP-1 (Fig. 6A) and regulated BCR signaling including ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 6B) and calcium mobilization (Fig. 6C). Thus, the ITIMs containing Tyr843 and Tyr863 but not those containing Tyr783 and Tyr817 are responsible for SHP-1 recruitment and BCR signal regulation in anti-Ig Ab-treated K46μv cells, in agreement with a previous finding by Otipoby et al. (17Otipoby K.L. Draves K.E. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44315-44322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Taken together, ITIMs containing Tyr783 and Tyr817 are involved in SHP-1 recruitment and BCR regulation upon BCR ligation by antigen but not anti-Ig Ab. In this study, we demonstrate that the previously defined SHP-1-binding domain containing Tyr843 and Tyr863 is dispensable for CD22 to recruit SHP-1 and to regulate BCR signaling in the B cell lines K46μv and BAL17IgM and that the previously identified ITIM containing Tyr783 is involved in both SHP-1 binding and BCR regulation. Some of the tyrosine residues in the molecules, such as HS1, augment their tyrosine phosphorylation by a mechanism known as processive phosphorylation (28Yamanashi Y. Fukuda T. Nishizumi H. Inazu T. Higashi K. Kitamura D. Ishida T. Yamamura H. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), in which a phosphorylated tyrosine recruits the kinase that phosphorylates other tyrosine residues in the same molecule (29Mayer B.J.

Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). However, Tyr783 does not regulate phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues of CD22. In contrast, the peptide containing Tyr783 was previously shown to bind to SHP-1 (14Doody G.M. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L. Fearon D.T. Science. 1995; 269: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus, Tyr783 does not augment binding of SHP-1 to other tyrosine residues of CD22 but rather serves as a SHP-1-binding site, thereby contributing to CD22-mediated signal regulation. We further demonstrated here that the flanking sequence of Tyr817 fits the consensus sequence of ITIM (27Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) and that both Tyr783 and Tyr817 are required for SHP-1 binding and BCR regulation of CD22F5/6 mutant carrying a Tyr → Phe mutation at Tyr843 and Tyr863. Both biochemical and structural studies previously demonstrated that efficient activation of SHP-1 requires engagement of both of the SH2 domains by peptides containing two phosphotyrosine residues (27Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 32Yang J. Liu L. He D. Song X. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6516-6520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Requirement of both Tyr783 and Tyr817 for SHP-1 recruitment in CD22F5/6 therefore suggests that two ITIMs containing Tyr783 and Tyr817, respectively, bind to the two SH2 domains of SHP-1, thereby recruiting it and regulating BCR signaling. Thus, Tyr783 plays a role together with Tyr817 in CD22-mediated BCR regulation by constituting a novel SHP-1-binding site. Here we demonstrate that the ITIMs containing Tyr783 and Tyr817 recruit SHP-1 and regulate BCR signaling upon BCR ligation by antigens but not anti-Ig Ab. We previously demonstrated that antigen stimulation induces stronger CD22 phosphorylation than stimulation with anti-Ig Ab by generating a qualitatively distinct signaling (18Hokazono Y. Adachi T. Wabl M. Tada N. Amagasa T. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When B cells are stimulated with antigens, CD22 is translocated to the BCR-containing lipid rafts and is strongly phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase Lyn, which is concentrated in lipid rafts (33Yu J. Sawada T. Adachi T. Gao X. Takematsu H. Kozutsumi Y. Ishida H. Kiso M. Tsubata T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 360: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, BCR ligation with anti-Ig Ab induces weak phosphorylation of CD22 (18Hokazono Y. Adachi T. Wabl M. Tada N. Amagasa T. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) probably because of exclusion of CD22 from BCR-containing lipid rafts. 3J. Yu and T. Tsubata, unpublished observation. ITIMs containing Tyr843 and Tyr863 probably recruit SHP-1 with a lower phosphorylation level, whereas those containing Tyr783 and Tyr817 appear to require higher levels of phosphorylation for SHP-1 binding. Previously, Doody et al. (14Doody G.M. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L. Fearon D.T. Science. 1995; 269: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) demonstrated that phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr783, Tyr843, and Tyr863, respectively, but not that containing Tyr817 block binding of CD22 to SHP-1. This suggests that ITIM containing Tyr817 binds to SHP-1 less efficiently than the other ITIMs and may require strong phosphorylation for SHP-1 recruitment. However, the flanking sequence of Tyr817 completely fits the consensus sequence of ITIM (27Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) and does not show a particular difference from other ITIMs; therefore, how the ITIM containing Tyr817 binds to SHP-1 less efficiently is not yet known. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanism and functional significance of stimulation-dependent activation of the novel inhibitory domain of CD22 containing Tyr783 and Tyr817.

https://openalex.org/W2082284045,"In junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, binding to cardiac triadin-1 provides a mechanism by which the Ca2+-release channel/ryanodine receptor may link with calsequestrin to regulate Ca2+ release. Calsequestrin and triadin-1 both contain N-linked glycans, but about half of triadin-1 in the heart remains unglycosylated. To investigate mechanisms for this incomplete glycosylation, we overexpressed triadin-1 as a series of glycoform variants in non-muscle cell lines and neonatal heart cells using plasmid and adenoviral vectors. We showed that the characteristic incomplete glycosylation stemmed from properties of the glycosylation sequence that are conserved among triadin splice variants, including the close proximity of Asn75 to the sarcoplasmic reticulum inner membrane. Although triadin-1 appeared by SDS-PAGE analysis as a 35/40-kDa doublet in all cells, variations occurred in the relative levels of the two glycoforms depending on the cell type and whether overexpression involved a plasmid or adenoviral vector. Treatment of triadin-1 with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 led to striking changes in the relative levels of triadin-1 that indicated active breakdown of unglycosylated, but not glycosylated, triadin-1. Besides substantial increases in the relative levels of unglycosylated triadin-1, proteasome inhibition led to an accumulation of two new modified forms of triadin-1 that were seen with triadin-1 only when it is not glycosylated on Asn75. Effects of tunicamycin and endoglycosidase H confirmed that these novel isoforms represent two alternative N-linked glycosylation sites, indicating that an alternative topology occurs infrequently leading to yet other glycoforms with short half-lives."

The present study demonstrates that low concentrations of the specific kainate GLU(K5) receptor agonist, ATPA, depressed baseline activity in the lateral nucleus of the rat amygdala (LA), induced by stimulation of external capsule fibers or by intranuclear stimulation in horizontal brain slices. ATPA reduced high-frequency-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in males while it enhanced LTP in females during certain phases of the estrus cycle. In untreated slices from females, LA-LTP differed depending on the phase of the estrus cycle. In addition, we show for the first time that the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor, SKF 86002, reduced LA-LTP. In males, the effects of ATPA and SKF 86002 were not additive. To the contrary, in females, the exposure to ATPA in control plus SKF 86002 increases LTP relative to control plus SKF 86002 alone. Thus, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of GLU(K5) stimulation on plasticity changes in the amygdala is gender-dependent and that the MAP kinase pathway might be involved in males."
