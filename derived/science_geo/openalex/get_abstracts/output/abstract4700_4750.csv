https://openalex.org/W1983940749,Deproteinized skeletal muscle extracts free of major nucleotides from control and insulin-treated rats were fractionated and assayed for inhibition of protein phosphorylation by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent and -independent protein kinases. A differential effect of insulin on a particular fraction was observed on cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase but not on cyclic AMP-independent protein kinases. This fraction that inhibited cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase also stimulated glycogen synthase phosphoprotein phosphatase. It is proposed that this fraction may contain a mediator substance generateed in the presence of insulin.

The protein is concentrated on the inner surface of the plasma membrane, particularly under ruffles, and it is highly concentrated on the inner surface of the membrane near junctions connecting adjacent cells. Small amounts of p60src were detected in the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear Golgi region of the cell. No significant localization was detected in control NRK cells or in NRK cells transformed by the Kirsten strain of murine sarcoma virus. The presence of p60src on the inner surface of the plasma membrane indicates that the changes in cell growth, cell shape and cell membrane structure noted in ASV-transformed cells are due to an initial action of p60src at the cell membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2031744140,"The complete DNA sequence of the human papovavirus BK is presented. From the 4963 base-pair sequence of BK virus (MM strain), the amino acid sequence of at least five proteins can be deduced: a T antigen and a t antigen, which share amino terminal peptides; proteins VP2 and VP3, which share 232 amino acids; and protein VP1, whose coding sequence overlaps those for VP2 and VP3 by 113 nucleotides but is read in a different frame. The gene loci and the arrangement of genes are strikingly similar in BK virus and simian virus 40 (SV40). The sequence of the deduced proteins in BK virus shares 73 percent amino acid homology with those in SV40, whereas the DNA sequence of the two viruses shares 70 percent homology, suggesting close evolutionary relationship. However, the repeated DNA sequences in the noncoding regions of these viruses are different."

https://openalex.org/W1488274351,"Evidence is presented demonstrating the existence of a receptor specific for transferrin on the brush border membrane of the human syncytial trophoblast. Equilibrium-binding studies were conducted using a placental vesicle preparation to demonstrate the presence of a high affinity, saturable binding site for ‘251-ferrotransferrin on placental membranes. The K, for this binding site was determined by Scatchard analysis to be 3.6 + 1.5 S.D. x lo7 M-‘. The specificity of the high affinity transferrin binding site was examined by competition studies showing that purified human IgG, human albumin, and ovalbumin did not compete for the binding sites. The protein nature of the binding site was suggested by its sensitivity to trypsinization of the membrane vesicles. Solubilization of the membranes with Triton X-100 did not impair the binding of “‘I-transferrin or the K, ‘of the soluble receptor. The transferrin binding of the complex was stable at pH 5.0 and reversible at pH 7.4. Using stabilization at pH 5.0, the solubilized membrane l transferrin complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-transferrin antibodies in the presence of saturating concentrations of transfer-r-in using Staphylococcus aweus as an immunoadsorbant. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this complex in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate demonstrated a single polypeptide of M, = 90,000 + 5,000 and p1 of 6.6 associated with transferrin in the immunoprecipitates of the membrane extracts. These values for the putative receptor were the same as for sialoglycoprotein 15b previously identified in a study characterizing the surface sialoglycoproteins of the term human placenta (Wada, H. G., Gornicki, S. Z., and Sussman, H. H. (1977) J. Supramol. Struct. 6,473-484). The demonstration of the transferrin receptor in the human placenta is of potential importance for studying the molecular mechanism involved in transplacental iron transport during fetal development."

Increasing the dielectric constant of an artificial bilayer increases its permeability to perchlorate or thiocyanate by a factor of 1000, to a value comparable to that of mitochondrial membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1497987465,"Microtubule inhibitors can be classified into two categories: 1) those which inhibit the polymerization-dependent GTPase activity of phosphocellulose-purified tubulin, but induce a significant polymerization-independent GTPase activity (e.g. colchicine, griseofulvine, daunorubicine); 2) those which inhibit the GTPase activity associated with tubulin polymerization and that induced by inhibitors of the first class (e.g. the vincaalkaloids and podophyllotoxin). The colchicine-stimulated GTPase activity of tubulin appears to be due to the tubulin.colchicine complex. This suggests that colchicine inhibits tubulin assembly by binding to a tubulin-tubulin interaction site required for the polymerization-dependent GTPase activity and induces by itself a tubulin conformational change that leads to polymerization-independent GTPase activity. Stoichiometry of inhibition by vinblastine of the colchicine-stimulated GTPase activity is 1:2. On the other hand, the inhibition by vinblastine of the tubulin self-assembly and of the polymerization-dependent GTPase activity is strongly substoichiometric at the beginning of the polymerization reaction, 1 vinblastine molecule inhibiting the ability of 10 tubulin dimers to polymerize and to hydrolyze the GTP. However, at the polymerization plateau, the inhibition effect by vinblastine appears to be lower, suggesting a selective action of vinblastine on the early stages of the polymerization reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2005391395,"Early deletion mutants of SV40 were studied in an attempt to determine the nucleotide sequences which affect the processing and stability of the two major early SV40 mRNAs. The early SV40 mutants with deletions between 0.53 and 0.60 map units (54/59 mutants) are viable in tissue culture infections. While all of these early viable mutants contain deletions in the intervening sequences for the large T antigen, results from transcriptional mapping showed that none of them appears to affect the sites or frequency of splicing for large T-mRNA. The 54/59 mutants in which the deletion removes the proximal small t splice junction make no discrete stable cytoplasmic small t-mRNA. Those 54/59 mutants with deletions that do not include the splice junction synthesize discrete and predictably shortened small t-mRNAs. The size and location of the specific deletions, however, appear to affect significantly the abundance of the altered transcripts; this probably reflects the frequency with which the splice is made. These findings suggest that both the primary sequence near the splice junctions and the secondary or tertiary RNA structure influence the location and frequency with which a particular splicing event occurs. In addition, SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of the early SV40 polypeptides synthesized by the 54/59 mutants has suggested a direct relationship between the abundance of an mRNA and the amount of the corresponding polypeptide. These results suggest that the synthesis of the early SV40 proteins is regulated primarily by the synthesis and processing of a particular mRNA, rather than by translational or posttranslational controls."

https://openalex.org/W2045172845,"Diethyldithiocarbamate reacted with superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes. Changes in both optical and esr spectra, which accompanied this reaction, indicated involvement of the Cu(II). The reaction was accelerated by raising the concentrations of the reactants, elevating the temperature, and lowering the pH, in the range 10.2 to 5.5, and it was independent of the presence of oxygen. During the first phase of this reaction the Cu(II).diethyldithiocarbamate complex remained bound to the enzyme and the catalytic activity did not diminish. There followed a second and slower process which was accompanied by the appearance of colloidal Cu(II).chelate complex and by a loss of activity which could be restored by the addition of CuSO4. All of the observations are accomodated by a model in which 1 diethyldithiocarbamate molecule reacts/copper center, with retention of activity, in Phase I, while a second diethyldithiocarbamate displaces the copper, with a loss of activity, in Phase II."
https://openalex.org/W1526884462,"Binary and ternary complexes of bovine adrenocortical mitochondrial cytochrome P-450scc with adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase.adrenodoxin complex are formed in the presence of cholesterol and Emulgen 913. Both cholesterol and Emulgen 913 are required for the binding of cytochrome P-450scc with adrenodoxin. Since phospholipids are able to replace Emulgen 913 in this reaction, in vivo phospholipids of the mitochondrial inner membrane appear to play the function of the detergent. The dissociation constants of the cytochrome.adrenodoxin complex are 0.3 to 0.4 microM at 130 microM dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and 0.9 microM at 120 microM Emulgen 913, whereas the dissociation constant for the ternary complex of cytochrome P-450scc with adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin is 4.0 microM at 150 microM Emulgen 913. The stoichiometry of binary and ternary complexes reveals the 1:1 and 1:1:1 molar ratios, respectively, judging from chemical analyses after the fractionation of the complexes by gel filtration. Emulgen 913, Tween 20, ethylene glycol, myristoyllysophosphatidylcholine, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine show the enhanced activity of cholesterol side chain cleavage reaction with cytochrome P-450scc, adrenodoxin, adrenodoxin reductase, and NADPH. These results, in conjunction with earlier experiments, lead us to the proposal on the structure of the hydroxylase complex in the membrane and to the hypothesis on the regulation of the enzymatic activity by the availability of substrate cholesterol to the cytochrome. Hence, we propose a mobile P-450scc hypothesis for the response of the mitochondrion to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1575960438,"We have observed the nuclear modulation pattern in the envelope of electron spin echoes for various low spin paramagnetic heme proteins including cytochrome c, myoglobin hydroxide, myoglobin mercaptoethanol, and cytochrome P-450, using the three-pulse-stimulated echo method. We have also carried out similar experiments with model compounds containing either [14N]- or [15N]imidazole. In many of the compounds studied, we have been able to identify the nuclear modulation effects arising from 14N of the porphyrin ring and have been able to characterize and interpret the modulation effects due to 14N of various nitrogenous axial ligands. We have found that the heme of low spin ferric cytochrome P-450 is coordinated to a nitrogenous ligand, probably imidazole. We have also demonstrated that the remote 14N of the imidazole ligand in a [14N]imidazole-heme-NO-model compound is coupled differently than in myoglobin nitroxide, demonstrating the direct effect of the protein of metal ligand bonding."
https://openalex.org/W4425937,"Using ability to stimulate tubulin assembly as an assay, we have purified a chicken brain associated protein under conditions identical to those used to isolate porcine brain 7 protein. Chicken brain T has a molecular weight, sedimentation coefficient, and amino acid composition very similar to porcine r. Both r proteins are microheterogeneous and yield very similar and characteristic one-dimensional peptide maps. We have also isolated 7 and a high molecular weight protein from simian virus 40-transformed 3T3 cells by copolymerization of labeled cellular proteins with carrier hog brain microtubules. The simian virus 3T3 cell proteins co-electrophorese with the corresponding hog brain associated proteins and yield peptide maps which are indistinguishable from the hog protein patterns. These findings confirm the presence of 7 and a high molecular weight microtubule associated protein from a nonneuronal source and demonstrate that both are present in a single cell type, as originally suggested by immunofluorescent localization with antibodies against the hog brain proteins. Moreover, the similarities of the T polypeptides from the three sources studied (hog brain, chicken brain, and mouse fibroblast) imply that T is a widely distributed and conserved microtubule protein. The similarities between the high molecular weight associated proteins from hog brain and mouse fibroblast suggest that they, too, are widely distributed."

https://openalex.org/W180833288,"Homogeneous gene 5 protein of bacteriophage T7, a subunit of T7 DNA polymerase, catalyzes the stepwise hydrolysis of single-stranded DNA in a 3' leads to 5' direction to yield nucleoside 5'-monophosphates. The gene 5 protein itself does not hydrolyze duplex DNA. However, in the presence of Escherichia coli thioredoxin, the host-specified subunit of T7 DNA polymerase, duplex DNA is hydrolyzed in a 3' leads to 5' direction to yield nucleoside 5'-monophosphates. The apparent Km for thioredoxin in the reaction is 4.8 x 10(-8) M, a value similar to that for the apparent Km of thioredoxin in the complementation assay with gene 5 protein to restore T7 DNA polymerase activity. Both exonuclease activities require Mg2+ and a sulfhydryl reagent for optimal activity, and both activities are sensitive to salt concentration. Deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates inhibit hydrolysis by both exonuclease activities; hydrolysis of single-stranded DNA by the gene 5 protein is inhibited even in the absence of thioredoxin where there is less than 2% active T7 DNA polymerase. E. coli DNA binding protein (helix destabilizing protein) stimulates the hydrolysis of duplex DNA up to 9-fold under conditions where the hydrolysis of the single-stranded DNA is inhibited 4-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1521846926,"Abstract In this study we have investigated the effects of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipolysis on the removal of radiolabeled apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein C-III-1 from in vitro lipolyzed lipoproteins. Lipolysis was carried out in vitro using lipoprotein lipase purified from bovine milk, and mixtures with or without plasma. Lipoproteins were isolated by ultracentrifugation and by gel filtration. Labeled apo-C-II and apo-C-III-1 distributed among plasma lipoproteins, predominantly VLDL and high density lipoprotein (HDL). Lipolysis induced transfer of apo-C-II and apo-C-III-1 from VLDL to HDL. The transfer was proportional to the extent of triglyceride hydrolysis, and similar for the two apoproteins. The apo-C-II/apo-C-III-1 radioactivity ratio did not change in either VLDL or the fraction of d greater than 1.006 g/ml during the progression of the lipolytic process. Similar observations were recorded while using plasma-devoid lipolytic systems. Gel filtration of incubation mixtures, on 6% agarose, revealed that the removal of labeled apo-C molecules from VLDL is not a consequence of either centrifugation or high salt concentration. These results suggest that there is no preferential removal of apo-C-II or apo-C-III-1 from lipolyzed VLDL particles. They further indicate that the ratio of apo-C-II to apo-C-III-1 does not regulate the extent of lipolysis of different VLDL particles, at least in VLDL isolated from normolipidemic humans."

The rate of binding was temperaturedependent and the extent proportional to the concentration of both ‘“51-hormone and cell fraction protein. The rates of dissociation of ‘251-hGH were similar in Golgi and PM, being temperature-dependent and unaffected by the presence of unlabeled hGH. At 4”C, degradation of lz51-hGH over a 24-h incubation was <lo% in PM, but was greater in the Golgi intermediate fraction. lz51-hGH eluted from cell fractions was intact as judged by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and rebinding to female rat liver microsomes. Preincubation at 30°C caused a steady loss of binding activity in all fractions. At 4”C, the loss was minimal in Golgi, but reached 35% in PM by 24 h. Binding to all fractions was optimum at pH 6.5 to 7.5 The binding of “‘1-hGH and lz51-ovine prolactin was inhibited in all fractions by lactogens in proportion to their biopotency, and not to any significant extent by animal somatotropins. Scatchard analyses in Golgi intermediate (Gi) and heavy (Gh) fractions, and in PM were linear. The apparent affinities (X 10’ M-‘, kS.E., N = 3) were Gi, 5.8 f 1.0; Gh, 4.4 k 0.6; and PM, 2.4 + 0.4. The concentration (fmol/mg of protein) of sites in these cell fractions was: Gi, 10,144 f 2733; Gh, 6,644 f 647; and PM, 2,501 + 217. Hypophysectomy of female rats resulted in a loss of lactogen receptors in all Golgi fractions and PM. Male rats had low to virtually absent receptor levels in Golgi and PM. Estrogen treatment caused a rapid increase in receptor level in the Golgi vesicle fraction but not in PM until 3 days post-treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2143923784,"methodological developments that have opened a new approach to the analysis of chromosomes: site-specific cleavage of DNA by restriction endonucleases and electrophoretic fractionation of the resulting fragments; recombination, cloning, and amplification of DNA segments from any source; rapid methods for determining the nucleotide sequence of DNA; site-directed in vitro mutagenesis; synthesis of polydeoxynucl eotides of predetermined sequence; and the ability to introduce cloned, functioning genes into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. As a result of these developments even chromosomes which are largely inaccessible to classical genetic methods can now be analysed piece by piece in chemical detail. Genes and signals can be altered at pre-selected sites, and the functional effect of such alterations determined. And active, synthetic genes can be constructed in vitro by recombination or by chemical synthesis. Many investigators have contributed to the “new genetics”. Contributions from my own laboratory resulted from our studies of a model eukaryotic chromosome, that of a small mammalian tumor virus. I became interested in tumor viruses in the mid 1960’s when I was asked to give a lecture on this subject to Johns Hopkins medical students. Although I had been working with an RNA coliphage (a bacterial virus) for some years, I knew very little about animal viruses. As I reviewed the tumor virus literature, I was impressed by the fact that simple viruses had a profound and permanent effect on the growth of cells in culture or in a living animal. Here was a microcosm of regulatory mechanisms related to the development of the virus itself and to the growth of animal cells, including neoplastic cells. At least some of these mechanisms appeared approachable with the tools of molecular genetics that had been so successfully used with bacterial viruses. Of course all of this was appreciated by a number of"

The ionic strength was varied between 0.002 and 0.02 M. Data were analyzed according to four different functions of ionic strength. Results showed that the Kirkwood-Tanford smeared charge model holds well for the calculation of the activity coefficients and that the whole charges of these proteins are reflected in the rates of their reactions. Chemical modifications or changes in the pH that altered the charge of the proteins affected the primary salt effects as predicted by the smeared charge model."

The cell extracts were purified by carboxymethyl-cellulose chromatography (CMC) and the fraction eluting with ovine adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was further purified either by another CMC under the same conditions or by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Microsequencing of the product from the second CMC allowed the identification of a peptide containing methionine 4 and phenylalanine 7, as expected for the NH2 terminus of ACTH. Purification by HPLC of a similar peptide obtained from the three other incubations gave three main raoactive peaks which were further characterized by their migration rates on polyacrylamide gels, molecular weight, and microsequencing. Results indicated that intact ACTH (residues 1-39) is present in extracts of rat intermediate lobe, but in very small quantities (less than 1% of the beta-endorphin content). ACTH is probably broken down into smaller fragments, e.g. alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) (ACTH, 1-13) and corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide (CLIP) (ACTH, 18-39). These studies also revealed with existence of a peptide having identical sequence with the (N-1) terminus of the ACTH/lipotropin (LPH) precursor."

https://openalex.org/W1590412238,"Synaptic membrane fractions from rat brain contain two types of membrane-bound cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The two types of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase differ in their affinities for cyclic AMP and even more markedly in their affinities for cyclic IMP, as determined by binding studies. The affinities of the regulatory subunits of the two protein kinases for cyclic AMP and cyclic IMP were compared with the apparent activation constants of cyclic AMP and cyclic IMP for the endogenous phosphorylation of several substrate proteins, including Proteins Ia and Ib and Proteins IIa and IIb. !I’his comparison provided evidence which suggests that the membrane-bound type II, (and not the type I,) cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is the enzyme which phosphorylates these proteins in synaptic membrane fractions. Other experiments, performed with kainic acid, a glutamic acid analog which specifically destroys neuronal cells, were designed to determine the localization of the type I, and type II, protein kinases, in relation to the cellular localization of the endogenous substrate proteins. In these experiments, a reduction of the neuronal population of rat striatum resulted in a large depletion of the type II, protein kinase, and of Proteins Ia and Ib, and Proteins IIa and IIb, but not of the type I,,, protein kinase. This association of the type II, protein kinase with the synaptic membrane proteins whose phosphorylation is stimulated by cyclic AMP is consistent with the suggestion that the endogenous phosphorylation of these membrane proteins is dependent on the type II, protein kinase. Major endogenous substrate proteins for the type I,,, protein kinase were not observed."

Double-stranded DNA is not a cofactor. The products of hydrolysis are ADP and Pi. The enzyme also catalyzed strand separation of duplex DNA in the presence of ATP and E. coli DNA binding protein.

https://openalex.org/W1542242707,Experiments using a phosphodiesterase-minus mutant of Dictyostelium discoideum indicate that ligand-induced loss of cell surface cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate binding sites (down regulation) can be evoked with concentrations of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate as low as 10(-8) M. The loss of receptor sites is observed after 5 min of cell preincubation with cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and can be as extensive as 75 to 80%. This decrease in binding sites is correlated with the appearance of a slowly dissociating cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate binding component. Radioactive cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate bound to this form of receptor cannot be competed for by nonradioactive cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate or adenosine 5'-monophosphate and is not accessible to hydrolysis by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase. The extent of appearance of this binding component is dependent upon the concentration of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate used to elicit the down regulation response and the temperature of the incubation medium.

https://openalex.org/W1524266184,"The purification from cultured human fibroblasts of a protein that binds specifically to partially depurinated DNA and inserts purines into those sites is described. The purine insertion, but not the binding, requires K+. The DNA binding can be saturated with increasing apurinic sites and is weakened by the presence of adenine or guanine. Base insertion into depurinated DNA is specific for adenine or guanine; none is observed with dATP or dGTP. When the depurinated DNA substrate is specifically cleaved with apurinic endonuclease, no purine insertion occurs. Guanine insertion does not occur into tRNA or depyrimidinated DNA, and thymine is not inserted into either depyrimidinated DNA or depurinated DNA. Purine insertion activity follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to purintes; the apparent Km values for both adenine and guanine are 5 microM. The enzyme binds the purine bases very tightly. Adenine binding saturates at less than 1 microM adenine, perhaps reflecting the low intracellular adenine concentration. The binding protein specific for UV-irradiated DNA (Feldberg, R.S., and Grossman, L.

https://openalex.org/W1499874360,The action of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) on the specific (receptor-mediated) uptake of cholesteryl linoleate . low density lipoprotein complexes was examined in Y-1 mouse adrenal tumor cells. High affinity binding (KA 4.1 X 10(8) M) was observed with ACTH; lower affinity was seen in the absence of ACTH. The effect of ACTH was observed within 10 min at physiological concentrations of low density lipoprotein (100 microgram/ml). Binding was followed by uptake (internalization) of the ester . lipoprotein complex which was transported to lysosomes. The site of action of ACTH was localized to the uptake process (internalization) since no effect of ACTH was observed on binding to the cell membrane nor on movement of internalized complex to lysosomes. ACTH increases the transport of cholesterol derived from cholesterol ester to the mitochondria. This cholesterol is converted to 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one and this conversion is accelerated by ACTH. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (but not butyrate) also stimulates uptake of cholesteryl linoleate . low density lipoprotein. The process stimulated by ACTH and dibutyryl cyclic AMP is specific for low density (as opposed to high density) lipoprotein and for ACTH as distinct from other peptide hormones. The possible physiological importance of this response is considered.
https://openalex.org/W1482868784,"A new system for studying the molecular mechanisms of mutation by carcinogens is described. The system involves (a) site-specific modification of the essential gene G in phi X174 replicative form DNA by a combination of chemical and enzymatic steps; (b) production of mutant virus carrying a change at a single preselected site by transfection of spheroplasts with the site modified phi X174 DNA; (c) detection and propagation of mutants using a host carrying the plasmid, p phi XG, that rescues all type of gene G mutants by complementation; (d) identification of the mutation in the progeny virus by isolating and sequencing mutant phi X174 DNA in the region that carried the parental, site-specific change. To demonstrate that this system is operational, we have produced a previously unknown phi X174 gene G mutant carrying a C leads to T base change at position 2401 of the viral (plus) strand. This preplanned, nonsense (amber) mutant was obtained by changing G to A at the appropriate position in a chemically synthesized, octadeoxynucleotide, minus strand primer; elongating this enzymatically with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (larger fragment) (lacking 5‘ leads to 3‘ exonuclease activity) to a 17-mer; and repriming to obtain the site-modified phi X174 replicative form DNA enzymatically with E. coli DNA polymerase I (large fragment) and T4 DNA ligase. After transfection of spheroplasts with the heteroduplex DNA, the lysate was screened for mutant virus with permissive (carrying p phi XG) and nonpermissive (without p phi XG) host cells. About 1% of the progeny virus were mutants. Out of 15 isolates, 11 were suppressible by an amber Su1+ (serine) or an ochre Su8+ (glutamine) suppressor. The other 4 isolates were not suppressed at all. Replicative form DNA produced from one of the suppressible mutants was shown (by sequencing) to contain the expected C leads to T change at the preselected site in the viral strand. Replicative form DNA from one of the nonsuppressible mutants was partially sequenced. No change was found at or around position 2401. The nature of the mutation(s) in these isolates is still unknown. The occurrence of mutations outside the preselected sites represent a potential problem for our projected studies, but additional data is required before the problem can be fully evaluated. In spite of this, it should be possible to study, in vivo, the biological effects of any site-specific modification (including covalent modifications by carcinogens) that can be introduced into gene G of phi X174 DNA via a synthetic, oligonucleotide primer."

Since the spectroscopic techniques measure nucleotide utilization they can be used in conjunction with measurements of incorporation of radiolabeled precursor such as [3H]UTP into acid-insoluble material to determine whether significant amounts of acid-soluble oligonucleotides are formed.
https://openalex.org/W1977722585,"Abstract The replication pattern of the endogenous baboon type C virus M7 was studied in 29 primary Chinese hamster × human hybrid clones generated with leukemic cells from two different patients with acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemia. There was no evidence of viral particulate RDDP or M7 antigen before viral infection. M7 virus replicated in human and some hybrid cells but not in Chinese hamster cells, indicating that M7 requires dominantly expressed human gene(s) for replication. Enzyme and cytogenetic analyses show that a gene(s) coded for by human chromosome 19 is necessary for M7 infection of these hybrids. Detailed cytogenetic correlations revealed, however, that the chromosome 19+/M7 + hybrid clones with intact chromosomes also had copies of chromosomes 3 and 6. Previously, Bevi , the putative integration site for M7 virus, has been assigned to human chromosome 6. Many clones with various combinations of chromosomes 3 and 6 lacked chromosome 19, however, and failed to replicate exogenously applied M7 virus, while tests of 27 secondary clones showed that M7 markers co-segregated with chromosome 19 markers. These findings all confirm the need for a chromosome 19-coded function in Chinese hamster × human hybrids. In addition, the yield of viral particulate RDDP produced into the culture fluid was 50–100 fold less per viral antigen-positive cell in the hybrids compared with human cells. Thus some form of regulation of viral components exists in the hybrid cells. When the virus replicating in hybrid cells was transferred back to human cells, this regulation was relaxed and the yield of RDDP per FA(+) cell greatly increased. We conclude that human chromosomes 6 and 19 code for functions involved in M7 virus metabolism, and we cannot exclude a function coded for by chromosome 3."
https://openalex.org/W297287601,"We have investigated the regulation of fibronectin and procollagen synthesis in normal and Rous sarcoma virus transformed primary avian tendon cells. These two proteins interact at the cell periphery and both are reportedly lost upon transformation. We thus examined whether their synthesis was coordinately regulated in Rous sarcoma virus-infected cells. It was found that while the synthesis of both pro alpha 1 and pro alpha 2 peptides was reduced upon transformation, the synthesis of fibronectin was not altered. Nevertheless, long term radiolabeling demonstrated that fibronectin levels were reduced in transformed cells. It is concluded that the reduction in levels of these components at the surface is brought about by different mechanisms; collagen levels being regulated by procollagen synthesis and fibronectin levels by degradation and/or release into the culture medium. The possibility is discussed that fibronectin is lost from the cell periphery of primary avian tendon cells as a consequence of decreased levels of anchoring collagen molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1588264605,"The spin label nitroxide derivative 3-(2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-1-oxyl)-propen-2-oic acid has been synthesized and characterized by chemical methods. It is a useful intermediate in the preparation of a new class of chromophoric spin label substrates for enzyme studies, as shown by the synthesis of O-3-(2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-1-oxyl)-propen-2-oyl-L-beta-phenyllactic acid, a specific ester substrate of bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase A (peptidyl-L-amino acid hydrolase; EC 3.4.12.2). Kinetic parameters of the esterolytic reaction are conveniently determined by UV spectrophotometric methods, and a reaction intermediate can be stabilized in fluid cryosolvent mixtures at subzero temperatures. Results are presented of preliminary electron spin resonance studies to demonstrate that structural relationships of the spin label substrate in a catalytically active configuration to active site residues can be determined for this low temperature-stabilized reaction intermediate. This substrate thus demonstrates the utility of this new class of spin label derivatives for characterization of enzyme reaction intermediates stabilized by cryoenzymologic techniques."
