https://openalex.org/W2064644667,"A. V. HILL1 has shown that ordinary diffusion of a chemical substance is too slow to explain the rapidity with which the contraction in the interior of a striated muscle fibre is set off by the action potential, which is a change in the potential difference across the surface membrane; some more rapid link must therefore exist. Krause's membrane (Z line, telophragma) is a possible anatomical basis for such a link2, since it extends continuously across the fibre and is attached to the interior of the sarcolemma3,4."

https://openalex.org/W2063394352,"BOTH heparin1 and histamine2 are now known to be concentrated in the tissue mast cells, and it might thus be expected that the release of histamine caused by damage to the mast cells would be accompanied by the release of heparin and a consequent increase in the clotting,time of blood. So far this dual effect has been observed in only one species, the dog, in which an intravenous injection of peptone or of a chemical histamine liberator such as compound 48/80 can release sufficient heparin to render the blood incoagulable. In the rat, however, although compound 48/80 releases histamine from the numerous mast cells in the subcutaneous connective tissue, the clotting time of the rat's blood remains unchanged. We have therefore attempted to discover what happens to the heparin in the rat following a maximal release of histamine by compound 48/80."

In the light of this conclusion, the finding that it inactivates guinea pig complement (C′) is felt worthy of this brief communication. (In a personal communication, Dr. Laurence Levine reported that he has independently observed this same finding.)"

https://openalex.org/W1985425750,"IN 1954, Lux1 investigated the possibility that potent inhibitors of Eimeria tenella might be found among compounds, other than sulphonamides, which interfered with the p-aminobenzoic acid–folic acid metabolic sequence. Lux found that a group of 2,4-diamino-pyrimidines possessed anticoccidial activity, one of the most active of the series being 2,4-diamino-5, p-chlorophenyl, 6-ethyl pyrimidine (‘Pyrimethamine’, ‘Daraprim’). He noted, furthermore, that this compound, when used in combination with certain sulphonamides, had a marked synergistic effect."

The volumes employed were 10–14 litres of medium, and the vessels were of glass, with stirrers made of either ‘Birmabright’ (a magnesium–aluminium alloy) or aluminium."

https://openalex.org/W2050856083,"THE immuno-electrophoretic method1 allows the definition of the constituents of a mixture of antigenic substances by means of their relative electrophoretic mobilities, and their enumeration, by specific precipitation, by means of a homologous immune serum. The study of normal human serum by this method has allowed the enumeration of at least sixteen different constituents2."

https://openalex.org/W1977582182,"DR. G. T. ASHLEY'S communication1 prompts me to record a further example of supra-sternal ossicles in primates, this time in Perodicticus potto. The specimen, which was the prepared skeleton of a young animal, showed a supra-sternal ossicle on the right side only, contributing to the articular surface for the clavicle (Fig. 1). The ossicle on the left side was presumably lost during preparation. From a comparison with the adult sternum, it would appear, that in Perodicticus the supra-sternal ossicles are responsible for the prominent antero-lateral angles of the manubrium sterni and thus for the deep supra-sternal notch. It is possible that they are a regular feature in the development of the sternum in this animal. It must not be forgotten, however, that the supra-sternal notch in man is considerably shallower in the newborn than in the adult, though supra-sternal ossicles do not seem to be a constant feature here."

Rougvie3 oxidized feather keratin directly with peracetic acid and similarly found the soluble particles to have a molecular weight of 10,000. He also made the important observation that fibres reconstituted from the oxidized material gave X-ray diffraction patterns with much of the detail of those of the original feather."
