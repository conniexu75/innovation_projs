https://openalex.org/W1965310795,"THE cosmic noise background radiation observed at metre and decametre wavelengths is generally considered to result from several different spatial components. These include synchrotron radiation from cosmic ray electrons in the galactic disk, similar radiation from the galactic halo (although the relative importance of this component is a matter of considerable controversy), and an isotropic radiation component from the integrated emission of all unresolved extra-galactic radio sources. Results of recent analyses of metre-wave measurements1–3 place the brightness Ix of the isotropic component at about one-third the minimum total brightness observed at a frequency f of 100 MHz. The spectral index αx of the isotropic radiation is thought to be about equal to the average spectral index (∼0.8) observed for surveys of extra-galactic discrete sources4 at f ∼ 100 MHz where"

https://openalex.org/W2092703328,"ATMOSPHERIC attack on stone statuary has increased considerably during the past few decades because of the presence of increasing amounts of gaseous pollutants such as SO2 and CO2 (ref. 1). There are two types of technique2 for the preservation of stone: those which provide, by means of impregnation, both a protective coating and a cement between dislodged grains; and those which change the chemistry of the stone so that the resultant substance is more resistant to attack."

https://openalex.org/W1965740127,"THIRRING'S solution for a rotating mass shell is frequently used to illustrate the appearance of centrifugal and Coriolis force in general relativity. In the equations of motion of test particles within the shell, terms appear which are of second order in the shell angular velocity, ω. These terms are conventionally identified with “centrifugal force”, yet they do bear the relationship to “Coriolis force” that one would expect from Mach's principle. The resolution of this paradox has an important bearing on the foundations of general relativity because, to resolve it, some authors have taken the extreme position that either general relativity or Mach's principle must be abandoned. In this communication we resolve the paradox without abandoning either."

https://openalex.org/W1995855585,"JACKSON has proposed that the cosmological constant is negative, and so large as to stabilize the clusters of galaxies without “hidden mass”1. But if we explain the stability of clusters of galaxies in this way, the entire universe must implode during the time taken for one galaxy to cross a cluster once; this conclusion is independent of the Hubble constant, and the motions in the clusters would arise mainly from the Hubble expansion itself, since there is no time over which to define a steady state."
