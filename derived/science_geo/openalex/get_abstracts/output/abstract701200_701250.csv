https://openalex.org/W4293746450,"The continual evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the emergence of variants that show resistance to vaccines and neutralizing antibodies threaten to prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. Selection and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants are driven in part by mutations within the viral spike protein and in particular the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), a primary target site for neutralizing antibodies. Here, we develop deep mutational learning (DML), a machine-learning-guided protein engineering technology, which is used to investigate a massive sequence space of combinatorial mutations, representing billions of RBD variants, by accurately predicting their impact on ACE2 binding and antibody escape. A highly diverse landscape of possible SARS-CoV-2 variants is identified that could emerge from a multitude of evolutionary trajectories. DML may be used for predictive profiling on current and prospective variants, including highly mutated variants such as Omicron, thus guiding the development of therapeutic antibody treatments and vaccines for COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4296807426,"We report herein, the design and synthesis of thiazolidine-2,4-diones derivatives as new inhibitors for VEGFR-2. The designed members were assessed for their in vitro anticancer activity against four cancer cell lines; A549, Caco-2, HepG-2 and MDA-MB-231. Compound 14a showed the most potent effects against Caco-2, and HepG-2 cell lines (IC50 = of 1.5 and 31.5 μM, respectively). Next, the in vitro VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity, safety profiles and selectivity indices were examined for all the synthesized members against the normal Vero cell line. Compound 14a (the safest member against Caco-2 cell line) was further investigated for its ability to inhibit Caco-2 cells migration and healing. Moreover, the apoptotic induction of compound 14a against Caco-2 cell line was investigated by assessing against four apoptotic genes (Bcl2, Bcl-xl, TGF, and Survivin). The results revealed that compound 14a can exert apoptosis through significant reduction of Bcl2, Survivin, and TGF gene expression levels. Finally, deep computational studies including molecular docking, ADMET, toxicity studies, and MD simulation were carried out. Also, the DFT calculations were performed and discussed, and the results confirmed the inhibitory reactivity of 14a against VEGFR-2. Compound 14a is expected to be used as a potential lead in the development of new VEGFR-2 inhibitors with increased potency."
https://openalex.org/W4296808015,"Fungi of the genus Trichoderma have been marketed for the management of diseases of crops. However, some Trichoderma species may produce toxic secondary metabolites and it should receive due attention to ensure human safety. In this study, we investigated the in vitro antagonistic potential of T. asperellum AU131 and T. longibrachiatum AU158 as microbial biocontrol agents (MBCAs) against Fusarium xylarioides and the associated antagonistic mechanism with bioactive substances. Swiss albino mice were used to evaluate the in vivo toxicity and pathogenicity of T. asperellum AU131 and T. longibrachiatum AU158 methanolic extracts and spore suspensions, respectively, in a preliminary safety assessment for use as biofungicides. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to profile volatile organic metabolites (VOCs) present in the methanolic extracts. The agar diffusion assay of the methanolic extracts from both T. asperellum AU131 and T. longibrachiatum AU158 were effective at a concentration of 200 μg/mL (1×107 spores/mL), causing 62.5%, and 74.3% inhibition, respectively. A GC-MS analysis of methanolic extracts from both bioagents identified 23 VOCs which classified as alcohols, acids, sesquiterpenes, ketones and aromatic compounds. The oral administration of methanolic extracts and spore suspensions of each Trichoderma species to female Swiss albino mice over 14 days did not show any significant signs of toxicity, mortality or changes to body weight. It can be concluded that the tested spore suspensions and methanolic extracts were not pathogenic or toxic, respectively, when administered to Swiss albino mice at various doses."

https://openalex.org/W4296800142,"Despite growing interest in edible seaweeds, there is limited information on seaweed chemical contaminant levels in the Salish Sea. Without this knowledge, health-based consumption advisories can not be determined for consumers that include Tribes and First Nations, Asian and Pacific Islander community members, and recreational harvesters. We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (i.e. 40 PCBs, 15 PBDEs, 17 PCDD/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 PAHs were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the USEPA and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo[a]pyrene [BaP], and PCBs) or are of regional interest (total As). USEPA cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the PCBs and two samples for BaP. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the USEPA noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be considered. Additionally, although we focused on toxicological aspects, there are cultural and health benefits of seaweed use that may affect consumer choice."
https://openalex.org/W4296803618,"The recent development of core-shell nanoparticles which combine strain coupled magnetostrictive and piezoelectric phases, has attracted a lot of attention due to their ability to yield strong magnetoelectric effect even at room temperature, thus making them a promising tool to enable biomedical applications. To fully exploit their potentialities and to adapt their use to in vivo applications, this study analyzes, through a numerical approach, their magnetoelectric behavior, shortly quantified by the magnetoelectric coupling coefficient (α ME ), thus providing an important milestone for the characterization of the magnetoelectric effect at the nanoscale. In view of recent evidence showing that α ME is strongly affected by both the applied magnetic field DC bias and AC frequency, this study implements a nonlinear model, based on magnetic hysteresis, to describe the responses of two different core-shell nanoparticles to various magnetic field excitation stimuli. The proposed model is also used to evaluate to which extent realistic variables such as core diameter and shell thickness affect the electric output. Results prove that α ME of 80 nm cobalt ferrite-barium titanate (CFO-BTO) nanoparticles with a 60:40 ratio is equal to about 0.28 V/cm∙Oe corresponding to electric fields up to about 1000 V/cm when a strong DC bias is applied. However, the same electric output can be obtained even in absence of DC field with very low AC fields, by exploiting the hysteretic characteristics of the same composites. The analysis of core and shell dimension is as such to indicate that, to maximize α ME, larger core diameter and thinner shell nanoparticles should be preferred. These results, taken together, suggest that it is possible to tune magnetoelectric nanoparticles electric responses by controlling their composition and their size, thus opening the opportunity to adapt their structure on the specific application to pursue."
https://openalex.org/W4296793607,"Purpose Immobilization of skeletal muscles causes muscle atrophy, muscle contracture, and muscle pain, the mechanisms of which are related to macrophage accumulation. However, muscle contractile exercise through a belt electrode device may mitigate macrophage accumulation. We hypothesized that such exercise would be effective in preventing myofiber atrophy, muscle contracture, and muscular pain. This study tested this hypothesis in immobilized rat gastrocnemius muscle. Materials and methods A total of 32 rats were divided into the following control and experimental groups: immobilization (immobilized treatment only), low-frequency (LF; immobilized treatment and muscle contractile exercise with a 2 s (do) /6 s (rest) duty cycle), and high-frequency (HF; immobilized treatment and muscle contractile exercise with a 2 s (do)/2 s (rest) duty cycle). Electrical stimulation was performed at 50 Hz and 4.7 mA, and muscle contractile exercise was applied to the lower limb muscles for 15 or 20 min/session (once daily) for 2 weeks (6 times/week). After the behavioral tests, the bilateral gastrocnemius muscles were collected for analysis. Results The number of macrophages, the Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 mRNA expression, and the hydroxyproline content in the HF group were lower than those in the immobilization and LF groups. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of type IIb myofibers in the superficial region, the PGC-1α mRNA expression, and the range of motion of dorsiflexion in the HF group were significantly higher than those in the immobilization and LF groups. The pressure pain thresholds in the LF and HF groups were significantly higher than that in the immobilization group, and the nerve growth factor (NGF) content in the LF and HF groups was significantly lower than that in the immobilization group. Conclusion Muscle contractile exercise through the belt electrode device may be effective in preventing immobilization-induced myofiber atrophy, muscle contracture, and muscular pain in the immobilized rat gastrocnemius muscle."
https://openalex.org/W4296793825,"Particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms are two classes of popular heuristic algorithms that are frequently used for solving complex multi-dimensional mathematical optimization problems, each one with its one advantages and shortcomings. Particle swarm optimization is known to favor exploitation over exploration, and as a result it often converges rapidly to local optima other than the global optimum. The genetic algorithm has the ability to overcome local extrema throughout the optimization process, but it often suffers from slow convergence rates. This paper proposes a new hybrid algorithm that nests particle swarm optimization operations in the genetic algorithm, providing the general population with the exploitation prowess of the genetic algorithm and a sub-population with the high exploitation capabilities of particle swarm optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through solutions of several continuous optimization problems, as well as discrete (traveling salesman) problems. It is found that the new hybrid algorithm provides a better balance between exploration and exploitation compared to both parent algorithms, as well as existing hybrid algorithms, achieving consistently accurate results with relatively small computational cost."
https://openalex.org/W4296794489,"With the rapid development of electric vehicle (EV) technology under the background of double carbon, a reasonable evaluation of the network planning of EV charging stations is conducive to the long-term stable development of the EV industry. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation system and method for EV charging networks under the traffic network and power grid coupling. First, an EV travel model is developed based on the travel probability matrix to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of EVs. Secondly, the coupling relationship among users, charging network, road network, and the power grid is analyzed, four criteria of user feedback, charging network operation, road network operation impact, and power grid operation impact are proposed, and corresponding evaluation indexes are constructed under each criterion to form a comprehensive evaluation index system. Furthermore, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and entropy weighting method are used to assign weights to the index layer and the criterion layer respectively, and the improved TOPSIS evaluation method is used to quantitatively analyze the impact of charging networks on different subjects for comprehensive evaluation. Finally, through the comprehensive evaluation of different charging network planning schemes, the effectiveness of the comprehensive evaluation method and model proposed in this paper is verified, which can provide a reference basis for the planning and improvement of EV charging station networks."
https://openalex.org/W4296794857,"The objective of this work is to examine disparities in the completion of substance use disorder treatment in the U.S. Our data is from the Treatment Episode Dataset Discharge (TEDS-D) datasets from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for 2017-2019. We apply a two-stage virtual twins model (random forest + decision tree) where, in the first stage (random forest), we determine differences in treatment completion probability associated with race/ethnicity, income source, no co-occurrence of mental health disorders, gender (biological), no health insurance, veteran status, age, and primary substance (alcohol or opioid). In the second stage (decision tree), we identify subgroups associated with probability differences, where such subgroups are more or less likely to complete treatment. We find the subgroups most likely to complete substance use disorder treatment, when the subgroup represents more than 1% of the sample, are those with no mental health condition co-occurrence (4.8% more likely when discharged from an ambulatory outpatient treatment program, representing 62% of the sample; and 10% more likely for one of the more specifically defined subgroups representing 10% of the sample), an income source of job-related wages/salary (4.3% more likely when not having used in the 30 days primary to discharge and when primary substance is not alcohol only, representing 28% of the sample), and white non-Hispanics (2.7% more likely when discharged from residential long-term treatment, representing 9% of the sample). Important implications are that: 1) those without a co-occurring mental health condition are the most likely to complete treatment, 2) those with job related wages or income are more likely to complete treatment, and 3) racial/ethnicity disparities persist in favor of white non-Hispanic individuals seeking to complete treatment. Thus, additional resources may be needed to combat such disparities."
https://openalex.org/W4296797893,"The endothelium maintains and regulates vascular homeostasis mainly by balancing interplay between vasorelaxation and vasoconstriction via regulating Nitric Oxide (NO) availability. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is one of three NOS isoforms that catalyses the synthesis of NO to regulate endothelial function. However, eNOS’s role in the regulation of endothelial function, such as cell proliferation and migration remain unclear. To gain a better understanding, we genetically knocked down eNOS in cultured endothelial cells using sieNOS and evaluated cell proliferation, migration and also tube forming potential in vitro . To our surprise, loss of eNOS significantly induced endothelial cell proliferation, which was associated with significant downregulation of both cell cycle inhibitor p21 and cell proliferation antigen Ki-67. Knockdown of eNOS induced cell migration but inhibited formation of tube-like structures in vitro . Mechanistically, loss of eNOS was associated with activation of MAPK/ERK and inhibition of PI3-K/AKT signaling pathway. On the contrary, pharmacologic inhibition of eNOS by inhibitors L-NAME or L-NMMA, inhibited cell proliferation. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of eNOS, both promoted endothelial cell migration but inhibited tube-forming potential. Our findings confirm that eNOS regulate endothelial function by inversely controlling endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and by directly regulating its tube-forming potential. Differential results obtained following pharmacologic versus genetic inhibition of eNOS indicates a more complex mechanism behind eNOS regulation and activity in endothelial cells, warranting further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4296809786,"Background A number of circulating micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) have been introduced as convincing predictive determinants in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to evaluate some miRNAs’ diagnostic and prognostic value in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). Method Forty-four AHF patients were randomly selected from a tertiary heart center, and 44 healthy participants were included in the control group. Plasma levels of assessed miRNAs, including miR -1, -21, -23, and -423-5-p were measured in both groups. The patients were followed for one year, and several clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, one-year mortality, and the number of readmissions, were recorded. Results An overall 88 plasma samples were evaluated. There was no significant difference in terms of demographic characteristics between the AHF and healthy groups. Our findings revealed that mean levels of miR-1, -21, -23, and -423-5-p in AHF patients were significantly higher than in the control group. Although all assessed miRNAs demonstrated high diagnostic potential, the highest sensitivity (77.2%) and specificity (97.7%) is related to miR-1 for the values above 1.22 (p = 0.001, AUC = 0.841; 95%CI, 0.751 to 946). Besides, the levels of miR-21 and -23 were significantly lower in patients with ischemia-induced HF. However, the follow-up data demonstrated no significant association between miRNAs and prognostic outcomes including in-hospital mortality, one-year mortality, and the number of readmissions. Conclusion The result of our study demonstrated that miR-1, -21, -23, and -423-5-p can be taken into account as diagnostic aids for AHF. Nevertheless, there was no evidence supporting the efficacy of these miRNAs as prognostic factors in our study."
https://openalex.org/W4296810135,"Dyskinetic cerebral palsy (DCP) is characterised by involuntary movements, and the movement patterns of children with DCP have not been extensively studied during upper limb tasks. The aim of this study is to evaluate psychometric properties of upper limb kinematics in participants with DCP and typically developing (TD) participants. In current repeatability and validity study, forty individuals with typical development (n = 20) and DCP (n = 20) performed a reach forward/sideways and a reach and grasp task during motion analysis on two occasions. Joint angles at point of task achievement (PTA) and spatio-temporal parameters were evaluated within-and between-sessions using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Independent t-tests/Mann-Whitney-U tests were used to compare parameters between groups. Within-session ICC values ranged from 0.45 to 1.0 for all parameters for both groups. Within-session SEM values ranged from 1.1° to 11.7° for TD participants and from 1.9° to 13.0° for participants with DCP. Eight within-session repetitions resulted in the smallest change in ICC and SEM values for both groups. Within-session variability was higher for participants with DCP in comparison with the TD group for the majority of the joint angles and spatio-temporal parameters. Intrinsic variability over time was small for all angles and spatio-temporal parameters, whereas extrinsic variability was higher for elbow and scapula angles. Between-group differences revealed lower shoulder adduction and higher elbow flexion, pronation and wrist flexion, as well as higher trajectory deviation and a lower maximal velocity for participants with DCP. This is the first study to assess the psychometric properties of upper limb kinematics in children and adolescents with DCP, showing that children with DCP show higher variability during task execution, requiring a minimum of eight repetitions. However, their variable movement pattern can be reliably captured within-and between-sessions, confirming the potential of three-dimensional motion analysis for assessment of rehabilitation interventions in DCP."
https://openalex.org/W4296793855,"This work quantifies the impact of pre-, during- and post-lockdown periods of 2020 and 2019 imposed due to COVID-19, with regards to a set of satellite-based environmental parameters (greenness using Normalized Difference Vegetation and water indices, land surface temperature, night-time light, and energy consumption) in five alpha cities (Kuala Lumpur, Mexico, greater Mumbai, Sao Paulo, Toronto). We have inferenced our results with an extensive questionnaire-based survey of expert opinions about the environment-related UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Results showed considerable variation due to the lockdown on environment-related SDGs. The growth in the urban environmental variables during lockdown phase 2020 relative to a similar period in 2019 varied from 13.92% for Toronto to 13.76% for greater Mumbai to 21.55% for Kuala Lumpur; it dropped to −10.56% for Mexico and −1.23% for Sao Paulo city. The total lockdown was more effective in revitalizing the urban environment than partial lockdown. Our results also indicated that Greater Mumbai and Toronto, which were under a total lockdown, had observed positive influence on cumulative urban environment. While in other cities (Mexico City, Sao Paulo) where partial lockdown was implemented, cumulative lockdown effects were found to be in deficit for a similar period in 2019, mainly due to partial restrictions on transportation and shopping activities. The only exception was Kuala Lumpur which observed surplus growth while having partial lockdown because the restrictions were only partial during the festival of Ramadan. Cumulatively, COVID-19 lockdown has contributed significantly towards actions to reduce degradation of natural habitat (fulfilling SDG-15, target 15.5), increment in available water content in Sao Paulo urban area(SDG-6, target 6.6), reduction in NTL resulting in reducied per capita energy consumption (SDG–13, target 13.3)."
https://openalex.org/W4296793960,"Fibromyalgia-syndrome (FMS) is a complex disease characterized by chronic widespread pain and additional symptoms including depression, cognitive dysfunction (“fibro-fog”) and maldigestion. Our research team examined whether FMS-related pain parameters assessed by quantitative sensory testing (QST) and psychological disturbances are accompanied by alterations of the fecal microbiome. We recruited 25 patients with FMS and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Medical background, food habits, psychopathology and quality of life were assessed through questionnaires. Stool samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. QST was performed according to the protocol of the German Network for Neuropathic Pain. QST showed that both lemniscal and spinothalamic afferent pathways are altered in FMS patients relative to healthy controls and that peripheral as well as central pain sensitization processes are manifest. Psychometric assessment revealed enhanced scores of depression, anxiety and stress. In contrast, neither the composition nor the alpha- and beta-diversity of the fecal microbiome was changed in FMS patients. FMS patients segregate from healthy controls in various parameters of QST and psychopathology, but not in terms of composition and diversity of the fecal microbiome. Despite consideration of several confounding factors, we conclude that the contribution of the gut microbiome to the pathophysiology of FMS is limited."
https://openalex.org/W4296803948,"The life histories of organisms are expressed as rates of development, reproduction, and survival. However, individuals may experience differential outcomes for the same set of rates. Such individual stochasticity generates variance around familiar mean measures of life history traits, such as life expectancy and the reproductive number R0. By writing life cycles as Markov chains, we calculate variance and other indices of variability for longevity, lifetime reproductive output (LRO), age at offspring production, and age at maturity for 83 animal and 332 plant populations from the Comadre and Compadre matrix databases. We find that the magnitude within and variability between populations in variance indices in LRO, especially, are surprisingly high. We furthermore use principal components analysis to assess how the inclusion of variance indices of different demographic outcomes affects life history constraints. We find that these indices, to a similar or greater degree than the mean, explain the variation in life history strategies among plants and animals."
https://openalex.org/W4296804050,"With the advent of single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq), the field of cell phenotyping is now a data-driven exercise providing statistical evidence to support cell type/state categorization. However, the task of classifying cells into specific, well-defined categories with the empirical data provided by sc/snRNA-seq remains nontrivial due to the difficulty in determining specific differences between related cell types with close transcriptional similarities, resulting in challenges with matching cell types identified in separate experiments. To investigate possible approaches to overcome these obstacles, we explored the use of supervised machine learning methods—logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, neural networks, and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM)–as approaches to classify cell types using snRNA-seq datasets from human brain middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and human kidney. Classification accuracy was evaluated using an F-beta score weighted in favor of precision to account for technical artifacts of gene expression dropout. We examined the impact of hyperparameter optimization and feature selection methods on F-beta score performance. We found that the best performing model for granular cell type classification in both datasets is a multinomial logistic regression classifier and that an effective feature selection step was the most influential factor in optimizing the performance of the machine learning pipelines."
https://openalex.org/W4296805508,"Maternal anaemia is a global public health problem contributing to adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. In addition to other risk factors, interbirth interval has been identified as a potentially modifiable risk factor of maternal anaemia. However, the current evidence for the association between interbirth interval and maternal anaemia remains inconclusive. Hence, this study examined the association between the interbirth interval and maternal anaemia in sub-Saharan Africa.We conducted a multinational cross-sectional study of interbirth interval (time between two singleton live births) and maternal anaemia (haemoglobin levels < 12 g/dl for non-pregnant women, < 11 g/dl for pregnant women) for 21 sub-Saharan African countries using the most recent nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys, 2010-2017. A weighted multivariable fractional polynomial function was used to estimate the non-linear relationship between interbirth interval and maternal anaemia, considering interbirth interval as a continuous variable and adjusting for potential confounders. Analyses were stratified by reproductive classification (non-pregnant and pregnant women).There were 81,693 women included in the study (89.2% non-pregnant, 10.8% pregnant). Of all women, 32.2% were in their postpartum period. Overall, 36.9% of women had anaemia (36.0% of non-pregnant and 44.3% of pregnant women). Of the participants, 15% had a short interbirth interval (<24 months), and 16% had a long interbirth interval (≥ 60 months). We found that both short and longer interbirth intervals were associated with an increased risk of maternal anaemia in a dose-response fashion. Relatively a lower risk of maternal anaemia was observed between 24 and 40 months of interbirth intervals.Our findings suggest that both short and longer interbirth intervals were associated with an increased risk of maternal anaemia in sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4296806566,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is one of the best studied cellular uptake pathways and its contributions to nutrient uptake, receptor signaling, and maintenance of the lipid membrane homeostasis have been already elucidated. Today, we still have a lack of understanding how the different components of this pathway cooperate dynamically in vivo . Therefore, we generated a reporter mouse model for CME by fusing eGFP endogenously in frame to clathrin light chain a (Clta) to track endocytosis in living mice. The fusion protein is expressed in all tissues, but in a cell specific manner, and can be visualized using fluorescence microscopy. Recruitment to nanobeads recorded by TIRF microscopy validated the functionality of the Clta-eGFP reporter. With this reporter model we were able to track the dynamics of Alexa594-BSA uptake in kidneys of anesthetized mice using intravital 2-photon microscopy. This reporter mouse model is not only a suitable and powerful tool to track CME in vivo in genetic or disease mouse models it can also help to shed light into the differential roles of the two clathrin light chain isoforms in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4296807202,"Antecedent factors which influence adult engagement with nature are underexplored given the human health benefits strongly associated with nature exposure. Formative pathways and impediments to nature contact merit understanding as they may contribute to later-life health disparities. We probed experiential pathways and attitudes toward nature engagement among adults purposefully sampled across U.S. regions, age, race/ethnicity, and urbanicity through semi-structured focus group discussions. The research aims were to explore entryways and barriers to experiencing nature and learn how natured and built environments compete in influencing human-nature relationships. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed following Braun and Clarke's phases of thematic analysis. Qualitative content analysis of discussions identified three principal themes: 1) formative influences promoting adult nature engagement (i.e., persons/organizations and places of origin), 2) detractors from nature engagement (i.e., perceptual, material, and physical barriers), and 3) role of current setting (i.e., natural and built environments) shaping nature-seeking relationships. We found experiential factors that included early life exposures outdoors, personal mentorship, and organizational affiliation to be highly influential in socializing individuals to nature and in soldering attachment to nature which manifests into adulthood. In contrast, changing demographics and childhood, inequity, social dynamics, metropolitan growth, urban renewal explained alienation from nature. These findings emphasize the importance of efforts to expand opportunities for nature contact, especially for youth living in economically challenged urban areas, which go beyond increasing greenspace to encompass mentoring partnerships for gaining skills and comfort outdoors and redesign of safe natured spaces within cities for hands-on learning and discovery."
https://openalex.org/W4296808680,"Background The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has brought about severe negative livelihood consequences for rural households worldwide. However, the heterogeneity and dynamics of livelihood impacts have been under-researched. There is also lacking a livelihood assessment of the pandemic based on a whole pandemic cycle. This study aimed to investigate the dynamic and heterogeneous livelihood impacts of COVID-19 pandemic for rural households in 2020 based on a case study of Southeast China. Methods The pandemic in China had experienced a complete cycle from initial outbreak, to intermediate recovery and finally new normal stage in 2020. We conducted face-to-face interviews with 95 rural households randomly drawn from 2 rural villages in Xunwu County , Jiangxi Province , Southeast China. The sampled households are interviewed with a questionnaire through face-to-face surveys in February and March, 2021 to evaluate the overall livelihood impacts of the pandemic during 2020. The survey collected data on demographic and economic characteristics, governmental control measures, and effects of the COVID-19 on agricultural production, employment, income, education, and daily life. In-depth interviews are also conducted to clarify the livelihood impacts of COVID-19 on villages. Results Results showed that the pandemic tremendously caused substantially negative livelihood impacts, including decreasing household income, and disorders in daily lives. The average income loss of all survey households is 6,842 RMB, accounting for 13.01% of the total household income in 2020. Containment measures also resulted in a series of disturbances in daily lives, such as rising food price additional expenditures, travel restrictions, party restrictions, closure of schools and deceasing living standards. There is remarkable household heterogeneity in the livelihood impacts. Results also revealed that the livelihood strategies of rural households to cope with the threat of COVID-19 were different in various pandemic stages. Conclusion Our findings have illustrated the severity and heterogeneity of livelihood impacts on rural households induced by COVID-19 pandemic. The dynamics of livelihood impacts is also highlighted in the study. Several policy suggestion was proposed to mitigate these negative consequences of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4296793433,"Background Recently, speech and video information recognition technology (SVRT) has developed rapidly. Introducing SVRT into the emergency medical practice process may lead to improvements in health care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of acceptance of SVRT among patients, caregivers and emergency medical staff. Methods Structured questionnaires were developed for the patient or caregiver group and the emergency medical staff group. The survey was performed in one tertiary academic hospital emergency department. Questions were optimized for each specific group, and responses were provided mostly using Likert 5-scales. Additional multivariable logistic regression analyses for the whole cohort and subgroups were conducted to calculate odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) to examine the association between individual characteristics and SVRT acceptance. Results Of 264 participants, respondents demonstrated a positive attitude and acceptance toward SVRT and artificial intelligence (AI) in future; 179 (67.8%) for video recordings, and 190 (72.0%) for speech recordings. A multivariable logistic regression model revealed that several factors were associated with acceptance of SVRT in emergency medical practice: belief in health care improvement by signal analysis technology (OR, 95% CIs: 2.48 (1.15–5.42)) and AI (OR, 95% CIs: 1.70 (0.91–3.17)), reliability of AI application in emergency medicine (OR, 95% CIs: 2.36 (1.28–4.35)) and the security of personal information (OR, 95% CIs: 1.98 (1.10–3.63)). Conclusion A high level of acceptance toward SVRT has been shown in patients or caregivers, and it also appears to be associated with positive attitudes toward new technology, AI and security of personal information."
https://openalex.org/W4296793595,"We analyze how parties respond programmatically to populist parties in power abroad. Political parties often copy the policies of governing parties in other countries–a phenomenon that contributes to waves of transnational policy diffusion. We report the first large-scale comparative study showing that populist parties in government abroad trigger the opposite reaction: instead of inspiring emulation, their highly visible governing dilemmas provoke a policy backlash by parties in other states. We argue that dilemmas arise because populist parties confront unique and debilitating trade-offs between maintaining their anti-system posture and governing effectively, which make them electorally vulnerable. Other parties observe foreign populists’ governing dilemmas and respond by distancing themselves in order to avoid these problems. We detect this “foreign populist backlash effect” using spatial econometric analysis, a method that allows us to estimate international policy connections between parties, applied to over 200 European parties’ programmatic positions since the 1970s. Our findings illuminate parties’ election strategies and show that this backlash effect constrains the spread of populism across Western democracies."

In this study, an iterative joint clustering and prediction approach is proposed to accurately predict spatiotemporal patterns in travel time. The clustering module is tied to the prediction module, and a prediction model is trained on each cluster. The combined clustering and prediction are then iterated until a chosen metric is optimized. This orients clusters of data towards prediction while enabling model development on subsets of travel time data with similar prediction complexity. The clusters created using the joint clustering and prediction approach confirmed to the real-world traffic scenario, forming clusters of high travel time at busy intersections and bus stops across the study stretch and forming clusters of low travel time in the sub-urban areas of the city. Further, a comparison of the developed framework with base methods demonstrated a decrease in prediction errors by at least 22.83%. This indicates that creating clusters of data that are sensitive to the quality of predictions using the joint clustering and prediction framework improves the accuracy of travel time predictions. The study also proposes criteria for choosing the best predictions when cluster-based predictions are used."
https://openalex.org/W4296795014,"This study aimed to provide volumetric choroidal readings regarding sex, origin, and eye side from healthy cynomolgus monkey eyes as a reference database using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. A machine learning (ML) algorithm was used to extract the choroid from the volumetric OCT data. Classical computer vision methods were then applied to automatically identify the deepest location in the foveolar depression. The choroidal thickness was determined from this reference point. A total of 374 eyes of 203 cynomolgus macaques from Asian and Mauritius origin were included in the analysis. The overall subfoveolar mean choroidal volume in zone 1, in the region of the central bouquet, was 0.156 mm 3 (range, 0.131–0.193 mm 3 ). For the central choroid volume, the coefficient of variation (CV) was found of 6.3%, indicating relatively little variation. Our results show, based on analyses of variance, that monkey origin (Asian or Mauritius) does not influence choroid volumes. Sex had a significant influence on choroidal volumes in the superior-inferior axis (p ≤ 0.01), but not in the fovea centralis. A homogeneous foveolar choroidal architecture was also observed."

This study aimed to determine the level of mindful eating and its associated factors among T2DM patients at a primary care clinic near Kuala Lumpur. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 18th December 2020 to 5th March 2021 during the movement control order in Malaysia. Respondents were recruited using systematic random sampling via an electronic appointment system. They completed a questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic, clinical profiles, and a Malay-translated Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ-M). Their blood pressure and body mass index were taken during the appointment day while the remaining clinical profiles such as fasting blood sugar (FBS) were obtained from the medical record. Two hundred respondents were recruited with a mean (SD) age of 57.0 (10.90) years. More than half of them were female (54%). Two-thirds of them had uncontrolled diabetes based on elevated FBS of &gt;7 mmol/L (61.5%) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of &gt;7% (67%), respectively. The mean (SD) score for mindful eating was 2.9 (0.25). Multiple logistic regression revealed that older respondents had a higher level of mindful eating [(AOR = 1.05, p -value 0.01, 95% CI = 1.01–1.09)]. In addition, elevated FBS level was also associated with a greater level of mindful eating [(AOR = 2.55, p -value 0.01, 95% CI = 1.28–5.07)]. Therefore, healthcare providers should promote mindful eating during the consultation, especially among younger patients. Blood glucose monitoring is also recommended to instil awareness of the importance of healthy eating habits."
https://openalex.org/W4296797198,"Introduction Moringa stenopetala Bak. Cuf. is a native plant of Ethiopia with important nutraceutical applications. However, little is known about its nutritional, ethno-pharmaceutical and therapeutic properties. Hence, the present study sought to assess the nutraceutical applications of M . stenopetala among traditional healers in southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 50 selected administrative units in Gamo Gofa, Segen areas and south Omo zones of southern Ethiopia from May to June 2020. Data were gathered using a semi-structured interview, field observation, and group discussion. Both quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using Excel 2019 and open code version 4.03, respectively. The results were presented using descriptive statistics, with the fidelity level (FL)% used to distinguish the preferential use of various plant parts. Results A total of 120 individuals participated in the study, and the majority of them, 89 (74.2%), were male and farmers by occupation. Eight four (70%) of them were residents of the Gamo Gofa Zone. The fidelity level revealed that the leaf and root were the most commonly used parts for nutraceutical purposes. Remarkably, M . stenopetala is used to treat human ailments such as leprosy and kidney and liver infections via various modes of utilisation and administration. As a result, the most common methods of utilising plant products are chewing or consuming crushed plant parts, and the oral route is the much-preferred method of application. On the other hand, the larvae of Moringa moth Nurda blitealis , are a defoliating insect during the rainy season and have been identified as a limiting factor for its production. Conclusions The nutraceutical aspects of M . stenopetala are extremely important to the rural community in southern Ethiopia. However, the defoliating moth larvae threaten its growth and biomass production, necessitating the need to manage and improve the plant’s productivity and sustainable use. Additionally, conducting experimental studies to validate the plant’s pharmacological potential correspond to a milestone in drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W4296798901,"Buildings account for approximately 40% of the energy consumption across the European Union, so there is a requirement to strive for better energy performance to reduce the global impact of urbanised societies. However, energy performant buildings can negatively impact building occupants (e.g., comfort, health and/or wellbeing) due to a trade-off between airtightness and air circulation. Thus, there is a need to monitor Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) to inform how it impacts occupants and hence redefine value within building performance metrics. An individualised study design would enable researchers to gain new insights into the effects of environmental changes on individuals for more targeted e.g., health interventions or nuanced and improved building design(s). This paper presents a protocol to conduct longitudinal monitoring of an individual and their immediate environment. Additionally, a novel approach to environmental perception gathering is proposed that will monitor environmental factors at an individual level to investigate subjective survey data pertaining to the participant's perceptions of IEQ (e.g., perceived air quality, thermal conditions, light, and noise). This protocol has the potential to expose time-differential phenomena between environmental changes and an individual's behavioural and physiological responses. This could be used to support building performance monitoring by providing an interventional assessment of building performance renovations. In the future it could also provide building scientists with a scalable approach for environmental monitoring that focuses specifically on individual health and wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W4296798984,"Imitation provides a reliable method to investigate the developing memory functions in childhood. The present study explored whether 3-4-year-old children are able to revise their previous experiences after a 1 week delay in order to adapt to an altered context. We used a combined short-term (Session 1) and delayed (Session 2) imitation paradigm based on a previous study with 2-year-olds. The constraints (target object close/far) and relatedly the relevance of using a tool in a goal attainment task (irrelevant/relevant, respectively) changed between the sessions. We found that children in Session 1 used the tool only when it was needed (relevant/object far context). After the 1 week delay when the tool was previously irrelevant and then became relevant, children remembered the irrelevant act and applied it in the altered context. When the tool lost its relevance after 1 week, children used the tool less than before, but did not fully omit it, despite its reduced efficiency. The present data with 3-year-olds was compared to a pattern of results with 2-year-olds (from a similar previous study), that allowed to discuss possible developmental transitions in memory and imitation. We propose that the flexible restoration of a formerly irrelevant act and the maintenance of a formerly successful solution indicate flexibility of preschooler’s memory when guiding imitation. This flexibility, however, interacts with children’s tendency to remain faithful to strategies that were previously ostensively demonstrated to them."
https://openalex.org/W4296800230,"Previous research has associated repeated transurethral procedures after a diagnosis of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with increased risk of death of causes other than bladder cancer.We investigated the overall and disease-specific risk of death in patients with NMIBC compared to a background population sample.We utilized the database BladderBaSe 2.0 containing tumor-specific, health-related and socio-demographic information for 38,547 patients with NMIBC not primarily treated with radical cystectomy and 192,733 individuals in a comparison cohort, matched on age, gender, and county of residence. The cohorts were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and Hazard ratios (HR) from a Cox regression models. In the NMIBC cohort, we analyzed the association between number of transurethral procedures and death conditioned on surviving two or five years.Overall survival and survival from causes other than bladder cancer estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves was 9.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) (8.6%-10.0%)) and 1.4% (95% CI 0.7%-2.1%) lower respectively for the NMIBC cohort compared to the comparison cohort at ten years. In a Cox model adjusted for prognostic group, educational level and comorbidity, the HR was 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.05) for death from causes other than bladder cancer comparing the NMIBC cohort to the comparison cohort. Among the NMIBC patients, there was no discernible association between number of transurethral procedures and deaths of causes other than bladder cancer after adjustment. The number of procedures were, however, associated with risk of dying from bladder cancer HR 3.56 (95% CI 3.43-3.68) for four or more resections versus one within two years of follow-up.The results indicate that repeated diagnostic or therapeutic transurethral procedures under follow-up do not increase of risk dying from causes other than bladder cancer. The modestly raised risk for NMIBC patients dying from causes other than bladder cancer is likely explained by residual confounding."
https://openalex.org/W4296800827,"Background Manicaland province in eastern Zimbabwe has a high incidence of HIV. Completion of the seventh round of the Manicaland Survey in 2018–2019 provided the opportunity to assess the state of the epidemic prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aims were to: a) estimate HIV seroprevalence and assess whether prevalence has declined since the last round of the survey (2012–2013), b) describe and analyse the socio-demographic and behavioural risk factors for HIV infection and c) describe the HIV treatment cascade. Methods Participants were administered individual questionnaires collecting data on socio-demographic characteristics, sexual relationships, HIV prevention methods and treatment access, and were tested for HIV. Descriptive analyses were followed by univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors for HIV seropositvity using logistic regression modelling based on the proximate-determinants framework. Results HIV prevalence was 11.3% [95% CI; 10.6–12.0] and was higher in females than males up to 45–49 years. Since 2012–2013 HIV prevalence has significantly declined in 30–44 year-olds in males, and 20–44 year-olds in females. The HIV epidemic has aged since 2012–2013, with an increase in the mean age of HIV positive persons from 38 to 41 years. Socio-demographic determinants of HIV prevalence were church denomination in males, site-type, wealth-status, employment sector and alcohol use in females, and age and marital status in both sexes. Behavioural determinants associated with increased odds of HIV were a higher number of regular sexual partners (lifetime), non-regular sexual partners (lifetime) and condom use in both sexes, and early sexual debut and concomitant STIs in females; medical circumcision was protective in males. HIV status awareness among participants testing positive in our study was low at 66.2%. ART coverage amongst all participants testing positive for HIV in our study was 65.0% and was lower in urban areas than rural areas, particularly in males. Conclusions Prevalence has declined, and ART coverage increased, since 2012–2013. Majority of the associations with prevalence hypothesised by the theoretical framework were not observed in our data, likely due to underreporting of sexual risk behaviours or the treatment-as-prevention effect of ART curtailing the probability of transmission despite high levels of sexual risk behaviour. Further reductions in HIV incidence require strengthened primary prevention, HIV testing and linkage to risk behaviour counselling services. Our results serve as a valuable baseline against which to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV prevalence and its determinants in Manicaland, Zimbabwe, and target interventions appropriately."
https://openalex.org/W4296802325,"Backgrounds Micronutrient deficits in women of reproductive age have been linked to poor pregnancy outcomes. The most common micronutrient deficits in women are iron and folate. The World Health Organization recommends daily oral iron and folic acid supplementation (IFAS) as part of routine antenatal care to lower the risk of maternal anemia and adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the effectiveness of the supplementation relies on client’s strict adherence. The aim of this study was to determine time- to- non-adherence to IFAS and associated factors among pregnant women in Hosanna Town, South Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross sectional study design was employed from May 15-June11, 2021. Data were entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. The Cox regression hazard model was applied. The threshold of statistical significance was declared at a p-value &lt;0.05 and adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were used to report. Result The median time-to-non-adherence was 74 days (95 percent CI: 65.33–82.67). After adjusting for the confounders, age (AHR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.09), education status (AHR = 2.43 95%CI 1.34–4.40, AHR 3.00, 95% CI: 2.09–4.31, AHR 1.91, 95% CI: 1.32–2.77), household’s wealth index (AHR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.19–2.51, AHR = 1.64, 95% CI:1.15–2.35), and counseling at service delivery (AHR = 2.53, 95% CI: 1.88–3.41) were independent predictors of time to non-adherence to IFAS among pregnant women. Conclusion The median time to non-adherence was short and women became non-adherent before the recommended duration. Improving women’s education and counseling pregnant women on IFAS during pregnancy would make a change."
https://openalex.org/W4296808125,"Introduction Family planning program is low-cost and an effective way to lower maternalmortality by reducing the number of high-risk births. Despite the effectiveness of the program, availability of materials, equipment and trained healthcare providers were some of the challenges in sub-Saharan African countries including Ethiopia. Determining the implementation status and identifying gaps is the aim of this evaluation. Method A facility-based cross-sectional evaluation design with mixed method approach was employed. Quantitative data was collected through the exit interview of 477 clients from March 25-April 25, 2020. The evaluation focused on three dimensions: availability, compliance, and acceptability with multiple data sources. The quantitative data were entered in to Epi-data version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was done to determine factors associated with client satisfaction. The qualitative data were transcribed, translated and analyzed by using thematic analysis. The evaluation finding was computed and compared with the preset criteria for the final judgment. Result The majority of the health care providers (69.8%) got family planning training in the past two years. Three health facilities (37.5%) had 24hrs electricity with backup generators whereas only 25% of the health facilities had functional piped water inside the service room. Only two (25%) health facilities had a separate room for family planning service and 37.5% of health facilities had national FP guidelines. The overall availability of required resources for family planning service at Gondar city public facilities were 62.1%. Only twenty one (26.3%) of health providers dressed based on dressing code of ethics and none of them had ID during our observation. The overall compliance level of health care providers during providing family planning services were 75.5%. About 53.9% of the clients were satisfied with family planning service provided at Gondar city public health facilities.—and–were significantly associated variables with client satisfaction. Conclusion The overall implementation of family planning service in Gondar city public health facilities with the three evaluation dimensions were judged as fair based on pre-setting judgment matrix. It is better to improve the service through training of healthcare providers, distributed family planning guidelines to health facilities and shortening of waiting time for service."
https://openalex.org/W4296810132,"Whether short-term, low-potency opioid prescriptions for acute pain lead to future at-risk opioid use remains controversial and inadequately characterized. Our objective was to measure the association between emergency department (ED) opioid analgesic exposure after a physical, trauma-related event and subsequent opioid use. We hypothesized ED opioid analgesic exposure is associated with subsequent at-risk opioid use.Participants were enrolled in AURORA, a prospective cohort study of adult patients in 29 U.S., urban EDs receiving care for a traumatic event. Exclusion criteria were hospital admission, persons reporting any non-medical opioid use (e.g., opioids without prescription or taking more than prescribed for euphoria) in the 30 days before enrollment, and missing or incomplete data regarding opioid exposure or pain. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relationship between ED opioid exposure and at-risk opioid use, defined as any self-reported non-medical opioid use after initial ED encounter or prescription opioid use at 3-months.Of 1441 subjects completing 3-month follow-up, 872 participants were included for analysis. At-risk opioid use occurred within 3 months in 33/620 (5.3%, CI: 3.7,7.4) participants without ED opioid analgesic exposure; 4/16 (25.0%, CI: 8.3, 52.6) with ED opioid prescription only; 17/146 (11.6%, CI: 7.1, 18.3) with ED opioid administration only; 12/90 (13.3%, CI: 7.4, 22.5) with both. Controlling for clinical factors, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for at-risk opioid use after ED opioid exposure were: ED prescription only: 4.9 (95% CI 1.4, 17.4); ED administration for analgesia only: 2.0 (CI 1.0, 3.8); both: 2.8 (CI 1.2, 6.5).ED opioids were associated with subsequent at-risk opioid use within three months in a geographically diverse cohort of adult trauma patients. This supports need for prospective studies focused on the long-term consequences of ED opioid analgesic exposure to estimate individual risk and guide therapeutic decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2904951290,"Recent reports of haemagglutinin antigen (HA) mismatch between vaccine composition strains and circulating strains, have led to renewed interest in influenza B viruses. Additionally, there are concerns about resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors in new influenza B isolates. To assess the potential impact in Ghana, we characterized the lineages of influenza B viruses that circulated in Ghana between 2016 and 2017 from different regions of the country: Southern, Northern and Central Ghana. Eight representative specimens from the three regions that were positive for influenza B virus by real-time RT-PCR were sequenced and compared to reference genomes from each lineage. A total of eleven amino acids substitutions were detected in the B/Victoria lineage and six in the B/Yamagata lineage. The strains of influenza B viruses were closely related to influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 and influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 for the Victoria and Yamagata lineages, respectively. Three main amino acid substitutions (P31S, I117V and R151K) were found in B/Victoria lineages circulating between 2016 and 2017, while one strain of B/Victoria possessed a unique glycosylation site at amino acid position 51 in the HA2 subunit. Two main substitutions (L172Q and M251V) were detected in the HA gene of the B/Yamagata lineage. The U.S. CDC recently reported a deletion sub-group in influenza B virus, but this was not identified among the Ghanaian specimens. Close monitoring of the patterns of influenza B evolution is necessary for the efficient selection of representative viruses for the design and formulation of effective influenza vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4296793651,"Introduction Post-hospital discharge mortality is high among undernourished children in many low and middle-income countries. Although a number of quantitative studies have highlighted a range of potential socio-cultural, economic and health system factors influencing paediatric post-discharge treatment-seeking and recovery, few studies have explored family and provider perspectives of the post-discharge period in-depth. Methods This work was part of a large, multi-country prospective cohort study, the Childhood Acute Illness and Nutrition (CHAIN) Network. We conducted a qualitative sub-study to understand the post-discharge treatment-seeking and recovery experiences of families of undernourished children aged 2–23 months admitted in a rural and urban icddr,b (International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh) hospital. Methods included repeat in-depth interviews (73 interviews in total) with 29 family members of 17 purposively selected children. These data were supplemented by interviews with 33 health workers, and by observations in hospitals and homes. Results Important drivers of treatment-seeking perceived to support recovery included advice provided to family members while in hospital, media campaigns on hygiene practice, availability of free treatment, and social and financial support from family members, relatives and neighbours. Key perceived challenges included low household incomes, mothers having to juggle multiple responsibilities in addition to caring for the sick child, lack of support (sometimes violence) from the child’s father, and family members’ preference for relatively accessible drug shops, physicians or healers over hospital admission. Conclusion Development of interventions that address the challenges that families face is essential to support post-discharge adherence to medical advice and recovery. Potential interventions include strengthening information giving during hospitalization on what post-discharge care is needed and why, reducing direct and indirect costs associated with hospital visits, engaging fathers and other ‘significant others’ in post-discharge advice, and building mobile phone-based support for follow-up care."
https://openalex.org/W4296793821,"Ornithine carbamoyltransferases (OTCs) are involved in the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway and in arginine biosynthesis. Two OTCs in a pair are named catalytic OTC (cOTC) and anabolic OTC (aOTC). The cOTC is responsible for catalyzing the third step of the ADI pathway to catabolize citrulline into carbamoyl phosphate (CP), as well as ornithine, and displays CP cooperativity. In contrast, aOTC catalyzes the biosynthesis of citrulline from CP and ornithine in vivo and is thus involved in arginine biosynthesis. Structural and biochemical analyses were employed to investigate the CP cooperativity and unidirectional function of two sequentially similar OTCs (32.4% identity) named Ps_cOTC and Ps_aOTC from Psychrobacter sp. PAMC 21119. Comparison of the trimeric structure of these two OTCs indicated that the 80s loop of Ps_cOTC has a unique conformation that may influence cooperativity by connecting the CP binding site and the center of the trimer. The corresponding 80s loop region of in Ps_aOTC was neither close to the CP binding site nor connected to the trimer center. In addition, results from the thermal shift assay indicate that each OTC prefers the substrate for the unidirectional process. The active site exhibited a blocked binding site for CP in the Ps_cOTC structure, whereas residues at the active site in Ps_aOTC established a binding site to facilitate CP binding. Our data provide novel insights into the unidirectional catalysis of OTCs and cooperativity, which are distinguishable features of two metabolically specialized proteins."

https://openalex.org/W4296794359,"Introduction Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) remains an effective biomedical intervention for HIV prevention in high HIV prevalence countries. In South Africa, United States Agency for International Development VMMC partners provide technical assistance to the Department of Health, at national and provincial levels in support of the establishment of VMMC sites as well as in providing direct VMMC services at site level since April 2012. We describe the outcomes of the Right to Care (RTC) VMMC program implemented in South Africa from 2012 to 2017. Methods This retrospective study was undertaken at RTC supported facilities across six provinces. Young males aged ≥10 years who presented at these facilities from 1 July 2012 to 31 September 2017 were included. Outcomes were VMMC uptake, HIV testing uptake and rate of adverse events (AEs). Using a de-identified observational database of these clients, summary statistics of the demographic characteristics and outcomes were calculated. Results There were a total 1,001,226 attendees of which 998,213 (99.7%) were offered VMMC and had a median age of 15 years (IQR = 12–23 years). Of those offered VMMC, 99.6% (994,293) consented, 96.7% (965,370) were circumcised and the majority (46.3%) were from Gauteng province. HIV testing uptake was 71% with a refusal rate of 15%. Of the newly diagnosed HIV positives, 64% (6,371 / 9,972) referrals were made. The rate of AEs, defined as bleeding, infection, and insufficient skin removal) declined from 3.26% in 2012 to 1.17% in 2017. There was a reduction in infection-related AEs from 2,448 of the 2,602 adverse events (94.08%) in 2012 to 129 of the 2,069 adverse events (6.23%) in 2017. Conclusion There was a high VMMC uptake with a decline in AEs over time. Adolescent men contributed the most to the circumcised population, an indication that the young population accesses medical circumcision more. VMMC programs need to implement innovative demand creation strategies to encourage older males (20–34 years) at higher risk of HIV acquisition to get circumcised for immediate impact in reduction of HIV incidence. HIV prevalence in the total population increased with increasing age, notably in clients above 25 years."
https://openalex.org/W4296795079,"Compliance to infection control measures may be influenced both by the fear of negative consequences of a pandemic, but also by the expectation to be able to handle the pandemic's challenges. We performed a survey on a representative sample for Norway (N = 4,083) in the first weeks of the COVID-19 lock-down in March 2020. We had preregistered hypotheses to test the effect of optimism and perceived risk on compliance. Perceived risk had small effects on increasing compliance and on leading to more careful information gathering. The expected negative association between optimism and compliance was not supported, and there was instead a small positive association. We found a small effect that optimism was associated with seeing less risk from the pandemic and with a larger optimistic bias. Finally, an exploratory analysis showed that seeing the infection control measures as being effective in protecting others explained a substantial proportion of the variation in compliance. The study indicates that how we think about pandemic risk has complex and non-intuitive relationships with compliance. Our beliefs and motivations toward infection control measures appears to be important for compliance."

https://openalex.org/W4296795956,"Cataract causes vision loss and blindness due to formation of opacities of the lens. The regulatory mechanisms of cataract formation and progression remain unclear, and no effective drug treatments are clinically available. In the present study, we tested the effect of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm) inhibitors using an ex vivo model in which rat lenses were cultured in galactose-containing medium to induce opacity formation. After lens opacities were induced by galactose, the lenses were further incubated with the Atm inhibitors AZD0156 or KU55933, which decreased lens opacity. Subsequently, we used microarray analysis to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of action, and extracted genes that were upregulated by galactose-induced opacity, but not by inhibitor treatment. Quantitative measurement of mRNA levels and subsequent STRING analysis revealed that a functional network consisting primarily of actin family and actin-binding proteins was upregulated by galactose treatment and downregulated by both Atm inhibitors. In particular, Acta2 is a known marker of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial cells, and other genes connected in this functional network ( Actn1 , Tagln , Thbs1 , and Angptl4 ) also suggested involvement of EMT. Abnormal differentiation of lens epithelial cells via EMT could contribute to formation of opacities; therefore, suppression of these genes by Atm inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for reducing opacities and alleviating cataract-related visual impairment."
https://openalex.org/W4296796506,"Plasticity-related proteins (PRPs), which are synthesized in a synapse activation-dependent manner, are shared by multiple synapses to a limited spatial extent for a specific period. In addition, stimulated synapses can utilize shared PRPs through synaptic tagging and capture (STC). In particular, the phenomenon by which short-lived early long-term potentiation is transformed into long-lived late long-term potentiation using shared PRPs is called “late-associativity,” which is the underlying principle of “cluster plasticity.” We hypothesized that the competitive capture of PRPs by multiple synapses modulates late-associativity and affects the fate of each synapse in terms of whether it is integrated into a synapse cluster. We tested our hypothesis by developing a computational model to simulate STC, late-associativity, and the competitive capture of PRPs. The experimental results obtained using the model revealed that the number of competing synapses, timing of stimulation to each synapse, and basal PRP level in the dendritic compartment altered the effective temporal window of STC and influenced the conditions under which late-associativity occurs. Furthermore, it is suggested that the competitive capture of PRPs results in the selection of synapses to be integrated into a synapse cluster via late-associativity."

Adult venous thromboembolism patients initiating apixaban or warfarin with ≥1 bleeding risk factor were identified from Medicare and four commercial claims databases in the United States. To balance characteristics between apixaban and warfarin patients, stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting was conducted. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and clinically relevant non-major bleeding. In total, 88,281 patients were identified. After inverse probability treatment weighting, the baseline patient characteristics were well-balanced between the two cohorts. Among venous thromboembolism patients at high-risk of bleeding, apixaban was associated with significantly lower risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding. No significant interactions were observed between treatment and number of risk factors on major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding or between treatment and type of bleeding risk factors on any of the outcomes. In conclusion, apixaban was associated with significantly lower risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism and bleeding among venous thromboembolism patients at high-risk of bleeding. Effects were generally consistent across subgroups of patients with different number or type of bleeding risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W4296798894,"Transmission lines are most prone to faults in the transmission system, so high-precision fault diagnosis is very important for quick troubleshooting. There are some problems in current intelligent fault diagnosis research methods, such as difficulty in extracting fault features accurately, low fault recognition accuracy and poor fault tolerance. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes an intelligent fault diagnosis method for high voltage direct current transmission lines (HVDC) based on Gramian angular difference field (GADF) domain and improved convolutional neural network (VGG16). This method first performs variational modal decomposition (VMD) on the original fault voltage signal, and then uses the correlation coefficient method to select the appropriate intrinsic mode function (IMF) component, and converts it into a two-dimensional image using the Gramian Angular Difference Field(GADF). Finally, the improved VGG16 network is used to extract and classify fault features adaptively to realize fault diagnosis. In order to improve the performance of the VGG16 fault diagnosis model, batch normalization, dense connection and global average pooling techniques are introduced. The comparative experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper can further identify fault features and has a high fault diagnosis accuracy. In addition, the method is not affected by fault type, transitional resistance and fault distance, has good anti-interference ability, strong fault tolerance, and has great potential in practical applications."

Understanding the factors associated with CKD knowledge could assists healthcare providers to design health education programmes. There are scarce local studies on CKD knowledge and its associated factors among university students. This subpopulation comprises of young people with diverse background and characteristics. This study was aimed to assess the CKD knowledge and its associated factors among university students. A cross-sectional study was conducted among Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia students from July 2020 to August 2020. A convenience sampling method was applied. All students were invited to complete an online survey using Google Forms that were sent to their email. The survey consisted of questions related to their sociodemographic, socioeconomics, university programme enrolled, medical history, lifestyle characteristics and CKD knowledge. The data were analysed using SPSS Statistics 26.0. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the final associated factors after controlling for confounders. A total of 3074 students participated and 32.6% of them had below average CKD knowledge. Students of male gender, enrolment in undergraduate programmes and non-health-related faculties/institutes were more likely to have below average CKD knowledge. Students who are Chinese, from high monthly household income family and with family history of CKD were less likely to have below average CKD knowledge. Almost one-third of the students had below average CKD knowledge. The six associated factors with CKD knowledge were non-modifiable. Of the six factors, three were associated with students being more likely to have below average CKD knowledge; another three were associated with students being less likely to have below average CKD knowledge. Future health education programmes to enhance CKD knowledge should be designed focusing on students who are more likely to have below average CKD knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W4296803765,"Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was developed to overcome male factor infertility, however, there recently has been an increasing trend in ICSI usage irrespective of the etiology, demonstrating an overuse of this insemination technique. There is a limited knowledge on the behaviour of ICSI derived embryos in non-male factor infertility patients. Metabolomic assessment of preimplantation embryos in conjunction with morphological evaluation can provide better understanding of embryonic behaviour. Hence, this study was undertaken to explore if there are any metabolomic differences between IVF and ICSI derived sibling day-5 blastocysts from non-male factor infertility patients. This prospective study included nineteen couples with non-male factor infertility undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology. The sibling oocytes retrieved from each patient were randomly assigned to two groups and inseminated either by IVF or ICSI. Spent culture media (SCM) in which embryos were cultured up to day 5 were collected and investigated using sensitivity enhanced NMR based metabolite profiling utilizing high resolution (800 MHz) NMR equipped with cryogenically cooled micro-coil (1.7 mm) probe. The metabolomic signature between IVF and ICSI derived sibling blastocysts was assessed. A significant reduction in the concentrations of pyruvate, citrate, glucose and lysine were observed in both IVF and ICSI sibling embryos compared to medium control (P&lt; 0.05–0.001). Further, histidine and valine level was found lower in ICSI embryos compared to medium control (P&lt;0.05) during 96 hours of in vitro culture. Notably, between IVF and ICSI SCM, no significant difference in the concentration of the metabolites was found. Our results suggest that ICSI in non-male factor does not alter the SCM metabolomic signature during 96 hours of embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W4296805726,"Bovine pregnancy-associated glycoproteins ( boPAGs ) are extensively glycosylated secretory proteins of trophoblast cells. Roughly 20 different boPAG members are known but their distribution patterns and degree of glycosylation during pregnancy are not well characterized. The objective of the present study was the development of a parallel reaction monitoring-based assay for the profiling of different boPAGs during pregnancy and after gestation. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of N-glycosylation on our analytical results. BoPAGs were purified from cotyledons of four different pregnancy stages. The assay detects 25 proteotypic peptides from 18 boPAGs in a single run. The highest abundances were found for boPAG 1 in both, glycosylated and deglycosylated samples. Strongest effects of glycosylation were detected during mid and late pregnancy as well as in afterbirth samples. Furthermore, we identified different boPAG-clusters based on the observed relative protein abundances between glycosylated and deglycosylated samples. A linkage between the impact of glycosylation and potential N-glycosylation sites or phylogenetic relation was not detected. In conclusion, the newly developed parallel reaction monitoring-based assay enables for the first time a comprehensive semi-quantitative profiling of 18 different boPAGs during pregnancy and post-partum on protein level, thereby investigating the influence of glycosylation. The results of this study provide new and important starting points to address further research on boPAGs to better understand their physiological role during pregnancy and for the development of new pregnancy detection tests."
https://openalex.org/W4296807469,"Seamless DNA vectors derived from bacterial plasmids are devoid of bacterial genetic elements and represent attractive alternatives for biomedical applications including DNA vaccines. Larger scale production of seamless vectors employs engineered Escherichia coli strains in order to enable tightly regulated expression of site-specific DNA recombinases which precisely delete unwanted sequences from bacterial plasmids. As a novel component of a developing lambda integrase genome editing platform, we describe here strain MG1655-ISC as a means to easily produce different scales of seamless vectors, ranging in size from a few hundred base pairs to more than ten kilo base pairs. Since we employed an engineered lambda integrase that is able to efficiently recombine pairs of DNA crossover sites that differ in sequence, the resulting seamless vectors will be useful for subsequent genome editing in higher eukaryotes to accommodate variations in target site sequences. Future inclusion of single cognate sites for other genome targeting systems could enable modularity. These features, together with the demonstrated simplicity of in vivo seamless vector production, add to their utility in the biomedical space."
https://openalex.org/W4296808197,"Background Several of the most extensively used risk prediction tools for coronary artery bypass grafting outcomes include female sex as an independent risk factor for postoperative outcomes. It is not clear whether this putative increased surgical risk impacts long-term survival. This study aimed to assess sex differences in 10-year all-cause mortality. Methods Retrospective analysis of 5340 consecutive patients undergoing primary isolated coronary artery bypass surgery, performed from 2000 to 2015, in a Portuguese level III Hospital. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at ten years. We employed an overlap weighting algorithm to minimize confounding. Its target population highlights patients with the most overlap in their observed characteristics, and its corresponding estimand is the average treatment effect in the overlap population. Results We identified that 5340 patients underwent isolated CABG: 1104 (20.7%) were female, and 4236 (79.3%) were male. Sixteen patients were lost to follow-up (0.3%). The median follow-up time was 12.79 (IQR, 9.52–16.66) years: 12.68 (IQR, 9.48–16.54) years for the male patient group and 13.13 (IQR, 9.75–16.98) years for the female patient group. The primary endpoint of all-cause mortality at ten years occurred in 1106 patients (26.1%) in the male patient group, compared with 315 (28.5%) in the female patient group. The unweighted survival analysis for both groups reveals the worst long-term prognosis for the female cohort (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.35; p &lt; 0.001), while in the overlap weighted survival analysis, such long-term difference in prognosis disappears (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.09; p = 0.693). Conclusion In this longitudinal, population-level analysis of patients undergoing primary, isolated CABG, we demonstrated that the female sex is not associated with increased long-term all-cause mortality compared to their male counterparts. Thus, sex should not influence the undertaking of an adequate revascularization strategy."
