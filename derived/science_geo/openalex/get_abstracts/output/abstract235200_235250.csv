Experiments with the radioactive isotope, phosphorus-32, have shown, however, that the phospholipids of the brain have a significant phosphorus turnover-rate1,2, and the turnover is greater for cephalin than lecithin."

 of muscle tissue, and did several studies of the nerve tissue in rabbit muscles. This brief report explains a successful technique
 for preparing and sectioning the delicate nerve tissue."

In alkaline medium the reduction proceeds at a concentration of 28 per cent sodium hydroxide, and the product is ammonia. Cotte and Kahane1 have found that silver sulphate catalyses the reduction at a suitably lower concentration of hydroxide. The ammonia formed was distilled into acid, the excess of which was measured. Our method is based on the same reduction; but the reduced nitrate is measured in another manner. The reduction is effected in a boiling 3 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, containing ammoniacal silver sulphate, by the action of ferrous hydroxide precipitated from a measured sample of ferrous ammonium sulphate. When the reaction is completed, the mixture is acidified with sulphuric acid and the excess of the ferrous iron is titrated with potassium permanganate. A blank titration must also be carried out. The reduction—without regard to the catalysis—proceeds by the following reactions: As can be seen from the equations, 8 moles of Fe(OH)2 are necessary for the reduction of 1 mole of nitrate. 1 ml. of 0.1 N potassium permanganate is equivalent to 0.7751 mgm. of NO3."

With their method of the reflectrix they find two focusing effects, one at a distance corresponding to a path that leaves the earth tangentially, the other at the limit of the skip distance."

https://openalex.org/W1991356511,"MANY soil actinomycetes of the genus Streptomyces inhibit the growth of fungi on solid agar media, the inhibitory power exerted by a colony of such an actinomycete on a neighbouring fungal colony being indicated by the width of the inhibition zone which forms between them. Since the width of this zone is affected by the size and relative positions of the two colonies, it is essential to standardize these conditions in order to compare the anti-fungal activity of an actinomycete on different media. Actinomycetes grow slowly by comparison with most fungi; hence, when making an antagonism test of this type, it is convenient to inoculate the actinomycete over an area of the agar surface upon which will arise a colony large enough to give an easily measurable inhibition zone in a short time. Colonies 5–10 mm. in diameter when three to five days old have been found to be quite suitable. The technique of placing aliquot drops of liquid inoculum directly on an agar surface is sometimes not satisfactory, because the drops may spread, particularly when the plate is moved, thereby giving rise to irregular colonies. Moreover, the amount of spreading is affected by the composition of the medium. Again, it is sometimes necessary to inoculate with the actinomycete after the fungus has grown for some time on the plate. In such cases it is difficult to place the drops at a predetermined distance from the fungal growth."

A theoretical criticism which may be of consequence when the experimental results are less definite can be illustrated by a simplified example."
