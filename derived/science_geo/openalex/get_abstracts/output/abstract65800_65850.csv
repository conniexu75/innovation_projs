https://openalex.org/W1497259627,"Abstract Treatment of M- or N-active sialoglycopeptides, derived from human erythrocytes, with alkaline borohydride (0.1 m NaOH-0.4 m NaBH4, room temperature, 26 hours) released 25 to 30% of the carbohydrate as low molecular weight oligosaccharides. No difference was found in the composition of oligosaccharides obtained from M- or N-active erythrocytes. The most complex oligosaccharide (Component I) was a tetrasaccharide, N-acetylneuraminyl-(2 → 3)-β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 3) [N-acetylneuraminyl-(2 → 6)]-d-N-acetylgalactosaminitol. In addition, the following compounds were identified: N-acetylneuraminyl-(2 → 3)-β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-d-N-acetylgalactosaminitol (Component II); N-acetylneuraminyl-(2 → 3)-β-d-galactitol (Component III); β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-d-N-acetylgalactosaminitol, together with free sialic acid, galactitol, N-acetylgalactosaminitol, 3-deoxy-d-glucitol, and the reduced Kuhn chromogen. It is concluded that the major, alkali-labile oligosaccharide of sialoglycopeptides is a tetrasaccharide and that other components are degradation products thereof."

Inhibition of DNA synthesis with hydroxyurea or high concentrations of thymidine results, within 30 min, in a termination of histone synthesis in vitro. Under these conditions, the labeling of other acid-soluble, nonhistone proteins is not affected. Inhibition of RNA synthesis with actinomycin D or 2-mercapto-1-(β-4-pyridethyl)benzimidazole in whole cells up to 90 min does not interfere with the histone synthesis in vitro. A rapidly labeled RNA with an approximate sedimentation constant of 8 to 9 S is connected with the microsomal fraction only when histones are being synthesized. The existence is inferred of a short-lived factor which facilitates the translation of histone messenger RNA in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1508136483,"Abstract The forward and reverse reactions catalyzed by transcarboxylase have been studied in the presence and absence of products and substrate analogues. The kinetic patterns of initial velocities at low substrate concentrations support the conclusion that the transcarboxylase reaction proceeds through two half-reactions in a mechanism with an intermediate formation of an enzyme-biotin∼CO2 complex. However, kinetic patterns with inhibitors were found to be inconsistent with the predicted patterns for a ping-pong mechanism since the inhibition was competitive when the inhibitor and the varied substrate were similar, that is, both coenzyme A compounds or both keto acids. Dissimilar combinations of inhibitors and varied substrates resulted in noncompetitive inhibition when the inhibitor was a product of the reaction, and uncompetitive inhibition when the inhibitor was an inactive analogue of the fixed substrate. These findings are interpreted as indicating that transcarboxylase has two types of separate and independent binding sites, one for binding each of two groups of substrates and inhibitors; coenzyme A compounds constitute one group of reactants, and keto acids constitute the other group. Consequently, the mechanism constructed for the oxalacetate transcarboxylase reaction may be described as a hybrid between a ping-pong mechanism and a random, ternary complex mechanism, since it involves an intermediate formation of a substituted form of the enzyme and allows independent binding of substrates to two distinct sites on the enzyme. Rate equations that establish a consistency between the new hybrid ping-pong mechanism and the observed kinetic data have been derived with the use of the combined assumptions of rapid equilibrium and steady state kinetic theory."

Incorporation of isotope is restricted to the prosthetic group of hemeproteins, and cytochromes with high specific radioactivity are generated. Subsequent measurements of biological decay in vivo can be made, and permit calculation of half-lives for several cytochromes. Cytochromes b and c are associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and have similar half-lives, 5.5 and 6.1 days. Cytochrome b5 is associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane, and its half-life is 4.4 days. Microsomal cytochrome b5 is renewed with a half-life of 2.3 days. Labeling the protein moiety of microsomal cytochrome b5 with arginine-14C (guanido) yielded a half-life of 2.5 days."
https://openalex.org/W1602623372,"Abstract Mouse mammary epithelial cells in organ culture incorporate 32Pi into histones and nonhistone nuclear phosphoproteins. This incorporation represents the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues of completed polypeptide chains, as indicated by analysis of the 32P-labeled products and by the insensitivity of 32Pi incorporation to inhibitors of protein synthesis. Insulin stimulates nuclear protein phosphorylation 8- to 10-fold concomitantly with a stimulation of RNA synthesis and prior to a stimulation of histone polypeptide synthesis. Prolactin stimulates phosphorylation of certain histone fractions and nonhistone nuclear phosphoproteins and induces specific milk proteins after preliminary treatment of the explants with insulin and hydrocortisone. The results indicate that hormonal stimulation of RNA synthesis is closely coupled to phosphorylation of nuclear proteins, and they suggest that nuclear phosphoproteins may be involved in the regulation of gene expression in mammary epithelial cells."

In the presence of a particulate enzyme from M. lysodeikticus undecaprenyl phosphate serves as an acceptor of a mannosyl group from GDP-mannose, with concomitant production of GDP. Optimal rates of enzymatic synthesis of mannosyl-1-phosphoryl-undecaprenol require the presence of Mg++ ion, and a surfaceactive compound, such as phosphatidylglycerol. An isomer of undecaprenyl phosphate, ficaprenyl (11) phosphate, serves as a substrate for mannosyl-1-phosphoryl-undecaprenol synthetase."

Xenografts, by contrast were cicatrized but eventually rejected. Intrafamilial transplants survived longer than interfamilial ones. Xenografts and autografts placed in the graft bed were joined to each other but xenografts were later destroyed although autografts were not. Two xenografts from Eisenia to Lumbricus, performed simul taneously, showed survival endpoints similar to a single xenograft. A 5-day interval between first- and second-set grafting led to an accelerated rejection of both transplants. First-set Allolobophora transplants to Lumbricus performed simulataneously with second-set Eisenia grafts were destroyed at a time different from either of the two Eisenia transplants. A single Allolobophora transplant to Lumbricus was rejected at survival tines equivalent to Allolobophora along with two Eisenia transplants."
https://openalex.org/W199434988,"During the replacement of histones by protamine at the terminal stages of trout spermatogenesis, both classes of chromosomal basic proteins are phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of newly synthesized protamine occurs in the cytoplasm. Newly synthesized phosphoprotamine is then transported into the nucleus and binds to DNA without appreciable dephosphorylation. Although the complex of phosphorylated protamine with DNA is as compact as the dephosphoprotamine-DNA complex, the affinity of protamine for DNA is decreased by phosphorylation. In contrast, pre-formed rather than newly synthesized histones are phosphorylated. The binding of histones to DNA as judged by salt or detergent dissociation does not appear to be significantly changed by phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W218822210,"Abstract Ribonuclease S-protein was attached covalently to agarose which had been activated by treatment with cyanogen bromide according to the methods described by Porath and his colleagues. Columns made with this conjugate showed a high affinity for ribonuclease S-peptide, which could be recovered by elution with dilute acetic acid. This procedure, employed for the purification of synthetic S-peptide derivatives prepared by the solid phase method of Merrifield, resulted in marked enhancement of specific activity. However, the chemical and catalytic properties of the purified materials suggest the presence of closely related side products, formed during the synthesis or during subsequent deprotection steps which bind tightly to the S-protein conjugate but which yield enzymically inactive complexes with RNase S-protein."
https://openalex.org/W1937641258,"Abstract Net conversion of malate to fumarate as measured by the A260 of fumarate is accompanied by a nearly equivalent loss of 3H or 2H from (2S, 3R)-32 or 3H-malate to water but by an appreciable incorporation of 18O from water into unreacted malate. At equilibrium with high substrate concentrations, exchange of the hydroxyl oxygen of malate with water is faster but interchange of the methylene hydrogen is slower than the carbon skeleton interchange between malate and fumarate. Relative values for the 18O(malate) ⇄ O(water), 14C(malate) ⇄ C(fumarate), 3H(malate) ⇄ H(water), and the 2H(malate) ⇄ H(water) exchange rates are 4.0, 2.5, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively. Exchange rate differences and 18O incorporation into malate as compared to net reaction are accentuated in a glycerol-water medium. The 14C:3H exchange ratio approaches a limiting value of below 1 at low substrate concentrations and a limiting value of between 2 and 3 at high substrate concentrations. Addition of 0.3 m ammonium sulfate accelerates the 3H exchange, presumably by facilitating proton dissociation from the enzyme. The exchange patterns are consistent with a carbonium ion mechanism. Theoretical equations and a reaction scheme in accord with the results are given. These allow calculation of distribution patterns of enzyme-bound intermediates and ratios for a number of velocity constants."
https://openalex.org/W1502045544,"Transcarboxylase catalyzes exchange between 14C-propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA, and also between 14C-pyruvate and oxalacetate. The presence of these exchange reactions is consistent with both a standard ping-pong reaction mechanism and the hybrid ping-pong reaction mechanism proposed for transcarboxylase. An analogue of pyruvate, 2-ketobutyrate, causes inhibition of pyruvate-oxalacetate exchange and stimulation of propionyl-CoA:methylmalonyl-CoA exchange. Oxalate, an analogue of oxalacetate, causes inhibition of both exchange reactions. In addition, oxalate inhibition results in an unusual set of kinetic patterns when studied as a function of all substrates in the forward and reverse direction of the complete reaction. These findings are inconsistent with a standard ping-pong reaction mechanism but can be explained by a hybrid ping-pong mechanism if it is assumed (a) that there are dual sites for the ring of biotin which are located adjacent to the two substrates sites, responsible for the two exchange reactions, and (b) that the presence of either 2-ketobutyrate or oxalate alters the rate of the migration of biotin between its dual sites."
https://openalex.org/W1530719073,"Abstract Transcarboxylase has been isolated from Propionibacterium shermanii grown in the presence of either 60Co or 65Zn, and it has been shown that there is good correlation between radioactivity and enzymatic activity during the final stages of purification. Quantitative determinations of the metal content by atomic absorption analyses indicate that approximately 2 moles of cobalt and 4 moles of zinc are usually present per mole of enzyme (molecular weight 670,000), giving a total metal content which is equimolar with the biotin content of the enzyme. Although the sum of the cobalt and zinc content is constant, the ratio between the two metals has been found to vary. The enzyme causes a substantial broadening of the nuclear magnetic signal arising from the methyl protons of pyruvate. The broadening effect is reversed by increasing concentrations of oxalate. It is proposed that cobalt and zine function at the active site for pyruvate. Radioactivity of 60Co-labeled transcarboxylase is primarily associated with a subunit of the enzyme with a sedimentation constant of 6S that contains little or no biotin."
https://openalex.org/W1550096107,"In order to assign a kinetic mechanism to phosphorylase b, initial rate studies were conducted in conjunction with isotope exchange studies at equilibrium. Initial velocity rates were measured with varied concentrations of both substrates in each direction, in the presence of saturating levels of AMP. Data were analyzed with double reciprocal plots and secondary replots of intercepts and slopes. The resulting kinetically derived dissociation constants agreed reasonably well with those determined by independent means. These results indicate that the kinetic mechanism of phosphorylase b is rapid equilibrium random bi bi in nature. The rate equation for this mechanism has been modified to take into account the fact that one of the substrates, glycogen, gives rise to a product which is chemically and kinetically indistinguishable under the conditions used to determine initial rates. This phenomenon, equivalent to having one of the two products present at all times, results in the number two being introduced into the rate equation, so the kinetically derived dissociation constant for glycogen is half the true value while the observed Km values for phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate are twice the theoretical values. This rate equation should apply wherever an enzyme synthesizes or degrades a homopolymer by 1 unit at a time. To confirm the mechanism suggested by initial velocity experiments, isotope exchange studies at equilibrium were performed for the phosphorylase b system, again in the presence of saturating levels of AMP. The 14C-glucose-1-P ⇌ glycogen equilibrium reaction rate increased as the concentrations of either glucose-1-P and orthophosphate or glycogen were increased, and reached a plateau as the concentration of varied substrates became saturating. The same results were obtained for 32Pi ⇌ glucose-1-P exchange. Thus, there was no evidence of an inhibition of the exchange of one pair of substrates when the concentration of the other substrate pair was raised. Similar exchange rates were observed in either direction, indicating that rapid equilibrium conditions apply. A reasonable agreement existed between the maximal velocities calculated from the initial rate data and those determined from the isotope exchange rates, assuming a rapid equilibrium random bi bi mechanism. Both the initial velocity and the equilibrium isotope exchange studies support a reaction mechanism in which substrates bind in a noncompulsory order to the enzyme and in which the interconversions of ternary complexes are the ratelimiting steps."
https://openalex.org/W1594324134,"A basic amino acid, putreanine, was found in mammalian brain but not in other organs. It was purified from bovine brain by ion exchange chromatography and was crystallized as the sulfate. From 82 kg of brain, 535 mg of the sulfate were obtained. Elementary analysis gave its empirical formula as C7H16N2O2. Its structure was subsequently determined as N-(4-aminobutyl)-3-aminopropionic acid by Shiba and Kaneko (see Appendix). The concentration of putreanine was determined by preliminary purification of the basic amino acid fraction from a trichloracetic acid extract of mammalian tissues followed by analysis in an automatic amino acid analyzer. It was only detected in the central nervous system of mammalian and avian organisms. Its concentration was highest in caudal regions of the brain, and the white matter of the cerebral and cerebellar cortices and the spinal cord contained more than grey matter of the corresponding areas. Putreanine appears in the brain of rats 2 weeks after birth and subsequently its concentration increases for several months."
https://openalex.org/W1674314053,"Abstract Collagen was extracted from Achilles tendons of copper-deficient and control chicks by successive treatment with 0.15 m NaCl, 1.0 m NaCl, and 0.5 m acetic acid. The fractions extractable by 1.0 m NaCl and 0.5 m acetic acid were purified and characterized by ultracentrifugation and gel electrophoresis. They were then fractionated on carboxymethyl cellulose columns into their α1, α2, β11, and β12 components. These components were analyzed for amino acids and in part for aldehyde function. Copper deficiency not only increased the proportion of total extractable collagen but also markedly increased the proportion of α components at the expense of the β components. The α:β ratio was increased approximately 3-fold, and the β11 component was essentially eliminated. Copper deficiency had no detectable effect upon amino acid composition. The amino acid analyses confirmed the presence of two distinct polypeptide chains which occurred in a ratio of approximately 2:1. Both the salt-soluble and the acid-soluble collagen from copper-deficient tendons contained less aldehyde than those from control tissue. The control α1 component contained approximately 1 mole of aldehyde per 100,000 g, while the deficient α1 contained about 0.7 mole. Copper functions as a catalyst in the formation of the intramolecular bond in collagen and appears to be essential for formation of an intermediate aldehydic compound."
https://openalex.org/W1567599555,"Abstract The action pattern and specificity of a highly purified exo-β-(1 → 3)-d-glucanase from Basidiomycetes species QM 806 have been investigated. The glucanase removes single glucose residues from a β-(1 → 3)-linked glucan chain commencing at the nonreducing terminal. It can bypass β-(1 → 6) linkages, yielding gentiobiose quantitatively from this structural feature, and it can cleave β-(1 → 3) linkages adjacent to other types of linkage in the main chain. The enzyme, although typically exo in its mode of attack, can initiate an endo cleavage in that it attacks endo-β-(1 → 3) bonds adjacent to β-(1 → 6) linkages. The enzyme does not catalyze transglycosylation reactions. The action pattern of the enzyme is the same on all structures attacked, regardless of their molecular size, but the rate at which these are attacked varies widely. Although the enzyme shows the greatest preference for substrates containing consecutive β-(1 → 3)-linked glucopyranosyl residues, it will degrade a variety of substrate analogues. It was found that the specificity of the enzyme extends over a number of residues of the substrate and is not directed toward any one particular residue or linkage. To explain these results, it is suggested that the glucanase has a substrate binding site composed of a consecutive series of individual glucosyl residue binding sites or subsites which are so arranged as to correspond spatially with a sequence of β-(1 → 3)-linked glucopyranosyl residues. Substrates were found to be hydrolyzed at a rate proportional to the degree to which their structures correspond to such a sequence of subsites on the enzyme. A similar relationship was found with the ability of these structures to act as inhibitors of the hydrolysis of laminarin, further indicating that the enzyme binds a number of consecutive glucosyl residues on the active site."

https://openalex.org/W1484895105,"Abstract Cystathionine γ-synthase catalyzes replacement of the succinyl group of O-succinylhomoserine by cysteine to yield cystathionine, a step in methionine biosynthesis in Salmonella. The enzyme catalyzes rapid exchanges of both α and β hydrogen atoms in many amino acids that are not otherwise substrates. Stereospecificity was indicated by the exchangeability of all 4 hydrogen residues in alanine but of only 2 in α-aminobutyrate. Neither the replacement of a substituent on carbon 4 nor the exchange of a hydrogen on carbon 3 have been observed with any other pyridoxal phosphate enzyme. Cystathionine itself underwent exchange of 4 hydrogen residues, the α hydrogen and 1 β hydrogen in each chain. The rate of exchange in the 3-carbon chain was 6 times greater than either the exchange rate in the other chain or the Vmax for net cystathionine formation. In the 4-carbon chain, the apparent initial rate of β hydrogen exchange was twice that of α hydrogen exchange. Cystathionine was also found to undergo slow γ elimination and γ replacement reactions; the hydrogen exchange rates were about 103 times faster than the rates of cysteine exchange or elimination. The apparent Km for cystathionine was the same in all reactions. No hydrogen exchanges were catalyzed by apoenzyme (the Km for pyridoxal-P was also determined (4 x 10-8 m)). These results indicate that the γ elimination step catalyzed by cystathionine synthase is unconcerted and that the enzyme is efficiently designed for general base attack on an amino acid β hydrogen. The solvent hydrogen previously shown to be acquired at carbon 3 of α-ketobutyrate during the γ elimination reaction is introduced stereospecifically. This protonation is, therefore, catalyzed by the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1502811517,"Abstract The activation of papain with four different activators is not accompanied by the binding of any of them to the protein. These experiments, taken together with previously reported results, show that the inactive form of papain prepared by the method of Kimmel and Smith (J. Biol. Chem., 207, 575 (1954)) is a mixed disulfide formed between the active site sulfhydryl group of the protein and free cysteine. The known inhibition of the activated enzyme by reagents having affinity for carbonyl groups has been investigated in order to determine whether an aldehyde residue which is intimately connected with the activation process is present on the enzyme, or if the observed inactivation of the protein by this class of reagents can be accounted for in some other manner. The following relevant observations were made. (a) Phenylhydrazine inactivates and binds to cyanide-activated papain but neither inactivates nor binds to cysteine- or borohydride-activated papain in the presence of excess activator. (b) The cysteine-activated enzyme is also inhibited by phenylhydrazine when the cysteine to papain ratio is low. (c) This inhibition in the presence of cyanide or low concentrations of cysteine is readily reversible with excess cysteine which also releases the bound phenylhydrazine from the protein. (d) Treatment of the enzyme with either phenylhydrazine or hydrogen peroxide in the presence of 14CN- results in the binding of one cyanide group per active site on the enzyme. Carboxamidomethylation of the sulfhydryl group at the active site prevents this reaction. (e) Semicarbazide and hydroxylamine, other reagents having high affinity for the carbonyl group, are much less effective inhibitors of papain. (f) Reactivation of cyanide-activated, peroxide-inactivated papain by cysteine yields 2-iminothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid. Model studies show that phenylhydrazine, but not semicarbazide or hydroxylamine, is capable of oxidizing cysteine to cystine during 1 hour of incubation with 30 mm reagent. Phenylhydrazine does not bind to cyanate-inactivated papain. Activator-free papain is irreversibly inhibited by phenylhydrazine, without concomitant binding of the reagent. These and other experiments show that the inhibition of cyanide-activated papain by carbonyl reagents is not due to the affinity of these compounds for a carbonyl group on the enzyme, but rather to an oxidative coupling of cyanide to the enzyme resulting in the conversion of the cysteine residue at the active site to β-thiocyanatoalanine. Reactivation can be effected by excess cysteine, whereby the cyanide moiety is transferred from the enzyme to the free sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residue."
https://openalex.org/W1483044202,"The hydrogen exchange kinetics of chymotrypsinogen A have been studied as a function of temperature and pH. At low pH and temperature, so chosen as to assure that the exchange proceeds predominantly through reversible thermal unfolding, the experimental rate constants and activation energy (72 ± 5 kcal at pH 2 and 27°) agree well with values calculated from available rate constants for thermal unfolding and refolding. At higher pH values and at temperatures below the thermal transition region, the measured rates are higher and the activation energies lower (35 ± 5 kcal at pH 5 and 37°) than expected for any exchange process involving thermal, cooperative unfolding. It can be shown that, although the formal mechanism of exchange through thermal unfolding changes with pH and the unfolding becomes rate-limiting at higher pH values, this fact does not explain the low activation energy. In order to explain the exchange of hard to exchange hydrogens without involving reversible thermal unfolding or changing the nature of such a transition, we suggest the existence of considerable segmental motion with relatively low activation energies, exposing in the kinetic sense all hydrogens to solution. Such a pathway of exchange would be sensitive to changes of rate in segmental motion in any part of the protein and give us information about surface properties of the protein. As a consequence, the observed changes in hydrogen exchange properties for proteins in general cannot be easily correlated to conformational changes in the thermodynamic sense."

https://openalex.org/W283496392,"Abstract With suitable submitochondrial particles from the heart, the rate of the inorganic phosphate ⇄ HOH exchange during substrate oxidation in the absence of ADP is less than 1/1000 of the rate in the presence of ADP. The concentration dependence of the exchange on ADP shows simple saturation behavior with an apparent Km of 0.32 mm. For net oxidative phosphorylation under similar conditions, but with a hexokinase-glucose trap present, the apparent Km for ADP is 0.58 mm. The ADP analogue, adenosine methylene diphosphonate, is not detectably phosphorylated, does not stimulate the Pi ⇄ HOH exchange in the absence of ADP, and does not inhibit the exchange in the presence of ADP. The submitochondrial particles show the presence of an oligomycin and a 2,4-dinitrophenol-sensitive ADP ⇄ ATP exchange. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the Pi ⇄ HOH exchange results from dynamic reversal of ATP formation at the catalytic site, and that in the phosphorylation reaction the first covalent compound formed from Pi or ADP is ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1581924901,"Abstract Sodium borohydride reduction of native trypsinogen produced a specific cleavage of only 1 of the 6 disulfide bonds. The partially reduced protein was converted to the 14C-carboxymethyl derivative, and tryptic hydrolysis produced two unique peptides in 72% yield which contained the radioactive label. The composition of the two purified peptides from a completely carboxymethylated sample agreed with the amino acid sequence around Disulfide 179 to 203. (Residue numbers refer to the amino acid sequence of trypsinogen.) Activation of carboxymethyl trypsinogen with trypsin and with enterokinase formed almost fully active molecules toward the active site titrant p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidinobenzoate. However, the rate of activation of the modified zymogen was much lower than with trypsinogen. Furthermore, the relative activity of the modified enzyme toward synthetic ester substrates was no greater than one-fifth of the normal rate. Disulfide 179 to 203 is the disulfide loop containing the active site serine of trypsin, and the altered enzyme activity suggests that a small change occurred in the orientation of amino acid residues which are part of the active site."

The S0.5 was estimated to be 1.5 x 10-3 m for UMP and 0.74 x 10-3 m for CMP. The purified enzyme preparation is stable for at least 2 weeks at 4° when stored at a concentration of 0.2 mg of protein per ml; 3-fold dilution results in rapid inactivation. The enzyme is inhibited by CDP, UDP, and ADP, and by high levels of ATP or Mg++. Kinetic studies suggest that ADP inhibition is competitive with ATP, and that CDP and UDP compete with the analogous monophosphate substrates. It appears that there may be two binding sites for UMP, but that CMP may bind at only one of them."
https://openalex.org/W1547223510,"Cholesterol was biosynthesized from (3R,2R)-(2-3H)(2-14C)-mevalonic acid. The cholesterol was degraded appropriately, and the presence and stereochemistry of three tritium atoms in the cholesterol nucleus were deduced. 5α-Cholestan-3-one, derived from the cholesterol, was dehydrogenated with dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone to 5α-cholest-1-en-3-one, a reaction involving loss of the 1α and 2β axial hydrogens, without loss of tritium. Oxidation of the 5α-cholest-1-en-3-one to 1,2-seco-A-norcholestan-1,2-dioic acid was accompanied by removal of tritium. Thus, it was concluded that tritium having the β configuration was present at C-1 in the cholesterol. The photolytic conversion of the cholesterol to 5α-hydroperoxycholest-6-en-3β-ol, which occurs with the stereospecific removal of the 7α hydrogen, proceeded without loss of tritium. Tritium was, however, lost when the hydroperoxide was converted to cholest-5-en-3β-ol-7-one. Hence, the presence of tritium at C-7 in the β configuration was inferred. The presence of α-oriented tritium at C-15 was indicated when progesterone, derived from the enzymatic side chain cleavage of the cholesterol, was converted microbiologically to pregn-4-en-12β,15α-diol-3,20-dione with loss of tritium. 15β-3H-Progesterone was synthesized and subjected to the same microorganism, giving the 12β,15α-diol, with retention of tritium, thereby indicating the validity of the approach. In addition to the three labels located at carbon atoms 1, 7, and 15, the presence of two further tritium atoms was indicated. It is assumed that these are located at carbon atoms 22 and 26. In summary, we have shown that during the transformation from lanosterol to cholesterol the 2-pro-R hydrogen of mevalonic acid at C-1 retains its β configuration, at C-7 is inverted from the α to the β orientation, and at C-15 is inverted from the β to the α configuration. It follows that the proton originating from the 2-pro-S hydrogen of mevalonic acid is lost at both carbon atoms 7 and 15."
https://openalex.org/W2057074212,Microinjections of carbachol (carbamylcholine chloride) into the amygdaloid complex of rats produced behavioral and electrophysiological seizures which subsided within 24 hours. A persisting functional change caused a deficit in avoidance learning 1 to 3 weeks after the seizure. A cholinergic system is implicated by the fact that cholinergic blockade (scopolamine) of the amygdala during training reversed the effects of the seizures induced by carbachol.
https://openalex.org/W1587959600,"Abstract Subcellular fractions of the water mold, Blastocladiella emersonii, catalyze the synthesis of a glycogen-like polysaccharide. Substrate (UDP-glucose) kinetics are Michaelian in the absence or presence of glucose-6-P. Exogenous glycogen does not affect the reaction. Glucose-6-P stimulates the reaction in a cooperative manner. It increases the Vmax of the reaction without affecting the Km for UDP-glucose. The degree of stimulation varies according to the phase of the life cycle. For zoospores, stimulation can be as high as 90-fold; for growing cells, it is around 4-fold only. The reaction is inhibited by nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives. Competitive inhibitors are UDP, ADP-glucose, and GDP-glucose. Noncompetitive inhibitors are ATP, ADP, GTP, and GDP. In the absence of glucose-6-P, the kinetic effects of the noncompetitive inhibitors are those expected of allosteric effectors. Glucose-6-P can completely reverse the inhibition by ATP, and, in a purely kinetic sense, glucose-6-P and ATP behave as antagonists. Neither glucose-6-P nor ATP bring about stable changes in the enzyme; their effects are easily reversed by the removal of the respective effector. ATP is effective at concentrations which are probably physiological and it is envisaged as an omnipresent allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme in vivo. The major effects of glucose-6-P in vitro, both as an activator and as a reliever of ATP inhibition, occur over fairly low concentrations (up to ∼0.5 mm). As has previously been suggested for yeast, we propose that, in B. emersonii, glycogen synthesis is regulated in a major way by the intracellular concentration of glucose-6-P."

https://openalex.org/W1536807211,"Abstract The incorporation of both 18O and 32P from labeled inorganic phosphate into ATP during steady state phosphorylation catalyzed by high concentrations of chloroplast fragments at low light intensities was linear with time to at least 3 min. This linearity was maintained from 2 to over 200 µmoles of ATP synthesized per µmole of cytochrome f present. If the pathway of oxygen to HOH is the same in the ATP ⇄ HOH exchange and in net ATP synthesis catalyzed by chloroplasts and if it involves an oxygen-containing intermediate, a detectable lag in incorporation of 18O as compared with 32P from Pi into ATP would be expected to occur. The sensitivity of the experiments was such that an intermediate pool of about 3 oxygen atoms per mole of cytochrome f might have been detected, but uncertainties are such that a larger pool could exist. The experiments make unlikely participation of a phosphorylated intermediate at the same level. The results warrant additional consideration of the possibility that the path of oxygen from Pi to HOH in photophosphorylation is direct."

https://openalex.org/W1504231304,"Abstract Lactose and neuramin lactose were produced by incubating subcellular particles from rat mammary gland in a system containing glucose, uridine diphosphate galactose, and cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid. The Km values for glucose in the synthesis of neuramin lactose were fairly constant for three similarly prepared enzyme preparations (0.25, 0.17, and 0.22 mm), but were widely dispersed in the synthesis of lactose (0.93, 1.8, and 18 mm). For UDP-galactose the Km value in the synthesis of neuramin lactose was 0.01 mm; in the synthesis of lactose it was 0.15 mm. The above mentioned system for the synthesis of neuramin lactose was compared with another in which lactose substituted for UDP-galactose plus glucose. The Km value for lactose was 5.6 mm. The Km value for CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid in the system containing UDP-galactose plus glucose was 0.066 mm. The rate of production of neuramin lactose in the system containing lactose was lower than in the system containing UDP-galactose plus glucose. In the latter system an intermediate particle-lactose complex was isolated by centrifugation; on incubation of this complex with CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid, neuramin lactose was produced. The formation of this intermediate complex is probably common for the synthesis of lactose and neuramin lactose; on addition of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid to a system synthesizing lactose, neuramin lactose was produced while corresponding amounts of lactose disappeared. No indication was obtained that the enzyme system which produces neuramin lactose from UDP-galactose plus glucose could be solubilized. No success was achieved in attempts to separate the particles which synthesize lactose from those which synthesize neuramin lactose from UDP-galactose plus glucose. The neuramin lactose produced from lactose and that produced from UDP-galactose plus glucose were chromatographically identical."
https://openalex.org/W1493864561,"Abstract Factors influencing synthetic rates by highly purified RNA polymerase from Micrococcus luteus with single and double stranded homopolymer templates have been investigated. The results indicate different reaction mechanisms depending on the number of strands of the template. Double stranded homopolymer templates show typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to the nucleoside triphosphate concentration whereas single stranded homopolynucleotides show sigmoidal kinetics. Double stranded deoxyribosyl templates are also affected less by lower temperatures than single stranded deoxyribosyl templates, suggesting that melting of the DNA template is not rate-limiting in this system. The reactions directed by single and double stranded templates also differ in their response to manganese concentration. For AMP incorporation, single stranded templates show a sharp manganese optimum whereas double stranded templates show a broad optimum. For uridine monophosphate incorporation, both single and double stranded templates show a sharp optimum. These results indicate functions for manganese other than in the formation of a nucleoside triphosphate-manganese complex. It is suggested that the results reflect a rate-limiting step involving product release (i.e. translation of the product from the active site of the enzyme) and that release is inhibited by high manganese concentrations. The sigmoidal dependence of the reactions directed by single stranded templates upon substrate concentration indicates a concentration-dependent interaction between the substrate and some other component of the reaction. This component is not manganese since maintaining a stoichiometric ratio between Mn++ and ATP in the r(U)n-directed reaction does not completely abolish the shape of the curve. Further, several lines of evidence suggest that the stacking interaction between the nucleoside triphosphate substrate and the template also does not account for the shape of the curve. Only the presence of a second template strand eliminates the sigmoidal profile of the substrate curves."
https://openalex.org/W1582431708,"Abstract The optical rotatory dispersion curves of diketopiperazines of l-serine, l-alanine, l-lysine, and l-valine in water and urea solutions were determined. Urea reduces the absolute value of the specific rotations at any wave length. The effect of the solvent medium on the respective optical activities increases in order: serine l alanine l lysine l valine, the percentage decrease in specific rotation of l-serine diketopiperazine on addition of urea being very small. When l-valylglycine diketopiperazine solutions were investigated, the optical activity appeared to be almost insensitive to the addition of urea. The results are discussed in terms of inter- or intramolecular or both hydrophobic interactions which depend on the nonpolar character of the respective side chains. Implications of the probable influence of the side chains conformational mobility on the optical activity of these materials are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2080656615,"Calcareous particles present in Pacific waters at depths of 50 to 3500 meters were collected by filtering seawater through spongin matrix. The specific activity of carbon-14 could be measured in two of these collections from depths of 2300 and 3500 meters. The ratios of carbon-14 to carbon-12 correspond to values observed in surface waters in recent years as a result of the addition of manmade carbon-14, thus indicating that the calcareous particles resulted from recent biological productivity. The results are related to the mean settling rates and the sizes and dissolution rates of biogenic calcareous particles in transit through a seawater column."

Also, the specific activities remain distinctly elevated through the first 9 days of age; thus, the competence for premature synthesis of tryptophan oxygenase is confirmed in neonatal rats."
