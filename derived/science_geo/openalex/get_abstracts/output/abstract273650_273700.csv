https://openalex.org/W1984700587,"Formaldehyde could have been produced by photochemical reactions in Earth's primitive atmosphere, at a time when it consisted mainly of molecular nitrogen, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Removal of formaldehyde from the atmosphere by precipitation can provide a source of organic carbon to the oceans at the rate of 1011 moles per year. Subsequent reactions of formaldehyde in primeval aquatic environments would have implications for the abiotic synthesis of complex organic molecules and the origin of life."
https://openalex.org/W2027345806,"The hydrogen concentration in soil gas has been measured in the area around the Yamasaki Fault, one of the active faults in southwestern Japan. Degassing of a significant amount of hydrogen (up to more than 3 percent by volume) has been observed for sites along the fault zone. The hydrogen concentration in soil gas at sites away from the fault zone was about 0.5 part per million, almost the same as that found in the atmosphere. The spatial distribution of sites with high hydrogen concentrations is quite systematic. A hypothesis on the production of hydrogen by fault movements is postulated."
https://openalex.org/W2065054787,Adult females of Drosophila melanogaster show a bimodal daily rhythmicity in the function of neurosecretory and corpus allatum cells. This result was obtained by measuring the size of the nuclei and determining the pattern of neurohormone secretion.

Study of such evolutionarily reduced female gametophytes may aid in elucidating the structural basis for genetic transmission of plastids and mitochondria in flowering plants."
https://openalex.org/W1991441073,The equilibrium pressure of the calcite-aragonite transition has been determined near 100 degrees C and is 4.35 kilobars. These data are in agreement with earlier work but conflict with the most recent determination by Simmons and Bell.
https://openalex.org/W2066863061,"An epidemic of blue mold of tobacco unexpectedly attacked crops in the United States and Canada in 1979, causing an estimated loss of almost a quarter billion dollars. The disease, caused by a fungus, apparently started in Cuba where half the crop was destroyed in 1979 and 90 percent in 1980. Control of blue mold is difficult and expensive. Resistant cultivars become susceptible within a few years. A therapeutic fungicide, metalaxyl, gives efficient control, but resistant strains of the fungus may soon appear. Blue mold is an international problem that will require the collaboration of scientists, governments, and Industries for an adequate solution."
https://openalex.org/W2081438616,"The presence of sterols in recent fresh-water sediments was confirmed and, for the first time, sterols were found to be widely distributed throughout recent marine sediments. Quantities ranged from 60 to 300 parts of cholesterol carbon per million parts of organic carbon in the sediments. No correlation of sterol content with environment or depth of burial in the sediment was apparent."

https://openalex.org/W1992402411,"An approach for factoring the effects of a planetary thermal history into a predicted set of crater statistics for an icy satellite is developed and forms the basis for subsequent data inversion studies. The key parameter is a thermal evolution-dependent critical time for which craters of a particular size forming earlier do not contribute to present-day statistics. An example is given for the satellite Ganymede and the effect of the thermal history is easily seen in the resulting predicted crater statistics. A preliminary comparison with the data, subject to the uncertainties in ice rheology and impact flux history, suggests a surface age of 3.8 Ã— 109 years and a radionuclide abundance of 0.3 times the chondritic value."

https://openalex.org/W2081569949,"The radiation dosage from secondary neutrons as well as from primary and secondary protons in the earth's atmosphere during solar particle events is calculated as a function of the solar proton flux, atmospheric depth, and geomagnetic-cutoff rigidity. The dosage in rems from secondary neutrons exceeds the dosage from protons below 30 g/cm(2) of residual atmosphere. Neutron dosages in rads are less than the dosage from primary protons at all depths above 100 g/cm(2). The maximum neutron dose to travelers in supersonic aircraft during solar particle events of the magnitude observed during the last solar cycle would be of the order of I rem."

https://openalex.org/W2035596607,Optically birefringent microstructures are formed within fluoride films that are produced on uranium dioxide by hydrofluorination. The positive molar volume change of the reaction produces nonuniform tensile and compressive stresses around sites of surface roughness which result in optical double refraction.
