https://openalex.org/W2067041321,"Rice ( Oryza sativa ), a major staple food, is usually milled to remove the oil-rich aleurone layer that turns rancid upon storage, especially in tropical areas. The remaining edible part of rice grains, the endosperm, lacks several essential nutrients, such as provitamin A. Thus, predominant rice consumption promotes vitamin A deficiency, a serious public health problem in at least 26 countries, including highly populated areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Recombinant DNA technology was used to improve its nutritional value in this respect. A combination of transgenes enabled biosynthesis of provitamin A in the endosperm."
https://openalex.org/W2054930781,A puzzling feature of the neocortex is the rich array of inhibitory interneurons. Multiple neuron recordings revealed numerous electrophysiological-anatomical subclasses of neocortical gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) interneurons and three types of GABAergic synapses. The type of synapse used by each interneuron to influence its neighbors follows three functional organizing principles. These principles suggest that inhibitory synapses could shape the impact of different interneurons according to their specific spatiotemporal patterns of activity and that GABAergic interneuron and synapse diversity may enable combinatorial inhibitory effects in the neocortex.
https://openalex.org/W2157392485,"A deep-sea temperature record for the past 50 million years has been produced from the magnesium/calcium ratio (Mg/Ca) in benthic foraminiferal calcite. The record is strikingly similar in form to the corresponding benthic oxygen isotope (delta(18)O) record and defines an overall cooling of about 12 degrees C in the deep oceans with four main cooling periods. Used in conjunction with the benthic delta(18)O record, the magnesium temperature record indicates that the first major accumulation of Antarctic ice occurred rapidly in the earliest Oligocene (34 million years ago) and was not accompanied by a decrease in deep-sea temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2068493779,The real-space dynamics in a model system of colloidal hard spheres was studied by means of time-resolved fluorescence confocal scanning microscopy. Direct experimental evidence for the presence of dynamical heterogeneities in a dense liquid was obtained from an analysis of particle trajectories in two-dimensional slices of the bulk sample. These heterogeneities manifest themselves as a non-Gaussian probability distribution of particle displacements and also affect the onset of long-time diffusive behavior.
https://openalex.org/W1979364624,"The cyclic water hexamer, a higher energy isomer than the cage structure previously characterized in the gas phase, was formed in liquid helium droplets and studied with infrared spectroscopy. This isomer is formed selectively as a result of unique cluster growth processes in liquid helium. The experimental results indicate that the cyclic hexamer is formed by insertion of water molecules into smaller preformed cyclic complexes and that the rapid quenching provided by the liquid helium inhibits its rearrangement to the more stable cage structure."
https://openalex.org/W2058459535,"A mass imbalance exists in Earth for Nb, Ta, and possibly Ti: continental crust and depleted mantle both have subchondritic Nb/Ta, Nb/La, and Ti/Zr, which requires the existence of an additional reservoir with superchondritic ratios, such as refractory eclogite produced by slab melting. Trace element compositions of minerals in xenolithic eclogites derived from cratonic lithospheric mantle show that rutile dominates the budget of Nb and Ta in the eclogites and imparts a superchondritic Nb/Ta, Nb/La, and Ti/Zr to the whole rocks. About 1 to 6 percent by weight of eclogite is required to solve the mass imbalance in the silicate Earth, and this reservoir must have an Nb concentration >/= 2 parts per million, Nb/La >/= 1.2, and Nb/Ta between 19 and 37-values that overlap those of the xenolithic eclogites. As the mass of eclogite in the continental lithosphere is significantly lower than this, much of this material may reside in the lower mantle, perhaps as deep as the core-mantle boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2088473157,"Abscisic acid (ABA) stimulates stomatal closure and thus supports water conservation by plants during drought. Mass spectrometry-generated peptide sequence information was used to clone a Vicia faba complementary DNA, AAPK, encoding a guard cell-specific ABA-activated serine-threonine protein kinase (AAPK). Expression in transformed guard cells of AAPK altered by one amino acid (lysine 43 to alanine 43) renders stomata insensitive to ABA-induced closure by eliminating ABA activation of plasma membrane anion channels. This information should allow cell-specific, targeted biotechnological manipulation of crop water status."
https://openalex.org/W2042457404,"Fast and reliable activation of inhibitory interneurons is critical for the stability of cortical neuronal networks. Active conductances in dendrites may facilitate interneuron activation, but direct experimental evidence was unavailable. Patch-clamp recordings from dendrites of hippocampal oriens-alveus interneurons revealed high densities of voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels. Simultaneous recordings from dendrites and somata suggested that action potential initiation occurs preferentially in the axon with long threshold stimuli, but can be shifted to somatodendritic sites when brief stimuli are applied. After initiation, action potentials propagate over the somatodendritic domain with constant amplitude, high velocity, and reliability, even during high-frequency trains."
https://openalex.org/W2040838736,"Signal transduction mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Slt2 pathway is essential to maintain the cell wall integrity in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Stimulation of MAPK pathways results in activation by phosphorylation of conserved threonine and tyrosine residues of MAPKs. We have used an antibody that specifically recognizes dually phosphorylated Slt2 to gain insight into the activation and modulation of signaling through the cell integrity pathway. We show that caffeine and vanadate activate this pathway in the absence of osmotic stabilization. The lack of the putative cell surface sensor Mid2 prevents vanadate- but not caffeine-induced Slt2 phosphorylation. Disruption of the Rho1-GTPase-activating protein genes <i>SAC7</i>and <i>BEM2</i> leads to constitutive Slt2 activation, indicating their involvement as negative regulators of the pathway. MAPK kinases also seem to participate in signaling regulation, Mkk1 playing a greater role than Mkk2 in signal transmission to Slt2. Additionally, one of the phosphatases involved in Slt2 dephosphorylation is likely to be the dual specificity phosphatase Msg5, since overexpression of<i>MSG5</i> in a <i>sac7</i>Δ mutant eliminates the high Slt2 phosphorylation, and disruption of <i>MSG5</i> in wild type cells results in increased phospho-Slt2 levels. These data present the first evidence for a negative regulation of the cell integrity pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2066829203,"BNIP3 (formerly NIP3) is a pro-apoptotic, mitochondrial protein classified in the Bcl-2 family based on limited sequence homology to the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain and COOH-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain. BNIP3 expressed in yeast and mammalian cells interacts with survival promoting proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and CED-9. Typically, the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologues mediates Bcl-2/Bcl-XLheterodimerization and confers pro-apoptotic activity. Deletion mapping of BNIP3 excluded its BH3-like domain and identified the NH2 terminus (residues 1–49) and TM domain as critical for Bcl-2 heterodimerization, and either region was sufficient for Bcl-XL interaction. Additionally, the removal of the BH3-like domain in BNIP3 did not diminish its killing activity. The TM domain of BNIP3 is critical for homodimerization, pro-apoptotic function, and mitochondrial targeting. Several TM domain mutants were found to disrupt SDS-resistant BNIP3 homodimerization but did not interfere with its killing activity or mitochondrial localization. Substitution of the BNIP3 TM domain with that of cytochromeb 5 directed protein expression to nonmitochondrial sites and still promoted apoptosis and heterodimerization with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. We propose that BNIP3 represents a subfamily of Bcl-2-related proteins that functions without a typical BH3 domain to regulate apoptosis from both mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial sites by selective Bcl-2/Bcl-XL interactions.

The core components of the cell death pathway were originally identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans(2.Horvitz H.R. Shaham S. Hengartner M.O. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant.

Nature. 1992; 356: 494-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, entire gene families have evolved to resemble the C. elegans death genes. The mammalian counterpart of CED-3 is the family of caspases, which are cysteine proteases that cleave after aspartic acid residues (5.Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G.

The Bcl-2 family of genes originally identified as repressors of cell death share structural and functional similarity to CED-9 (9.Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins acts at a central decision point in the apoptotic pathway. The family is divided into two functional groups: 1) anti-apoptotic members (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, A1, Bcl-W, and CED-9), which suppress cell death triggered by a diverse array of stimuli, and 2) pro-apoptotic members include Bax, Bak, Bcl-XS, Diva, and Mtd/Bok as well as the BH3-only subfamily described below, which antagonize the activity of pro-survival proteins and promote apoptosis in transfected cells (10.Adams J.M.

The intracellular distribution of these proteins is primarily to the outer mitochondrial membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 and nuclear envelope anchored by a COOH-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain (10.Adams J.M.

Other family members remain in the cytosol or loosely associated with the mitochondria until the delivery of a death signal and then translocate (13.Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A.

Early models suggested that the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-related proteins and their propensity to form homo- and heterodimers determined whether a cell lived or died (18.Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in Bcl-2 exhibit developmental defects characteristic of increased cell death, with the majority dying at a few weeks of age (19.Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). The absence of Bcl-XL as well as its C. elegans orthologue, CED-9, leads to embryonic lethality (4.Hengartner M.O.

Sequence alignment of the Bcl-2-related proteins highlights four regions of homology designated Bcl-2 homology domains 1, 2, 3, and 4 (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4) (21.Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

The tertiary structure of the Bcl-XL monomer reveals the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains in close proximity to create a hydrophobic pocket (25.Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E.

Further analysis of Bcl-XL complexed to the Bak BH3 peptide demonstrates electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic pocket of Bcl-XL and the amphipathic α-helix of the Bak-BH3 peptide (26.Sattler M.

Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). The interactions between pro- and anti-apoptotic members have been extensively detailed in yeast two-hybrid or in vitro binding assays as well as by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) of membrane-solubilized mammalian cells (24.Zha H.

A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Earlier mutagenesis studies of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL determined that BH1 and BH2 domains are critical for heterodimerizing with pro-apoptotic molecules Bax and Bak and sustaining their ability to suppress cell death (21.Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 29.Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Therefore, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XLmutants that fail to bind Bax or Bak also fail to protect against apoptosis (21.Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 28.Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). However, mutants of Bcl-XL have been identified that no longer bind to Bax or Bak yet retain their anti-apoptotic activity (29.Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 30.Minn A.J. Kettlun C.S. Liang H. Kelekar A. Vander H.M. Chang B.S. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 632-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Similar examples are evident among the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-related proteins. For example, BH3 mutants of Bax have been identified that are unable to heterodimerize with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL but induce cell death (31.Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Merino R. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22764-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32.Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The observation of mutants that have lost their ability to heterodimerize yet still retain their cell death function indicates that the two roles of these proteins are separable. Studies in Bcl-2- and Bax-deficient mice also show that these proteins can function independently of one another (34.Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The importance of the BH3 domain in mediating heterodimerization with pro-survival proteins and facilitating apoptosis is underscored by the identification of BH3-only containing proteins: Bik, Blk, Hrk, BimL, Bad, Bid, and the C. elegans, EGL-1 (10.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar, 11.Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev.

Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Earlier studies of BNIP3 suggested that the removal of the proposed BH3 domain reduced its ability to interact with Bcl-XL or E1B 19K and resulted in a partial loss of its cell death-inducing activity (36.Yasuda M. Theodorakis P. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic activity of BNIP3 is also dependent on its TM domain, because its removal completely ablated apoptotic activity (35.Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S.

In this report, we have characterized the regions within BNIP3 that are required for Bcl-2 family interaction and cell death. We have demonstrated that BNIP3 lacking its BH3-like domain is still able to heterodimerize with Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or CED-9 and efficiently induce cell death and that this interaction occurs at the NH2 and COOH termini of the BNIP3 protein. Furthermore, although the BNIP3 TM domain targets it to the mitochondrion, the induction of apoptosis is nearly as efficient when BNIP3 is directed to nonmitochondrial sites following TM domain swapping. These data demonstrate that BNIP3 is part of a functionally unique subset of the Bcl-2 family, which also includes Mtd/Bok (42.Inohara N. Ekhterae D. Garcia I. Carrio R. Merino J. Merry A. Chen S.

Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Briefly, human BNIP3 cDNA was used as template with appropriate primers to incorporate suitable restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify full-length BNIP3 (1–194) and deletion mutants: BNIP3ΔN (Δ1–49), BNIP3ΔTM2 (Δ164–194), BNIP3ΔC (Δ184–194), and BNIP3ΔN;ΔTM (Δ1–49; Δ164–194). Following restriction digestion, the inserts were ligated in-frame into modified pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) expression vectors with a 5′- or 3′-T7 epitope tag. BNIP3 deletion mutants, BNIP3ΔTM1 (Δ164–184), BNIP3Δ179–185, BNIP3ΔBH3 (Δ104–119), and BNIP3ΔCD (Δ112–130) and point mutants, BNIP3(L179→S) and BNIP3(G180→E) were generated by PCR using splice overlap extension and site-directed mutagenesis (45.Dieffenbach C.W. Dveklsler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 603-612Google Scholar), respectively, and then ligated into the appropriate expression vector. Chimeric BNIP3 constructs were generated using the splice overlap extension method (45.Dieffenbach C.W. Dveklsler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 603-612Google Scholar) whereby 5′- and 3′-primers were designed to amplify BNIP3 (residues 1–163) and TM domains of human Bcl-2 (BclTM, residues 219–239) or rat hepatic cytochrome b 5 (Cb5TM, residues 100–134). Specifically, the 3′-primer of BNIP3 and 5′-primer of BclTM or Cb5TM contained complementary regions. Following PCR to amplify BNIP3 and BclTM or Cb5TM, aliquots of the two PCR products were combined to generate the recombinant gene template (BNIP3-BclTM or BNIP-Cb5TM) through the overlapping complementary regions. The overlap was extended through PCR, and the recombinant gene was further amplified using 5′- and 3′-primers to the entire recombinant gene, which incorporated restriction sites suitable for cloning into pcDNA3. Other plasmids were kindly provided as follows: pcDNA3-Bcl-2 (Dr. Lorrie Kirshenbaum, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada) and pcDNA3-myc-Bcl-XL (Dr. Gordon Shore, McGill University, Montreal, PQ, Canada). For yeast transformations, expression plasmids were constructed employing a similar strategy whereby BNIP3 and deletion mutants were ligated in-frame to the GAL4 binding domain of pGBT9 (46.Bartel P. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar) or to the GAL4 activating domain of pACTII (47.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Dr. Gabriel Núñez (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) kindly provided the yeast two-hybrid vectors pGBT8-Bcl-2, pGBT8-Bcl-XL and pGBT8-CED-9. The nucleotide sequence of all constructs was confirmed on an ABI-310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Polyclonal and monoclonal BNIP3 antibodies were raised against amino acid residues 1–163 (BNIP3ΔTM2) of human BNIP3. BNIP3ΔTM2 was PCR amplified incorporating appropriate 5′ and 3′ restriction sites to ligate into GST-containing expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain HB101 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma-Aldrich). Rabbit polyclonal anti-BNIP3 antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with purified BNIP3ΔTM2-GST fusion protein. For monoclonal anti-BNIP3 antibody, mice were immunized with BNIP3ΔTM2 cleaved from GST and formulated in RIBI adjuvant (Ribi Immunochem Research Inc., Hamilton, MT) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Splenocytes were collected from immunoreactive mice and fused by polyethylene glycol 4000 to murine myeloma cell line P3-X63-Ag8.653, followed by selection with hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium. Positive hybridomas were screened using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blotting. Yeast strain KGY37 was co-transformed with binding domain and activating domain expression plasmids as indicated in the figures. Transformants were grown on synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan and leucine. Protein-protein interactions activating the HIS3 reporter gene were determined by growth on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine in the presence of 0.5–1 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (48.Gietz R.D. Triggs-Raine B. Robbins A. Graham K.C. Woods R.A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 172: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The relative β-galactosidase activity of interacting proteins was measured by filter lifting colonies followed by X-gal staining or by assaying the hydrolysis of ortho-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside according to the manufacturer's instructions. Culture dishes (100 mm) were seeded with 2 × 106 293T human embryonic kidney cells 24 h prior to transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were co-transfected with indicated expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The total amount of DNA was maintained at 15 μg. After 12 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 1 volume of 0.2% Nonidet P-40 isotonic buffer with freshly added protease inhibitors (100 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mmNaCl, 0.2% Nonidet-P40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following sonication three times at 10 s, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cellular debris. Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 30 min and then incubated for 2 h with an equal volume of binding buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% Nonidet-P40) and hamster monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 (Clone 6C8, PharMingen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) or mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (Clone 9E10, gift from Dr. Jim Wright, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada). Immune complexes were captured with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads for an additional hour, centrifuged, and washed four times in equal volumes of lysis and binding buffer, and then solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed on Laemlli 10–12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-BNIP3, mouse monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 (Clone 4D7, PharMingen), or rabbit polyclonal anti-Bcl-XL (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) antibody. The immune complexes were detected by horseradish-conjugated secondary antibody and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression plasmids encoding BNIP3 and its mutants cloned into pcDNA3 were used as templates for in vitro transcription/translation in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the TnT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For co-IP, equivalent amounts ofin vitro protein products were incubated with 3 μg of purified Bcl-2 protein and hamster monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibody in 250 μl of 0.2% Nonidet-P40 IP buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Nonidet-P40) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were captured with protein A-Sepharose 4B for an additional hour, washed four times in excess IP buffer, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. In vitroprotein products or solubilized immune complexes were separated by Laemlli 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed with 25% 2-propanol and 10% acetic acid for 20 min, followed by an additional 20 min in Amplify solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then analyzed by autoradiography. To detect Bcl-2 protein in each co-IP reaction, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Rat-1 and Rat-1/Bcl-2 fibroblasts or MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were transfected as described (35.Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) with pcDNA3 constructs T7-BNIP3 and T7-BNIP3ΔBH3. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and then stained with mouse monoclonal anti-T7 (Novagen, Madison, WI) followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.). Transfected apoptotic cells were enumerated by altered nuclear morphology following Hoechst dye staining. In total, 200–300 transfected cells/sample were evaluated using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. For the β-galactosidase cell death assay, 1 × 105 293T cells seeded in 6-well 35-mm plates were co-transfected with 0.75 μg of indicated expression plasmid and 0.2 μg of pcDNA3-β-galactosidase in duplicate using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were then fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde and washed three times with 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline and stained in X-gal buffer as described to detect β-galactosidase expression (49.Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The percentage of dying cells was calculated by assessing the number of rounded, condensed, blue cells in the total population of flat, blue cells. MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were transfected with indicated expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE reagent for 5 h, and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde 24 h post-transfection. Cells were co-stained with mouse monoclonal anti-BNIP3 antibody to detect expression of BNIP3, BNIP3-BclTM, and BNIP3-Cb5TM and rabbit polyclonal anti-heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) antibody (gift from Dr. Radney Gupta, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada) and visualized by goat anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated antibody (Bio-Can Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada) and goat anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated antibody using a confocal fluorescence microscope equipped with an argon laser and dual detectors (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The images were acquired with Image Space software using a 60× objective lens and transferred to graphics program for printing. BNIP3 was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using E1B 19K as bait (50.Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system we have been able to confirm these interactions and have shown interaction of BNIP3 with CED-9 (TableI). Yeast transformants co-expressing BNIP3 with Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or CED-9 activated both thelacZ and HIS3 reporter genes, respectively, as determined by relative β-galactosidase expression and growth in the absence of histidine.

This nonstoichiometric oxide forms by reaction of dioxide with water and by water-catalyzed reaction of dioxide with oxygen. The PuO(2) + H(2)O reaction rate is 0.27 nanomoles per meter squared per hour at 25 degrees C; the activation energy at 25 degrees to 350 degrees C is 39 kilojoules per mole. Slow kinetics and a low lattice parameter-composition dependence for fluorite-related PuO(2+x) are consistent with a failure to observe the phase in earlier studies. Perplexing aspects of plutonium oxide chemistry can now be explained."

Here, the theory of electromagnetic wave propagation in diffusive media is combined with information theory to show how interference affects the information transmission rate between antenna arrays. Nontrivial dependencies of the information capacity on the nature of the antenna arrays are found, such as the dimensionality of the arrays and their direction with respect to the local scattering medium. This approach provides a physical picture for understanding the importance of scattering in the transfer of information through wireless communications."
https://openalex.org/W1520156967,"CD105 (endoglin), a receptor for transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), is highly expressed in tissue-cultured, activated endothelial cells in vitro and in tissues undergoing angiogenesis in vivo. The absence of CD105 in knockout mice leads to their death from defective vascular development, but the role of CD105 in the modulation of angiogenesis has not been elucidated. TGFbeta1 is a well-recognized regulator of angiogenesis. Using an antisense approach, we have shown that inhibition of CD105 protein translation in cultured human endothelial cells enhances the ability of TGFbeta1 to suppress growth and migration in these cells. The ability of endothelial cells to form capillary tubes was evaluated by the use of a 3-dimensional collagen matrix system where TGFbeta1 not only reduced the length of capillary-like structures, but also caused massive mortality in CD105-deficient cells compared to control cultures. These results provide direct evidence that CD105 antagonizes the inhibitory effects of TGFbeta1 on human vascular endothelial cells and that normal cellular levels of CD105 are required for the formation of new blood vessels."
https://openalex.org/W1538521820,"Previous findings have provided strong evidence that myostatin functions as a negative regulator of muscle mass during development and growth. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that myostatin may serve a similar function in fully differentiated muscle experiencing modified loading. Our findings show that myostatin expression can be modulated in fully differentiated, nonpathological skeletal muscle in a manner that is inversely related to changes in muscle mass. Atrophy of rat hind limb muscles induced by 10 days of unloading resulted in a 16% decrease in plantaris mass, a 110% increase in myostatin mRNA, and a 37% increase in myostatin protein. Immunohistochemical observations showed a detectable increase in myostatin concentration at myotendinous junctions during muscle unloading. The concentration of myostatin mRNA and protein returned to values not significantly different from ambulatory controls after 4 days of reloading, during which time plantaris mass also returned to control values. However, the results also show that periods of 30 min of daily muscle loading during the unloading period were sufficient to prevent significant losses of muscle mass caused by unloading, although myostatin mRNA still showed a 55% increase in concentration. Thus, significant increases in myostatin expression are not sufficient for muscle mass loss, although muscle mass loss during unloading is accompanied by increases in myostatin."

Experiments with four types of invertebrates showed that feeding behavior and dietary uptake control bioaccumulation of cadmium, silver, nickel, and zinc. Metal concentrations in animal tissue correlated with metal concentrations extracted from sediments, but not with metal in porewater, across a range of reactive sulfide concentrations, from 0.5 to 30 micromoles per gram. These results contradict the notion that metal bioavailability in sediments is controlled by geochemical equilibration of metals between porewater and reactive sulfides, a proposed basis for regulatory criteria for metals."
https://openalex.org/W2039435798,"BRCA1 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that has been classified as a tumor suppressor based on the fact that women carrying a mutated copy of the BRCA1 gene are at increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. The association of BRCA1 with RAD51 has led to the hypothesis that BRCA1 is involved in DNA repair. We describe here the generation and analysis of murine embryonic stem (ES) cell lines in which both copies of the murine homologue of the human BRCA1 gene have been disrupted by gene targeting. We show that exogenous DNA introduced into these BRCA1 deficient cells by electroporation is randomly integrated into the genome at a significantly higher rate than in wild type ES cells. In contrast, integration of exogenous DNA by homologous recombination occurs in BRCA1 deficient cells at a significantly lower rate than in wild type controls. When BRCA1 expression is re-established at 5-10% of normal levels by introduction of a Brca1 transgene into BRCA1 deficient ES cells, the frequency of random integration is reduced to wild type levels, although the frequency of homologous recombination is not significantly improved. These results suggest that BRCA1 plays a role in determining the response of cells to double stranded DNA breaks."
https://openalex.org/W1860857195,"Acute renal failure (ARF) in response to ischemia-reperfusion is thought to be associated with neutrophil infiltration. Neutrophil recruitment depends on adhesion molecules, including P-selectin. Our study sought to characterize the role of P-selectin in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) -induced acute renal failure (ARF). In wild-type (wt) and P-selectin-deficient (P-/-) mice (both C57BL/6), ARF was induced by 32 min bilateral renal ischemia, followed by reperfusion (I/R). Wt showed a 12- and 20-fold increase in creatinine at 24 and 48 h after I/R, respectively. Similar changes were seen in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). By contrast, in P-/- creatinine and BUN increased only moderately (fourfold over sham). In wt, renal myeloperoxidase activity, indicating neutrophil infiltration, peaked after 24 h (19-fold over sham). This was significantly attenuated in P-/- (fivefold over sham). Western blot analysis revealed maximum P-selectin expression 12 h after I/R in wt. Immunostaining detected P-selectin in glomerular endothelium and in platelets adherent in glomerular and peritubular vessels. Postischemic injection of P-selectin antibody at 10 min after reperfusion, but not isotype control antibody, protected wt from ARF similar to the protection seen in P-/-. We conclude that blocking P-selectin even after onset of reperfusion protects mice from I/R-induced ARF, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking P-selectin."

The TFPP is responsible for the cleavage and N-methylation (known collectively as processing) of the highly conserved type 4 leader peptide present at the N terminus of the families of secreted proteins known as type 4 prepilins and type 4 prepilin-like proteins (1.Strom M.S. Nunn D.N. Lory S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2404-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Whereas the cleavage of the type 4 leader peptide is a necessary step for secretion of the mature pilin, methylation of the N terminus of the mature pilin is not required for secretion and has no known function (2.Pepe J.C. Lory S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19120-19129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Type 4 pilins are polymerized as the structural subunits of type 4 pili (Tfp), which are surface organelles required for diverse activities that contribute to broad attributes such as genetic transfer, virulence, and environmental persistence of a wide array of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Prototypical examples include microcolony formation mediated by toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP) ofVibrio cholerae, 2Kirn, T. J., Lafferty, M. L., Sandoe, C. M. P., and Taylor, R. K. (2000), Mol.

Microbiol. 1995; 18: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The related type 4 pilin-like proteins partially comprise the main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway in Gram-negative bacteria, also known as the type 2 secretion pathway (6.Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The general secretory pathway is the pathway utilized by the majority of proteins that are secreted outside of Gram-negative bacteria. Such proteins include toxins such as cholera toxin of V. cholerae (7.Sandkvist M. Michel L.O. Hough L.P. Morales V.M. Bagdasarian M. Koomey M. DiRita V.J. Bagdasarian M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6994-7003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.Strom M.S. Nunn D. Lory S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as other enzymes such as pullulanase of Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.Pugsley A.P. Reyss I. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and hemolysin of Aeromonas hydrophila (10.Pepe C.M. Eklund M.W. Strom M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Type 4 pilin-like proteins are also required for natural transformation of Bacillus subtilus (11.Dubnau D. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.Pestova E.V. Morrison D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2701-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The type 4 leader peptide is characterized by several features that are highly conserved, yet differ from those of standard leader peptides. The N-terminal leader that is cleaved from the mature protein is highly charged and immediately precedes a region of approximately 20 residues that are predominantly hydrophobic and are retained within the mature protein. The majority of type 4 prepilins or prepilin-like proteins are designated type 4a, containing leader peptides that are short (∼6 residues). Type 4b preproteins contain a longer leader (∼25 residues). The peptide bond on the prepilin that is hydrolyzed by the TFPP lies between the charged and hydrophobic domains, immediately C-terminal to an invariant glycine. The new N-terminal amino acid that arises upon processing is a N-methylated phenylalanine for type 4a proteins and is typically a N-methylated methionine for type 4b proteins. The TFPPs themselves are integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins with numerous transmembrane domains. The processing reaction has been postulated to occur on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane because of the membrane orientation of the prepilin, the location of all the major nonmembrane peptidase domains, and the likelihood that the cytoplasmically located S-adenosyl methionine would provide an available source of methyl groups for the methylation step of the reaction (13.Strom M.S. Lory S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3181-3188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies on the proteolytic mechanism of the TFPPs have focused on the largest cytoplasmic region of the protein designated cytoplasmic domain 1. These studies were performed on PilD, a prototypic TFPP fromP. aeruginosa. Domain 1 of the PilD peptidase contains two pairs of cysteine residues that are conserved among many members of the TFPP family. Alteration of the 4 highly conserved cysteine residues by substitution of alanine or serine residues resulted in up to an 80–100% reduction of peptidase activity in an in vitroassay. However, the processing defect varied from approximately 0% to 80% for the various mutants in vivo, suggesting that although pilin cleavage was less efficient, it was not abolished (14.Strom M.S. Bergman P. Lory S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15788-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical inhibitor studies supported the notion that the cysteine residues contributed to protease activity and PilD was classified as a cysteine protease, specifically as a member of the C20 family of cysteine proteases (15.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 461-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The retention of partial activity by some of the pilD mutants as well as the subsequent discovery of TFPP's that lack the consensus cysteine residues have brought this mechanism of protease activity into question. For example, the XpsO TFPP of Xanthomonas campestris was characterized and shown to lack all the domain 1 cysteine residues, yet the xpsOgene fully complements a pilD deletion for prepilin processing (16.Hu N.T. Lee P.F. Chen C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Some newer members of the rapidly growing family lack the entire domain 1 region. Analysis of a current TFPP alignment also reveals a complete lack of any conserved histidine residue, a necessary component of the cysteine protease catalytic mechanism (15.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 461-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These observations have led to a revised classification of PilD, and therefore the complete family of TFPPs, to the U12 category of proteases with unknown catalytic mechanism (17.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the study reported here, an approach similar to the comprehensive mutational strategy employed to identify the signal peptidase I active site (18.Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27349-27354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine the active site residues of TcpJ, the TFPP responsible for processing the TcpA type 4 prepilin of V. cholerae. A protein sequence alignment of the TFPP family revealed several highly conserved potential protease active site residues in addition to the two cysteine pairs that exist in this protease family. These include serine, aspartic acid, lysine, and glutamic acid residues, most of which are located in cytoplasmic domains of TFPPs. Mutations in tcpJ corresponding to these positions, as well as a deletion of the entire region encoding cytoplasmic domain 1, were constructed. In vivo activity and in vitroprotease assays indicate that only Asp125 and Asp189, which are completely conserved throughout the entire TFPP family, are absolutely required for protease activity in TcpJ. Chemical protease inhibition studies are consistent with this finding. The mutational analysis was extended to a second TFPP ofV. cholerae, VcpD, which is required for toxin secretion (19.Marsh J.W. Taylor R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1481-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results lead to the conclusion that members of the TFPP family are bilobed aspartic acid proteases and due to their complete insensitivity to pepstatin should be regarded as a novel family of non-pepsin-like acid proteases. These findings allow the rational development of inhibitors with practical therapeutic value. E. coli strains used were K38 (20.Russel M. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and JM109 (21.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J.

A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). E. coli strains were grown in LB at 37 °C. V. Cholerae strains were grown in LB, pH 6.5, at 30 °C to induce expression of TCP. Antibiotics were added to the media when needed at the following concentrations: 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 45 μg/ml kanamycin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The method for membrane preparation was adapted from a previously described cell fractionation protocol (25.Pfau J.D. Taylor R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4724-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 100-ml overnight culture was placed on ice for 20 min, and the cells were then collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 200 mm Tris, pH 8.0, to which 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 msucrose, 2 ml of H2O, 20 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and 20 μl of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) were added. The cell suspension was allowed to incubate on ice for an additional 30 min. 100 μl of 1m MgSO4 was added, and the suspension was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet is resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, sonicated 3 × 15 s at 50% duty, and centrifuged at 5000 × gfor 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 230,000 ×g (60,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor) for 15 min. The resulting pellet, which contained the total membrane fraction, was resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Membrane preparations were prepared from 42 °C grown overnight cultures of E. coliK38, which does not express TcpA, and MK90, which overexpresses TcpA prepilin at elevated temperature. 20 μl of a membrane preparation from K38 and from MK90 were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel alongside a standard of 3 μg of trypsin, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. The stained gel was dried using the Novex gel drying system. The dried gel was scanned by a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI, and densitometry analysis was performed using ImageQuant version 1.2 software. The intensities (measured in pixels) of the 3-μg trypsin band, the TcpA prepilin band (MK90), the corresponding location of the TcpA prepilin band in the TcpA-negative control lane (K38), and an approximately 28-kDa band from both K38 and MK90 were measured while adjusting to a single background value. The mass of the TcpA prepilin present in the MK90 lane was determined by first subtracting the intensity of the corresponding area in the K38 TcpA prepilin-lacking lane. This corrected for the staining intensity of minor protein bands that co-migrate with TcpA prepilin. By comparing the intensity values of the 28-kDa bands from the TcpA-positive and TcpA-negative lanes, a further adjustment was made to the TcpA prepilin value to account for any loading difference between the lanes. The trypsin band intensity was divided by 3 μg to determine an intensity/μg value, which was applied to the final TcpA prepilin band value to determine the mass of TcpA prepilin/μl in the membrane preparation. The TcpA prepilin membrane preparation was diluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, buffer to a concentration of 0.2 μg/μl. The in vitro TcpJ cleavage assay was designed, based on the assay developed for PilD ofP. aeruginosa (26.Nunn D.N. Lory S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3281-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), except that pre-TcpA was provided in a membrane preparation rather than as purified protein. TcpJ derivatives were provided in membrane preparations of the TcpJ-expressing strain JM109 (pCL9) (wild-type and mutant alleles). The 100-μl processing reaction was prepared by combining a 50-μl substrate fraction with a 50-μl enzyme fraction (an equivalent of 1 unit of wild-type activity) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The substrate fraction was prepared by combining 5 μl of the TcpA prepilin-containing membrane preparation (1 μg of TcpA prepilin), 10 μl 0.5% (w/v) cardiolipin, 20 μl of 5× assay buffer (125 mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5% v/v Triton X-100), and brought up to the total volume with H2O. The enzyme fraction was prepared by combining a standardized volume of TcpJ-containing membrane preparation and H2O to bring the volume to 50 μl. The cleavage reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 2× protein sample buffer. The volume of TcpJ preparation for all TcpJ derivatives was standardized to be equivalent to the volume containing an amount of wild-type TcpJ sufficient to cleave 50% of 1 μg of TcpA prepilin in 1 h, which is defined as 1 unit of TcpJ peptidase activity. The formation of mature TcpA from precursor was monitored by Western immunoblot analysis. Chemical inhibitors were tested for their ability to prevent the cleavage of TcpA from the prepilin to mature form in the in vitro cleavage assay. Various concentrations of inhibitors were added to both the enzyme (1 unit of TcpJ) and substrate fraction so that, when combined, the inhibitor concentration would remain constant. The inhibitor was incubated in the enzyme fraction at room temperature for 30 min prior to the combination of the two fractions. The 100-μl reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C before 100 μl of 2× SDS protein sample buffer was added to stop the reaction. The specific concentrations of each inhibitor are listed in Table I. The 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC)/glycinamide inhibition protocol is a two-step chemical reaction based on the procedure developed for the selective modification of carboxyl side groups of aspartic and glutamic acids in proteins (27.Hoare D.G. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 2057-2058Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Takahashi et al. (28.Takahashi K. Tanokura M. Inoue H. Kojima M. Muto Y. Yamasaki M. Makabe O. Kimura T. Takizawa T. Hamaya T. Suzuki E. Miyano H. Structure and Function of the Aspartic Proteinases.

Membranes containing the equivalent of 6 units of TcpJ activity are incubated in 80 μl of 25 mm potassium biphthalate, pH 4.0, and 100 mm EDAC for 30 min at room temperature. 20 μl of 1m glycinamide was added to the mixture, and incubation at room temperature was continued for an additional 30 min before the reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 μl of 200 mmTris buffer, pH 8.0. The mixture was spot dialyzed against 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, for 1 h and then centrifuged at 230,000 × g (60,000 rpm in TLA 100.3 rotor) for 15 min. The resulting membrane pellet, which contains the chemically modified TcpJ was resuspended in 60 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. 20 μl of the membrane suspension, which contains 2 units of TcpJ, was used in the in vitro cleavage assay to determine the peptidase activity. Activity of the modified TcpJ was compared with an equivalent amount of TcpJ, which had been subjected to a mock modification procedure that did not include EDAC or glycinamide.Table IThe effect of chemical inhibitors on the in vitro TcpJ cleavage assayChemical(s)SpecificitySuggested concentrationConcentrationCleavage%No inhibitor100E-64Cysteine proteases(1.4–28 μm)aRoche Molecular Biochemicals.(1–10 μm)bProlysis, a protease and protease inhibitor Web server (T.

The inhibition by EDAC/glycinamide is a two-step protocol conducted in acidic conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). The TcpJ S46A, C76A, D189A, and K191A alterations were constructed in pCL10 by the QuikchangeTM(Stratagene) method of mutagenesis, which utilizes inverse PCR primed by divergent overlapping primers containing the desired complementary nucleotide changes. The S18A, C48A, C51A, S65A, C73A, S81A, E88A, D125A, D125E, D125N, D125Amb, S172A, D183N, D189E, D189N, D189Amb, S212A/S213A, and Δ35–81 were constructed in pCL10, and D147A and D212A were constructed in pJM294 using other methods of inverse PCR primed by nonoverlapping divergent primers. Both primers contained an engineered common restriction site that allowed for the restriction of the PCR product by the appropriate enzyme followed by the ligation at the complementary DNA overhangs. In these cases, only one primer carried the desired mutation that was incorporated into the amplified DNA. In some cases the engineering of restriction sites into the primers was accompanied by the incorporation of silent mutations. In other primers, seamless cloning and mutagenesis was performed by incorporating the restriction enzyme site EarI orSapI at the 5′ end of each primer in the pair. These enzymes cleave just outside their recognition site, which makes possible a primer design that ensures that the recognition site is cleaved off the end of the PCR product, while complementary gene sequence overhangs remain to promote annealing prior to ligation. In vivo TcpA processing was monitored in E. coli and V. cholerae strains grown to mid-log phase except where indicated. 0.5 ml of cell culture was centrifuged and resuspended in 100 μl of LB. 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the sample. The total sample was boiled for 5 min, and 50 μl was subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. For both in vivo and in vitro processing, the proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-TcpA peptide 6 antiserum. The secondary Ab, an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, was used to detect TcpA by chemiluminescence using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by autoradiography. For detection of TcpJ, 20 μl of a membrane preparation from a TcpJ-expressing strain was combined with 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. 20 μl of the sample was then subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-TcpJ peptide J3–1 antiserum or, in the case of TcpJ (6.Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)His and TcpJ (6.Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)HisΔ35–81, with TetraHis Ab (Qiagen). Detection with secondary antibody was carried out as described for TcpA. In order to characterize the biochemical mechanism of the cleavage reaction catalyzed by TcpJ and other TFPPs, we sought to identify the critical active site amino acids. First, a limited set of candidate active site residues were identified for targeted changes. Since only the amino acids cysteine, serine, aspartic acid, histidine, lysine, or glutamic acid have been identified as critical active site residues in proteases, an alignment of 27 TFPPs was used to quantitate the conservation of these residues (Fig.1). Since the active site is thought to be located on the cytoplasmic face of the cellular membrane, the analysis was further refined to focus on those residues located within the three major theoretical cytoplasmic domains of TcpJ. Twelve conserved positions were identified, including eight in cytoplasmic domain 1, one in domain 2, and three in domain 3 as indicated by asterisks (Fig. 2 A). Of these residues, only Asp125 and Asp189 are present in every single TFPP examined. The positions of all potentially catalytic residues with respect to the membrane topology model of TcpJ are indicated in Fig. 2 B. 16 residues including the 7 serines, 4 cysteines, 3 aspartic acids, 1 lysine, and 1 glutamic acid indicated asshaded residues in Fig. 1 and 2 B were selected for mutagenesis. 13 of the 16 potential active site residues targeted for mutagenesis are all of the residues conserved at greater than the arbitrary level of 50% in TcpJ. The three selected residues that did not meet this criterion are Ser172, Asp183, and Ser212. Ser172 of TcpJ may be functionally equivalent to residues Ser168 and Ser171indicated as (S168) and (S171) in Fig. 1, which, in combination, are approximately 65% conserved. Asp183and Glu183 (Fig. 1, (E183)) in combination are conserved in nearly 80% of the 27 TFPPs. Aspartic acid and glutamic acid can function equivalently as the active site of an acid protease (29.Takahashi K. Kagami N. Huang X.P. Kojima M. Inoue H. Adv. in Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 436: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Ser212 was required due to the construction of the S212A/S213A double mutant, which was necessary so the analysis of the phenotype of the S213A would not be ambiguous due to the remaining serine in the adjacent position.Figure 2Primary sequence alignment of the three major cytoplasmic domains of the TFPP family and topology relative to TcpJ. A, partial protein sequence alignment of 27 TFPP homologs. The first region shown corresponds approximately to the large cytoplasmic domain 1. The following two regions correspond precisely to the predicted residues, which constitute cytoplasmic domains 2 and 3.Asterisks designate positions in these regions for which mutations were constructed for this study. The alignment was done in DNASTAR MegAlign, using the Clustal method for alignment. B, membrane topology model of TcpJ.

https://openalex.org/W1535461485,"The primary recognized health risk from common deficiencies in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a cytoprotective enzyme for oxidative stress, is red blood cell hemolysis. Here we show that litters from untreated pregnant mutant mice with a hereditary G6PD deficiency had increased prenatal (fetal resorptions) and postnatal death. When treated with the anticonvulsant drug phenytoin, a human teratogen that is commonly used in pregnant women and causes embryonic oxidative stress, G6PD-deficient dams had higher embryonic DNA oxidation and more fetal death and birth defects. The reported G6PD gene mutation was confirmed and used to genotype fetal resorptions, which were primarily G6PD deficient. This is the first evidence that G6PD is a developmentally critical cytoprotective enzyme for both endogenous and xenobiotic-initiated embryopathic oxidative stress and DNA damage. G6PD deficiencies accordingly may have a broader biological relevance as important determinants of infertility, in utero and postnatal death, and teratogenesis."

It has also been proposed that these compounds function in spatial buffering of cellular energy production sites. So, phosphagens act as reserves not only of ATP but also of inorganic phosphate, which is mostly returned to the medium by metabolic consumption of ATP. Phosphoarginine is the main reserve of high energy phosphate compounds in a wide variety of invertebrates. In addition phosphocreatine, phosphoglycocyamine, phosphotaurocyamine, phosphohypotaurocyamine, phosphoopheline, and phospholombricine are also found, whereas in vertebrates the only one present is phosphocreatine (1.Morrison J.F. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 457-486Google Scholar, 2.Huennekens F.M. Whiteley H.R. Florkin M. Mason H.S. Comparative Biochemistry. 1. Academic Press, New York1960: 107-180Crossref Google Scholar). Arginine kinase (EC 2.7.3.3) is a member of a conserved family of phosphotransferases which also includes creatine kinase. These enzymes catalyze the reversible transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to a guanidino acceptor, which can be either an amino acid (e.g.lombricine or arginine) or a carboxylate (e.g. creatine or glycocyamine; Reaction 1).MgATP+guanidino acceptor⇄P­guanidino acceptor+MgADP+H+REACTION 1Arginine kinase is present in Annelida, Celenterata, Platyhelmintes, Nemertea, Mollusca, Phoronida, Arthropoda, Equinodermata, Hemichordata, and Chordata, where, like other phosphagen kinases, it maintains ATP homeostasis during muscle contraction (1.Morrison J.F.

Academic Press, New York1960: 107-180Crossref Google Scholar). Common in most of these phosphotransferases is the presence in the binding sites of substrates of five arginine residues interacting with ATP, two carboxylate amino acids, and one cysteine residue interacting with the guanidino acceptor group (3.Zhou G.

In addition, some arginine kinases contain a domain for interaction with actin (4.Reddy R.R. Houmeida A. Benyamin Y. Roustan C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Most of the enzymatic reactions studied in trypanosomatids, which involves l-arginine, are related to the ornithine-arginine pathway. Distinct genus of trypanosomatids utilizes different enzymes in arginine catabolism. Members of the Trypanosoma genus include T. cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, devoid of ornithine decarboxylase, arginine decarboxylase, and arginase (5.Camargo E.P. Coelho J.A.

In addition, the existence of the nitric oxide pathway inT. cruzi was demonstrated recently by this laboratory. This signaling pathway involves a putativel-glutamate/N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, a nitric oxide synthase, and a guanylyl cyclase and seems to be a control step in epimastigote flagellar motility (7.Paveto C.

Enzymes and PCR1 reagents were provided by Promega Corporation (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides were from Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX), and other reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Unless otherwise indicated, T. cruziepimastigote forms of the Tulahuen 2 strain were cultured at 28 °C in a medium containing 5 g/liter liver infusion, 5 g/liter Bacto-tryptose (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI), 68 mmNaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 22 mmNa2HPO4, 0.2% glucose, 0.002% hemin supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/liter streptomycin. Cell viability was assessed by direct microscopic examination. For arginine kinase purification, epimastigotes from 7-day cultures (late logarithmic phase) were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g, washed three times with 25 mm Hepes adjusted to pH 7.3 with Tris and containing 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 154 mm NaCl, and 5.5 mm d-glucose (buffer A). The pellet was then resuspended (1 ml/each 30 ml of culture) in 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.3, containing 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mmbenzamidine, 25 units/ml Trasylol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and lysed by six cycles of freezing in liquid N2 and thawing at 4 °C. The extract was then centrifuged 5 min at 8,000 × g. The supernatant thus obtained was used as a source of epimastigote proteins for the arginine kinase purification. The supernatant fluid (5.0 ml) was applied to a 5 × 1-cm Whatman DE-52 column equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, and washed with 25 ml of the same buffer solution. The enzyme activity was recovered in the percolate. After a concentration step using Amicon ultracentrifugation cells, the sample (0.5 ml) was applied to a Superose-6 HR10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated as above. The effluent, obtained at a rate of 0.3 ml/min, was collected in 0.5-ml fractions. The peak activity fractions were pooled and used as a source of kinase activity. These fractions were enriched 80-fold in enzyme activity with a recovery of about 55% (specific activity 0.8–1.2 μmol·min−1·mg of protein−1; see Fig. 3 B). Purification of recombinant arginine kinase was performed on a Ni-NTA agarose column (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions for denatured polypeptides. The eluate was then dialyzed successively for 24 h against decreasing urea concentrations (from 7.0 m to none) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.15 m NaCl, to obtain recombinant arginine kinase with a specific activity of 10–16 μmol·min−1·mg of protein−1 and a yield of 10–20 mg of protein/liter of culture (see Fig. 3 A). The incubation mixture contained 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.3, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm l-[2,3-3H]arginine (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA; 0.5 μCi/assay), and an enzyme source (0.1–8 μg of protein) in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Incubations were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C, and reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.3, containing 10 mm l-arginine and 5 mm EDTA (stop buffer). The mixtures were then resolved by passage through a strong anion exchange resin, AG 1-X4, 200–400 mesh chloride form (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) mounted into 1-ml tulip columns equilibrated with stop buffer. After loading the samples, the columns were washed with 3 ml of 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.3, and eluted with 2 ml of 1 m NaCl. The eluates were counted for radioactivity. The assay method for arginine kinase activity is validated for the ulterior analysis of the anion exchange eluate products by mass spectrometry (see below). Under the conditions described above, phosphoarginine but not l-arginine was retained by the anion exchange resin. In addition, the eluate fraction contained less than 2% of free l-arginine and more than 95% of the phosphoarginine produced. Arginine kinase activity was assayed alternatively using a modification of the procedure described by France et al. (10.France R.M. Cellers D.S. Grossman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 10 mm l-arginine, 2 mm[γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and an enzyme source in a final volume of 0.2 ml. The reaction was carried out for 10 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1.4% and heating for 1 min at 100 °C. Mixtures were cooled 1 min on ice and then extracted with isobutyl alcohol/(NH)4MoO4 as described by Richards et al. (11.Richards D.E. Rega A.F. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 0.1 ml of the organic phase were counted for radioactivity. For both procedures, the enzyme activity was proportional to the incubation time (2–20 min) and enzyme protein (0.1–1.0 μg protein of Superose fraction). DNA was obtained from an epimastigote lysate, treated with proteinase K, by phenol-chloroform extraction and centrifugation through a CsCl gradient. Total RNA was prepared from approximately 3.7 × 1010 cells (99% epimastigotes), according to Chomszynski and Sacchi (12.Chomszynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). A putative arginine kinase sequence of 287 bp was amplified from T. cruzi DNA as template using two degenerated primers with the sequences GA(C/T)GA(C/T)CACTT(C/T)CT(G/T/C)TT(C/T)AA(A/G)G (forward) and GTCGT(A/G)CC(G/A/C)AG(A/G)TT(C/T)G(A/T)(G/T)GG(A/G)C (reverse). Primer structures were deduced from arginine kinase amino acid sequences from Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster, Penaeus japonicus, andCaenorhabditis elegans (see “Results” and Fig.2 A). Incubation mixtures contained 400–700 ng of T. cruzi DNA, 200–500 ng of each primer and 4 mmMgCl2. Amplification conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 2 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C, followed by an extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. A 287-bp product was obtained by PCR amplification, subcloned, and sequenced. This product showed an 83% identity with theTrypanosoma brucei rhodesiense expressed sequence tag (Accession Number W00186) and a high identity with others related guanidino kinases. Probes were labeled with the random primer DNA labeling kit from Bio-Rad using [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) as the labeled nucleotide. A T. cruzi genomic library from the CL Brener clone was obtained from Dr. M. Levin. This library was prepared by Dr. Edson Rondinelli (Instituto de Biofisica, Universidade de Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) in the λ phage replacement vector Lambda FIX II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), containing 12–15-kbp inserts into the XhoI site, and is available through the T. cruzi genome initiative (13.Zingales B. Rondinelli E. Degrave W. da Silveira F. Levin M. Le Paslier D. Modabber F. Dobrokhotov B., B. Swindle J. Kelly J.M. Åslung L. Hoheisel J.D. Ruiz A.M. Cazzulo J.J. Pettersson U. Frash A.C. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 16-22PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 100,000 independent recombinant phages were screened with the 287-bp PCR fragment as a probe and, after three rounds of selection, three phage clones giving positive hybridization signals were selected. The positive phage clones were subjected to sequencing using the PRISM Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). This procedure requires the Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA automatic sequencer. Mixtures were supplemented with double-stranded phage DNA and the corresponding oligonucleotide. Reactions were performed in the model 480 DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer) following the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blot analysis, 10–20 μg of total RNA samples from epimastigote cells were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with the full-length arginine kinase gene as a probe. The Southern blot analysis was performed using aliquots of 5 μg of DNA previously digested with the following endonucleases: AccI,BamHI, BglI, and EcoRI. The products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred, and hybridized as described for Northern blots. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed in a CHEF electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad) with a hexagonal electrode array. Agarose blocks containing about 107 epimastigote forms were prepared as described (14.Engman D.M. Reddy L.V. Donelson J.E. Kirchhoff L.V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The separation of the chromosomal bands was carried out in 1.0% Gel Seakem agarose (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3), and run in the same buffer. The electrophoretic conditions were as follows: 16 h, 6 V/cm pulsed each 60–90 s; 20 h, 3 V/cm pulsed each 200–500 s; and 24 h, 2.7 V/cm pulsed each 500–1,200 s, maintained at constant temperature (14 °C). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.1 μg/ml) and photographed. Chromosomes fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) were used as molecular mass standards. The gel was treated for 10 min with 0.25 m HCl and washed twice with bidistilled water. DNA was denatured in a solution containing 0.4 mNaOH and 1 m NaCl (two incubations, 20 min each). The transfer of nucleic acids and hybridization conditions were the same as those described for Northern blots. A fragment carrying the entire T. cruzi arginine kinase sequence was obtained by PCR using as primers the following oligonucleotides: CGCGGATCCAACTCAGTCACGATGGCC (5′-end carrying aBamHI site) and CGGAATTCGGCTCACCTCGCAGATTC (3′-end carrying an EcoRI site). Conditions were similar to those described above. After double digestion with BamHI andEcoRI, the fragment thus generated was purified with the Wizard PCR Preps Kit (Promega) and ligated to the pRSET A vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) treated previously with EcoRI andBamHI. This plasmid transcribes under the control of the T7 promoter and includes a polyhistidine tag. Expression was performed in the BL21(DE3)pLysS host (E. coli B, F−, dcm, ompT, hsdS, (rb−, mB−), gal λ(DE3),[pLysS, Camr ]). An overnight culture was carried out in 700 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Induction was performed with 100 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 60 min at 37 °C. Arginine kinase antiserum was obtained using female mice from the BALB/c strain immunized by an intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg of recombinant arginine kinase plus 0.1 ml of incomplete Freund's adjuvant followed, 15 days later, by a booster intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg of recombinant protein. After 15 days, mice were bled by exposing the ocular cavity. Procedures for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of protein samples were carried out as described by Laemmli (15.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Polypeptides were electrotransferred from polyacrylamide gels to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For reaction with the antibody, the transferred membranes were blocked with a 5% (w/v) non-fat milk suspension for 30 min. After incubation for 2 h with a 1:100 dilution of the mouse anti-arginine kinase antiserum, detection was carried out by incubating with a 1:2,000 dilution of sheep anti-mouse Ig conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The latter was developed with the Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (NEN Life Science Products). l-Arginine and phosphoarginine characterization was performed by mass spectrometry using a ZAB-SE Q4F (Micromass, UK) mass spectrometer (high mass, 800; low mass, 50; resolution, 1,000; time (s/dec), 4; ionization mode, FAB− and FAB+; accelerating voltage, 8,000 V). Protein was assayed as described by Bradford (16.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Sequences were analyzed, compared, and aligned using Advanced BLAST version 2.0, Clustal W, and LaserGene software (DNASTAR, Inc.). Consensus sequences in T. cruzi arginine kinase were located with BLOCKS (17.Henikoff J.G. Henikoff S. Pietrokovski S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An arginine kinase activity was detected in partially purified preparations from T. cruzi epimastigote soluble extracts. The activity requires ATP and a divalent cation such as Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+; dATP or GTP is less efficient than ATP in phosphorylating l-arginine (Table I). Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) values for both ATP and l-arginine were about 0.3 mm, and the optimum pH was 8.2 (results not shown). Identical results were obtained with the two kinase assay procedures (see “Experimental Procedures”).Table IEffect of divalent cations and nucleoside triphosphates on T. cruzi arginine kinase activityAdditions/omissionsArginine kinaseRecombinant AKμmol · min −1 · mg −1μmol · min −1 · mg −1None (control)0.81 ± 0.00410.65 ± 0.257Minus ATP0.00 ± 0.0020 ± 0.005Minus Mg2+, plus 10 mm EDTA0.11 ± 0.0100.28 ± 0.027Minus Mg2+, plus 5 mm Mn2+0.74 ± 0.0440.27 ± 0.022Minus Mg2+, plus 5 mm Ca2+0.47 ± 0.0327.03 ± 0.147Plus 5 mmZn2+0.05 ± 0.0190.56 ± 0.052Minus Mg2+, plus 5 mm Zn2+0.00 ± 0.0050.19 ± 0.017Plus 5 mmCu2+0.02 ± 0.0070.50 ± 0.262Minus Mg2+, plus 5 mm Cu2+0.00 ± 0.0100.15 ± 0.097Minus ATP, plus 2 mmdATP0.49 ± 0.1017.69 ± 0.059Minus ATP, plus 2 mm GTP0.16 ± 0.1220.03 ± 0.0030.8 μg of partially purified T. cruzi soluble extract and 0.2 μg of the recombinant protein were assayed for arginine kinase (AK) activity with the standard method as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with the modifications listed in the table.

A control reaction was performed in the presence of 2 mm ATP and 5 mm MgAcO. Data are the means ± S.D. of triplicates. The reaction product was characterized by mass spectrometry. Standard phospho-l-arginine and arginine kinase reaction products gave the same FAB+ signals: m/z 113 and 207; FAB− signals were also identical:m/z 255 and 283. The effects of several amino acids, arginine/guanidine derivatives, and polyamines on T. cruzi arginine kinase were tested. Under standard assay conditions (1 mm l-arginine), the presence of 5-fold higher concentrations of canavanine and histidine produced a greater than 50% inhibition. Other compounds such as l-homoarginine, l-glutamate, N-methyl-l-arginine, l-nitroarginine,l-lysine, l-aspartate, agmatine, and ethylguanidine elicited inhibitions of between 20 and 35% (TableII). Inhibition constant (K i) values for canavanine and homoarginine were calculated because both metabolites produced inhibition of arginine kinase activity as well as arginine transport in epimastigote cells (9.Pereira C.A. Alonso G.D. Paveto M.C. Flawiá M.M. Torres H.N. J. Eukar. Microbiol. 1999; 46: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). K i values for canavanine and homoarginine were 6.0 mm, and 7.0 mm respectively (results not shown).Table IIEffect on T. cruzi arginine kinase of several amino acids, arginine/guanidine derivatives and polyaminesAdditionArginine kinaseInhibitionRecombinant AKInhibitionμmol · min −1 · mg −1%μmol · min −1 · mg −1%None (control)1.20 ± 0.027015.99 ± 0.5410l-Histidine0.52 ± 0.0225611.74 ± 0.08527l-Lysine0.90 ± 0.0552513.58 ± 0.04515Glycine1.19 ± 0.145115.34 ± 0.2354l-Isoleucine1.02 ± 0.0641514.55 ± 0.4539l-Aspartate0.90 ± 0.0842513.43 ± 0.26016l-Glutamate0.82 ± 0.0073113.81 ± 0.58014N-Methyl-l-arginine0.86 ± 0.0552813.25 ± 1.12717l-Nitroarginine0.86 ± 0.0372811.95 ± 0.41225d-Arginine1.27 ± 0.020016.59 ± 0.1700l-Homoarginine0.80 ± 0.0163313.83 ± 0.25613l-Ornithine1.06 ± 0.0851214.53 ± 0.3769l-Citrulline1.17 ± 0.032213.75 ± 0.09614Creatine1.05 ± 0.0111313.39 ± 0.30516Canavanine0.27 ± 0.044779.30 ± 0.35742Agmatine0.96 ± 0.1822013.47 ± 1.28316Putrescine1.29 ± 0.045017.77 ± 0.5440Ethylguanidine0.94 ± 0.0512214.27 ± 0.73911Guanidine propionic0.97 ± 0.0971813.57 ± 0.83115Amino guanidine1.01 ± 0.0041614.68 ± 0.3448Guanidine1.11 ± 0.067714.07 ± 0.32112Methylguanidine1.19 ± 0.042113.81 ± 0.08314Urea1.15 ± 0.079414.69 ± 0.0678γ-Guanidine butyramide1.16 ± 0.100315.74 ± 0.0782The effects of different compounds were tested on the native and recombinant arginine kinase (AK) standard assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” in the presence of 1 mmarginine and a 5-fold molar excess (5 mm) of the metabolite screened.

Open table in a new tab The effects of different compounds were tested on the native and recombinant arginine kinase (AK) standard assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” in the presence of 1 mmarginine and a 5-fold molar excess (5 mm) of the metabolite screened. Data are the means ± S.D. of triplicates. Available arginine kinase sequences were selected as a source of information to amplify a putative homologue from T. cruzi DNA. Arthropods and helminths such as A. mellifera, D. melanogaster, P. japonicus, and C. elegans belong to the lowest evolved metazoa and posses arginine kinases with reported genetic sequences. All of these sequences share amino acid identities of about 60–70% (see Fig. 2). Taking into account this information, a set of primers was designed and used to amplify a putative arginine kinase fromT. cruzi DNA. The only product resulting from this amplification was a fragment of 287 bp. After sequencing, the fragment revealed a 79% amino acid identity with an equivalent domain ofD. melanogaster arginine kinase. The 287-bp fragment was used to probe a T. cruzi genomic library in λ FIX II. Following a tertiary screening, three clones were isolated with 12–15-kbp inserts. One of these, when subjected to sequencing, revealed an open reading frame corresponding to a polypeptide of 357 amino acids (Fig. 1) with a molecular weight of 40,201 and a theoretical isoelectric point of 7.04. This protein sequence shows all of the characteristic consensus blocks of the ATP:guanidino phosphotransferase family (see “Experimental Procedures”): BL001112A (positions 52–95), BL00112B (positions 116–149), BL00112C (positions 161–191), BL00112D (positions 199–245), BL00112E (positions 259–288), and BL00112F (positions 306–354). BL00112E houses the consensus CPTNLGT (positions 271–277), which partially corresponds to the active site of the kinase. In addition, a putative “actinin-type” actin binding domain (18.Kuhlman P.A. Hemmings L. Critchley D.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), DAKTFLVWVNE, was found (positions 214–224). 5′- and 3′-noncoding sequences were also characterized. A proposed “pyrimidine-rich” region and a splice leader acceptor site were located at the 5′-noncoding region, whereas downstream of the coding region, a 309-bp noncoding sequence was found, apparently followed by an open reading frame. This sequence is identical to a T. cruzi expressed sequence tag (GenBank AI035059) reported by theT. cruzi genome initiative. The protein coded by this open reading frame of 82 amino acids is quite unusual: it contains 15 arginines, 5 lysines, and has an isoelectric point of 10.8. The highest amino acid identities of the T. cruzi sequence were with arginine kinases of A. mellifera (insect), D. melanogaster (insect), P. japonicus (crustacean), and C. elegans (helminth): 69.6, 66.9, 71.8, and 58.5%, respectively. Identity with a putative bacterial arginine kinase, from Chlamydia trachomatis, was rather poor: 11.2%. When the comparison was made with other guanidino kinases, the degree of homology was 39% with the human creatine kinase, 38% with the lombricine kinase from Eisenia fetida(annelid), and 36% with the guanidino acetate kinase of Neanthes diversicolor (annelid) (Fig.2 A). A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the 10 ATP:guanidino phosphotransferase sequences analyzed (Fig. 2 B). The phenogram indicates the existence of three major groups: one corresponding to arthropod and helminth arginine kinases; the second to a variety of creatine, lombricine, and glycocyamine kinases; and a third group that comprises a bacterial arginine kinase. T. cruzi arginine kinase clearly belongs to the first group. The expressed enzyme was purified to near homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.3 A) and assayed for biochemical properties. It was recovered with a specific activity of about 10–16 μmoles·min−1·mg of protein−1. This value was 10 times lower than those reported for some arthropod and mollusk muscle arginine kinases (19.Rosenthal G.A. Dahlman D.L. Robinson G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3679-3683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Reddy R.R.S. Roustan C. Benyamin Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 99B: 387-394Google Scholar, 21.Strong S.J. Ellington R.W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 113B: 809-816Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some kinetic properties of the recombinant and the native T. cruzi enzymes were similar but not identical; for example, the K m value for ATP andl-arginine was about 0.3 mm for both preparations (results not shown). On the other hand, the recombinant enzyme was less active with Mn2+ than the native one (TableI). Southern blots were carried out on DNA from the T. cruzi Tulahuen 2 strain digested with four restriction endonucleases. Hybridization analysis using as probe the fragment carrying the entire T. cruzi arginine kinase sequence revealed that T. cruzi arginine kinase is encoded by a single-copy gene (Fig. 4 A). These results are consistent with those obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of T. cruzi chromosomes (chromosome blot), in which only two chromosomal bands of 880 and 847 kbp were detected (see Fig. 4 C). On the other hand, Northern blot analysis of T. cruzi RNA using the fragment carrying the entire T. cruziarginine kinase sequence revealed a mRNA subpopulation of about 2.0 kb (Fig. 4 B). Western blot analysis of polypeptides in an epimastigote soluble extract, using the antiserum against T. cruzi recombinant arginine kinase, revealed a 40-kDa polypeptide band (Fig.4 D). Cytosolic fractions of some lower eukaryotic organisms were assayed for arginine kinase activity. The activity was present in the Tulahuen 0, Tulahuen 2 and G T. cruzistrains, as well as in: Trypanosoma rangeli,Herpetomonas muscarum, and Leptomonas samueli. No activity was detected in Crithidia fasciculata,Leishmania chagasi, Plasmodium falciparum,Toxoplasma gondii, Euglena gracilis, andAcanthamoeba polyphaga (results not shown). The present study reports the biochemical characterization and the analysis of the genetic sequence of arginine kinase from the flagellate protozoan T. cruzi. The enzyme was partially purified from epimastigote cells and from an E. coli expression system. Except for the behavior to divalent cations and some inhibitors both preparations showed similar kinetic properties. This may be attributable to an inappropriate folding of the recombinant enzyme or the presence of a histidine tag. Because this enzyme presents an extraordinary amino acid homology compared with those from crustaceans and insects, the evolutionary origin of its sequence is under discussion. Indeed, it is accepted that arthropods were the first hosts for trypanosomatids. Later, some of them diverged to parasitize plants and warm blooded animals. Thus, it may be speculated that some kind of horizontal genetic transfer between arthropods and trypanosomatids might have occurred during evolution. An interesting fact is related to the role of arginine kinase in trypanosomatids and, in general terms, in protozoa organisms from which it was believed that phosphoguanidino phosphagens were excluded. In this regard, the presence of a putative actinin-like actin binding domain in the sequence of this enzyme clearly suggests a relationship with cytoskeletal structures related to cell movement, particularly flagellar movement and other processes requiring a high energy consumption. From the experience in T. cruzi, it is evident that the role of phosphagens is not restricted to multicellular organisms bearing movements driven by muscle tissue. A last point is related to therapeutic implications of arginine kinase. Because this kinase is not present in mammalian tissues, it could be a possible target for the future development of chemotherapeutic agents against Chagas' disease and other parasitic diseases caused by related organisms. For this purpose, a rational approach would involve three steps: 1) identification in the parasite of a unique biochemical compound different from those in the host cell (in our case phosphoarginine); 2) characterization of the target enzyme responsible for the production of such compound (the arginine kinase described here); and 3) search for a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. We express our thanks to Dr. Antonio Gonzalez Aguilar from the Lopez-Neyra Institute for Research in Parasitology, Granada, Spain for helping us with the sequencing and to Dr. Tomohiko Suzuki from the Kochi University in Japan for the helpful advice."
https://openalex.org/W2020478281,"Growing evidence suggests that activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction mediates changes in muscle gene expression in response to exercise. Nevertheless, little is known about upstream or downstream regulation of MAPK in response to muscle contraction. Here we show that ex vivo muscle contraction stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and p38MAPK phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or p38MAPK was unaffected by protein kinase C inhibition (GF109203X), suggesting that protein kinase C is not involved in mediating contraction-induced MAPK signaling. Contraction-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK was completely inhibited by pretreatment with PD98059 (MAPK kinase inhibitor) and SB203580 (p38MAPKinhibitor), respectively. Muscle contraction also activated MAPK downstream targets p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90Rsk), MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP-K2), and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1). Use of PD98059 or SB203580 revealed that stimulation of p90Rsk and MAPKAP-K2 most closely reflects ERK and p38MAPK stimulation, respectively. Stimulation of MSK1 in contracting skeletal muscle required the activation of both ERK and p38MAPK. These data demonstrate that muscle contraction, separate from systemic influence, activates MAPK signaling. Furthermore, we are the first to show that contractile activity stimulates MAPKAP-K2 and MSK1. Growing evidence suggests that activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction mediates changes in muscle gene expression in response to exercise. Nevertheless, little is known about upstream or downstream regulation of MAPK in response to muscle contraction. Here we show that ex vivo muscle contraction stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and p38MAPK phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or p38MAPK was unaffected by protein kinase C inhibition (GF109203X), suggesting that protein kinase C is not involved in mediating contraction-induced MAPK signaling.

Although exercise results in the activation of MAPK signaling, very little is known of the mechanism by which MAPK mediates signal transduction in direct response to muscle contraction.ERK1/2 activation is mediated via a number of signaling molecules including growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (9.Cohen P.

Activation of the p38MAPK signaling cascade is initiated via a number of stimuli including inflammatory cytokines (15.Freshney N.W. Rawlingson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Similar to the ERK pathway, PKC has also been implicated in p38MAPK activation, as endothelin-1 activation of p38MAPK in rat ventricular myocytes is inhibited by phorbol ester down-regulation of PKC or by treatment with a PKC inhibitor GF109203X (18.Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, the role of PKC in the exercise-induced activation of ERK1/2 or p38MAPKsignaling pathways has not been determined.Activated MAPK interacts with a number of downstream targets, including the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90Rsk) (19.Zhao Y. Bjørbæk C. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP-K2) (20.Cuenda A. Rouse J.

Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), which are activated by ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, respectively. Additionally, the recently identified mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) is activated by a mechanism involving an interaction with either ERK or p38MAPK (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). To date, the role of MSK1 in exercise-induced signal transduction is unknown.The aim of this study was to first assess whether PKC is involved in MAPK activation in response to muscle contraction. Secondly, we investigated the effect of ex vivo muscle contraction on MAPK signaling to the downstream targets p90Rsk, MAPKAP-K2, and MSK1. Here we show that contractile activity activates p90Rsk and MAPKAP-K2. Activation of p90Rsk and MAPKAP-K2 by muscle contraction most closely reflects ERK and p38MAPK activity, respectively. Additionally, we show that contractile activity stimulates the recently identified MSK1. The use of an ex vivo model of muscle contraction demonstrates that local effects of muscle contraction lead to the activation of the MAPK signaling cascade, independent of systemic influence.DISCUSSIONExercise and contractile activity stimulate ERK (3.Goodyear L.J.

Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zierath J.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We have utilized an ex vivo system to achieve muscle contraction to examine the direct role of muscle contraction upon stimulation of MAPK signal transduction. This system allows us to study the effects of muscle contraction on signal transduction independent of systemic factors or influence of surrounding tissue. Contractile activity increased muscle glucose transport 5–6-fold, and decreased muscle glycogen stores > 60%, demonstrating a profound effect of contractile activity on carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle. This system of muscle contraction greatly influenced signaling by the MAPK pathways. Here we show that ex vivo muscle contraction, void of any systemic factors, is sufficient for ERK1/2 and p38MAPK phosphorylation. Increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK occurred only at voltages that elicit measurable muscle contraction. This suggests that muscle contraction rather than electrical stimulation is directly responsible for initiating MAPK signaling in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, we show thatex vivo contraction activates the downstream MAPK targets p90Rsk, MAPKAP-K2, and MSK1.Classic growth factor-mediated activation of ERK1/2 involves the Ras/Raf/MEK signaling cascade (9.Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 10.Ray L.B. Sturgil T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 263: 12721-12727Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 11.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated MEK1/2 phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2. Exercise/contraction-induced ERK1/2 signaling appears to involve similar signal transduction (4.Aronson D. Violan M.A. Dufresne S.D. Zangen D. Fielding R.A. Goodyear L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 7.Sherwood D.J. Dufresne S.D. Markuns J.F. Cheatham B. Moller D.E. Aronson D. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E870-E878PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which muscle contraction initiates the Ras-Raf association remains undetermined (7.Sherwood D.J. Dufresne S.D. Markuns J.F. Cheatham B. Moller D.E. Aronson D. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E870-E878PubMed Google Scholar). PKC activation is also known to lead to Ras activation and thus stimulate MAPK activtity (12.van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M. Koch W.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1266-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Additionally, PKC can mediate p38MAPK activation by an unidentified mechanism (18.Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Muscle contraction has been suggested to activate PKC in response to electrical stimulation (30.Richter E.A. Cleland P.J.F. Rattigan S. Clark M.G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 217: 232-236Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31.Cleland P.F.J. Appleby G.F. Rattigan S. Clark M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17704-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sciatic nerve stimulation in rat hind limb is associated with a rapid (2–5 min) shift of PKC activity, as measured by 32P incorporation to histone IIIS, from the cytosol to the membrane fraction (30.Richter E.A. Cleland P.J.F. Rattigan S. Clark M.G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 217: 232-236Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31.Cleland P.F.J. Appleby G.F. Rattigan S. Clark M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17704-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether PKC mediates MAPK signal transduction in response to ex vivo muscle contraction. Pre-exposure of rat epitrochlearis muscles to the PKC inhibitor GF109203X did not alter ERK1/2 or p38MAPK phosphorylation in contracting skeletal muscle. These results suggest that GF109203X-sensitive PKC isoforms (i.e. conventional and novel) are not involved in contraction-induced MAPK kinase signaling. The mechanism by which muscle contraction initiates Ras-Raf association (7.Sherwood D.J. Dufresne S.D. Markuns J.F. Cheatham B. Moller D.E. Aronson D. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E870-E878PubMed Google Scholar) remains elusive.The uses of the specific inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580 have been powerful tools in the delineation of downstream MAPK signaling in response to numerous stimuli. PD98059 (23.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar) and SB203580 (20.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P. Lee J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) have been reported to be highly selective inhibitors of MEK1 and p38MAPK activity, respectively, with very little inhibition reported on other members of the MAPK family. We show that PD98059 completely inhibited contraction-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, with ERK2 phosphorylation reduced to 50% of basal activity. This indicates that MEK1 is the primary kinase involved in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to muscle contraction. Unexpectedly, SB203580 also inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in contracting muscle, although to a lesser degree than observed with PD98059. Contraction-stimulated ERK1/2 phoshorylation was reduced by 25% by SB203580; however, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was still significantly elevated over basal levels. The activity of p90Rsk activity in contracting skeletal muscle paralleled ERK phosphorylation. Muscle contraction induced a 5-fold increase in p90Rsk activity. This effect was completely abolished in the presence of PD98059, indicating that muscle contraction simulates p90Rskactivity via an ERK dependent mechanism. Similar to our findings for ERK phosphorylation, exposure of skeletal muscle to SB203580 resulted in an intermediate degree of inhibition on p90Rsk activity. To our knowledge, these results are the first to show an inhibitory effect of SB203580 on the ERK signaling pathway. Previously, SB203580 has been reported to be without inhibitory effect on MEK1, ERK2, or p90Rsk activity (20.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P. Lee J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Our results could suggest that there is cross-talk between the activation of the p38MAPK pathway and the ERK pathway, which may be promoting the activation of ERK in skeletal muscle. Although we observe no inhibition of force development in contracting muscles exposed to SB203580, the possibility remains that SB203580 inhibits unidentified signaling molecules involved in the coupling of muscle contraction to the MAPK signaling pathway.In the present study, we show that p38MAPK phosphorylation is dramatically increased in direct response to ex vivomuscle contraction. Exposure to PD98059 did not prevent contraction-induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK. In contrast, p38MAPK phosphorylation was reduced by 90% in muscle exposed to SB203580. Similar to the observed effects of contraction on p38MAPK activation, MAPKAP-K2 activity was increased 10-fold in response to muscle contraction. This response was also unaffected by PD98059 but completely inhibited in the presence of SB203580. The mechanism of SB203580 inhibition is through binding to the ATP pocket of p38MAPK (32.Tong L. Pav S. White D.M. Rogers S. Crane K.M. Cywin C.L. Brown M.L Pargellis C.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 33.Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carrr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), therefore the finding that SB203580 inhibited p38MAPK phosphorylation was unexpected. However, this is not the first report to show SB203580-induced inhibition of p38MAPK phosphorylation, because SB203580 exposure to ischemic cardiomyocytes also leads to reduced p38MAPK phosphorylation (34.Armstrong S.C. Delacey M. Ganote C.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 555-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in epitrochlearis muscles exposed to osmotic shock (KHB supplemented with 600 mm mannitol) for 20 min we do not observe an inhibition of p38MAPK phosphorylation by SB203580 exposure. 2J. W. Ryder, A. Krook, and J. R. Zierath unpublished results. Therefore, SB203580 may inhibit contraction-MAPK signal transduction coupling, with the greatest effects elicited upon the p38MAPKcascade. Nevertheless, p38MAPK inhibition is evident from the complete ablation of contraction-induced MAPKAP-K2 activity.Recently a new MAPK target protein, MSK1, has been identified (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that contractile activity activates MSK1 in skeletal muscle. Thus, muscle contraction is the first identified stimulus of MSK1 activity in primary tissue. In 293 cells, MSK1 is activated in an ERK-dependent manner by stimulation with TPA or epidermal growth factor (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ultraviolet light, arsenite, or H2O2 also activate MSK1 through p38MAPK. These results suggest that either ERK or p38MAPK activity are sufficient for activation of MSK1 (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Accordingly, because muscle contraction leads to the activation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK kinase, simultaneous inhibition of ERK and p38MAPK activity would be expected to fully inhibit MSK1 activity in response to muscle contraction. Surprisingly, PD98059 and SB203580 independently and completely inhibited contraction-induced MSK1 activity. Inhibition of MSK1 occurred despite the observation that contraction-stimulated MAPKAP-K2 and p90Rsk activities were significantly increased following PD98059 and SB203580 exposure, respectively. Thus, both ERK and p38MAPK activation appear to be required for MSK1 activation in skeletal muscle in response to muscle contraction.MAPK activation plays an important role in the regulation of gene transcription. Here we provide evidence that muscle contraction stimulates activation of ERK and p38MAPK pathways, separate from any endocrine or paracrine influence. This activation appears to occur independently of PKC. Moreover, we show that contraction-induced p90Rsk and MAPKAP-K2 activation occur largely via separate MAPK signaling pathways. Importantly, we provide evidence demonstrating that MSK1 is directly activated by ex vivo muscle contraction and that this activation requires the simultaneous activation of both the ERK and p38MAPK pathways. Chronic exercise leads to changes in expression of key proteins involved in the regulation of fuel metabolism in skeletal muscle (1.Ren J.-M. Semenkovich C.F. Gulve E.A. Holloszy J.O. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), increased MAPK signaling could mediate exercise-induced changes in gene expression and alterations in muscle metabolism. Although exercise results in the activation of MAPK signaling, very little is known of the mechanism by which MAPK mediates signal transduction in direct response to muscle contraction. ERK1/2 activation is mediated via a number of signaling molecules including growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (9.Cohen P.

Activation of the p38MAPK signaling cascade is initiated via a number of stimuli including inflammatory cytokines (15.Freshney N.W. Rawlingson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Similar to the ERK pathway, PKC has also been implicated in p38MAPK activation, as endothelin-1 activation of p38MAPK in rat ventricular myocytes is inhibited by phorbol ester down-regulation of PKC or by treatment with a PKC inhibitor GF109203X (18.Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, the role of PKC in the exercise-induced activation of ERK1/2 or p38MAPKsignaling pathways has not been determined. Activated MAPK interacts with a number of downstream targets, including the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90Rsk) (19.Zhao Y. Bjørbæk C. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP-K2) (20.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), which are activated by ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, respectively. Additionally, the recently identified mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) is activated by a mechanism involving an interaction with either ERK or p38MAPK (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). To date, the role of MSK1 in exercise-induced signal transduction is unknown. The aim of this study was to first assess whether PKC is involved in MAPK activation in response to muscle contraction. Secondly, we investigated the effect of ex vivo muscle contraction on MAPK signaling to the downstream targets p90Rsk, MAPKAP-K2, and MSK1. Here we show that contractile activity activates p90Rsk and MAPKAP-K2. Activation of p90Rsk and MAPKAP-K2 by muscle contraction most closely reflects ERK and p38MAPK activity, respectively. Additionally, we show that contractile activity stimulates the recently identified MSK1. The use of an ex vivo model of muscle contraction demonstrates that local effects of muscle contraction lead to the activation of the MAPK signaling cascade, independent of systemic influence.

Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zierath J.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We have utilized an ex vivo system to achieve muscle contraction to examine the direct role of muscle contraction upon stimulation of MAPK signal transduction. This system allows us to study the effects of muscle contraction on signal transduction independent of systemic factors or influence of surrounding tissue. Contractile activity increased muscle glucose transport 5–6-fold, and decreased muscle glycogen stores > 60%, demonstrating a profound effect of contractile activity on carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle. This system of muscle contraction greatly influenced signaling by the MAPK pathways. Here we show that ex vivo muscle contraction, void of any systemic factors, is sufficient for ERK1/2 and p38MAPK phosphorylation. Increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK occurred only at voltages that elicit measurable muscle contraction. This suggests that muscle contraction rather than electrical stimulation is directly responsible for initiating MAPK signaling in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, we show thatex vivo contraction activates the downstream MAPK targets p90Rsk, MAPKAP-K2, and MSK1.Classic growth factor-mediated activation of ERK1/2 involves the Ras/Raf/MEK signaling cascade (9.Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 10.Ray L.B. Sturgil T.W. J. Biol.

Activated MEK1/2 phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2. Exercise/contraction-induced ERK1/2 signaling appears to involve similar signal transduction (4.Aronson D. Violan M.A. Dufresne S.D. Zangen D. Fielding R.A. Goodyear L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 7.Sherwood D.J. Dufresne S.D. Markuns J.F. Cheatham B. Moller D.E. Aronson D. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E870-E878PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which muscle contraction initiates the Ras-Raf association remains undetermined (7.Sherwood D.J. Dufresne S.D. Markuns J.F. Cheatham B. Moller D.E. Aronson D. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E870-E878PubMed Google Scholar). PKC activation is also known to lead to Ras activation and thus stimulate MAPK activtity (12.van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M. Koch W.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1266-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Additionally, PKC can mediate p38MAPK activation by an unidentified mechanism (18.Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Muscle contraction has been suggested to activate PKC in response to electrical stimulation (30.Richter E.A. Cleland P.J.F. Rattigan S. Clark M.G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 217: 232-236Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31.Cleland P.F.J. Appleby G.F. Rattigan S. Clark M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17704-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sciatic nerve stimulation in rat hind limb is associated with a rapid (2–5 min) shift of PKC activity, as measured by 32P incorporation to histone IIIS, from the cytosol to the membrane fraction (30.Richter E.A. Cleland P.J.F. Rattigan S. Clark M.G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 217: 232-236Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31.Cleland P.F.J. Appleby G.F. Rattigan S. Clark M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17704-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether PKC mediates MAPK signal transduction in response to ex vivo muscle contraction. Pre-exposure of rat epitrochlearis muscles to the PKC inhibitor GF109203X did not alter ERK1/2 or p38MAPK phosphorylation in contracting skeletal muscle. These results suggest that GF109203X-sensitive PKC isoforms (i.e. conventional and novel) are not involved in contraction-induced MAPK kinase signaling. The mechanism by which muscle contraction initiates Ras-Raf association (7.Sherwood D.J. Dufresne S.D. Markuns J.F. Cheatham B. Moller D.E. Aronson D. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E870-E878PubMed Google Scholar) remains elusive.The uses of the specific inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580 have been powerful tools in the delineation of downstream MAPK signaling in response to numerous stimuli. PD98059 (23.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar) and SB203580 (20.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P. Lee J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) have been reported to be highly selective inhibitors of MEK1 and p38MAPK activity, respectively, with very little inhibition reported on other members of the MAPK family. We show that PD98059 completely inhibited contraction-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, with ERK2 phosphorylation reduced to 50% of basal activity. This indicates that MEK1 is the primary kinase involved in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to muscle contraction. Unexpectedly, SB203580 also inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in contracting muscle, although to a lesser degree than observed with PD98059. Contraction-stimulated ERK1/2 phoshorylation was reduced by 25% by SB203580; however, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was still significantly elevated over basal levels. The activity of p90Rsk activity in contracting skeletal muscle paralleled ERK phosphorylation. Muscle contraction induced a 5-fold increase in p90Rsk activity. This effect was completely abolished in the presence of PD98059, indicating that muscle contraction simulates p90Rskactivity via an ERK dependent mechanism. Similar to our findings for ERK phosphorylation, exposure of skeletal muscle to SB203580 resulted in an intermediate degree of inhibition on p90Rsk activity. To our knowledge, these results are the first to show an inhibitory effect of SB203580 on the ERK signaling pathway. Previously, SB203580 has been reported to be without inhibitory effect on MEK1, ERK2, or p90Rsk activity (20.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P. Lee J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Our results could suggest that there is cross-talk between the activation of the p38MAPK pathway and the ERK pathway, which may be promoting the activation of ERK in skeletal muscle. Although we observe no inhibition of force development in contracting muscles exposed to SB203580, the possibility remains that SB203580 inhibits unidentified signaling molecules involved in the coupling of muscle contraction to the MAPK signaling pathway.In the present study, we show that p38MAPK phosphorylation is dramatically increased in direct response to ex vivomuscle contraction. Exposure to PD98059 did not prevent contraction-induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK. In contrast, p38MAPK phosphorylation was reduced by 90% in muscle exposed to SB203580. Similar to the observed effects of contraction on p38MAPK activation, MAPKAP-K2 activity was increased 10-fold in response to muscle contraction. This response was also unaffected by PD98059 but completely inhibited in the presence of SB203580. The mechanism of SB203580 inhibition is through binding to the ATP pocket of p38MAPK (32.Tong L. Pav S. White D.M. Rogers S. Crane K.M. Cywin C.L. Brown M.L Pargellis C.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 33.Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), therefore the finding that SB203580 inhibited p38MAPK phosphorylation was unexpected. However, this is not the first report to show SB203580-induced inhibition of p38MAPK phosphorylation, because SB203580 exposure to ischemic cardiomyocytes also leads to reduced p38MAPK phosphorylation (34.Armstrong S.C. Delacey M. Ganote C.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 555-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in epitrochlearis muscles exposed to osmotic shock (KHB supplemented with 600 mm mannitol) for 20 min we do not observe an inhibition of p38MAPK phosphorylation by SB203580 exposure. 2J. W. Ryder, A. Krook, and J. R. Zierath unpublished results. Therefore, SB203580 may inhibit contraction-MAPK signal transduction coupling, with the greatest effects elicited upon the p38MAPKcascade. Nevertheless, p38MAPK inhibition is evident from the complete ablation of contraction-induced MAPKAP-K2 activity.Recently a new MAPK target protein, MSK1, has been identified (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that contractile activity activates MSK1 in skeletal muscle. Thus, muscle contraction is the first identified stimulus of MSK1 activity in primary tissue. In 293 cells, MSK1 is activated in an ERK-dependent manner by stimulation with TPA or epidermal growth factor (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ultraviolet light, arsenite, or H2O2 also activate MSK1 through p38MAPK. These results suggest that either ERK or p38MAPK activity are sufficient for activation of MSK1 (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Accordingly, because muscle contraction leads to the activation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK kinase, simultaneous inhibition of ERK and p38MAPK activity would be expected to fully inhibit MSK1 activity in response to muscle contraction. Surprisingly, PD98059 and SB203580 independently and completely inhibited contraction-induced MSK1 activity. Inhibition of MSK1 occurred despite the observation that contraction-stimulated MAPKAP-K2 and p90Rsk activities were significantly increased following PD98059 and SB203580 exposure, respectively. Thus, both ERK and p38MAPK activation appear to be required for MSK1 activation in skeletal muscle in response to muscle contraction.MAPK activation plays an important role in the regulation of gene transcription. Here we provide evidence that muscle contraction stimulates activation of ERK and p38MAPK pathways, separate from any endocrine or paracrine influence. This activation appears to occur independently of PKC. Moreover, we show that contraction-induced p90Rsk and MAPKAP-K2 activation occur largely via separate MAPK signaling pathways. Importantly, we provide evidence demonstrating that MSK1 is directly activated by ex vivo muscle contraction and that this activation requires the simultaneous activation of both the ERK and p38MAPK pathways.

Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar) and SB203580 (20.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P. Lee J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) have been reported to be highly selective inhibitors of MEK1 and p38MAPK activity, respectively, with very little inhibition reported on other members of the MAPK family. We show that PD98059 completely inhibited contraction-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, with ERK2 phosphorylation reduced to 50% of basal activity. This indicates that MEK1 is the primary kinase involved in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to muscle contraction. Unexpectedly, SB203580 also inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in contracting muscle, although to a lesser degree than observed with PD98059. Contraction-stimulated ERK1/2 phoshorylation was reduced by 25% by SB203580; however, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was still significantly elevated over basal levels. The activity of p90Rsk activity in contracting skeletal muscle paralleled ERK phosphorylation. Muscle contraction induced a 5-fold increase in p90Rsk activity. This effect was completely abolished in the presence of PD98059, indicating that muscle contraction simulates p90Rskactivity via an ERK dependent mechanism. Similar to our findings for ERK phosphorylation, exposure of skeletal muscle to SB203580 resulted in an intermediate degree of inhibition on p90Rsk activity. To our knowledge, these results are the first to show an inhibitory effect of SB203580 on the ERK signaling pathway. Previously, SB203580 has been reported to be without inhibitory effect on MEK1, ERK2, or p90Rsk activity (20.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P. Lee J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Our results could suggest that there is cross-talk between the activation of the p38MAPK pathway and the ERK pathway, which may be promoting the activation of ERK in skeletal muscle. Although we observe no inhibition of force development in contracting muscles exposed to SB203580, the possibility remains that SB203580 inhibits unidentified signaling molecules involved in the coupling of muscle contraction to the MAPK signaling pathway. In the present study, we show that p38MAPK phosphorylation is dramatically increased in direct response to ex vivomuscle contraction. Exposure to PD98059 did not prevent contraction-induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK. In contrast, p38MAPK phosphorylation was reduced by 90% in muscle exposed to SB203580. Similar to the observed effects of contraction on p38MAPK activation, MAPKAP-K2 activity was increased 10-fold in response to muscle contraction. This response was also unaffected by PD98059 but completely inhibited in the presence of SB203580. The mechanism of SB203580 inhibition is through binding to the ATP pocket of p38MAPK (32.Tong L. Pav S. White D.M. Rogers S. Crane K.M. Cywin C.L. Brown M.L Pargellis C.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 33.Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carrr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), therefore the finding that SB203580 inhibited p38MAPK phosphorylation was unexpected. However, this is not the first report to show SB203580-induced inhibition of p38MAPK phosphorylation, because SB203580 exposure to ischemic cardiomyocytes also leads to reduced p38MAPK phosphorylation (34.Armstrong S.C. Delacey M. Ganote C.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 555-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in epitrochlearis muscles exposed to osmotic shock (KHB supplemented with 600 mm mannitol) for 20 min we do not observe an inhibition of p38MAPK phosphorylation by SB203580 exposure. 2J. W. Ryder, A. Krook, and J. R. Zierath unpublished results. Therefore, SB203580 may inhibit contraction-MAPK signal transduction coupling, with the greatest effects elicited upon the p38MAPKcascade. Nevertheless, p38MAPK inhibition is evident from the complete ablation of contraction-induced MAPKAP-K2 activity. Recently a new MAPK target protein, MSK1, has been identified (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that contractile activity activates MSK1 in skeletal muscle. Thus, muscle contraction is the first identified stimulus of MSK1 activity in primary tissue. In 293 cells, MSK1 is activated in an ERK-dependent manner by stimulation with TPA or epidermal growth factor (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ultraviolet light, arsenite, or H2O2 also activate MSK1 through p38MAPK. These results suggest that either ERK or p38MAPK activity are sufficient for activation of MSK1 (22.Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Accordingly, because muscle contraction leads to the activation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK kinase, simultaneous inhibition of ERK and p38MAPK activity would be expected to fully inhibit MSK1 activity in response to muscle contraction. Surprisingly, PD98059 and SB203580 independently and completely inhibited contraction-induced MSK1 activity. Inhibition of MSK1 occurred despite the observation that contraction-stimulated MAPKAP-K2 and p90Rsk activities were significantly increased following PD98059 and SB203580 exposure, respectively. Thus, both ERK and p38MAPK activation appear to be required for MSK1 activation in skeletal muscle in response to muscle contraction. MAPK activation plays an important role in the regulation of gene transcription. Here we provide evidence that muscle contraction stimulates activation of ERK and p38MAPK pathways, separate from any endocrine or paracrine influence. This activation appears to occur independently of PKC. Moreover, we show that contraction-induced p90Rsk and MAPKAP-K2 activation occur largely via separate MAPK signaling pathways. Importantly, we provide evidence demonstrating that MSK1 is directly activated by ex vivo muscle contraction and that this activation requires the simultaneous activation of both the ERK and p38MAPK pathways."

Here we investigated the differential effects of proteasomal inhibitors on the viability of proliferating and quiescent primary endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Subconfluent, proliferating cells underwent carbobenzoxy-L-isoleucyl-7-í-butyl-L-glutamyl-L-alanyl-L-leucinal (PSI)-induced apoptosis at low concentrations (EC50=24 nM), whereas at least 340-fold higher concentrations of PSI were necessary to obtain the same effect in confluent, contact-inhibited cells. PSI-mediated cell death could be blocked by a caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-H), but not by a caspase-1 inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-H), suggesting that a caspase-3-like enzyme is activated during PSI-induced apoptosis. When applied to the embryonic chick chorioallantoic membrane, a rapidly expanding tissue, PSI induced massive apoptosis also in vivo. PSI treatment of the CAM led to the formation of areas devoid of blood flow due to the induction of apoptosis in endothelial and other cells and to the collapse of capillaries and first order vessels. Our results demonstrate that proteasomal inhibitors such as PSI may prove effective as novel anti-angiogenic and anti-neoplastic substances.—Drexler, H. C. A., Risau, W., Konerding, M. A.

https://openalex.org/W1508318473,"The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of hemeoxygenases HO-1 and HO-2, which are responsible for the production of carbon monoxide (CO), in the human placenta and placental bed and to determine the role of inhibitors of HO on placental perfusion pressure. We hypothesized that HO is expressed within the placenta and that invading cytotrophoblast cells (CTB) express HO isoforms. The expression of HO-1 and HO-2 was studied on placenta and placental bed biopsies, obtained using a transcervical sampling technique, from normal human pregnancies between 8 and 19 wk gestation and at term. In the placenta, HO-2 immunostaining was prominent in syncytiotrophoblast in the first trimester and reduced toward term (P<0.0005). HO-2 endothelial immunostaining was weak in the first trimester, but increased by term (P<0.0005). Within the placental bed, HO-2 was expressed by CTB in cell columns, the cytotrophoblast shell, and cell islands. Both intravascular CTB and interstitial CTB expressed HO-2. HO-1 immunostaining was low in the placenta but intense on the CTB within the placental bed. A striking feature was the absence of HO-1 from the proximal layers of cell columns, with strong expression on the more distal CTB layers of the cell columns. In placental perfusion studies, a significant dose-dependent increase in perfusion pressure was observed in the presence of zinc protoporphyrin, an inhibitor of HO. These results suggest a role for CO in placental function, trophoblast invasion, and spiral artery transformation. Hemeoxygenase expression in human placenta and placental bed implies a role in regulation of trophoblast invasion and placental function."

Mice were orally administered alpha-tocopherol (200 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) alone, CoQ(10) (123 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) alone, or the two together for 13 wk. Administration of alpha-tocopherol resulted in an approximately sevenfold elevation of mitochondrial alpha-tocopherol content. Intake of CoQ(10) alone caused an approximately fivefold increase in CoQ content (CoQ(9) and/or CoQ(10)) and alpha-tocopherol of mitochondria. The rate of (O2(./-)) generation by submitochondrial particles (SMPs) was inversely related to their alpha-tocopherol content but unrelated to CoQ content. Experimental in vitro augmentation of SMPs with varying amounts of alpha-tocopherol caused an up to approximately 50% decrease in the rate of O2(./-) generation. Similar in vitro augmentations of SMPs with CoQ(10) had previously been found to have no effect on the rate of O2(./-) generation The CoQ(10)-induced elevation of alpha-tocopherol in the present study was inferred to be due to a 'sparing/regeneration' by CoQ.

https://openalex.org/W1543854743,"Antibodies (Abs) raised against the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) were used to investigate the role of ERalpha proteins located at the plasma membrane in mediating the rapid, estrogen-stimulated secretion of prolactin (PRL) from rat pituitary GH(3)/B6/F10 cells. Exposure of the cells to 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) significantly increased PRL release after 3 or 6 min. When ERalpha Abs that bind specifically to ERalpha but are too large to diffuse into cells were tested for activity at the cell membrane, Ab R4, targeted to an ERalpha hinge region sequence, increased PRL release in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Ab H151, directed against a different hinge region epitope, decreased PRL release and blocked the stimulatory action of E(2). Abs raised against the DNA binding domain (H226) or the carboxyl terminus (C542) were not biologically active. When each Ab was examined for recognition of ERalpha on the cell surface by immunocytochemistry, all except H151 generated immunostaining in aldehyde-fixed cells. In live cells, however, Ab H151 but not Ab R4 blocked the membrane binding of fluorescently tagged E(2)-BSA. Overall, the data indicate that plasma membrane ERalpha proteins mediate estrogen-stimulated PRL release from GH(3)/B6/F10 cells. These results may also convey information about conformationally sensitive areas of the membrane form of ERalpha involved in rapid, nongenomic responses to estrogens."

Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemenr P. Gomis-Ruth F.-X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). In many instances components of the extracellular matrix can serve as substrates for these metalloproteinases. Members of the metzincin family continue to be identified, and new functions are being recognized for enzymes previously described. Enzymes are classified into different metzincin families based on structural features of their catalytic domain. All metzincins are inhibited by chemicals that chelate the zinc ion (1.Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemenr P. Gomis-Ruth F.-X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Until recently, protein inhibitors had been characterized for only the MMP family. Endogenous MMP activity is mainly regulated by a family of proteins called tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP) (2.Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar). Four members of the TIMP family have been identified and are designated TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4. Molecular weights of these inhibitors range from 20,000 to 29,000 (3.Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond L.A. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30375-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Although the primary amino acid sequence identity between the TIMPs is low (3.Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond L.A. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30375-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 4.Apte S.S. Mattei M. Olsen B.R. Genomics. 1994; 19: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), their tertiary structure is thought be remarkably similar because of the conserved positions of 12 cysteine residues. These 12 cysteine residues form six disulfide bonds, and correct pairing of these residues is critical for TIMP inhibitory function (5.Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K.

Although TIMPs generally have a broad specificity with regard to MMP inhibition, TIMP-1 is often found associated with active and latent forms of MMP-9 (8.Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4583-4591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and TIMP-2 is often found associated with active and latent forms of MMP-2 (9.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17374-17378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Howard E.W. Banda M.J. J. Biol.

TIMP-3 is found associated with the extracellular matrix, and TIMP-4 may be expressed in a tissue-specific manner (2.Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the functions of TIMP have been broadened from inhibitors of only MMPs. TIMP-3 has been shown to inhibit TACE (tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme), a member of ADAM (12.Amour A. Augustin A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, theK i derived for TIMP-3 inhibition of TACE was much larger than that derived for inhibition of MMP-2. Additionally, TIMP-1 has been shown to inhibit aggrecanase, a recently described ADAM 13, 14). Because of their role in extracellular matrix remodeling, MMPs have been widely studied in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Expression of both MMP and TIMP has been shown to increase in some tumor cell lines. Several studies have shown that increase in the expression of TIMP can decrease the invasiveness of some tumor cell lines. For example, transfection of TIMP-1 cDNA into astrocytoma cells diminishes their invasive potential (15.Nakano A. Tani E. Miyazaki K. Yamamoto Y. Furuyama J. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 83: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16.Matsuzawa K Fukuyama K. Hubbard S.L. Dirks P.B. Rutka J.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Observations such as these suggest that modulation of metalloproteinase activity may be a significant control point for regulation of tumor cell invasion. Consequently, the presence of TIMP or other metalloproteinase inhibitors may be beneficial in controlling tumor cell invasion. Previously, during the course of investigating TIMP activity in cell lines derived from human brain tumors, our laboratory observed at least four metalloproteinase inhibitors present in the conditioned medium. Their molecular weights ranged from 29,000 to 16,500. Based on their molecular sizes, the inhibitors were most likely TIMP-1, at a molecular weight of 29,000, TIMP-3 and/or TIMP-4 at a molecular weight of 23,000, and TIMP-2 at a molecular weight of 20,000. However, the smallest inhibitor, migrating at an apparent molecular weight of 16,500, did not correspond to the molecular size of any known TIMP, and it was not detected in normal cells derived from brain (17.Apodaca G. Rutka J.T. Bouhana K. Berens M.E. Giblin J.R. Rosenblum M.L. McKerrow J.H. Banda M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2322-2329PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the smallest inhibitor may be specific to transformed cells arising in human brain tumors. In the present study, the 16,500 molecular weight inhibitor has been isolated, identified, and partially characterized. Results of this study show that the 16,500 molecular weight inhibitor is not a new member of the TIMP family, nor is it a truncated form of a previously identified TIMP. Instead our results indicate that the novel inhibitor is the C-terminal fragment of procollagen C-terminal proteinase enhancer (PCPE). Once confluent, U343-MGA or H4 cell lines were grown under serum-free conditions with 0.2% lactablumin hydrolysate added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in roller bottles. U343-MGA, a human neuroglioma cell line, was a gift from the Brain Tumor Research Center at University of California, San Francisco. H4, also a human neuroglioma cell line, was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and was grown in the presence of 80 nm phorbol ester. Medium conditioned by these cells was collected, NaN3 was added to a final concentration of 0.02%, and the medium was frozen until use. For each preparation, 3–5 liters of conditioned medium was filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper and concentrated by ultrafiltration through a YM-10 membrane (Amicon). The concentrated conditioned medium was circulated over gelatin-Sepharose to remove MMP-2 and MMP-9, as well as, TIMP-2 in complex with MMP-2 (10.Howard E.W. Banda M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17972-17977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein that did not bind the gelatin-Sepharose column, including the small molecular weight inhibitor, was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.02% NaN3 and applied to a heparin-Sepharose column. Bound protein was eluted using a gradient of 0 to 1m NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.02% NaN3. Fractions were collected and analyzed for the presence of MMP inhibitors by reverse zymography (18.Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2814-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The small molecular weight inhibitor typically eluted at approximately 625 mm NaCl. These fractions were pooled and passed over a lentil lectin column to adsorb TIMP-1, and the flow-through was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The material was then fractionated on a strong cation exchange column of SP Sephadex. A gradient of 0 to 1.5 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, was used to elute the protein. Fractions containing the 16.5-kDa inhibitor protein were identified by SDS-PAGE and by reverse zymography. The small molecular weight inhibitor eluted near the end of the gradient at 1.5 m NaCl. Samples prepared for amino acid sequence analysis were further fractionated by reverse phase liquid chromatography on a C4 column developed with a gradient of CH3CN in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (10.Howard E.W. Banda M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17972-17977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples used to test inhibitor activity were not passed over the reverse phase column because of the harsh fractionation conditions required. Instead, the small molecular weight inhibitor was purified from the last remaining contaminants by electroelution from SDS-PAGE using an ISCO concentrator. Electoelution was done according to the instructions provided by ISCO. Electrophoresis was done according to the method of Laemmli (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) using 15% acrylamide. Modifications to the sample buffer included a 4-fold increase in the amount of SDS and omission of β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Inhibitors were visualized using reverse zymography on 15% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (18.Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2814-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, samples containing inhibitors were subjected to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing 1% gelatin. After soaking in 2.5% Triton X-100, the gels were soaked in medium conditioned by rabbit synovial fibroblasts treated with phorbol ester (80 nm). This conditioned medium contains a variety of proteinases including several different MMPs. Conditioned medium was removed, and the gel was agitated in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% azide) overnight at 37 °C. Inhibitor bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue followed by destaining with a solution of methanol and acetic acid. To ensure staining was the result of inhibitor protection of the gelatin, a second gel was run in parallel with the reverse zymogram, but soaking in medium conditioned by synovial fibroblasts was omitted. A partially purified fraction of inhibitors from brain tumor conditioned medium (2 mg) was made 4 m with electrophoresis grade urea followed by addition of β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration, 0.14m). This solution was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The sample was then alkylated by addition of iodoacetamide (final concentration, 0.7 mm) and incubation in the dark for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with β-mercaptoethanol (0.14 m). For the urea control, a sample was made 4 m in urea and incubated in parallel without the addition of β-mercaptoethanol or iodoacetamide. Both samples were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3. The effect on inhibitory activity was analyzed by reverse zymography. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (20.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44933) Google Scholar) and probed with antibodies raised against TIMP-1, TIMP-2 (Oncogene/Calbiochem), or TIMP-3 (Chemicon). Antipeptide antibodies to the C-terminal region of PCPE were raised in rabbits against the peptide GQVEENRGPVL, corresponding to residues 402–412 of the human sequence (21.Takahara K. Kessler E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26280-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), linked via an aminohexanoic acid spacer to a C-terminal cysteine and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies were affinity-purified on columns of the same peptide coupled to TC gel (Quality Controlled Biochemicals) via the cysteine thiol (22.Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and ECL reagents were purchased from Amersham and used as instructed by the manufacturer. MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were purified from medium conditioned by brain tumor cells according to previously published protocols (10.Howard E.W. Banda M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17972-17977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse phase HPLC was used as the final step to strip TIMP-2 from MMP-2. Removal of TIMP-2, concentration of MMP-2 and repeated freeze thaw cycles of the enzyme resulted in a MMP-2 sample that was largely active as tested by gelatin zymography. CT-PCPE was purified as described above with electroelution rather that reverse phase HPLC as the final step. The substrate used was the quenched fluorescent peptide Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2(Bachem) (23.Murphy B. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and was used at a final concentration of 1 μm in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% azide. MMP-2 (final concentration, 2 nm) was mixed with varying concentrations of either TIMP-2 or CT-PCPE at room temperature followed by the addition of the substrate. Enzyme activity was monitored at 393 nm with excitation at 328 nm using a Perkin-Elmer LS-30 Luminescence Spectrophotometer. To produce recombinant human PCPE, a 1370 base pair PCR product was obtained using primers 5′-GATCGGATCCATGCTGCCTGCAGCCACAGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAGAAGCTTTCAGTCCTGGGACGCAGCAG-3′ (reverse), corresponding to nucleotides 61–81 and 1391–1410, respectively, of the reported human PCPE cDNA sequence (Ref. 21.Takahara K. Kessler E. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Eddy R.L. Jani-Sait S. Shows T.B. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol.

The ten additional bases of the forward and reverse primers contain BamHI and HindIII recognition sites, respectively. The PCR was performed on a model 480 Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer) under high fidelity/long distance PCR conditions (24.Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Aca. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar,25.Chang S. Fockler C. Barnes W.M. Higuchi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5695-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) using Taq Extender PCR additive (Stratagene) with denaturing at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 32 cycles of 98 °C for 7 s with annealing and extension at 68 °C for 3 min. Final incubation was at 70 °C for 8 min. Unamplified cDNA (2 ng) from human dermal fibroblasts (CLONTECH) was used as a template. The PCR product was sequenced on both strands to ensure fidelity, subcloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pFastBac1 transfer vector, and then recombined into a baculovirus shuttle vector propagated in Escherichia coliusing the Bac-To-Bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Resultant recombinant viral genomes were transfected into Sf21 insect cells. Infectious baculovirus were harvested at 72 h and then amplified 48 h in fresh Sf21 cells for high titer stocks. Conditioned medium containing approximately 2 μg/ml recombinant PCPE was harvested 4 days after infection of Sf21 with high titer stocks. All Sf21 cultures were in serum-free SF-900 IISFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCPE (270 pmol) was mixed with plasmin in a substrate to enzyme ratio of 37:1 (mol:mol) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The digestion proceeded for 2.5 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. One half of the sample (6.5 μg) was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel using a Bio-Rad mini gel apparatus and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The other half of the sample was analyzed by reverse zymography. To diminish the activity of plasmin in reverse zymography, the substrate buffer contained 2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. An additional sample was prepared and analyzed by immunoblot using antipeptide antibodies that recognize the C-terminal region of PCPE. Protein to be sequenced was resolved by electrophoresis on a 15% acrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-Psq, Millipore) (26.Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized on the membrane by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Amino acid sequence analysis was performed by the Biomolecular Resource Center at University of California, San Francisco. As previously reported (17.Apodaca G. Rutka J.T. Bouhana K. Berens M.E. Giblin J.R. Rosenblum M.L. McKerrow J.H. Banda M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2322-2329PubMed Google Scholar), medium conditioned by some human brain tumor cell lines contains at least four inhibitors as detected by reverse zymography. Except for the smallest inhibitor, with an apparent molecular weight of 16,500, the molecular weights of the inhibitors observed by reverse zymography correspond to those of known TIMPs. To examine the proteinase class targeted by the small molecular weight inhibitor migrating at 16,500, medium conditioned by human brain tumor cells was analyzed by reverse zymography. Inhibitor activity was developed in the presence of either the metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline (10 mm) or the serine proteinase inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (2 mm). Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride had no effect on the development of inhibitory activity for any of the four brain tumor inhibitors. This indicated that serine proteases were not likely targets for the inhibition observed on reverse zymography (data not shown). However, as expected for the TIMPs, 1,10-phenanthroline interfered with the development of inhibitor activity in reverse zymography. In addition, the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline also interfered with development of inhibitor activity of the 16,500 molecular weight protein. Gelatin substrate was not protected in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline, indicating that a metalloproteinase was required for the detection of inhibitor bands that are normally detected in the absence of the chelator. Protein amounts of all four inhibitors were not in sufficient quantity to stain through the gelatin background. This was confirmed by running a polyacrylamide gel in parallel with the reverse zymography. The only protein band observed was the contaminant migrating at approximately 43,000 molecular weight (data not shown). This contaminant was also observed to stain through the gelatin background in reverse zymography independent of the absence or presence of 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 1). Thus, the 43,000 molecular weight protein was classified as a contaminating protein and not as an inhibitor. Because development of inhibitory activity was sensitive to the presence of 1,10-phanthroline, the polypeptide migrating at 16,500 molecular weight was designated a metalloproteinase inhibitor. Several studies have shown the importance of correct disulfide bond pairing for inhibitory activity of TIMP (5.Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 6.Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32141-32149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To further characterize the small inhibitor, the requirement for disulfide bonds was analyzed. A partially purified protein fraction from human brain tumor conditioned medium containing all four inhibitors was reduced and alkylated under denaturing conditions. Inhibitor function was then analyzed by reverse zymography. Reduction and alkylation completely abolished the inhibitory activity of the known TIMPs as well as that of the 16,500 molecular weight metalloproteinase inhibitor (Fig. 1). However, simply denaturing the sample with urea was not sufficient to produce complete loss of inhibitor function for the TIMPs or for the 16,500 molecular weight inhibitor. These results indicated that, like TIMP, the novel 16,500 molecular weight inhibitor was specific for metalloproteinases and required intact disulfide bonds for inhibitory function. It has been shown that carboxyl-truncated TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 retain metalloproteinase inhibitory function because inhibitory activity resides in the amino domain of TIMP (27.Miyazaki K. Funahashi K. Numata Y. Koshikawa N. Akaogi K. Kikkawa Y. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14387-14393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Because the small inhibitor behaved as a TIMP, the inhibitory activity observed at molecular weight 16,500 on reverse zymography could be derived from a functional TIMP fragment. To test this, Western blot analysis was used to examine a partially purified protein fraction containing all four inhibitor activities. Antibodies directed against TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 reacted only with proteins corresponding to inhibitors of apparent molecular weights of 29,000 and 20,000, respectively. When this sample was tested for reactivity with anti-TIMP-3 antibody, a protein at molecular weight of approximately 23,000 was recognized, but no reactivity in the range of the small molecular weight inhibitor was observed (Fig.2). This indicated that the smallest inhibitor was not a fragment of TIMP-1, TIMP-2, or TIMP-3. To identify the protein responsible for the inhibitory function observed at molecular weight 16,500, inhibitors were isolated using a series of chromatography steps. The chromatography included: gelatin-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, lentil lectin, SP-Sephadex, and reverse phase HPLC. At all steps, column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE and reverse zymography. Reverse phase HPLC was used for the final step prior to amino acid sequence analysis. A single protein band was present on SDS-PAGE following HPLC purification (Fig. 3), and this sample was used for amino acid sequence analysis. Although activity of the TIMPs was not affected by exposure to the conditions used in reverse phase HPLC, the activity of the 16,500 molecular weight inhibitor was diminished on reverse zymography after HPLC purification. Therefore, when evaluation of activity was required, the HPLC step was replaced with electroelution. As shown in Fig. 3, eletroelution of the 16,500 molecular weight region from a preparatory electrophoresis gel subsequently produced inhibitor activity when analyzed by reverse zymography. From a typical purification of approximately 5 liters of serum-free medium conditioned by human brain tumor cells, 1.6 μg of active protein was recovered. From two independent preparations of HPLC purified inhibitor, five different N termini were detected. All five sequences identified from preparations of the small molecular weight inhibitor matched amino acid sequences near the C terminus of a protein previously described as PCPE (21.Takahara K. Kessler E. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Eddy R.L. Jani-Sait S. Shows T.B. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26280-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). None of the five sequences contained an N-terminal sequence identical to that of a TIMP. However, comparison of CT-PCPE with the amino domain of TIMP revealed that each contained six cysteine residues. In the case of TIMP, they form three disulfide bonds critical for inhibitory function (5.Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 6.Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32141-32149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Results shown in Fig. 1 indicated that the six cysteine residues in CT-PCPE may also form disulfide bonds critical for inhibitory function. Based on the apparent molecular weight of the inhibitor, all five fragments represented polypeptides that contained the majority of the C-terminal domain of PCPE. The N termini of four of the five fragments were consistent with proteolysis by a serine proteinase. These results suggested that the inhibitory activity observed at 16,500 molecular weight was not a TIMP but was C-terminal fragment(s) of PCPE. This activity has been designated CT-PCPE, for C-terminal PCPE. Generation of most of the identified fragments was consistent with processing of PCPE by a serine proteinase that was present either in the conditioned medium or on the surface of the brain tumor cells. Amino acid sequence analysis of the CT-PCPE fragments suggested that serine proteinases might be involved in the processing of PCPE. It has previously been shown that trypsin can degrade PCPE in vitro, which releases an active N-terminal region that has PCP/BMP-1 enhancing activity (29.Kessler E. Mould A.P. Hulmes D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Presumably, a serine proteinase found on the cell surface or one that was secreted into the conditioned medium was responsible for processing PCPE to the inhibitor CT-PCPE. To test whether inhibitory fragments could be released by degradation of PCPE with a serine proteinase, PCPE was expressed in a baculovirus system. Baculovirus was chosen because insect cells do not secrete TIMP. The expressed PCPE protein was digested with plasmin, and the resulting degradation fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis and reverse zymography. The total number of peptide fragments generated by plasmin degradation was examined by staining with"

This suggests that zinc finger proteins may be primary targets of NO-induced stress. In this study, the specific interaction of the heterodimeric complex of two zinc finger transcription factors, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)) receptor (VDR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) with 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) response elements (VDREs), was used as a model system. NO was applied to this system via the NO donors SNOC and MAMA/NO and caused a dose-dependent inhibition of VDR-RXR-VDRE complex formation (IC(50) values 0.5-0.8 mM). Ligand-bound or preformed complexes displayed less sensitivity to NO-induced stress. These in vitro effects of NO were found to be reversible. Functional assays in transiently transfected cells indicated that NO can also act in vivo as a repressor of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) signaling (IC(50) value of the slow NO donor DETA/NO, 0.5 mM). These findings suggest that NO has a modulatory role on transcription factors depending on their sensitivity to NO-induced stress, thus providing a mechanism for a gene regulatory function of NO."
https://openalex.org/W1768251043,"The control of mRNA stability is becoming recognized as a crucial point of gene expression regulation. A common element responsible for mRNA decay modulation is the adenine- and uracil-rich element that is found in the 3' untranslated region of numerous mRNAs subjected to fast expression changes in response to various stimuli. Previously we identified a post-transcriptional regulation level for the antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene, which could be involved in t(14;18) lymphoma-associated bcl-2 overexpression. Here we demonstrate that bcl-2 mRNA is endowed with an adenine- and uracil-rich element (ARE) characterized by high evolutionary conservation not only among all chordates examined, but even between chordates and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (ced-9 gene). As for other well-established destabilizing AREs, the insertion of the bcl-2 ARE downstream from stable beta-globin mRNA causes an enhanced decay of the beta-globin transcript, which proves its functional role. This possibility is corroborated by the fact that the pathway leading to the modulating activity of bcl-2 ARE is influenced by PKC, since the addition of DAG and TPA markedly attenuated the bcl-2 ARE destabilizing potential. Conversely, it is noteworthy that when C(2)-ceramide is added to the culture medium as the apoptotic agent, the beta-globin transcript harboring the bcl-2 ARE undergoes a dramatic increase in decay. This observation clearly indicates that the destabilizing function of bcl-2 ARE is enhanced by apoptotic stimuli and suggests that this element could be involved in a post-transcriptional mechanism of bcl-2 down-regulation during apoptosis. The half-life of the mRNA of bcl-2 in Jurkat cells is prolonged by PKC stimulation and shortened by C(2)-ceramide addition, strongly supporting the view that bcl-2 mRNA stability plays a physiological role in modulating bcl-2 expression, particularly in its down-regulation during apoptosis. Thus, this element becomes a new candidate for mediating those bcl-2 gene expression changes-from apoptosis-associated down-regulation to tumor-associated overexpression-observed thus far that profoundly influence single cell fate and tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2130969923,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) require heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as cofactors for signaling. The heparan sulfate chains (HS) mediate stable high affinity binding of FGFs to their receptor tyrosine kinases (FR) and may specifically regulate FGF activity. A novel in situ binding assay was developed to examine the ability of HSPGs to promote FGF/FR binding using a soluble FR fusion construct (FR1-AP). This fusion protein probe forms a dimer in solution, simulating the dimerization or oligomerization that is thought to occur at the cell surface physiologically. In frozen sections of human skin, FGF-2 binds to keratinocytes and basement membranes of epidermis and dermal blood vessels. In contrast, in skin preincubated with FGF-2, FR1-AP binds avidly to FGF-2 immobilized on keratinocyte cell surfaces, but fails to bind to basement membranes at the dermo-epidermal junction or dermal microvessels despite the fact that these structures bind large amounts of FGF-2. Apparently, basement membrane and cell surface HSPGs differ in their ability to mediate the assembly of a FGF/FR signaling complex presumably due to structural differences of the heparan sulfate chains."
https://openalex.org/W2050618862,"In budding yeast, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) plays a central role in the nutritional control of metabolism, cell cycle, and transcription. This study shows that both the regulatory subunit Bcy1p and the catalytic subunit Tpk1p associated with it are predominantly localized in the nucleus of rapidly growing cells. Activation of nuclear PKA by cAMP leads to fast entry of a significant part of Tpk1p into the cytoplasm, while the regulatory subunit remains nuclear. In contrast to rapidly proliferating cells, both Bcy1p and Tpk1p are distributed over nucleus and cytoplasm in cells growing on a nonfermentable carbon source or in stationary phase cells. These results demonstrate that at least two different mechanisms determine the subcellular localization of PKA; cAMP controls the localization of Tpk1p, and the carbon source determines that of Bcy1p. The N-terminal domain of Bcy1p serves to target it properly during logarithmic and stationary phase. Studies with Bcy1p mutant versions unable to concentrate in the nucleus revealed that cells producing them are less viable in stationary phase than wild type cells, display delayed reproliferation following transfer to fresh growth medium, and, as diploids, exhibit reduced efficiency of sporulation.

A-kinase anchor protein protein kinase A polymerase chain reaction nuclear export signal green fluorescent protein 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol hemagglutinin fluorescence-activated cell sorting wild type In all classes of living cells, extracellular signals regulate intracellular processes via signal transduction pathways. Numerous such pathways have been identified, and this raises important questions about cross-talk, timing, and specificity of signaling. One level of control to ensure signal specificity is to localize proteins involved in signaling to specific subcellular compartments. Differential compartmentation has been demonstrated for a growing number of transcription factors and protein kinases that translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus or vice versa in response to extracellular signals (1.Toone W.M. Jones N. Genes Cell. 1998; 3: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 2.Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Signaling complexes have been identified that are specifically localized by means of scaffold or anchor proteins, respectively. Scaffold proteins bind different components of a signaling pathway, simultaneously ensuring specificity and efficiency of signaling. Ste5p is an example of a scaffolding system in yeast, which coordinates the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade involved in the mating type response (3.Elion A. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 322-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Proteins functioning as anchors may target signaling molecules to specific subcellular sites. In mammalian cells, A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs)1 function as adaptor proteins targeting RII type cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to various specific intracellular structures (4.Dell'Acqua M.L.

Activation of PKA takes place by binding of two cAMP molecules to each regulatory subunit, resulting in dissociation and thereby activation of the catalytic subunits (8.Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P.

The addition of this sugar to derepressed cells leads to a transient increase in cAMP levels (13.Francois J. Van Schaftingen E. Hers H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and consequently to activation of PKA. This transient activation is supposed to facilitate the transition from respiratory to fermentative growth (14.Thevelein J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15.Jiang Y. Davis C. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6942-6951Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Studies with mutants with high or low PKA activity, respectively, confirm the role of this protein kinase in nutritional signaling. For instance, bcy1Δ mutants, which display a constitutive high activity of PKA, do not accumulate reserve carbohydrates, cannot grow on carbon sources other than glucose, are stress-sensitive, do not sporulate, and have very low viability in stationary phase. Most of these phenotypes are reversed to the opposite extreme in mutants with constitutive low PKA activity (16.Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). A subset of these phenotypes is explained, at least partially, by defective regulation of gene transcription in the respective PKA mutants. Most notably, transcription of stress-induced genes bearing stress response elements in their promoter region is repressed by PKA activity (17.Marchler G. Schüller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar,18.Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). These cis-acting elements are occupied only under stress conditions by at least two functionally redundant transcription factors, Msn2p and Msn4p, which mediate stress-induced transcription (19.Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schüller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Recently, regulation of the localization of these factors by PKA was described. Low PKA activity allows entry of Msn2p and Msn4p into the nucleus, while high PKA activity stimulates export and inhibits import (20.Gorner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Here we describe the localization of both regulatory and catalytic subunits of PKA in budding yeast. We found that the localization of Bcy1p is regulated according to the nutritional status of yeast cells and have identified the N-terminal domain of this protein as sufficient for proper targeting. Mutants with constitutively cytoplasmic PKA are less viable in stationary phase than wild type cells and are delayed in the reentry into the cell cycle upon resuspension in fresh growth medium. Yeast strains used are as follows: W303-1A (MATa ade2 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3), MR1 (W303-1A bcy1::LEU2), JW1 (W303-1A bcy1::URA3), EI1 (W303-1A/W303-1A bcy1::URA3 bcy1::LEU2), PA2F2 (W303-1A bcy1::LEU2 pde2::TRP1[313HBwt]), PA3F3 (W303-1A bcy1::LEU2 pde2::TRP1[313HBΔN2]), and TH5 (MATa leu2–3 leu2–112 ura3–52 trp1–1 his3–532 his4 cyr1::LEU2 CAM) (21.Hall D.D. Markwardt D.D. Parviz F. Heideman W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4370-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). EI1 was generated by crossing MR1 and JW1. TH5 was a generous gift by W. Heideman. Yeast media were prepared as described (22.Rose M. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). To obtain cells in stationary phase, cultures were grown in YPD (supplemented with 60 mg/liter adenine sulfate) or SC medium (at least) 5 days at 30 °C. For reproliferation experiments, cells were resuspended in fresh growth medium at A 600 of 0.25. To achieve sporulation, diploid cells were grown in YPD toA 600 of 1.0; subsequently, glucose was added to a final concentration of 10% (w/v), and cells were grown for an additional 6 h. They were then inoculated in YP-acetate atA 600 of 0.1, grown overnight, washed, and resuspended in sporulation medium. Sporulation efficiency was determined after 48 h of incubation. All plasmids used in this study are shown in Table I. Plasmid 33pAGT was generated as follows. A PCR fragment of TPK1 was generated using oligonucleotides 5′-CTT CAG GAT CCG TCG ACT GGC GGC CGC ACT GAA GAA CAA AAT GGA G-3′ and 5′-CAA GAG GAA TTC TTA CCC CCA CAT TCT AAT AAT AA-3′ for a PCR with yeast genomic DNA as template and was cloned inBamHI–EcoRI in YCplac33 (23.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). This introduced aNotI site directly after the start of the TPK1coding region. Then a GFP NotI cassette (20.Gorner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) was introduced in the NotI site, and subsequently aSpeI–HindIII fragment from plasmid Ycp50-TPK1 (a generous gift from H. de Winde) corresponding to the downstream part ofTPK1 was inserted. Finally, the ADH1 promoter was amplified from yeast genomic DNA as template with primers 5′-CTA AAC CGC GGA ATA TTT CGG GAT ATC-3′ and 5′-ACC ATG GTA TAT GAG ATA GTT GAT TGT ATG C-3′. This PCR fragment was cut withNcoI–HindIII and placed upstream ofGFP-TPK1, bringing the fusion gene under control of theADH1 promoter. Plasmid 33pAGHT was generated by introducing a triple copy of the HA epitope (24.Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1955-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) into the NotI site of 33pAGT directly downstream of GFP. BCY1 was amplified by PCR using a plasmid-borne copy as template with primers 5′-GAC TGG ATC CAT GGT ATC TTC TTT GCC C-3′ and 5′-GAT GGA ATT CAT CGA TCT GTG TGG ATA GGGG-3′, cut with BamHI–EcoRI, and subcloned correspondingly in plasmid 33pAGHT using a unique BamHI site directly after the second HA epitope and thereby replacingTPK1 by BCY1. This resulted in plasmid 33pAGHB. Deletions of BCY1 were made as follows. PCR fragments were generated using the forward primers ΔN1 (5′-CGC GGA TCC AAG GCC AGG GAG CCT G-3′), ΔN2 (5′-CGC GGA TCC ACT AGA GAA AAG ACA TCA AC-3′), and ΔN3 (5′-CGC GGA TCC CGT AAT AAC TT CTG TTC AA-3′) and reverse primer 5′-GAT GGA ATT CAT CGA TCT GTG TGG ATA GGG G-3′, resulting in DNA fragments corresponding to deletions ΔN1, ΔN2, and ΔN3 (see Fig. 3 A). These were cut with EcoRI andBamHI and cloned in plasmid 33pAGHB. Similarly, PCR fragments were made using reverse primers ΔC1 (5′-TTT CTG CAG TTA ATG CTG TTG TTC TTC CTG-3′), ΔC2 (5′-TTT CTG CAG TTA GAT CGA TTT TTC CAG TCT TTG-3′), and ΔC3 (5′-TTT CTG CAG TTA CTT GAG GAA CGC TCT CTG-3′) with forward primer 5′-GAC TGG ATC CAT GGT ATC TTC TT GCC C-3′, resulting in DNA fragments corresponding to ΔC1, ΔC2, and ΔC3 (see Fig. 3 A). These were cut with PstI andBamHI and cloned in plasmid 33pAGHBwt. To bring theGFP-HA2-BCY1 fusion under control of the authenticBCY1 promoter, this region was amplified from yeast genomic DNA as template using oligonucleotide primers 5′-AGA TGA TCG ATG CAT GCC ACC ACG AC-5′ and 5′-CCG GAA TTC CAT GGA TCC CGT TTA TTC TTA CTG TTG TC-3′, cut with EcoRI and ClaI, and cloned in pRS313 (25.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then a double-stranded linker oligonucleotide 5′-CATG GGC GGC CGC GAA TTC GAG CT-3′ and 5′-CCG CCG GCG CTT AAG C-3′ was inserted (NcoI–SacI) directly downstream of theBCY1 promoter region, resulting in plasmid 313pBL. Subsequently, the NcoI–EcoRI DNA fragment containing GFP-HA-BCY1 from plasmid 33pAGHBwt was subcloned in 313pBL, resulting in plasmid 313GHBwt. Plasmids 313HBwt, 313HBΔN1, and 313HBΔN2 were generated by subcloning theNotI–EcoRI fragments from the corresponding 33pAGHB deletion series in 313pBL. In 313GHBwt, a double-stranded oligonucleotide obtained by annealing oligonucleotides 5′-ATG AAT GAA TTA GCC TTG AAA TTA GCA GGT CTT GAT ATC AAC AAG ATG CAT GC-3′ and 5′-CAT GGC ATG CAT CTT GTT GAT ATC AAG ACC TGC TAA TTT CAA GGC TAA TTC ATT-3′, which encode the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor nuclear export signal (NES) flanked by sequences required for cloning and determination of orientation, was inserted in theNcoI site. This resulted in plasmid 313NES-HBwt, in which the NES is placed at the N terminus of the HA tag.Table IPlasmids usedPlasmidDescription33pAGTGFP-TPK1fusion under control of a truncated ADH1 promoter inCEN,ARS,URA3 vector YCplac3333pATTPK1under control of a truncated ADH1 promoter in CEN, ARS, URA3 vector YCplac3333pAGHBwtGFP-HA-BCY1fusion under control of a truncated ADH1 promoter inCEN,ARS,URA3 vector YCplac3333pAGHBΔN1Plasmid 33pAGHBwt with Bcy1p deleted for amino acids 1–4833pAGHBΔN2Plasmid 33pAGHBwt with Bcy1p deleted for amino acids 1–12433pAGHBΔN3Plasmid 33pAGHBwt with Bcy1p deleted for amino acids 1–17933pAGHBΔC3Plasmid 33pAGHBwt with Bcy1p deleted for amino acids 49–41633pAGHBΔC1Plasmid 33pAGHBwt with Bcy1p deleted for amino acids 125–41633pAGHBΔC2Plasmid 33pAGHBwt with Bcy1p deleted for amino acids 180–416313GHBwtGFP-HA-BCY1 fusion under control of theBCY1 promoter in CEN,ARS,HIS3 vector pRS313313HBwtHA-BCY1 fusion under control of theBCY1 promoter in CEN,ARS,HIS3 vector pRS313313HBΔN1Plasmid 313HBwt with Bcy1p deleted for amino acids 1–48313HBΔN2Plasmid 313HBwt with Bcy1p deleted for amino acids 1–124313NES-HBwtPlasmid 313HBwt with the PKI NES fused to HA-BCY1 Open table in a new tab Cells were used for fluorescence microscopy directly without fixation. Nuclei were stained by the addition of 5 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI) to the cell suspension. All cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope. Images were taken with a Quantix CCD camera using IP LAB software, processed in Adobe Photoshop 4.0, and printed on an Epson Stylus Photo printer. Fixation and staining was carried out as described by Nasmyth et al. (26.Nasmyth K. Adolf G. Lydall D. Seddon A. Cell. 1990; 62: 631-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). HA-tagged Bcy1p was detected by anti-HA antibodies (12CA5 mouse IgG), and indirect immunofluorescence was achieved by using goat anti-mouse IgG CYC3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). Samples were drawn containing about 107 cells and fixed immediately in 70% ethanol. Cells were washed and resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, and treated with RNase (0.4 mg/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. Then cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 5 mg/ml pepsin dissolved in 55 mm HCl, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking. DNA was stained by resuspending the cells in a buffer containing 180 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 190 mm NaCl, 70 mm MgCl2, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and sonicated briefly. For each time point taken, 10,000 cells were measured for DNA content with a Becton Dickinson FACScan using LysisII software. To study the localization of PKA in living cells, we fused GFP to the N termini of the regulatory subunit Bcy1p and one of the catalytic subunit isoforms, Tpk1p. These fusion proteins were found to be functional, since GFP-Bcy1p produced in a bcy1Δ strain restored the ability of this mutant to grow on carbon sources other than glucose. GFP-TPK1 expressed in a tpk1 tpk2 tpk3 triple deletion strain complemented the otherwise lethal phenotype of such a strain (data not shown). Since cAMP is known to cause dissociation of Tpk1p and Bcy1p, we determined whether intracellular cAMP levels regulate the localization of these fusion proteins. The strain TH5 used for this experiment allows manipulation of intracellular cAMP levels due to a deletion of the adenylate cyclase gene (CYR1). It bears an additional mutation (CAM), allowing uptake of cAMP (21.Hall D.D. Markwardt D.D. Parviz F. Heideman W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4370-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GFP-Bcy1p was found nuclear both in the presence and absence of cAMP (Fig.1 A). Although GFP-Bcy1p production in this experiment was driven by a truncated ADH1promoter (up to position −410 relative to the transcription start, lacking its main upstream activating sequence (27.Tornow J. Santangelo G.M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)), a similar localization of this fusion protein was detected when it was produced from its own promoter in cells grown on glucose (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Subcellular localization of GFP-Bcy1p (A) or HA-Bcy1p (C) in cells grown on glucose or ethanol and in stationary phase cells. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out with strain MR1 transformed with GFP-Bcy1p-encoding plasmid 313GHBwt (A) or with control plasmid 313HBwt (B) grown to logarithmic phase on YPD or YPE and to stationary phase on YPD. C, indirect immunofluorescence of MR1 cells transformed with 313HBwt, using anti-HA antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the case of GFP-Tpk1p, expression from the authentic TPK1promoter was too weak for us to observe fluorescence (data not shown). To increase expression, the GFP-TPK1 fusion was expressed under control of a similar truncated ADH1 promoter as for GFP-Bcy1p, resulting in a moderate overexpression. When cells expressing this construct were briefly starved for cAMP, GFP-Tpk1p was found predominantly localized in the nucleus, but subsequent addition of cAMP led to redistribution of Tpk1p throughout the cell within about 10 min (Fig. 1 B). This effect is independent of de novoprotein sythesis, since it occurs also in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 1 C). Fig. 1 D shows that autofluorescence of cells studied is very low, indicating that the observed fluorescence is derived specifically from the GFP derivatives. The results summarized in Fig. 1 show that, under the experimental conditions used here, catalytically inactive PKA holoenzyme resides in the nucleus. On the other hand, when the catalytic Tpk1p subunit is released from the regulatory subunit upon activation by high intracellular cAMP, it does partly enter the cytoplasm. We followed the subcellular localization of a GFP-Bcy1p fusion, making use of the native BCY1 promoter, under different physiological conditions. Similar to the situation shown in Fig. 1, GFP-Bcy1p was found predominantly nuclear in wild type cells (W303-1A) grown on glucose (Fig. 2 A). However, in cells grown on ethanol (or on various other nonfermentable carbon sources) a significant portion of the fusion protein was found extranuclear, an effect that became even more pronounced in stationary phase cells (Fig.2 A; data obtained for the other carbon sources not shown). The fluorescence observed is derived specifically from GFP fusion protein, since the levels of autofluorescence were found to be very low in logarithmic and stationary phase cells (Fig. 2 B). The observations made with GFP-Bcy1p were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence of fixed cells using a HA-tagged Bcy1p (Fig.2 C). Also with this method, we found that in glucose-grown cells HA-Bcy1p is predominantly nuclear and distributed over nucleus and cytoplasm in cells grown on ethanol (this method did not allow us to study stationary phase cells, since such cells could not be spheroplasted). The cytoplasmic localization of Bcy1p observed seemed to be a specific growth phase and/or carbon source effect, since treatment of glucose-grown cells with stress agents (salt or ethanol), starvation for nitrogen overnight, or mating factor arrest did not have any influence on nuclear localization (data not shown). These observations rule out the possibility that cytoplasmic localization of Bcy1p is caused by a decrease of general metabolic activity or by a cell cycle arrest per se. In summary, the results obtained demonstrate that Bcy1p is predominantly nuclear in rapidly growing cells but is distributed over nucleus and cytoplasm in cells grown on ethanol and in stationary phase cells. As a first step toward identification of the molecular mechanism of control of Bcy1p localization, we decided to identify the protein domain responsible for subcellular targeting. It has been reported previously (8.Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Scott J.D. McMullen B. Hurwitz M. Krebs E.G. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) that Bcy1p exhibits high sequence conservation to the C-terminal cAMP binding pockets and to the catalytic subunit association domain (or hinge region) of its mammalian counterparts (Fig. 3 A). The yeast N terminus, however, does not exhibit any homology and is longer than that of mammalian RII regulatory subunits (8.Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Scott J.D. McMullen B. Hurwitz M. Krebs E.G. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Moreover, the extreme N terminus of mammalian RII interacts with AKAPs that localize this protein to various subcellular locations (28.Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Hastings C.A. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24245-24251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore carried out a deletion analysis of the Bcy1p part of a GFP-Bcy1p fusion. Removal of the N-terminal extension (ΔN1) led to a significant decrease of nuclear accumulation of Bcy1p, but deletion of the whole nonconserved N terminus (ΔN2) resulted in an almost even nucleocytoplasmic distribution of fluorescence in logarithmic cells (Fig. 3 B). An even more extended deletion, including the hinge region (ΔN3), gave results similar to those obtained with the ΔN2 deletion (data not shown). We then tried to address whether the N-terminal domain is sufficient for proper targeting by determining the subcellular location of C-terminal deletions of Bcy1p (ΔC1–C3). Fusion of the first 48 N-terminal amino acids to GFP (ΔC3) was sufficient for nuclear accumulation although somewhat less efficient than in the case of full-length Bcy1p. When the whole N-terminal region was fused to GFP (ΔC1) or when the hinge region was also present (ΔC2), efficient nuclear concentration was observed (Fig.3 B and data not shown). Moreover, GFP fusions containing only the Bcy1p N-terminal domain are also distributed over nucleus and cytoplasm upon transition into stationary phase (Fig. 3 C). Based on these results, we conclude that the first 124 N-terminal amino acids of Bcy1p are necessary and sufficient for proper nutrient-regulated subcellular targeting. In wild type cells growing on glucose, GFP-Tpk1p was found to be concentrated in the nucleus, with a significant portion being present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 A). The fact that GFP-Tpk1p is concentrated in the nucleus (although cAMP levels are supposed to be relatively high under these conditions) probably indicates that a subpopulation of GFP-Tpk1p is still bound to Bcy1p, since the latter protein is exclusively nuclear under these conditions (Figs. 1 and 2). Importantly, in stationary phase, when Bcy1p is evenly distributed through the nucleus and cytoplasm, this nuclear concentration of GFP-Tpk1p is not observed (Fig. 4 A). To study whether the nuclear accumulation of GFP-Tpk1p is indeed dependent on nuclear Bcy1p, we created two strains, PA2F2 and PA3F3, which are deleted for chromosomally encoded BCY1 but express a plasmid-borne copy of full-length BCY1 (strain PA2F2) and a mutant allele of BCY1 expressing an N-terminal truncated version of Bcy1p (ΔN2; strain PA3F3), respectively. Both strains were transformed with a plasmid encoding GFP-Tpk1p. As shown in Fig.4 B, strain PA2F2 (with wild type Bcy1p) displayed nuclear accumulation of GFP-Tpk1p. In contrast, in strain PA3F3 (Bcy1ΔN2), GFP-Tpk1p has lost most of its nuclear accumulation. These results demonstrate that nuclear concentration of GFP-Tpk1p in rapidly growing cells is dependent on correspondingly localized Bcy1p. If nuclear concentration of GFP-Tpk1p is dependent on association with nuclear Bcy1p, then this would be abolished by high intracellular cAMP levels comparable with what is shown in Fig. 1 A, where nuclear accumulation of GFP-Tpk1p is lost after the addition of cAMP. Strain PA2F2 (with full-length Bcy1p) used in the experiment shown in Fig.4 B bears a deletion of PDE2. This makes it responsive to extracellular cAMP. The addition of 3 mm cAMP to this strain abolished nuclear accumulation of GFP-Tpk1p, resulting in a nucleocytoplasmic distribution of GFP-Tpk1p (results not shown), similar to the results shown in Fig. 1 B. These findings illustrate that Tpk1p does not possess an intrinsic capacity to concentrate in the nucleus but that its accumulation in the nucleus is dependent on interaction with Bcy1p localized correspondingly. Strain MR1 (bcy1) transformants bearing a plasmid-borne wild type BCY1 allele or BCY1alleles deleted for the N-terminal nuclear targeting region (ΔN1 and ΔN2) display equal growth rates on both glucose and ethanol (TableII), demonstrating that mislocalization of PKA does not have a significant impact on culture growth under these conditions. Transcription of a number of PKA-regulated genes was studied in such cells by Northern analysis. The increase of mRNA levels of several genes controlled via stress response elements or similar elements (HXK1, HSP104, DDR2,SSA3) (29.Boorstein W.R. Craig E.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2543-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30.Moskvina E. Schüller C. Maurer C.T.C. Mager W.H. Ruis H. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) was not affected in mutant cells grown into stationary phase. The level of ribosomal protein L25 gene transcript, which is positively controlled by PKA (31.Klein C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell.

Lett. 1994; 123: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was also completely unaffected in Bcy1p mislocalization mutants (data not shown). Consistent with the data on stress response element-controlled genes, we could not observe any difference in the subcellular localization of an Msn2p-GFP fusion (20.Gorner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) under a variety of conditions known to affect this subcellular localization (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W1819087145,"Adult-onset, long-term caloric restriction (CR) prolongs maximum life span in laboratory rodents. However, the effect of this intervention on an organism's ability to cope with a physical challenge has not been explored. We investigated the influence of CR and aging on stress tolerance in old rats exposed to an environmental heating protocol on two consecutive days. We hypothesized that CR would increase heat tolerance by reducing cellular stress and subsequent accrual of oxidative injury. All calorically restricted rats survived both heat exposures compared with only 50% of their control-fed counterparts. CR also decreased heat-induced radical generation, stress protein accumulation, and cellular injury in the liver. In addition, heat stress stimulated marked induction of the antioxidant enzymes manganese-containing superoxide dismutase and catalase, along with strong nuclear catalase expression in liver samples from rats subjected to CR. In contrast, stress-related induction of antioxidant enzymes was blunted, and nuclear catalase expression was unchanged from euthermic conditions in the control-fed group. These data suggest that CR reduces cellular injury and improves heat tolerance of old animals by lowering radical production and preserving cellular ability to adapt to stress through antioxidant enzyme induction and translocation of these proteins to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1903340475,"Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the main donor of methyl groups in the cell. In mammals MAT is the product of two genes, MAT1A and MAT2A. MAT1A is expressed only in the mature liver whereas fetal hepatocytes, extrahepatic tissues and liver cancer cells express MAT2A. The mechanisms behind the tissue and differentiation state specific MAT1A expression are not known. In the present work we examined MAT1A promoter methylation status by means of methylation sensitive restriction enzyme analysis. Our data indicate that MAT1A promoter is hypomethylated in liver and hypermethylated in kidney and fetal rat hepatocytes, indicating that this modification is tissue specific and developmentally regulated. Immunoprecipitation of mononucleosomes from liver and kidney tissues with antibodies mainly specific to acetylated histone H4 and subsequent Southern blot analysis with a MAT1A promoter probe demonstrated that MAT1A expression is linked to elevated levels of chromatin acetylation. Early changes in MAT1A methylation are already observed in the precancerous cirrhotic livers from rats, which show reduced MAT1A expression. Human hepatoma cell lines in which MAT1A is not expressed were also hypermethylated at this locus. Finally we demonstrate that MAT1A expression is reactivated in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin, suggesting a role for DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation in MAT1A silencing."
https://openalex.org/W1799724127,"In 1988, the National Institute on Aging launched a 10-year program aimed at identification of biomarkers of aging. Previous results from our laboratory showed that pentosidine, an advanced glycation product, formed in skin collagen at a rate inversely related to maximum life span across several mammalian species. As part of the Biomarkers Program, we investigated the hypothesis that longitudinal determination of glycation and glycoxidation rates in skin collagen could predict longevities in ad libitum-fed (AL) and caloric restricted (CR) mice. C57BL/6NNia male mice were biopsied at age 20 months and at natural death. Glycation (furosine method) was assessed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and the glycoxidation products carboxymethyllysine (CML) and pentosidine were determined by GC/MS and HPLC, respectively. CR vs. AL significantly (P<0.0001) increased both mean (34 vs. 27 months) and maximum (47 vs. 31 months) life spans. Skin collagen levels of furosine (pmol/micromol lysine) were approximately 2.5-fold greater than CML levels and 100-fold greater than pentosidine. Individual accumulation rates modeled as linear equations were significantly (P<0.001) inhibited by CR vs. AL for all parameters and in all cases varied inversely with longevity (P<0.1 to <0.0001). The incidence of three tissue pathologies (lymphoma, dermatitis, and seminal vesiculitis) was found to be attenuated by CR and the latter pathology correlated significantly with longevities (r=0.54, P=0. 002). The finding that markers of skin collagen glycation and glycoxidation rates can predict early deaths in AL and CR C57BL/6NNia mice strongly suggests that an age-related deterioration in glucose tolerance is a life span-determining process."
https://openalex.org/W1561198074,"Recent advances in transgenic mouse technology provide novel models to study cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology. In light of these developments, there is an increasing need for understanding cardiovascular function and blood flow control in normal mice. To this end we have used intravital microscopy to investigate vasomotor control in arterioles of the superfused cremaster muscle preparation of anesthetized C57Bl6 mice. Spontaneous resting tone increased with branch order and was enhanced by oxygen. Norepinephrine and acetylcholine (ACh) caused concentration-dependent vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. Microiontophoresis of ACh evoked vasodilation that conducted along arterioles; the local (direct) response was inhibited by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (LNA), and both local and conducted responses were inhibited by 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA). Microejection of KCl evoked a biphasic response: a transient conducted vasoconstriction (inhibited by nifedipine), followed by a conducted vasodilation that was insensitive to LNA, indomethacin, and 17-ODYA. Phenylephrine evoked focal vasoconstriction that did not conduct. Perivascular sympathetic nerve stimulation evoked constriction along arterioles that was inhibited by tetrodotoxin. These findings indicate that for arterioles in the mouse cremaster muscle, nitric oxide and endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor (as shown by LNA and 17-ODYA interventions, respectively) mediate vasodilatory responses to ACh but not to KCl, and that vasomotor responses spread along arterioles by multiple pathways of cell-to-cell communication."

Most flavoproteins contain either FMN or FAD as prosthetic groups; however, a small number of enzymes contain both cofactors. In mammalian systems, NADPH cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase (cytochrome P-450 reductase) was the first such enzyme isolated (1.Dignam J.D. Strobel H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2.Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by several other dual flavin enzymes including nitric-oxide synthases (NOS)1 in higher organisms (3.Bredt D.S.

Chem. 1986; 261: 7160-7169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sulfite reductase (6.Ostowski J. Barber M.J. Rueger D.C. Miller B.E. Siegel L.M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15796-15808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in bacteria. More recently, the cDNA sequence encoding a putative FMN- and FAD-binding enzyme, methionine synthase reductase, has been described (7.Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gajuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Hing H.H.Q. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3059-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Cytochrome P-450 reductase, the most extensively characterized of these enzymes (8.Vermilion J. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8812-8819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Shen A.L.

Springer-Verlag, New York1993: 35-59Google Scholar), is found in the endoplasmic reticulum of most eukaryote cells and is an integral component of the monooxygenase system transferring electrons from NADPH to cytochromes P-450 via FMN and FAD co-factors. Cytochrome P-450 reductase may also donate electrons to heme oxygenase (11.Schacter B.A. Nelson E.B. Marver H.S. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3601-3607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cytochrome b 5(12.Enoch H.G. Strittmatter P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1962; 237: 587-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the crystal and NMR structure of the FMN domain of human cytochrome P-450 reductase (15.Zhao Q. Modi S. Smith G.

Roberts D.C. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) have been resolved, providing high resolution structural information on this enzyme class. The amino-terminal region of cytochrome P-450 reductase bears striking amino acid homology with FMN-containing flavodoxins, while the carboxyl-terminal region shows similarities with the FAD-containing ferredoxin-NADP+reductases, thus leading to the hypothesis that cytochrome P-450 reductase has evolved as a fusion of these two ancestral proteins (18.Porter T.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 154-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,19.Smith G.C.M Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A carboxyl-terminal cytochrome P-450 reductase-like domain is also a component of the NOS family of enzymes, where it is fused to an amino-terminal heme domain. The NOS reductase domain shuttles electrons from NADPH to the active site iron where the amino acid,l-arginine, is metabolized to nitric oxide (NO) (20.Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4158) Google Scholar). In addition to its normal physiological functions, cytochrome P-450 reductase plays a role in the reduction of one-electron acceptors such as the therapeutically important anticancer agents mitomycin c (22.Keyse S.R. Fracasso P.M. Heimbrook D.L. Rockwell S. Sligar S.G. Sartorelli A.C. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5638-5643PubMed Google Scholar), adriamycin (23.Bachur N.R. Gordon S.L. Gee M.V. Kon H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 954-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), and the benzotriazine di-N-oxide, tirapazamine (24.Walton M.I. Wolf C.R. Workman P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Evidence is also emerging that NOS can transfer electrons to these compounds via its reductase domain (25.Vásquez-Vivar J. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Pritchard K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11293-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 26.Garner A.P. Paine M.J.I. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Chinje E.C. Ortiz de Montellano P. Stratford I. Tew D. Wolf C.R.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1929-1934PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of these dual flavin reductases will therefore influence the outcome of cancer therapy. In this study we report the cloning of a novel member of the FNR family containing FMN and FAD as cofactors, which supports the NADPH-dependent metabolism of cytochrome c, the quinone anti-neoplastic agent doxorubicin, and menadione. Interestingly, the enzyme, which we have called NR1 (novelreductase 1) appears widely expressed in human cancer cell lines and, therefore, could play a potential role in the activation (or deactivation) of drugs used in cancer therapy. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom (UK)) and all enzymes and cell culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK), except where stated. All solvents were of HPLC grade (Rathburn Chemicals Ltd., UK). The EST data base was screened for putative FAD- or FMN-containing proteins using the human P-450 reductase cDNA as the probe sequence (accession no. S90469). Two novel cDNAs were identified, one was subsequently reported to be methionine synthase reductase (7.Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gajuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Hing H.H.Q. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3059-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and the other (pNR1-SPORT) was used in these studies. This clone contained a 2506-nucleotide sequence and contained putative FAD- and FMN-binding domains. This cDNA in pSPORT (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as a template for PCR amplification of the sequence for expression in baculovirus andEscherichia coli systems. Oligonucleotides 5′-GAGAATTCCATATGCCGAGCCCGCAGCTTCTG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCTCGAGTCAGGCCCACGTCTCTGTCTGGAA-3′ corresponding to putative 5′ and 3′ ends of the NR1 coding sequence were synthesized. The 5′ oligonucleotide contained overhanging NdeI andEcoRI restriction sites, while the 3′ oligonucleotide contained XhoI and EcoRI sites. Following 25 cycles of amplification using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), the cDNA was ligated into pCR SCRIPT (Stratagene) to produce the plasmid pNR1-SCRIPT and sequenced to confirm that no PCR errors had been introduced. For baculoviral expression, the coding sequence was removed from pNR1-SCRIPT by EcoRI digestion and cloned into the unique EcoRI site of pFastBac Hta (Life Technologies, Inc.) and in frame with an amino-terminal 6-histidine linker and rTEV protease cleavage site. Recombinant baculovirus (vNR1) was produced following transposition of the cDNA sequence downstream of the polyhedrin promoter in Bacmid DNA and transfection into insect Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.), following manufacturer's instructions. The FAD domain constructs were generated by PCR amplification and cloning of nucleotides 579–1860 (encoding amino acid residues 194–597). This region was cloned into pCRSCRIPTto produce pFAD-SCRIPT using a Stratagene kit system and sequenced to verify clone integrity. Forward (5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGTAGCTCACCCCGGCTCTCAGG-3′) and reverse (5′-GGAATTCCTCGAGTCAGGCCCACGTCTCTGTCTGCAA-3′) primers were then used, which contained NdeI and XhoI sites for subcloning into the unique NdeI/XhoI sites of pET15b (Novagen) downstream of a 6-histidine linker and thrombin cleavage site. The resulting plasmid pFAD-PET was used for expression of the FAD domain. For baculoviral expression of NR1, Sf9 cells were maintained at 27 °C in SF900 II media (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to standard procedures (27.0′Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). For expression, a 300-ml suspension culture (∼2.0 × 106cells/ml) was infected with virus at a multiplicity of approximately 2 plaque-forming units/cell. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. Protein purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The suspension was sonicated (MSE probe, several short bursts at highest power) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h (Sorvall Ultra Pro 80 with A641 rotor). The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml Hi-Trap nickel-agarose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed sequentially with 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol; 20 ml Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol; and then with 25 ml of PBS. Approximately 3 ml of yellow protein was then eluted with PBS,10% glycerol, 0.3 m imidazole. The protein was diluted with 10 ml of affinity buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), and loaded onto a 2-ml 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column. The column was washed sequentially with 15 ml of affinity buffer and affinity buffer with 0.5 m NaCl. The protein was eluted in 2.5 ml of affinity buffer containing 0.5m NaCl and 10 mm 2′-AMP. FMN was added to 40 μm to replace any cofactor lost during purification, and protein exchanged into PBS, 10% glycerol using a PD-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis using Bio-Rad reagents and bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. For E. coli expression of the FAD domain, BL21 (plys S) strains containing the domain expression plasmid pFAD-PET were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). One-liter cultures of fresh LB broth were inoculated with 10 ml of the overnight culture and the bacteria grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6–1.0. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added (0.5 mm) to initiate expression and the culture transferred to 30 °C and grown overnight. Cells were harvested at 5,000 ×g for 15 min and resuspended in 20 ml of binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0). The recombinant protein was extracted and purified over a 5-ml Hi-Trap nickel-agarose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (19.Smith G.C.M Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The FAD domain was washed with binding buffer containing 60 mm imidazole and eluted with binding buffer containing 1 m imidazole. The protein eluted off the column was then exchanged into affinity buffer using PD-10 gel filtration columns and purified over 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose as described above. Final yields of pure protein were between 2 and 5 mg/liter of culture. The final purified protein was stored in PBS, 10% glycerol at −20 °C. Antibodies against NR1 were generated in sheep using 1 mg of purified recombinant NR1-FAD domain by Scottish Antibodies Production Unit (Carluke, UK). Antibodies to full-length cytochrome P-450 reductase have been described previously (19.Smith G.C.M Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblots were carried out using a Mini-PROTEAN II (Bio-Rad) electrophoresis system. Except where indicated, proteins were separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) according to manufacturer's instructions. For immunodetection, the blots were blocked in TBST (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% v/v Tween 20) with 5% w/v milk powder (Marvel) overnight at 4 °C with shaking. After washing several times with TBST, blots were incubated with appropriate antibody diluted in TBST, 5% milk powder at room temperature for 1–2 h. The binding of the primary antibodies was detected using a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, ECL). The secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit IgG and anti-sheep IgG (Scottish Antibody Production Unit). The tumor cell lines MCF7, HepG2, HeLa, and NIH3T3 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. PEO1, EJ9, NCI H322, and HT29 cells were cultured in RPMI medium. All culture media were supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, except for HepG2 cultures, which contained 15% v/v serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To prepare whole cell extracts, approximately 2 × 107cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed once with PBS, and frozen at −70 °C. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mm PBS, 0.25 m sucrose and sonicated on ice using several pulses with an MSE probe. Following centrifugation at 4 °C, 12,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was aspirated and stored at −70 °C. For subcellular fractionation studies, approximately 2 × 108 MCF-7 cells were harvested, washed twice in PBS, and homogenized using a 20-ml glass homogenizer in 10 ml of resuspension buffer (RB) consisting of 0.25m sucrose, 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclear material and particulate cell matter were pelleted at 10,000 ×g for 10 min and resuspended in 5 ml of RB. The supernatant material was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resultant pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RB. The supernatant, containing the cytoplasmic fraction, and the pellet, containing the membrane fractions, were stored at −70 °C. FMN and FAD content was determined by HPLC (28.Klatt P. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Meyer B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 359-365Google Scholar) using a Hewlett Packard 1050 HPLC chromatograph and fluorescence detector. Flavins were released from NR1 by boiling for 5 min, and denatured protein removed by 20,000 ×g centrifugation for 10 min. FMN and FAD were detected by fluorescence (excitation, 450 nm; emission, 520 nm) following isocratic separation (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, methanol; v/v ratio 78:22) over a 25-cm Spherisorb ODS-2 5-μm column. Authentic FMN and FAD standards purchased from Sigma were used as control. Both were over 95% pure, as judged by HPLC analysis. Absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu 160 UV spectrophotometer. Human Multiple Tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with a 521-base pair cDNA fragment generated by SacI/SmaI restriction endonuclease digestion of pNR1. This probe was radiolabeled by incorporation of [32P]dCTP (RadPrime DNA labeling system, Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified using a Chroma Spin+ TE-30 column (CLONTECH). After a 1-h prehybridization, hybridization was carried out for 1 h using ExpressHyb buffer (CLONTECH) at 68 °C. The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 20 min, twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.05% v/v sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 °C for 20 min, and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C with two intensifying screens. The full-length 2.6-kilobase NR1 cDNA segment was digested from pSPORT with EcoRI andHindIII and used as a probe in fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping (FISH). Standard cytogenetic techniques were used to prepare fixed normal lymphocyte slides. The probe was labeled with Spectrum Red dUTP using a nick translation kit (both Vysis, Downers Grove, IL) using the following kit protocol modifications. Slides were pretreated four times for 2 min in 2× SSC, pH 7.0, and dehydrated through 70%, 85%, and 100% ethanol (2 min each) prior to air drying. DNA was dried at 37 °C for 15 min, and an extra posthybridization wash of 1× SSC, 0.3% v/v Nonidet P-40 at 73 °C for 2 min was added between the other washes. Chromosomes were visualized using an Olympus BX60 fluorescent microscope fitted with a cooled CCD camera and using Vysis QUIPS image analysis software. Potassium ferricyanide and cytochromec reduction was measured as described for cytochrome P-450 reductase (29.Vermilion J.L. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 266-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of doxorubicin and menadione was carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm NADPH, and various substrate concentrations at 37 °C. The total incubation volume was 500 μl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μg of enzyme. The oxidation of NADPH was then monitored at 340 nm using a Shimadzu UV 2000 spectrophotometer. Final doxorubicin concentrations ranged from 20 to100 μm and menadione from 10 to 22.5 μm. Control reactions were carried out in the absence of active enzyme. A DNA fragment was identified, which contained an open reading frame with significant homology to human cytochrome P-450 reductase, following an extensive data base search of EST data base libraries. The cDNA insert for the EST was 2452 nucleotides in length (excluding the poly(A) tail) and contained the complete coding sequence for a putative cytochrome P-450 reductase-like enzyme (Fig.1). The initiation codon is predicted to be the first in-frame methionine residue based on sequence alignment with human cytochrome P-450 reductase and is preceded by several nucleotides bearing homology to the Kozak initiation sequence consensus (30.Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are also in-frame protein stop codons upstream of the predicted start site, which place this ATG codon in good context for the initiation of translation. A 1791-nucleotide sequence encodes a 597-amino acid residue polypeptide, NR1 (Fig. 1), with a predicted molecular mass of 66,700 Da. Comparative alignment of the identified amino acid sequence with human P-450 reductase and other FMN- and FAD-containing human flavoproteins shows sequence similarities ranging from 41% for NOS II and methionine synthase transferase to 44% for cytochrome P-450 reductase (Fig.2). The cytochrome P-450 reductase subfamily of enzymes contain distinctive amino-terminal FMN-binding and carboxyl-terminal FAD- and NADPH-binding domains, which are aligned for efficient electron transfer by a connecting domain (17.Wang M. Roberts D.C. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, a similar domain arrangement is found in NR1 with particularly strong sequence conservation in the regions shown to be involved in FMN, FAD, and NADPH cofactor binding. The major difference in domain organization is associated with the extreme amino-terminal region. Cytochrome P-450 reductase contains a hydrophobic 60-amino acid amino-terminal anchor domain, which is involved in tethering the molecule to the endoplasmic reticulum (9.Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. Schenkman J.B. Grein H. Cytochrome P-450. Springer-Verlag, New York1993: 35-59Google Scholar, 17.Wang M. Roberts D.C. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). This domain is absent in NR1, implying a different cellular location for the enzyme. The 2.5-kb NR1 cDNA was used to probe a spread of human metaphase chromosomes. The gene was localized close to the telomere on the short arm of chromosome 9q34.3 by FISH analysis (Fig. 3). An 80-nucleotide gene sequence identical to NR1 cDNA has been identified in random mapping studies of chromosome 9 (31.Church D.M. Stotler C.J. Rutter J.L Murrell J.R. Troflatter J.A. Buckler A.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), thus confirming the chromosomal localization. In order to determine whether the NR1 cDNA codes for a biologically active enzyme, we expressed the cloned cDNA using a baculovirus system. The full-length NR1 coding sequence was subcloned into pFastBac downstream of the very late polyhedron promoter, and the cDNA fused with a 6-histidine-tagged sequence at the amino terminus to facilitate affinity purification by nickel-agarose chromatography. Recombinant baculovirus vNR1 was generated by homologous recombination with Bacmid DNA. NR1 was detectable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at around 3 days after infection, at which time cells were harvested for protein purification. Approximately 20% of recombinant enzyme remained in the soluble fraction following cell lysis and 100 × gcentrifugation. Recombinant NR1 was purified by affinity purification over nickel-agarose and ADP-Sepharose to a final purity of over 90% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.4 A). The final yield of purified NR1 was approximately 1.5 mg/liter suspension culture. Purified NR1 was yellow, indicating the presence of flavin, and bound to 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose, indicating the presence of an NADPH-binding domain. HPLC analysis of heat-denatured enzyme determined that it released two fluorophores whose retention times exactly matched those of authentic FMN and FAD (Fig. 4 B). There were 1.2 and 1.1 mol each, respectively, of FMN and FAD bound per mole of enzyme. NR1 exhibited a UV-visible spectrum similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase (32.Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2694-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), possessing absorbance maxima at 380, 460, and 626 nm (Fig. 4 C). Like cytochrome P-450 reductase, the addition of NADPH under aerobic conditions caused a decrease in the absorbance at 380 and 460 nm, and an absorbance increase at 580 nm. Furthermore, the UV-visible spectrum of NR1 reduced with NADPH was stable over a 24-h period, which is consistent with the reduction of the flavin co-factors by NADPH and the production of an air-stable semiquinone form (10.Backes W.L. Schenkman J.B. Greim H. Cytochrome P-450. Springer-Verlag, New York1993: 35-59Google Scholar, 32.Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2694-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,46.Masters B.S.S. Bilimoria M.H. Kamin H. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4081-4088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above data showed that NR1 is a flavoenzyme that binds both FMN and FAD cofactors as predicted from the amino acid sequence. Furthermore, the spectral changes associated with the addition of NADPH indicate that electrons are transferred from NADPH to FAD and FMN, which indicates that NR1 follows the same pattern of electron transfer as in other dual flavin enzymes. The cytochrome P-450 reductase family of flavoenzymes are generally capable of reducing the hemoprotein cytochrome c, which thus serves as a model substrate for the comparative analysis of enzyme activity and electron transfer. Cytochrome c reducing activity was maximal when it occurred using potassium phosphate concentrations of between 300 and 400 mm and the enzyme had a pH optimum of around 8.0 (data not shown). There was also no detectable enzyme activity using NADH as a reducing cofactor. The conditions for optimal enzyme activity were thus similar to those observed for cytochrome P-450 reductase (9.Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. Schenkman J.B. Grein H. Cytochrome P-450. Springer-Verlag, New York1993: 35-59Google Scholar, 10.Backes W.L. Schenkman J.B. Greim H. Cytochrome P-450. Springer-Verlag, New York1993: 35-59Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters of cytochrome c reduction were compared with human cytochrome P-450 reductase. As shown in TableI, the apparent K mvalue of NR1 for cytochrome c was 21 μm, which was similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase (15 μm). Reported K m values of mammalian P-450 reductase for cytochrome c range between 5 and 21 μm (14.Williams C.H. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 587-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,49.Philips A.H. Langdon R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2652-2660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Shen A. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27475-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The apparent k cat value was calculated as 1.3 s−1, which was approximately 100-fold lower than cytochrome P-450 reductase. NR1 also metabolized a range of one-electron acceptors, including the quinone-containing compounds doxorubicin and menadione (Table II). Although all the activities measured were significantly lower than cytochrome P-450 reductase (in the range 1–4%), they were reasonably similar to activities previously measured (25.Vásquez-Vivar J.

Taken together, these results indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes an authentic NADPH-dependent reductase enzyme, which is capable of catalyzing the reduction of cytochrome c and one-electron acceptors.Table IComparison of kinetic parameters of cytochrome c reduction by NR1 and cytochrome P-450 reductaseEnzymeK mV maxK catμmμmol/min/mgs −1NR121.3 ± 2.81.2 ± 0.11.3P-450 reductase15.2 ± 3.885.4 ± 13.8109.3Reactions contained 0.3 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.7, 50 μm NADPH, with varying amounts of cytochromec.

https://openalex.org/W2073698613,"The regulation of vascular endothelial cell behavior during angiogenesis and in disease by transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1) is complex, but it clearly involves growth factor-induced changes in extracellular matrix synthesis. Proteoglycans (PGs) synthesized by endothelial cells contribute to the formation of the vascular extracellular matrix and also influence cellular proliferation and migration. Since the effects of TGF-β1on vascular smooth muscle cell growth are dependent on cell density, it is possible that TGF-β1 also directs different patterns of PG synthesis in endothelial cells at different cell densities. In the present study, dense and sparse cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine, [35S]sulfate, or35S-labeled amino acids in the presence of TGF-β1. The labeled PGs were characterized by DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography and Sepharose CL-4B molecular sieve chromatography. The glycosaminoglycan M rand composition were analyzed by Sepharose CL-6B chromatography, and the core protein M r was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, before and after digestion with papain, heparitinase, or chondroitin ABC lyase. These experiments indicate that the effect of TGF-β1 on vascular endothelial cell PG synthesis is dependent on cell density. Specifically, TGF-β1 induced an accumulation of small chondroitin/dermatan sulfate PGs (CS/DSPGs) with core proteins of ∼50 kDa in the medium of both dense and sparse cultures, but a cell layer-associated heparan sulfate PG with a core protein size of ∼400 kDa accumulated only in dense cultures. Moreover, only in the dense cell cultures did TGF-β1 cause CS/DSPG hydrodynamic size to increase, which was due to the synthesis of CS/DSPGs with longer glycosaminoglycan chains. The heparan sulfate PG and CS/DSPG core proteins were identified as perlecan and biglycan, respectively, by Western blot analysis. The present data suggest that TGF-β1 promotes the synthesis of both perlecan and biglycan when endothelial cell density is high, whereas only biglycan synthesis is stimulated when the cell density is low. Furthermore, glycosaminoglycan chains are elongated only in biglycan synthesized by the cells at a high cell density.

In addition, PGs can regulate endothelial cell functions that are mediated by growth factors and cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), to which some PGs bind. Endothelial cells synthesize heparan sulfate PGs (HSPGs), including the major endothelial extracellular matrix PG, perlecan (6.Saku T. Furthmayr H. J. Biol.

Vascular endothelial cells also constitutively synthesize and secrete the large aggregating chondroitin sulfate PG, versican (9.Morita H. Takeuchi T. Suzuki S. Maeda K. Yamada K. Eguchi G. Kimata K.

TGF-β1 is synthesized by endothelial cells and, when activated, dramatically modifies endothelial cell proliferation and migration (15.Fráter-Schröder M. Müller G. Birchmeier W. Böhlen P.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and may contribute to the development of the atherosclerotic lesion (18.Nabel E.G. Shum L. Pompili V.J. Yang Z.Y. San H.

A hallmark of the atherosclerotic lesion is the accumulation of extracellular matrix components such as PGs and collagen (19.Wight T.N. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 9: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar, 20.Ylä-Herttuala S. Sumuvuori H. Karkola K. Möttönen M. Nikkari T. Lab. Invest. 1986; 54: 402-407PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Salisburry B.G.J.

While it is well known that TGF-β regulates the synthesis of various PGs in several cell types, including fibroblasts (23.Bassols A. Massague J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 27A: 6-12Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whether this cytokine influences the production of specific PGs by endothelial cells is not known. The cytokine-driven accumulation of extracellular matrix macromolecules in the vessel wall during disease and in other sites of TGF-β release and activation, such as at wound sites, clearly fills a structural function. However, the induced expression of some PGs by TGF-β may also influence cell proliferation, migration, and phenotype by modifying the utilization and activity of growth factors at sites of PG deposition. For example, heparan sulfate chains borne on PGs such as the large basement membrane-associated HSPG, perlecan, promote the binding of FGF-2 to its receptor (29.Aviezer D. Hecht D. Safran M. Eisinger M. David G. Yayon A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 30.Aviezer D. Levy E. Safran M. Svahn C. Buddecke E. Schmidt A. David G. Vlodavsky I. Yayon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 114-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that perlecan in endothelial extracellular matrix may regulate endothelial cell functions such as proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and fibrinolytic activity mediated by FGF-2 (31.Silverstein J. Rifkin D.B. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1987; 13: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32.Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The small leucine-rich PGs biglycan and decorin bind, via their core proteins, to TGF-β and sequester the cytokine from the cell surface receptor (33.Yamaguchi Y. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1988; 336: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34.Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar, 35.Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegärd D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the regulation of endothelial cell functions mediated by the cytokines may be influenced by changes in the PGs that are synthesized. In the present study, PGs synthesized by cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells after exposure to human platelet TGF-β1were characterized to clarify the regulation of endothelial PG synthesis by TGF-β. Since the growth response of sparse cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells to TGF-β is different from dense cultures of the cells (36.Majack R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we tested whether TGF-β also regulates PG synthesis by vascular endothelial cells in a cell density-dependent manner. The results suggest that, like the effect of TGF-β on cell proliferation, cells respond differently to the cytokine at different cell densities. This difference in response may have important consequences for the control of endothelial cell behavior during repair of vascular damage. Vascular endothelial cells derived from bovine aorta and Western blotting blocking reagent were from Dainihon Pharmaceutical (Osaka, Japan).

TGF-β1-derived from human platelets, urea, phenol red, and SDS were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). ECL Western blotting detection reagents, horseradish peroxidase-linked protein A, nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL), and Hyperfilm ECL were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4; derived from Proteus vulgaris) was from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Rabbit antisera against perlecan core protein (EY-9) and biglycan core protein (LF-96) were kindly provided by Dr. John Hassell (Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children, Tampa, FL) and Dr. Larry Fisher (NIDR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), respectively. Trypsin (1:250) and Pronase were from Difco and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively; cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), and other reagents were from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Vascular endothelial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 100-mm dishes in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air until confluent. They were transferred into 24-well culture plates at 1 × 104cells/cm2 and cultured for 24 h (“sparse cultures”) or until confluent (“dense cultures”). The medium was replaced by fresh serum-free ASF 301 medium after washing of the cells with the medium, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4, 8, 24, or 48 h in 0.25 ml of fresh serum-free ASF 301 medium with TGF-β1 at 0.1, 1, or 10 ng/ml in the presence of both 100 kBq/ml [3H]glucosamine and 370 kBq/ml [35S]sulfate. After incubation, the conditioned medium was harvested, and the cell layer was washed with 0.25 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS); the wash was combined with the corresponding conditioned medium. The cell layer was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min with 0.25 ml of CMF-PBS containing 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. The trypsinized cell suspension was harvested, and the culture well was washed with 0.25 ml of CMF-PBS. The wash was combined with the corresponding cell suspension and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant includes GAGs derived from the cell surface and the solubilized extracellular matrix (37.Gill P.J. Adler J. Silbert C.K. Silbert J.E. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The supernatant and the conditioned medium were used for the determination of radioactive GAGs by the CPC precipitation method (38.Wasteson Å. Uthen K. Westermark B. Biochem. J. 1973; 136: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) as follows: each fraction was incubated with 3 mg/ml Pronase at 50 °C for 3 h. The Pronase digests were mixed with 4 mg/ml carrier chondroitin sulfate A and 0.5% CPC. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min to obtain the precipitated GAG·CPC complexes. The precipitate was dissolved in 0.1 ml of 4 m NaCl and reprecipitated by the addition of 1.4 ml of 80% aqueous ethanol. The CPC precipitation, the centrifugation, the NaCl dissolution, and the ethanol precipitation were repeated three times. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 10 min and dissolved in 0.4 ml of distilled water. The incorporated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Dense and sparse cultures of vascular endothelial cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in 1 ml of serum-free ASF 301 medium with or without TGF-β1 at 0.1, 1, or 10 ng/ml medium for 48 h and labeled with 2.5 kBq/ml [14C]leucine during the last 6 h of the incubation. After incubation, the medium was discarded, and the cells were washed twice with CMF-PBS. The cells were then scraped off with a rubber policeman in the presence of 0.75 ml of CMF-PBS. The culture well was washed with 0.75 ml of CMF-PBS, and the wash was combined with the harvested cell suspension. Cell homogenate was prepared by sonication of the cell suspension, and the incorporation of [14C]leucine into the 5% trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction of the cell homogenate was determined by liquid scintillation counting. A portion of the cell homogenate was analyzed for DNA content by the fluorometric method (39.Kissane J.M. Robins E. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the incorporated radioactivity was expressed as dpm/μg of DNA. Separately, dense and sparse cultures of endothelial cells were prepared in 24-well plates and treated with TGF-β1 for 48 h. The cells were then harvested by trypsinization, and the cell number at the end of the treatment was counted with a particle counter (Sysmex CDA-500). Dense and sparse cultures of vascular endothelial cells were prepared in 100-mm dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in 6 ml of serum-free ASF 301 medium with TGF-β1 at 10 ng/ml in the presence of 200 kBq/ml [3H]glucosamine. The conditioned medium was harvested, and solid urea was added to a concentration of 8m. The cell layer was washed twice with ice-cold CMF-PBS. After extraction with 8 m urea solution containing 0.1m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 5 mm benzamidine, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris base, and 2% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 15 min, the layer was harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman. The medium and cell extracts were chromatographed on PD-10 columns equilibrated in 8m urea buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris base to obtain high molecular mass (>3 kDa) macromolecules. To separate PGs on the basis of differences in charge density, the macromolecules were applied to DEAE-Sephacel (5 ml of resin) in 8 m urea buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris base. Unbound radioactivity was removed from the column by washing with 30 ml of the buffer. Bound radioactivity was eluted from the column with a liner gradient of 0.1–0.7 m NaCl in the urea buffer (total volume of 50 ml). Proteoglycan-containing peaks are eluted at ∼0.4 and 0.5m NaCl (peaks II and III, respectively) and succeed an earlier eluting peak (peak I, ∼0.2 m NaCl) that does not contain PGs (40.Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Peak II in the cell layer of dense cells and peak III in the conditioned medium of either dense or sparse cells were separately pooled because they contained markedly increased radioactivity in samples from TGF-β1-treated cultures (see “Results”). Pooled peak material was concentrated by application of the diluted samples to 0.3-ml DEAE-Sephacel columns and eluting bound radioactivity with sequential washes of 8 murea buffer containing 3 m NaCl. Concentrated PGs were then chromatographed on a Sepharose CL-4B column (0.9 × 80 cm) in 8m urea buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl to separate PGs on the basis of their hydrodynamic size. The high and lowM r subclasses of peak II and the lowM r subclass of peak III, defined on the basis of Sepharose CL-4B elution position, were pooled and concentrated by DEAE-Sephacel minicolumns. PGs were precipitated with 3.5 volumes of 1.3% potassium acetate in 95% ethanol and 80 μg/ml carrier chondroitin sulfate for 2 h at −20 °C; the precipitation was repeated three times. The precipitated PGs were digested with 10 μg of papain in 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm cysteine at 65 °C for 4 h or with 1.7 units/ml chondroitin ABC lyase in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 3 mm sodium acetate for at 37 °C for 4 h or with 1 unit/ml heparitinase in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mm calcium acetate at 37 °C for 4 h. The digested samples were chromatographed on a Sepharose CL-6B column (0.9 × 80 cm) in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) with 0.2 m NaCl. The void volume and the total volume were estimated by the elution of dextran blue and phenol red, respectively. Estimates of GAG chain size were made by comparison of Sepharose CL-6B elution K av, determined experimentally with a previously published curve of log M r versus K av on Sepharose CL-6B for chondroitin sulfate chains of various known M r(41.Wasteson Å. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Dense and sparse cultures of vascular endothelial cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in 6 ml of fresh ASF 301 medium with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 in the presence of 1 MBq/ml Tran35S-label reagent. After incubation, radiolabeled PGs accumulated in the conditioned medium and the cell layer were extracted under a dissociative condition in the presence of 8 m urea. The extracts were concentrated on 0.3 ml of DEAE-Sephacel columns and precipitated with 1.3% potassium acetate in 95% ethanol. Some precipitates were digested with heparitinase or chondroitin ABC lyase. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the procedure of Laemmli (42.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) on acrylamide 4–12% gradient slab gels with a 3% stacking gel. The radiolabeled PG cores were visualized by autoradiography of dried gels exposed to Kodak XAR-2 film at −70 °C. For Western blot analysis, the SDS-polyacrylamide gels were equilibrated in 25 mm Tris transfer buffer (pH 9.5) with 20% methanol and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 90 min with a semidry transfer apparatus (Atoo, AE-6677). The membrane was blocked and exposed to a primary antibody against perlecan (EY-9, diluted 1:1000) or biglycan (LF-96, diluted 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation of the blot with horseradish peroxidase-linked protein A, bands that bound to the primary antibody were visualized by an enzyme-linked chemoluminescence procedure. In dense cultures, the incorporation of both [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate into GAGs was significantly increased by TGF-β1 in both the cell layer and the conditioned medium (Fig.1). In contrast, TGF-β1significantly increased [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate incorporation only into GAGs that accumulated in the conditioned medium, but not in the cell layer, of cultures of sparse cells. In compartments of these cultures in which GAG accumulation was increased by TGF-β1, the increased accumulation was significant at 1 ng/ml and further increased at 10 ng/ml, indicating that the regulation of GAG accumulation by TGF-β1 is dose-dependent. A time course of the stimulation of endothelial GAG synthesis by TGF-β1 at 10 ng/ml (Fig. 2) indicated that the increase in [3H]glucosamine incorporation was significant after 8 h in the cell layer and the medium of the dense cultures but was significantly different from unstimulated controls only after 24 h in sparse culture medium. At no time after stimulation with TGF-β1 was [3H]glucosamine incorporation into GAG increased over control in the cell layer of sparse cell cultures. In summary, sparse and dense cultures differed in response to TGF-β1 stimulation primarily by the accumulation of GAG in the cell layers of dense but not sparse cultures. Since TGF-β1 increased the [3H]glucosamine incorporation in a time-dependent manner, vascular endothelial cells were treated with TGF-β1 at 10 ng/ml for 48 h in the following experiments.Figure 2Time course of the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into GAGs accumulated in the cell layer and the conditioned medium of dense and sparse vascular endothelial cells after exposure to TGF -β1. Dense and sparse cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3, 6, 24, and 48 h with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) in the presence of [3H]glucosamine.

The TGF-β1-induced increase in [3H]glucosamine incorporation in the cell layer and the conditioned medium of the dense cells and in the conditioned medium of the sparse cells was completely abrogated in the presence of the antibody, indicating that the increase in the [3H]glucosamine incorporation requires TGF-β1. The antibody alone did not decrease the control levels of [3H]glucosamine incorporation into GAGs, suggesting that endogenous TGF-β1 is not activated in either sparse or dense endothelial cell cultures under the conditions of the experiments. The observed TGF-β1-induced increase in the accumulation of GAGs in the cell layer and the conditioned medium of vascular endothelial cells may be due to an increase in cell number or represent an increase in general protein synthesis. To address these questions, the cell number and the incorporation of [14C]leucine into acid-insoluble macromolecules after exposure to the cytokine were examined. Over 48 h, the number of sparsely plated endothelial cells was significantly but only slightly decreased by 10 ng/ml TGF-β1, when compared with controls, whereas the number of cells in dense cultures was unaffected by the cytokine (TableI). Moreover, TGF-β1 did not change overall protein synthesis by either dense or sparse cultures, as assessed by [14C]leucine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity. These results indicate that the TGF-β1-induced increase in the [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate incorporation into GAGs cannot be explained by increased cell number and does not represent an overall increase in protein synthesis.Table ICell number and protein synthesis of dense and sparse vascular endothelial cells after exposure to TGF-β1Cell number[14C]Leucinecells × 10 2 /cm 2dpm/μg DNADense cultures Control826 ± 593747 ± 147 0.1 ng/ml TGF-β1870 ± 603921 ± 177 1.0 ng/ml TGF-β1945 ± 814355 ± 316 10 ng/ml TGF-β1861 ± 564118 ± 118Sparse cultures Control574 ± 25545 ± 79 0.1 ng/ml TGF-β1494 ± 38740 ± 35 1.0 ng/ml TGF-β1446 ± 18aSignificantly different from the corresponding control, p < 0.01.586 ± 20 10 ng/ml TGF-β1426 ± 17aSignificantly different from the corresponding control, p < 0.01.545 ± 40Dense and sparse cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in the presence of TGF-β1and labeled with [14C]leucine during the last 6 h of the incubation.

This binding site has been narrowed to a 52-residue sequence that is composed of two nonoverlapping, weak paxillin binding sites. The PTP-PEST binding site on paxillin has been mapped to the two carboxyl-terminal LIM (lin11, isl-1, and mec-3) domains. Transient expression of PTP-PEST reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas, as anticipated. A PTP-PEST mutant defective for binding p130cas does not cause a reduction in its tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo. Expression of PTP-PEST also caused a reduction of phosphotyrosine on paxillin. Expression of mutants of PTP-PEST with deletions in the paxillin-binding site did not associate with paxillin in vivo and failed to cause a reduction in the phosphotyrosine content of paxillin. These results demonstrate that paxillin can serve as a PTP-PEST substrate in vivo and support the model that a noncatalytic domain interaction recruits paxillin to PTP-PEST to facilitate its dephosphorylation.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). One prominent PTK in this signaling pathway is FAK. FAK has been implicated in the regulation of a number of important biological functions, including cell spreading, cell motility, cell survival, and cell growth (2.Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 3.Gilmore A. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 4.Cary L.A. Chang J.F.

One feature of FAK that is essential for signaling is its autophosphorylation and association with Src family PTKs. Several focal adhesion-associated, FAK-binding proteins also become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to activation of integrin signaling pathways including paxillin and p130cas. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin may function in controlling the rate of cell spreading (9.Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas has been implicated in controlling cell motility (10.Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 11.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The interactions of paxillin and p130cas with SH2 domain containing signaling molecules is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, and assembly of the p130cas/crk complex appears to be important in regulating cell motility (11.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Although tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion-associated proteins has been intensively investigated, the dephosphorylation of these proteins has not been extensively studied until recently. PTPs function to dephosphorylate tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates and a number of candidate PTPs that may regulate signaling through focal adhesion-associated proteins have recently been identified. In MCF7 cells, a fraction of the transmembrane PTP leukocyte common antigen-related protein was localized in focal adhesions, although there is no evidence implicating leukocyte common antigen-related protein in the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion-associated proteins (12.Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). There is biochemical evidence suggesting that two focal adhesion-associated proteins, FAK and p130cas, are substrates for PTEN/MMAC1 (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10/mutated in multiple advanced cancers 1) (13.Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S.-I. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 14.Tamura M. Gu J. Takino T. Yamada K.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 442-449PubMed Google Scholar). Further, perturbation of PTEN expression levels alters the ability of cells to spread and migrate, biological functions that FAK and p130cas are believed to control (13.Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S.-I. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Similarly, PTP1B has been implicated in regulating the phosphotyrosine content of FAK, paxillin, and p130cas and in controlling the rate of cell spreading and migration (15.Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 173-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, PTP1B can associate with p130cas via an SH3 domain mediated interaction and may sometimes localize to focal adhesions (16.Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 17.Arregui C.O. Balsamo J. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain containing PTP, SHP2, can be coimmunoprecipitated with FAK (18.Yu D.-H. Qu C.-K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts lacking functional SHP2, the phosphotyrosine content of FAK and paxillin is perturbed and the cells exhibit retarded spreading on fibronectin and reduced motility (18.Yu D.-H. Qu C.-K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 19.Oh E.-S. Gu H. Saxton T.M. Timms J.F. Hausdorff S.

One other candidate PTP for regulation of focal adhesion-associated proteins is PTP-PEST. This PTP was first implicated in this function when p130cas was identified as a PTP-PEST substrate using a substrate trapping approach (20.Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In addition, there are binding sites in the noncatalytic domain of PTP-PEST for both the SH3 domain of p130cas and for paxillin (21.Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22.Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PTP-PEST in Rat 1 fibroblasts reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas, but not tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK or paxillin, and retards cell motility (23.Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Conversely, PTP-PEST−/− fibroblasts exhibit elevated levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas (24.Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.-F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These cells also exhibit dramatic elevation in the phosphotyrosine content of both FAK and paxillin (24.Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.-F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The PTP-PEST−/− cells spread more rapidly than wild type cells but show reduced motility (24.Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.-F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In this report, we further characterize the interaction of PTP-PEST with paxillin. The PTP-PEST binding site on paxillin is localized to the two carboxyl-terminal LIM domains. The paxillin-binding site on PTP-PEST is shown to reside close to, but is independent of, the p130cas-binding site. Although paxillin does not associate with substrate trapping constructs of PTP-PEST, expression of PTP-PEST in 293 cells results in a reduction in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous paxillin. Using mutants of PTP-PEST, we demonstrate that the interaction of p130cas and paxillin with the noncatalytic domain of PTP-PEST is required for their dephosphorylation in vivo. Chicken embryo (CE) cells were prepared and cultured as described previously (25.Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and COS cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. For expression as GST fusion proteins, fragments of PTP-PEST were amplified by PCR using the PTP-PEST cDNA as template. Primers were designed to create a 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ EcoRI site, and the fragments were inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the multiple cloning site of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in-frame with the GST coding sequence. For expression in the yeast 2-hybrid system, the fragment of PTP-PEST extending from codon 297 to codon 485 was amplified by PCR using primers that created EcoRI sites. This fragment was subcloned into pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto CA) and pGAD424 (CLONTECH) in-frame with the Gal 4 sequences. Various fragments of paxillin were amplified by PCR and subcloned in-frame into pGBT9 or pGAD424. The amino-terminal domain of paxillin (residues 3–332) was subcloned into the pGAD424 vector because expression of this fragment of paxillin in the pGBT9 vector results in autoactivation of the reporter gene. 2Unpublished observations. The carboxyl-terminal domain of paxillin (codons 320–559) was subcloned into pGBT9. Smaller fragments of paxillin, including LIM domains 1, 2, and 3 (codons 320–502), LIM domains 2, 3, and 4 (codons 376–559), LIM domains 1 and 2 (codons 320–441), LIM domains 2 and 3 (codons 376–502), LIM domains 3 and 4 (codons 436–559), LIM domain 1 (codons 320–381), LIM domain 2 (codons 376–441), LIM domain 3 (codons 436–502), and LIM domain 4 (codons 495–559) were inserted in-frame into pGAD424. Constructs containing the LIM 4 domain terminate at the stop codon of paxillin. The 3′ primers used to amplify each of the other fragments created an in-frame stop codon. For expression in mammalian cells, epitope-tagged derivatives of PTP-PEST were engineered into pcDNA 3 as described previously (22.Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The point mutant P337A was created by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites mutagenesis protocol (Promega, Madison WI). Mutant dl 367–400 was created by PCR amplification of a DNA fragment encoding residues 99–367 using a primer creating a 3′KpnI site. A second PCR product containing codons 400–884 was generated using a primer creating a 5′ KpnI site. Ligation of the two PCR products via the KpnI sites resulted in the in-frame fusion of codons 99–367 with codons 400–884. These fragments were inserted between the HindIII site (at codon 99 of PTP-PEST) and the SalI site (in the multiple cloning site 3′ of the PTP-PEST termination codon) of pBluescript/PTP-PEST. The mutants were then subcloned into pcDNA3. Yeast strain CG-1945 was used for this analysis. Cells were grown in YPD media, and plasmids were introduced using the LiAc transformation protocol (26.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 186Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on minimal media plates lacking tryptophan (to select for pGBT9 derivatives), leucine (to select for pGAD424 derivatives), or both (to select for double transformants). Transformants were purified by streaking on a selective plate. Expression of the lacZreporter gene was tested using the blue/white colony assay. Yeast were streaked onto a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene NH) on top of a selective minimal medium plate and grown at 30 °C. The yeast were lysed using liquid N2, and the nitrocellulose filters were placed on Whatman 3 mmpaper saturated with Z buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4) containing 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.3 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. After incubation at room temperature overnight, colonies were scored as blue or white. Cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (22.Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or Triton X-100 lysis buffer (22.Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were performed using approximately 500 μg of cell lysate and 5 μl of polyclonal antisera or 2 μg of purified antibody. Monoclonal antibody KT3 was used to recognize tagged variants of PTP-PEST. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing p130cas and paxillin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum recognizing the noncatalytic domain of PTP-PEST was generated as described below. Immune complexes were precipitated using protein A-Sepharose beads or goat anti-mouse agarose beads. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with Tris-buffered saline. The samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Phosphotyrosine was detected using RC20 (Transduction Laboratories). Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A GST fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 304 amino acids of PTP-PEST was used as antigen to prepare polyvalent rabbit antiserum as described previously (27.Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was purified on glutathione beads, eluted with 2% SDS and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. For primary immunizations, 1 mg of fusion protein in phosphate-buffered saline was emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into female New Zealand White rabbits. For all boosts, 500 μg of antigen in phosphate-buffered saline was emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously. Serum was prepared by centrifugation of cellular and clotted material from whole blood. Fragments of PTP-PEST were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified as described (28.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, 1–2 μg of fusion protein (immobilized to glutathione beads) was incubated with 100–200 μg of lysate for 1 h. The beads were washed as described for immune complexes above, and bound paxillin was detected by Western blotting. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to map the PTP-PEST binding site on paxillin. The carboxyl-terminal half of paxillin was expressed as a GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein using the pGBT9 vector. A fragment of PTP-PEST containing the paxillin-binding site (residues 297–485) was expressed as a GAL4 activation domain fusion protein using the pGAD424 vector. Coexpression of these two proteins induced expression of the lacZ reporter as assessed using a colorimetric assay (Fig. 1 A). When the amino-terminal half of paxillin was expressed alone as a GAL4 DNA fusion protein, it activated the reporter gene.2 Therefore reciprocal constructs were engineered to determine whether the amino-terminal domain of paxillin interacted with PTP-PEST. Residues 297–485 of PTP-PEST were expressed as a GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein and the amino-terminal domain of paxillin was expressed as a GAL4 activation domain fusion protein. Coexpression of these two proteins failed to activate expression of the reporter gene (Fig.1 A). Despite their inability to interact, both of these fusion proteins were functional in yeast. The amino-terminal domain of paxillin interacted with a GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein containing the paxillin-binding site of FAK (Fig. 1 A). The GAL4 DNA binding domain/PTP-PEST fusion protein interacted with several GAL4 activation domain/paxillin LIM domain fusion proteins (see below). Thus in the yeast two-hybrid system PTP-PEST binds to the carboxyl-terminal, LIM domain containing half of paxillin. To validate the findings from the yeast two-hybrid system, fragments of paxillin were transiently expressed in COS cells and tested for PTP-PEST binding activity. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of paxillin were subcloned into pcDNA3 for transient expression. Each was engineered to contain the KT3 epitope tag at the carboxyl terminus. Both of these constructs were efficiently expressed in COS cells as determined by Western blotting whole cell lysates using the KT3 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). To examine PTP-PEST binding, cell lysates were incubated with a GST fusion protein containing PTP-PEST residues 297–494, which was immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were collected and washed, and associated fragments of paxillin were detected by Western blotting with KT3. The carboxyl-terminal half of paxillin was found associated with the GST/PTP-PEST fusion protein (Fig. 2, lane 3). Although the amino-terminal half of paxillin was expressed in the COS cell lysates, it failed to associate with the GST/PTP-PEST fusion protein (Fig. 2, lane 4). These results are in accord with the yeast two-hybrid data and demonstrate that the PTP-PEST binding region is within the carboxyl-terminal half of paxillin. To further refine the PTP-PEST binding site within paxillin, a series of deletion mutants was engineered and analyzed in the yeast two-hybrid system for interaction with PTP-PEST. Originally, the paxillin/PTP-PEST interaction was reconstituted in yeast by expressing the four paxillin LIM domains as a GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein. Expression of this construct alone did not activate the reporter gene.2However, expression of GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins containing fewer than four LIM domains resulted in activation of the reporter gene.2 To circumvent this problem, the reciprocal constructs were built and analyzed. Thus a GAL4 DNA binding domain/PTP-PEST fusion protein was tested for interaction with GAL4 activation domain/paxillin LIM domain fusion proteins. Deletion of LIM 4 abrogated interaction with PTP-PEST (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, a fusion protein containing paxillin LIM domains 2, 3, and 4 did interact with PTP-PEST in the two-hybrid system (Fig.1 B). Next, fusion proteins containing pairs of LIM domains from paxillin were analyzed. Whereas a protein containing LIM domains 3 and 4 from paxillin interacted with PTP-PEST, fusion proteins containing either LIM domains 1 and 2 or LIM domains 2 and 3 failed to interact (Fig. 1 C). Additional constructs containing each of the individual LIM domains of paxillin fused to the GAL 4 activation domain were tested but all failed to interact with PTP-PEST in the two-hybrid system.2 The failure of individual LIM domains to interact with PTP-PEST could indicate that a functional binding site is composed of sequences from both LIM 3 and LIM4. In contrast, the stability of the structure or the strength of the interaction of individual LIM domains may simply be compromised. To attempt to strengthen the potential interaction between individual LIM domains and PTP-PEST, multiple copies of individual LIM domains were engineered in-frame with the Gal 4 activation domain. However, tandem copies of LIM domain 3 (called LIM 33) or LIM domain 4 (called LIM 44) both failed to interact with PTP-PEST in the yeast 2-hybrid system (Fig.1 C). The results of this analysis demonstrate that the PTP-PEST binding site on paxillin lies within LIM domains 3 and 4. It was previously demonstrated that a recombinant fusion protein containing PTP-PEST codons 297–494 could directly bind to both p130cas and paxillin (22.Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The p130cas binding site in PTP-PEST has been identified as the proline-rich sequence extending from amino acid 333 to 338 (21.Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The recognition binding sites for several LIM domains have been identified, and a proline containing sequence has been implicated as the binding site for one of the LIM domains of enigma (29.Wu R.

To exclude the possibility that paxillin binds to the same proline rich region as p130cas, two GST fusion proteins containing PTP-PEST residues 276–400 were utilized. One contained wild type PTP-PEST sequences and the other contained a point mutation, proline 337 to alanine, which has been shown to abrogate association with the p130cas SH3 domain (21.Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Each fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione beads, incubated with cell lysate and associated p130cas and paxillin detected by Western blotting. The wild type PTP-PEST sequences bound to both paxillin and p130cas (Fig.3, top and middle panels,lane 2). The P337A mutant failed to associate with p130cas (Fig. 3, middle panel, lane 3) but exhibited undiminished paxillin binding activity (Fig. 3, top panel, lane 3). Therefore, the paxillin-binding site was distinct from the p130cas binding site. To further delineate the paxillin-binding site, a series of GST fusion proteins containing different fragments of PTP-PEST was engineered and characterized for paxillin binding activity (Fig.4). A fusion protein containing PTP-PEST residues 277–398 bound paxillin as well as fusion proteins containing PEST residues 297–492 and 297 to the carboxyl terminus of the protein (Fig. 5 A, top panel, lanes 3and 8, and data not shown). A series of amino-terminal deletions of the GST/PTP-PEST 277–398 construct was analyzed. Deletion of 61 residues had no effect upon binding. Thus GST/PTP-PEST 338–390 had undiminished paxillin-binding activity (Fig. 5 B, top panel, lanes 3 and 4). Deletion of an additional 14 residues compromised paxillin binding. Although GST/PTP-PEST 352–398 exhibited binding activity, it bound to paxillin much more weakly than GST/PTP-PEST 338–390 (Fig. 5 B, top panel, lanes 4 and5). Further deletion from the amino terminus very severely compromised paxillin binding. GST/PTP-PEST 371–492 exhibited drastically reduced binding activity (Fig. 5 A, top panel, lane 5). In some experiments, a small amount of bound paxillin was detected, whereas in others, no paxillin was detected. A series of carboxyl-terminal deletions was also built and analyzed. Truncation of the carboxyl terminus to residue 390 had little effect on paxillin binding activity (Fig. 5 B, top panel, lane 4). However, a deletion extending to residue 368 had a severe effect upon paxillin binding. Thus GST/PTP-PEST 277–368 exhibited very weak binding (Fig.5 A, top panel, lane 7). In some experiments, paxillin binding was detectable, whereas in others it was not.Figure 5Nonoverlapping fragments of PTP-PEST exhibit weak paxillin binding activity. A and B,glutathione beads containing 2 μg of immobilized GST or GST/PTP-PEST fusion proteins were incubated with 100 μg of CE cell lysate, and bound paxillin was detected by Western blotting (top panels). Each GST fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue (bottom panels). GST alone was used as a negative control (lanes 2, top panels). The residues of PTP-PEST contained in each fusion protein are denotedabove each lane. Ten μg of lysate was included as a loading control (lanes 1, top panels). C,glutathione beads containing GST fusion proteins were incubated with CE cell lysates, and bound paxillin was detected by Western blotting (top panel). For this analysis, 100 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 25 μg of GST (lane 2), 10 μg of GST/PTP-PEST 277–368 (lane 3), 25 μg of GST/PTP-PEST 277–368 (lane 4), 10 μg of GST/PTP-PEST 371–492 (lane 5), or 25 μg of GST/PTP-PEST 371–492 (lane 6). Ten μg of lysate was analyzed as a loading control (lane 1). Each fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results suggest that the minimal paxillin-binding site in PTP-PEST extends from residue 338 through residue 390. Removal of residues from either the amino or carboxyl termini of this fragment dramatically reduced, but did not totally abrogate, paxillin-binding activity. This observation could be explained if further deletion destabilized a single binding site. Alternatively, this observation could indicate that there are two weaker paxillin-binding sites within this region of PTP-PEST, and both binding sites are required for full binding activity. This idea is consistent with the observations that GST/PTP-PEST 277–368 and GST/PTP-PEST 371–492 both exhibit very weak but detectable paxillin binding activity. This hypothesis was further tested by more extensively analyzing the binding activity of two nonoverlapping constructs, GST/PTP-PEST 277–368 and GST/PTP-PEST 371–492. Although both fusion proteins bound very weakly to paxillin under the standard conditions of interaction, significant binding activity was detected if 10-fold more fusion protein was used in the binding reaction (Fig. 5 C, top panel). Importantly, under these conditions, GST alone did not detectably bind paxillin (Fig.5 C, top panel, lane 2). Therefore, the interaction is apparently still specific under these conditions. These results suggest that there are two sites of PTP-PEST that can weakly interact with paxillin. One site lies between amino acids 338 and 368 and the other resides between residues 371 and 390. Both weak binding sites are required for the efficient association of paxillin with PTP-PEST. To further characterize PTP-PEST, a polyclonal antiserum recognizing a fragment of the noncatalytic domain was generated. The carboxyl-terminal 304 residues of PTP-PEST were expressed as a GST fusion protein and purified using glutathione-agarose beads. The fusion protein was used as an antigen to raise polyvalent antiserum in rabbits. The antiserum was characterized using lysates of 293 cells and 293 cells expressing exogenous PTP-PEST.

Little is known regarding mechanisms by which its transport activity is modulatedin vivo. In previous studies (Campbell, C. G., Spray, D. C., and Wolkoff, A. W. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 15399–15404), we demonstrated that hepatocyte uptake of sulfobromophthalein was down-regulated by extracellular ATP. We have now found that extracellular ATP reduces theV max for transport of sulfobromophthalein by rat hepatocytes; K m remains unaltered. Reduced transport also results from incubation of hepatocytes with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A. Immunoprecipitation of biotinylated cell surface proteins indicates that oatp1 remains on the cell surface after exposure of cells to ATP or phosphatase inhibitor, suggesting that loss of transport activity is not caused by transporter internalization. Exposure of32P-loaded hepatocytes to extracellular ATP results in serine phosphorylation of oatp1 with the appearance of a single major tryptic phosphopeptide; oatp1 from control cells is not phosphorylated. This phosphopeptide comigrates with one of four phosphopeptides resulting from incubation of cells with okadaic acid. These studies indicate that the phosphorylation state of oatp1 must be an important consideration when assessing alterations of its functional expression in pathobiological states.

Expression of oatp1 is limited to the basolateral plasma membrane of the hepatocyte (11.Bergwerk A. Shi X. Ford A. Kanai N. Jacquemin E. Burk R.D. Bai S. Novikoff P.M. Stieger B. Meier P.J.

Other studies indicate that oatp1 is an electroneutral anion exchanger in which uptake of a compound such as BSP is accompanied by efflux of a counter-ion such as HCO3− (14.Satlin L.M. Amin V. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26340-26345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) or GSH (15.Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16184-16191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although oatp1 is under strong developmental regulation (13.Angeletti R. Bergwerk A. Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 275: C882-C887Crossref Google Scholar), little is known regarding mechanisms by which its activity may be modulated in vivo. In previous studies, we demonstrated that hepatocyte uptake of BSP was down-regulated rapidly and specifically by extracellular ATP (16.Campbell C.G. Spray D.C. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15399-15404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, it appeared that this effect was caused by the tetra-anion ATP−4. Characteristics of nucleotide specificity suggested that ATP was interacting with a purinergic receptor that was similar to the P2Z (now P2X7) receptor (17.Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). This receptor has been described in macrophages and other cells as forming a channel that facilitates anion permeability (18.Steinberg T.H. Newman A.S. Swanson J.A. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8884-8888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Coutinho-Silva R. Persechini P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1793-C1800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That ATP−4reduces organic anion permeability in hepatocytes suggests that it acts by a different mechanism in these cells. Purinergic receptors in the P2Y class are G protein-coupled, and several have been described with nucleotide specificities similar to that described previously for inhibition of organic anion transport by hepatocytes (20.Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Dubyak G.R. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Schwabe U. Williams M.

Sci. 1998; 19: 506-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which activation of a purinergic receptor might influence oatp1 function is unknown. Candidates include phosphorylation of the transporter with subsequent reduction of activity or internalization from the cell surface. The purpose of the present study was to examine these mechanistic possibilities. Hepatocytes were isolated from 200–250-g male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) after perfusion of the liver with collagenase type I (Worthington) (13.Angeletti R. Bergwerk A. Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 275: C882-C887Crossref Google Scholar). All animals used in this study received humane care in compliance with the institution's guidelines. Viability of isolated hepatocytes was >90% as judged by trypan blue exclusion. In some experiments, hepatocytes were cultured overnight as described previously (13.Angeletti R. Bergwerk A. Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 275: C882-C887Crossref Google Scholar, 23.Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In brief, freshly isolated hepatocytes were suspended in Waymouth 752/1 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA), 1.7 mmadditional CaCl2, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Approximately 1.5 × 106 cells in 3 ml of medium were placed in 60-mm Primaria culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and cultured in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After 2 h, the medium was changed, and cells were cultured overnight for approximately 18 h. HeLa cells (ATCC) stably transfected with pMEP-4-oatp1 were cultured and grown in selective medium as described previously (24.Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D. Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The pMEP-4-oatp1 plasmid was constructed so that expression of oatp1 was under the control of a metallothionein promoter (24.Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D. Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For induction of oatp1, cells were cultured for 24 h in medium containing 100 μmZnSO4 and then 24 h following an additional 50 μm (total of 150 μm) ZnSO4(24.Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D.

A peptide containing the amino-terminal 14 amino acids of the derived oatp1 sequence was synthesized with a cysteine residue at the carboxyl terminus to be used as a linker. Synthesis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-(fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The peptide structure was verified by amino acid analysis and by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a PE Sciex API-III instrument. These procedures were performed in the Laboratory of Macromolecular Analysis at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. This peptide is unique to oatp1, and the sequence is distinct from protein sequences of the other known members of the oatp family of proteins. This cysteine-terminating peptide was linked to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions. Rabbits were immunized with this keyhole limpet hemocyanin-linked peptide by Covance Research products, Inc. (Denver, PA). Specificity of the resulting antiserum was tested by immunoblot as described previously (11.Bergwerk A. Shi X. Ford A. Kanai N. Jacquemin E. Burk R.D. Bai S. Novikoff P.M. Stieger B. Meier P.J.

Calyculin A, Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine methyl ester (BAME), soybean trypsin inhibitor,Nα-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester (TAME), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, ATP, BSP, and 1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin were from Sigma. 35S-BSP was prepared as described previously (24.Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D. Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol.

Cells were suspended with gentle rotation in 1 ml of this medium at 37 °C for 30 min. After three washes, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-free minimum essential medium, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 100 μl (1 mCi) of 32Pi was added. Cells were rotated gently at 37 °C for 2 h. Cell viability remained unchanged during these incubations. In some studies, after this incubation period ATP (final concentration 5 mm) or okadaic acid (final concentration 0.6 μm) was added to the medium for an additional 10 min. Cells were then quickly pelleted and washed three times in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μg/ml BAME, 20 μg/ml TAME, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μmokadaic acid at 4 °C. The cell pellets were then processed for immunoprecipitation. 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm octyl glucoside, 20 μg/ml BAME, 20 μg/ml TAME, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmokadaic acid, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, was added to each cell pellet and vortexed vigorously. The tubes were allowed to sit on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a table top centrifuge (Hermle Z230M, Hermle GmbH & Co., Gosheim, Germany). The supernatant and 10 μl of nonimmune rabbit serum were placed in a tube containing 40 μl of protein A/G agarose beads (Pierce) which had been prewashed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer. This mixture was rotated gently at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged to remove nonspecifically adsorbed material. A 10-μl aliquot of anti-oatp1 was added to the supernatant and rotated at 4 °C overnight. 40 μl of protein A/G agarose beads was then added, and tubes were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were removed by aspiration, and the beads were washed five times at 4 °C with 1 ml of buffer consisting of 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2. The samples were subsequently washed with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE in the absence of reduction. After electrophoresis, the samples were transferred onto NitroBind nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Micron Separations, Inc., Westboro, MA). Radioautography was performed utilizing BioMax MS film (Kodak) with an intensifying screen at −70 °C for 1–4 days. Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis was performed by a modification of methods described previously (25.Glavy J.S. Wolfson M. Nieves E. Han E.K. Yang C.P. Horwitz S.B. Orr G.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). After drying, digested samples were resuspended in 7 μl of pH 1.9 buffer consisting of a mixture of 88% formic acid, glacial acetic acid, and twice deionized water (50:156:1,794, v/v). Samples were applied onto a 100-μm cellulose thin layer chromatography plate (Merck). The plates were electrophoresed in the first dimension at 650 volts in pH 1.9 buffer for 1 h in a Hunter thin layer peptide mapping system model HTLC-7000 (C.B.S. Scientific Co., Inc., Del Mar, CA). After blow drying, plates were rotated 90° and chromatographed in a solution consisting of isobutyric acid, n-butyl alcohol, pyridine, glacial acetic acid, and twice deionized water (125:3.8:9.6:5.8:55.8, v/v). After drying, plates were exposed to BioMax MS film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen for 7–10 days. Tryptic peptides were prepared as above. 50 μl of 6 nHCl was added to the dried hydrolysate and then heated at 110 °C for 70 min. The sample was dried, resuspended in pH 1.9 buffer, and subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis as described previously (26.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Migration of unlabeled amino acid standards was revealed by subsequent exposure of the plate to ninhydrin. Cell surface biotinylation was performed as a modification of a method described previously (28.Altin J.G. Pagler E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Overnight cultured rat hepatocytes were washed three times with 1.5 ml of buffer A, consisting of 135 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 27.8 mm glucose, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in 1 ml of this buffer for 15 min. ATP (5 mm final concentration) or okadaic acid (0.6 μm final concentration) was then added, and incubation was continued for 10 min. Cells were then washed three times at 4 °C with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0. They were then incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce), a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent. After biotinylation, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, and then processed for immunoprecipitation of oatp1, as described above. To ensure that cells remained intact during this procedure and that internal protein was not biotinylated, immunoprecipitation was also performed using an antibody to a common determinant of the Yb rat GST subunit, kindly provided by Dr. Irving Listowsky (29.Abramovitz M. Ishigaki S. Felix A.M. Listowsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17627-17631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is abundant in rat hepatocyte cytosol. That Yb could be biotinylated in disrupted cells was confirmed by harvesting cells in phosphate-buffered saline, homogenizing them by 20 strokes in a tight Dounce, and performing the biotinylation procedure on the supernatant following table top centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and biotinylated oatp1 was detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following transfer to nitrocellulose and probing with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Pierce). Densitometry of immunoblot bands was performed using an Ultrascan XL densitometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transport of 35S-BSP was quantified in cultured rat hepatocytes as described previously (13.Angeletti R. Bergwerk A. Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 275: C882-C887Crossref Google Scholar, 23.Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed three times with 1.5 ml of buffer A. They were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% BSA. After this period, cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of buffer A with or without 5 mm ATP, 0.6 μmokadaic acid, or 50 nm calyculin A. 1 μm35S-BSP (approximately 105 cpm) was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 5 min. The solution was then aspirated rapidly, and cells were washed five times at 4 °C with 1.5 ml of buffer A. The third wash contained 5% BSA and was allowed to stand for 5 min. Cells were harvested, and radioactivity was determined. Cell protein was determined in replicate plates by the BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions using BSA as standard. In studies of saturation of BSP uptake, varied concentrations of BSP were used, keeping the ratio of BSA to BSP constant as described previously (23.Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). K m andV max were quantified by non-linear least squares fit of the data (SigmaPlot v. 4.0, Jandel Corporation, San Rafael, CA) to Equation 1.V=Vmax∗[BSP]Km+[BSP]+b∗[BSP]Equation 1 In this equation, b is a constant representing nonspecific association of ligand with cells. Similar studies were performed in oatp1-transfected HeLa cells, except that BSA was not included in the incubation of cells with 35S-BSP (24.Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D. Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In these studies, overnight cultured rat hepatocytes were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 0.1% BSA containing 1 μm35S-BSP in the presence and absence of 0.6 μm okadaic acid, 5 mm ATP, or a mixture of both okadaic acid and ATP. As seen in Fig.1 A, incubation with the phosphatase inhibitor (okadaic acid) alone reduced 35S-BSP uptake by approximately 35% (p < 0.001). ATP inclusion in the medium resulted in an approximately 77% reduction in35S-BSP uptake (p < 0.001). Inclusion of both ATP and okadaic acid in the medium reduced uptake by 85%, a significantly greater reduction than was seen with either agent alone (p < 0.001). It was possible that addition of okadaic acid and ATP reduced 35S-BSP uptake because of competition for uptake. However, as seen in Fig. 1 B, these agents had no effect (p > 0.9) on 35S-BSP uptake by HeLa cells that had been stably transfected with oatp1. As seen in Fig. 2 A, the initial uptake of 35S-BSP was reduced over a range of BSP concentrations. Non-linear analysis of these data revealed saturable and nonsaturable components (Fig. 2, B and C). There was no effect of ATP treatment on K m (0.0699 μm ± 0.009, control versus 0.0601 μm ± 0.018, ATP treated, n = 4,p > 0.6). In contrast, V max was reduced significantly by ATP treatment (1.766 pmol/min/mg of protein ± 0.327, control versus 0.683 pmol/min/mg of protein ± 0.085, ATP-treated, n = 4,p < 0.04). The constant for nonspecific cell interaction, b, was also reduced in ATP-treated cells (0.504 ± 0.104 pmol/min/mg of protein/μm, controlversus 0.172 ± 0.052 pmol/min/mg of protein/μm, ATP-treated, p < 0.03). Reduced V max for BSP transport, as shown in the studies described above, could result from internalization of cell surface oatp1 as a consequence of the addition of ATP or okadaic acid to the medium. To examine this possibility, after treatment with these agents, the surface of hepatocytes was biotinylated using a strategy that does not biotinylate intracellular proteins. Oatp1 was then immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, biotinylated oatp1 was quantified. As seen in Fig. 3, there was no reduction in cell surface oatp1 after incubation in ATP or okadaic acid. Densitometric analysis revealed recoveries of immunoprecipitated oatp1 of 88% and 104% of control after incubation in okadaic acid and ATP, respectively (averages of two and three independent studies, respectively). When intact hepatocytes were biotinylated, no biotinylated Yb was detected in the immunoprecipitate. When disrupted cells were biotinylated, biotinylated Yb was detected readily after immunoprecipitation (data not shown). The studies presented above suggest the possibility that ATP, when added to the cell medium, interacts with a purinergic receptor that stimulates phosphorylation of oatp1 through a signal transduction mechanism. In support of this hypothesis is the finding that okadaic acid and calyculin A, structurally distinct phosphatase inhibitors (31.Li D. Cheng S.J. Fisone G. Caplan M.J. Ohtomo Y. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F863-F869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are equally effective in inhibiting 35S-BSP transport (Fig.4). These results suggest that the phosphorylation state of oatp1 represents the net balance between kinase and phosphatase activities. As seen in Fig.5 a, under control conditions, no oatp1-derived tryptic phosphopeptides are seen. After a 10-min exposure of cells to extracellular ATP, a single major tryptic phosphopeptide appears (Fig. 5 b). Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed exclusive serine phosphorylation (data not shown). After exposure of cells to okadaic acid, four distinct tryptic phosphopeptides are seen (Fig. 5 c). One of these phosphopeptides comigrates with the phosphopeptide that results from ATP treatment (Fig. 5 d). Exclusive serine phosphorylation of oatp1 was also observed in okadaic acid-treated hepatocytes (data not shown). In contrast to results in rat hepatocytes, oatp1 did not become phosphorylated after ATP treatment of HeLa cells that had been stably transfected with the oatp1 expression vector (data not shown).Figure 5Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis of immunoprecipitated 32P-oatp1. Rat hepatocytes were incubated in phosphate-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in phosphate-free medium supplemented with 1 mCi of 32Pi. After this incubation period, cells were incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 °C following no further additions (panel a) or addition of 5 mm ATP (panel b), 0.6 μm okadaic acid (panel c), or a mixture of 5 mm ATP and 0.6 μm okadaic acid (panel d). After washing, cells were pelleted, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody specific for the amino terminus of oatp1. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE in the absence of reduction, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to radioautography. Nitrocellulose strips corresponding to immunoprecipitated oatp1 were excised, incubated with TPCK-treated trypsin, and the digests were subjected to two-dimensional mapping as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Plates were then subjected to radioautography. No labeled tryptic phosphopeptides were observed under control conditions (panel a), whereas after exposure to ATP for 10 min, a single major tryptic phosphopeptide appears as indicated by the arrowhead (panel b). After a 10-min exposure to okadaic acid, four distinct tryptic phosphopeptides are seen (panel c), one of which comigrates with the phosphopeptide that results from ATP treatment (arrowhead). The intensity of this phosphopeptide is enhanced when ATP and okadaic acid are added together (panel d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transport of organic anions is a fundamental function of the hepatocyte (1.Scharschmidt B.F.

Oatp1 is best modeled as a 12-transmembrane domain protein and is the first member of a unique family of plasma membrane transporters of varied tissue and substrate specificities. Studies that examined functional expression of oatp1 in the presence and absence of specific antisense oligonucleotides suggested that this protein mediates a substantial proportion of hepatocyte transport of the synthetic organic anion, BSP (32.Hagenbuch B. Scharschmidt B.F. Meier P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When this compound is administered intravenously, it binds tightly to albumin in the circulation from which it is cleared rapidly (1.Scharschmidt B.F. Waggoner J.G. Berk P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1280-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that BSP was also extracted efficiently from its albumin carrier by rat hepatocytes in culture (23.Min A.D. Johansen K.L. Campbell C.G. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33.Wolkoff A.W. Samuelson A.C. Johansen K.L. Nakata R. Withers D.M. Sosiak A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These characteristics of transport were used to devise the strategy that resulted in the expression cloning of oatp1 (3.Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2146-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4.Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Oatp1 has no homology to the ATP-binding cassette class of transporters. It appears to function as an anion exchanger in which an organic anion is taken up in exchange for a HCO3− (14.Satlin L.M. Amin V. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26340-26345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that GSH may also serve as an exchangeable intracellular anion (15.Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16184-16191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Mechanisms by which oatp1 function may be regulated are unknown. There is little oatp1 expression in the neonatal rat liver (13.Angeletti R. Bergwerk A. Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 275: C882-C887Crossref Google Scholar), and its expression in the adult may be under weak hormonal control (34.Lu R. Kanai N. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F332-F337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Simon F.R. Fortune J. Iwahashi M. Gartung C. Wolkoff A.W. Sutherland E. Am. J.

In previous studies, we found that transport of BSP by hepatocytes was down-regulated rapidly in the presence of extracellular ATP (16.Campbell C.G. Spray D.C. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15399-15404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies performed in the presence and absence of divalent cations suggested that it was the tetra-anionic form (i.e.ATP−4) that mediated this effect (16.Campbell C.G. Spray D.C. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15399-15404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular ADP had no influence on BSP transport, although it was as effective as ATP in elevating intracellular free Ca+2, presumably through P2Y purinergic receptors (16.Campbell C.G. Spray D.C. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15399-15404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the purinergic receptor that mediates down-regulation of hepatocyte organic anion transport is not known. Evidence has been presented for the existence of two distinct P2Y receptors in rat hepatocytes (37.Dixon C.J. Woods N.M. Cuthbertson K.S. Cobbold P.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). One of these receptors responds to both ATP and ADP and produces free Ca+2transients of short duration. The other responds to ATP only and produces Ca+2 transients of longer duration. Whether this latter receptor type regulates organic anion transport may be speculated, but direct evidence is lacking. Molecular characterization of these proteins in the liver has not as yet been established. The present study provides evidence that oatp1 undergoes serine phosphorylation in response to extracellular ATP. A number of other plasma membrane transporters that undergo phosphorylation have been described. The Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (ntcp) undergoes phosphorylation that is catalyzed by protein kinase A (38.Mukhopadhyay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1629-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 39.Grune S. Engelking L.R. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17734-17741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that this phosphorylation regulates translocation of the protein between the plasma membrane and an intracellular vesicular pool (40.Mukhopadhyay S. Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30039-30045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The GLUT4 glucose transporter also cycles between plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles under regulation of cAMP (41.Kelada A.S. Macaulay S.L. Proietto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7021-7025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may regulate phosphorylation of the transporter and associated proteins (42.Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1458-1464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the mdr1b P-glycoprotein has several sites that are phosphorylated (25.Glavy J.S. Wolfson M. Nieves E. Han E.K. Yang C.P. Horwitz S.B. Orr G.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar,27.Glavy J.S. Horwitz S.B. Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5909-5914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although an effect on function or subcellular localization has not as yet been described. The Na+/H+ exchanger is phosphorylated on a serine residue by protein kinase C, and this reduces its activity by altering its conformational state (30.Logvinenko N.S. Dulubova I. Fedosova N. Larsson S.H. Nairn A.C. Esmann M. Greengard P. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9132-9137Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31.Li D. Cheng S.J. Fisone G. Caplan M.J. Ohtomo Y. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F863-F869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study indicates that similar to the Na+/H+ exchanger, when oatp1 is phosphorylated, it loses transport activity but does not leave the cell surface. Retention on the cell surface was demonstrated by quantitative biotinylation of oatp1 with a membrane-impermeant reagent. Even though this transporter remains on the cell surface,V max for transport is reduced by more than 60% (Fig. 2). This reduction in transport activity correlates with appearance of a single major tryptic peptide that becomes phosphorylated in response to extracellular ATP. The location of this peptide in the protein and the mechanism by which phosphorylation alters its transport function are not as yet known. As noted above, recent studies have shown that oatp1 is an anion exchanger (14.Satlin L.M. Amin V. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26340-26345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15.Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16184-16191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It is possible that addition of a negatively charged phosphate group to the inner domain of the protein prevents this exchange from occurring. However, numerous alternative possibilities exist, and structure-function relationships of oatp1 remain to be elucidated. It is of interest that HeLa cells that have been stably transfected with oatp1 show no phosphorylation of this protein in response to extracellular ATP or okadaic acid. Likewise, in these oatp1-expressing cells, BSP uptake is not affected by these agents. It is likely that they lack either the purinergic receptor or the kinase that mediates this response to ATP. The physiologic consequences of ATP-mediated down-regulation of organic anion transport are unknown. It is possible that in states in which there is liver injury, ATP is released locally and reduces the ability of hepatocytes to extract organic anions from the blood. This could be protective by keeping cells from being overloaded with potentially toxic anionic compounds, or it could exacerbate effects of already compromised liver function. It is clear that the phosphorylation state of the transporter must be considered when assessing alterations of its functional expression in pathobiological states."
https://openalex.org/W1552641940,"A major lipid-signaling pathway in mammalian cells implicates the generation of ceramide from the ubiquitous sphingolipid sphingomyelin (SM). Hydrolysis of SM by a sphingomyelinase present in acidic compartments has been reported to mediate, via the production of ceramide, the apoptotic cell death triggered by stress-inducing agents. In the present study, we investigated whether the ceramide formed within or accumulated in lysosomes indeed triggers apoptosis. A series of observations strongly suggests that ceramide involved in stress-induced apoptosis is not endolysosomal: 1) Although short-chain ceramides induced apoptosis, loading cells with natural ceramide through receptor-mediated endocytosis did not result in cell death. 2) Neither TNF-alpha nor anti-CD95 induced the degradation to ceramide of a natural SM that had been first introduced selectively into acidic compartments. 3) Stimulation of SV40-transformed fibroblasts by TNF-alpha or CD40 ligand resulted in apoptosis equally well in cells derived from control individuals and from patients affected with Farber disease, having a genetic defect of acid ceramidase activity leading to lysosomal accumulation of ceramide. Also, induction of apoptosis using anti-CD95 (Fas) or anti-CD40 antibodies, TNF-alpha, daunorubicin, and ionizing radiation was similar in control and Farber disease lymphoid cells. In all cases, apoptosis was preceded by a comparable increase of intracellular ceramide levels. 4) Retroviral-mediated gene transfer and overexpression of acid ceramidase in Farber fibroblasts, which led to complete metabolic correction of the ceramide catabolic defect, did not affect the cell response to TNF-alpha and CD40 ligand."

However, the concentrations of these drugs required to cause S phase arrest are 2–4 orders of magnitude lower than levels of drug required to cause detectable adducts and to block polymerase or helicase progression. These results suggest that inhibition of DNA replication and cell cycle progression in cultured cells upon treatment with CPI drugs occurs via a trans-acting mechanism rather than by directly blocking DNA replication fork progression. The most likely explanation for this trans-inhibition of DNA replication is through cellular DNA damage response pathways or checkpoints. Since both viral, simian virus 40 (SV40), and cellular DNA replication are inhibited at similar CPI levels, it is possible to use the more easily studied viral system to elucidate how CPI treatment results in DNA replication arrest. SV40 DNA replication is the most well studied model for eukaryotic DNA replication. An in vitro system was developed that requires only one viral protein, SV40 large T antigen, an exogenous plasmid DNA template containing the SV40 origin sequence, and primate or human cell extracts, to support SV40 DNA replication (13.Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 14.Stillman B.W. Gluzman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). All the cellular DNA replication factors required to support SV40 DNA synthesis have been identified and purified (for review, see Refs. 15.Brush G.S. Kelly T.J. Stillman B.

The in vitro SV40 DNA replication system has been used by others to investigate the effects of DNA-damaging agents on SV40 DNA replication. Extracts from UV-irradiated cells have a reduced ability to supportin vitro SV40 DNA replication. This defect can be complemented by the addition of purified human replication protein A (RPA) (23.Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that RPA is at least one target of the cellular DNA damage response pathways. However, following treatment of cells by the anti-cancer drug camptothecin or by gamma radiation, a trans-dominant negative factor was found to be present in treated cell extracts (24.Wang Y. Huq M.S. Iliakis G. Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25.Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1654-1659PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of purified RPA to these cell extracts could not rescue in vitro SV40 DNA replication activity (25.Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1654-1659PubMed Google Scholar,26.Wang Y. Zhou X.-Y. Wang H. Huq M.S. Iliakis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22060-22064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The different effects on SV40 DNA replication and the differing nature of the DNA-damaging agents have made it difficult to draw general conclusions about the mechanisms of DNA replication arrest following DNA damage. RPA is a major eukaryotic single-strand DNA-binding protein required for DNA replication, repair, and recombination (for a review, see Ref.27.Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Human RPA is a heterotrimer with subunits of 70, 32, and 14 kDa. The 70-kDa subunit (RPA70) carries the primary single-strand DNA binding domain, whereas the 32-kDa subunit of RPA (RPA32) has been shown to be phosphorylated during the cell cycle and hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA damage or apoptosis (23.Carty M.P.

DNA-dependent protein kinase and ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein have been implicated in RPA phosphorylation upon DNA damage (29.Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23896-23904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of RPA32 induced by camptothecin or gamma radiation can be either completely or partially blocked by the addition of the DNA polymerase inhibitor, aphidicolin. This suggests that replication fork passage through sites of damaged DNA may be required to induce RPA32 hyperphosphorylation (31.Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Wold M.S. Pommier Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The hyperphosphorylation of RPA, and its reduced ability to support SV40 DNA replication in extracts from UV-irradiated cells, suggested a relationship between phosphorylation of RPA and arrest of DNA synthesis upon UV treatment (23.Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, after extensive in vitro studies, a relationship between the hyperphosphorylation of RPA32 and the inhibition of RPA function in SV40 DNA replication has not been shown (37, 41, for a review see Wold (27.Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar)). RPA may also function in DNA damage responses through binding to and inactivation of the p53 protein. Interaction of RPA with p53 inhibits the ability of p53 to bind to its DNA-binding site (42.Miller S.D. Moses K. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2194-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Upon UV irradiation, the RPA-p53 interaction is disrupted (43.Abramova N.A. Russell J. Botchan M. Li R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7186-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and p53 is free to activate downstream transcriptional targets, resulting in cell cycle arrest. This suggests that RPA may be playing roles in both the S phase and the G1 checkpoints. In this study, adozelesin was used as a model agent to investigate the link between DNA damage and DNA replication inhibition at the molecular level. Our previous studies have shown that a trans-acting inhibitor of SV40 DNA replication is induced in cell extracts upon treatment of HeLa cells with bizelesin (11.McHugh M.M. Kuo S.-R. Walsh-O'Beirne M.H. Liu J.-S. Melendy T. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11508-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These results are similar to effects reported for camptothecin treatment and gamma radiation (24.Wang Y. Huq M.S. Iliakis G. Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25.Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1654-1659PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we show that adozelesin-induced DNA replication inhibition occurs through RPA inactivation, similar to results previously reported for UV radiation and hyperthermia (23.Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 44.Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This adozelesin response is clearly different from those induced by bizelesin treatment, camptothecin treatment, or gamma radiation. [α-32P]dATP was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Adozelesin was generously supplied by The Upjohn Co. Adozelesin stock solutions in dimethylacetamide were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide prior to addition to 293 suspension cell cultures. Camptothecin and aphidicolin were obtained from Sigma. Human 293 cells (transformed embryonic kidney cells) were grown as suspension cultures in Joklik-modified minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% (v/v) calf serum. Early passage newborn foreskin primary fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum (45.Dollard S.C. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against human p53 protein (DO-1) and p34-cdc2 were purchased from PharMingen andStressgen Biotech, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies specific to the human RPA 70- and 32-kDa subunits have been described previously (28.Din S. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The SV40 origin-containing plasmid pSV011 has been described previously (46.Prelich G. Stillman B. Cell. 1988; 53: 117-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). SV40 large T antigen was purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected High-FiveTMinsect cells (Invitrogen) using immunoaffinity chromatography (47.Lanford R.E. Virology. 1988; 167: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was purified as described elsewhere (48.Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Human RPA was purified from 293 cells as described elsewhere (49.Brill S.J. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses encoding the five human replication factor C (RFC) subunits were a generous gift from Dr. Ellen Fanning, Vanderbilt University. His-tagged human RFC complex was expressed from recombinant baculoviruses in High FiveTM cells and purified by nickel column chromatography as described (50.Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The intact RFC five subunit complex was further separated from various subcomplexes by sedimentation through a 15–40% (v/v) glycerol gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5 mm Na2EDTA. Adozelesin was added to 293 suspension cell cultures at the indicated concentrations for the lengths of time indicated. Equivalent amounts of dimethylacetamide/dimethyl sulfoxide were added to control cultures. Cells were harvested, and extracts were prepared as described (11.McHugh M.M. Kuo S.-R. Walsh-O'Beirne M.H. Liu J.-S. Melendy T. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11508-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14.Stillman B.W. Gluzman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES-K+ (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmNa2EDTA, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT), the cells were resuspended in 1.4× cell pellet volume of hypotonic buffer for 10 min before being lysed by seven passages through a 25-gauge needle. Cell lysates were left on ice for 30 min before separating the soluble fraction from cell debris by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts were aliquoted, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Conditions used for SV40 cell-free DNA replication were as described (11.McHugh M.M. Kuo S.-R. Walsh-O'Beirne M.H. Liu J.-S. Melendy T. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11508-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14.Stillman B.W. Gluzman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 ng of SV40 origin-containing plasmid pSV011, 500 ng of T antigen, 200 μm each of UTP, CTP, and GTP, 4 mm ATP, and 100 μm each of dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 25 μm dATP, creatine phosphokinase (24 units/ml), 40 mm phosphocreatine, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]dATP were combined in a 10-μl reaction with 40 μg of control- or drug-treated cell extract (or as indicated in the figure legends) at 37 °C for 60 min before the addition of stop solution containing 10 mm Na2EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. Replication products were isolated and separated using 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer. Gels were dried and analyzed using a Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst PhosphorImager. Quantitation of DNA replication activity in each reaction (expressed either as the total number of pixels per lane × 102 or as a percent of the positive control) included both the θ form DNA replication intermediates and the completely replicated plasmids (from Form I through Form II). Cells from control or 100 nmadozelesin-treated 293 suspension cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin for 30 min on ice. The lysates were subjected to centrifugation (9,000 × g) for 10 min, and supernatant from 5 × 107 cells was mixed with 40 μl of anti-RPA32 monoclonal antibody (28.Din S. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar)-conjugated Trisacryl-protein A beads (Pierce) for 1 h. After washing with lysis buffer three times and centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 2 min, the beads were resuspended in sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% (w/v) SDS, and 100 mm DTT), heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and the sample buffer was removed and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The amount of protein as described in each figure was resolved by electrophoresis on 12.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using NovaBlot (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies against p53 or cdc2 as indicated in the legends. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Pierce) was used as secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) and detected using the Supersignal enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) and exposure to x-ray film (Marsh Biomedical Products). Extracts from adozelesin-treated cells were tested for the ability to support SV40 DNA replication in vitro. Human 293 cells cultured in suspension were treated with 0, 5, 20, or 100 nm adozelesin for 2 h. The cell number was identical in all four cultures at the time of harvest. Cell extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and used in cell-free SV40 DNA replication assays with exogenous SV40 origin-containing plasmid template and SV40 large T antigen. As shown in Fig. 1, SV40 DNA replication activity in extracts from adozelesin-treated cells was suppressed as compared with activity in mock-treated cell extracts (Fig. 1, A andB). The maximal level of inhibition (∼85%) was obtained with extracts from cells treated with the highest level of adozelesin used, 100 nm (Fig. 1 A, lanes 12–15). Treatment up to 1 μm adozelesin showed little additional effect (data not shown). Although the plasmid template was not present during adozelesin treatment of the cells, it was possible that the inhibition of SV40 DNA replication could have been due to the presence of residual drug in the prepared cell extracts. Binding of the drug to the DNA template during the in vitro reaction could then result in inhibition of DNA replication. To test this possibility, adozelesin was added to control cell extracts that were then used in in vitro SV40 DNA replication reactions. We calculated the theoretical maximum level of adozelesin likely to be present in the in vitro reactions to be 17 nm. 2This calculation was based on an assumption of complete diffusion of adozelesin into the cells during the 2 h of drug treatment. The maximum level of adozelesin used to treat the cell cultures, 100 nm, was divided by the dilution factor of 2.4, which was due to the dilution of the total harvested cell pellet volume into the volume of lysis buffer used for hypotonic lysate extract preparation. Since a maximum volume of 4 μl of extract was used in each 10-μl DNA replication reaction, this result was further divided by a factor of 2.5, generating the predicted maximum level of adozelesin in the DNA replication reactions at 17 nm.Therefore adozelesin was added to mock-treated 293 cell extracts at 25–100 nm. These mixtures were then used in in vitro SV40 DNA replication reactions. The addition of adozelesin to in vitro DNA replication reactions at up to 50 nm had virtually no effect on DNA replication (Fig.1 C). 3Addition of higher levels of exogenous adozelesin (100 nm) did inhibit in vitro DNA replication slightly. However, this inhibition was substantially less than that seen with the drug-treated cell extracts and would correspond to treatment of cells with well over 0.5 μmadozelesin. This is equivalent to treatment of cells with nearly 300 nmadozelesin. These results clearly indicate that extracts from cells treated with up to 100 nm adozelesin do not produce an appreciable cis-effect on SV40 DNA replication due to adozelesin binding to the plasmid template. Therefore, the inhibition of SV40 DNA replication in vitro appears to occur through a trans-effect, in agreement with results from studies of DNA replication in cell culture (10.Cobuzzi Jr., R.J. Burhans W.C. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19852-19859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Several of the most commonly used molecular markers for DNA damage in human cells were evaluated following adozelesin treatment of cultured cells. The first marker tested was induction of p53 levels. The addition of adozelesin to 100 nm did not alter p53 protein levels in 293 cells (Fig.2 A, lanes 3 and 4). However, human 293 cells are transformed by adenovirus E1A and E1B, which results in very high constitutive levels of transcriptionally inactive p53 protein (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) (51.Froesch B.A. Aime-Sempe C. Leber B. Andrews D. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6469-6475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 52.Grand R.J. Lecane P.S. Owen D. Grant M.L. Roberts S. Levine A.J. Gallimore P.H. Virology. 1995; 210: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore primary cells were used to evaluate this marker. When primary human foreskin fibroblasts were treated with 100 nm adozelesin, p53 levels were substantially induced (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and2). Following DNA damage, increased levels of p53 have been shown to lead to transcriptional activation of the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter and increased levels of p21Waf1/Cip1 (an inhibitor of cyclin kinases that mediates G1 arrest) (for review see Ref. 53.Ball K.L. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). p21Waf1/Cip1 levels are extremely low in 293 cells, likely due to the inactive nature of p53 in this transformed cell type (54.Parry D. Mahony D. Wills K. Lees E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As anticipated from the inactive nature of p53 in 293 cells, no induction of p21Waf1/Cip1 levels was detected in 293 cells following adozelesin treatment (data not shown). Another cellular marker for activation of the DNA damage response pathways, hyperphosphorylation of the 32-kDa subunit of RPA (RPA32), was also evaluated in adozelesin-treated cells. A monoclonal antibody specific to RPA32 was used for detection of RPA32 on immunoblots of adozelesin-treated cells. A population of slower-migrating hyperphosphorylated RPA32 (Pi-RPA32) was seen in both primary fibroblasts and 293 cells treated with 100 nmadozelesin (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 4) but was not seen in mock-treated cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and3). To confirm that the altered migration is due to phosphorylation, the slower migrating form was shown to be completely converted to the faster-migrating, hypophosphorylated form (RPA32) by treatment with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). Quantitative immunoblotting, using both RPA32 and RPA70 monoclonal antibodies, demonstrated that overall RPA protein levels varied by less than 10% between mock- and adozelesin-treated cells (Fig.2 A and data not shown). The RPA-p53 association was also investigated following adozelesin treatment. It has been previously shown that p53 is co-immunoprecipitated with RPA from human cell lysates and that pretreatment of cells with UV light dissociates this RPA-p53 complex (43.Abramova N.A. Russell J. Botchan M. Li R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7186-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against RPA32 was used to immunoprecipitate RPA from mock-treated 293 cell extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The precipitates were then subjected to immunoblotting. As previously published for other cell types, p53 was co-immunoprecipitated with RPA from 293 cell extracts (Fig.2 B, lane 5). When RPA was immunoprecipitated from 100 nm adozelesin-treated 293 cell extracts, the levels of co-immunoprecipitated p53 were dramatically reduced as compared with the control cell extracts (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). As a control, we analyzed whether p34Cdc2, which is known to phosphorylate RPA, was also co-immunoprecipitated with RPA from cell extracts. p34Cdc2 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with RPA at similar levels from both adozelesin- and mock-treated cell extracts (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6). It should be noted that the levels of both p53 and RPA remain similar in mock- and adozelesin-treated 293 cell extracts (Fig. 2 A). Pretreatment of cells with aphidicolin, a DNA polymerase inhibitor, has been shown to prevent the hyperphosphorylation of RPA32 following treatment of cells with the anti-tumor drug, camptothecin (31.Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Wold M.S. Pommier Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1"
https://openalex.org/W2123781391,"We constructed a plasmid vector having a 1.4-kilobase pair insert of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) cDNA in an antisense direction to express antisense mRNA. The construct was then transfected to SM3, a cell line from vascular smooth muscle cells, producing a few stable transfectants. The down-regulation of MLCK expression in the transfectants was confirmed by both Northern and Western blots. The control SM3 showed chemotaxic motility to platelet-derived growth factor-BB, which was supported by lamellipodia. However, the transfectants showed neither chemotaxic motility nor developed lamellipodia, indicating the essential role of MLCK in the motility. The specificity for the targeting was assessed by a few tests including the rescue experiment. Despite this importance of MLCK, platelet-derived growth factor-BB failed to induce MLC20 phosphorylation in not only the transfectants but also in SM3. The mode in which MLCK was involved in the development of membrane ruffling is discussed with special reference to the novel property of MLCK that stimulates the ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin without phosphorylating its light chain (Ye, L.-H., Kishi, H., Nakamura, A., Okagaki, T., Tanaka, T., Oiwa, K., and Kohama, K. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 6666–6671). We constructed a plasmid vector having a 1.4-kilobase pair insert of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) cDNA in an antisense direction to express antisense mRNA. The construct was then transfected to SM3, a cell line from vascular smooth muscle cells, producing a few stable transfectants. The down-regulation of MLCK expression in the transfectants was confirmed by both Northern and Western blots. The control SM3 showed chemotaxic motility to platelet-derived growth factor-BB, which was supported by lamellipodia. However, the transfectants showed neither chemotaxic motility nor developed lamellipodia, indicating the essential role of MLCK in the motility. The specificity for the targeting was assessed by a few tests including the rescue experiment. Despite this importance of MLCK, platelet-derived growth factor-BB failed to induce MLC20 phosphorylation in not only the transfectants but also in SM3. The mode in which MLCK was involved in the development of membrane ruffling is discussed with special reference to the novel property of MLCK that stimulates the ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin without phosphorylating its light chain (Ye, L.-H., Kishi, H., Nakamura, A., Okagaki, T., Tanaka, T., Oiwa, K., and Kohama, K.

A. 96, 6666–6671). vascular smooth muscle cell platelet-derived growth factor myosin light chain kinase minimal essential medium prostaglandin F2α base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline The formation of acute atherosclerotic plaques results largely from a stimulated invasion of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)1 from the tunica media into the tunica intima. Future therapeutics to correct atherogenesis will benefit from the development of procedures to control these regulatory steps. A number of cytokines, such as platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, angiotensin II, bradykinin, thrombin, and catecholamines, appear to play significant roles in the control of VSMC replication (reviewed in Ref. 1.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9971) Google Scholar). It is currently difficult, if not impossible, to simultaneously target the many molecules involved in these complex signal pathways. In contrast to the complexity of upstream signaling, all VSMC types utilize common contractile machinery for driving their cell division and movement, i.e. the actomyosin contractile system. Thus, a protocol to control actomyosin activities would be a powerful tool for controlling VSMC proliferation and migration, regardless of which pathways are activated by growth factors in the VSMCs of atherosclerotic plaques. The actomyosin system functions both in VSMC contraction and at the leading edge of migratory VSMCs. Several proteins are known to regulate actomyosin activities in VSMCs by modulating either the actin or myosin function (reviewed in Ref. 2.Marston S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is one such regulatory protein. Upon the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin, MLCK phosphorylates a myosin subunit, known as the 20-kDa regulatory light chain (MLC20). In all smooth muscle cells, including VSMCs, the phosphorylation of MLC20 by MLCK serves to trigger myosin interaction with actin (reviewed in Ref. 3.Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although most MLCK studies have focused on its regulatory roles in smooth muscle contraction, MLCK also functions in the regulation of cell migration (4.Wilson A.K. Gorgas G. Claypool W.D. de Lanerolle P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5.de Lanerolle P. Gorgas G. Li X. Schluns K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16883-16886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, upon activation by PDGF-BB, VSMCs become highly motile and develop membrane ruffling (6.Mellstroom K.

MLCK is composed of several functional domains: actin-binding domain at the N terminus (11.Guerriero Jr., V. Rowley D.R. Means A.R.

Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G. Nanaev A.K. Collinge M. Lukas T.J. Sellers J.R. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16578-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the regulatory role of the kinase domain, we recently found that actin- and myosin-binding domains regulate the actin-myosin interaction; the former inhibits the interaction (18.Ye L.-H. Hayakawa K. Kishi H. Imamura M. Nakamura A. Okagaki T. Takagi T. Iwata A. Tanaka T. Kohama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32182-32189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the latter activates the interaction (20.Ye L.-H. Kishi H. Nakamura A. Okagaki T. Tanaka T. Oiwa K. Kohama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6666-6671Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). How are these regulatory modes of MLCK involved in the actual motility of VSMCs? As the first step to approach this question, we are interested in down-regulating MLCK in VSMCs. In the present study, we inhibited the expression of MLCK in SM3 cells, a cell line established from rabbit VSMC (21.Sasaki Y. Uchida T. Sasaki Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), by overexpressing the antisense RNA of MLCK in SM3. The data indicate that the down-regulation of MLCK gives rise to significant loss of both lamellipodia formation and cell migration of SM3 when stimulated by PDGF-BB. These results suggest that MLCK is involved in inducing lamellipodia to induce VSMC migration. Inhibition of MLCK may be a useful future approach to regulate VSMC migration in vivo. SM3 is a multipassagable smooth muscle cell line established from rabbit aorta smooth muscle (21.Sasaki Y. Uchida T. Sasaki Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SM3 cells remain in a proliferative form in the presence of fetal bovine serum (21.Sasaki Y. Uchida T. Sasaki Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), while they differentiate into a contractile form upon removal of fetal bovine serum. Throughout the present study, SM3 cells were maintained in the proliferative form in minimum essential medium (MEM; Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. PDGF-BB of human recombinant as expressed inEscherichia coli, prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), G418, and Y-27632 was obtained from Sigma, Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), Life Technologies, Inc., and Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Saitama, Japan), respectively. They were dissolved according to the manufacturers' instructions and mixed with MEM in the specified concentrations and used for the experiments. All other reagents were of reagent grade. Poly(A)+ RNA of SM3 was purified using the QuickPrep® Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The first strand cDNA was synthesized with the First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using RU3229 of 5′-CATTGCCCGTTTTCTGCCATTTTC-3′, a specific primer for rabbit smooth muscle MLCK. After RNaseH (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan) treatment, the 1366-bp cDNA fragment encoding a coding region of MLCK mRNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using RU1666 (5′-AAAAGAAACCTGCCCCCAAGACTC-3′) as the upper primer and RU 3008 (5′-GTGGCTGAGGTAACATTGGCTAAG-3′) as the lower primer. The primers RU3229, RU1666, and RU3008 were designed on the basis of the sequence of MLCK cDNA derived from rabbit uterine smooth muscle reported by Gallagher et al. (22.Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Griffin S.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to prime bp 3229–3252, bp 1666–1689, and bp 3008–3031 of rabbit smooth muscle MLCK. The 1366-bp MLCK cDNA corresponded to bp 1666–3031 of rabbit smooth muscle MLCK (Fig. 1) and was inserted into pGEM-T® vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and named pGEM-T/SM3-MLCK-PCR product. The NcoI–SpeI fragment encoding the 1366-bp MLCK cDNA was isolated from pGEM-T/SM3-MLCK-PCR product and ligated to theNcoI–SpeI site of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), whose SmaI site was changed to NcoI. We named the resulting plasmid vector pBst/SM3-FL. TheXbaI–PstI fragment containing MLCK cDNA was isolated from the pBst/SM3-FL and ligated with an antisense orientation into an expression vector pCXLp− (23.Mikawa T. Borisov A. Brown A.M.C. Fischman D.A. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). pCXLp− has the long terminal repeat sequence of spleen necrosis virus, a member of the avian retrovirus family as a promoter. The downstream sequence of the multicloning site encodes bacterial β-galactosidase so that the transformants are able to screen by X-gal staining. The resulting vector was designated pCXαK. The sequence of the insert in pCXαK was confirmed by an Applied Biosystems model 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 5 μg of pCXαK and 0.4 μg of pGEM4SVneo were cotransfected into 1 × 105cells of SM3 using the calcium phosphate method (24.Graham F.L. Van Der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were trypsinized and plated on 100-mm dishes with dilution to form colonies and cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum-MEM containing 500 μg/ml G418. The resulting colonies were isolated using cloning cylinders and transferred to 24-well plates. A subpopulation of each clone was subjected to X-gal staining as described elsewhere (23.Mikawa T. Borisov A. Brown A.M.C. Fischman D.A. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). LacZ-positive clones were selected and processed for subcloning on 100-mm dishes. After four subclonings, three clones consisting of 100% LacZ-positive cells were obtained and named A3, A8, and C1. The total RNA was isolated from rabbit aorta, SM3, A3, A8, and C1 cells using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (25.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). The poly(A)+ RNA was purified using OligotexTM-dT30Super (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). The RNA samples were loaded on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, electrophoresed at 60 V for 3 h, and blotted onto positively charged nitrocellulose membrane (GeneScreen Plus®; NEN Life Science Products) via an upward capillary transfer. The blots were hybridized with a 32P-labeled, random primed cDNA probe corresponding to bp 3054–3252 of rabbit smooth muscle MLCK, in order to detect only the sense mRNA of MLCK. The probe for β-actin was a 32P-labeled, random-primed cDNA probe of full-length chicken β-actin, the template for which was excised from SP64β-actin constructed by Mikawa's laboratory. The conditions for the hybridization were as follows: 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 50% deionized formamide, 2× sodium citrate/sodium chloride (SSC), 5× Denhart's solution, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C. The final washing was carried out in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. The nitrocellulose membrane thus treated was exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. SM3, A3, A8, and C1 cells were washed with ice-cold saline and fixed with 10% trichroloacetic acid for 15 min on ice, followed by scraping with a rubber policeman and centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The precipitate was suspended in 100 μl of SDS-sample buffer consisting of 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 7.5% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 1.4 m2-mercaptoethanol and was sonicated briefly. An aliquot of 2m Tris was added to adjust the pH to 6.8. The sample was boiled for 5 min and stored at −80 °C until electrophoresis. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with 8% acrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ImmobilionTM PVDF Transfer Membrane; Millipore, Corp., Bedford, MA) at 40 V for 3 h in the presence of 10 mmCAPS at pH 11.0 and 10% methanol. 5 μg of protein isolated from SM3, A3, A8, and C1 cells as described above was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell), dried, treated with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline), and washed twice in PBST briefly for 5 min. The membranes were subjected to electrical transfer or dot blots and then reacted with a polyclonal antibody raised against chicken gizzard MLCK (26.Ito M. Guerriero Jr., V. Chen X.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3498-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27.Akasu T. Ito M. Nakano T. Schneider C.R. Simmons M.A. Tanaka T. Tokimasa T. Yoshida M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1133-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature. After a wash in PBST, the blots were reacted with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated by horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following the wash in PBST, the immunoreactive proteins were visualized on x-ray film with an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (ECL Western blotting detection system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We subjected the 152-kDa major band to densitometry (see below) by excluding fuzzy staining. A cell migratory assay was performed using the modified Boyden chamber method (28.Falk W. Goodwin Jr., R.H. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We used a 96-well microplate chamber with 3.2-mm diameter wells containing polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores (Neuroprobe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The cells were trypsinized and suspended in MEM. 2 × 103cells suspended in 100 μl of MEM were applied per well in the upper chamber. In the lower chamber, 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB were dissolved in MEM and applied in a volume of 0.4 ml/well. The cells were then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. After the unmigrated cells in the upper chamber were removed, the migrated cells were subjected to Giemsa staining and counted with a microscope in five fields at × 400. The migratory activity was tested with six wells for the respective cell lines. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and plated on a glass coverslip at a density of 1 × 105 cells in a 60-mm dish and cultured overnight. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated in MEM with and without 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB so that they produced lamellipodia. The cells were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. After two washes with PBS for 10 min each, the cells were stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) that was dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 0.2 unit/ml and diluted to 1:100 in PBS. After the excess phalloidin was removed by washing with PBS for 10 min three times, the cells on the coverslips were mounted with PermaFluor (Immunon, Pittsburgh, PA) and observed with a fluorescence microscope. We considered cells that developed a broad accumulation of F-actin on the cell edge (more than 5 μm in width and 30% in the length of the whole periphery of the cell) as lamellipodia-positive. The number of scored cells was about 130 on average in the 10 fields. The XbaI–PstI fragment containing MLCK cDNA was isolated from the pBst/SM3-FL (see “Plasmid Construction”) and ligated with a sense orientation into an expression vector, pME18S, which has SRα promoter (29.Itoh U. Yonehara S. Schreures J. Gorman D.M. Maruyama K. Ishii A. Gahao I. Arai K. Mitajima A. Science. 1990; 247: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We named the resulting vector MLCKpME18S. The sequence of the insert in MLCKpME18S was confirmed by an Applied Biosystems model 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For DNA transfection, A3, A8, and C1 cells were plated on 120-mm coverslips on the day before the transfection. They were co-transfected by 1 μg of MLCKpME18S and 1 μg of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) using FuGENE-6 Transfection (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 6 μl of FuGENE-6 was mixed with 94 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was added slowly to the rescue mixture of MLCKpME18S plus pEGFP-C1 (a total of 2 μg of DNA in 2 μl) or the control mixture of pME18S plus pEGFP-C1 (a total of 2 μg of DNA in 2 μl). After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the FuGENE-6/DNA mixture was added to the cells. Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h and subjected to the staining of lamellipodia described as above. We performed a MLC20 phosphorylation assay using glycerol-PAGE and Western blot essentially as described elsewhere (30.Sakurada K. Seto M. Sasaki Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1563-C1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured on a 100-mm dish were stimulated with 30 μm of PGF2α for 5 min or 10 ng/ml of PDGF-BB for 10 min, and those reactions were terminated by adding 5% trichroloacetic acid at the final concentration, followed by scraping with a rubber policeman. The trichroloacetic acid-fixed cell was washed with acetone containing 10 mm dithiothreitol to remove trichroloacetic acid and dried. The dried cell pellet was mixed with a urea sample buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris base, 22 mm glycine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 8m deionized urea, and 0.1% bromphenol blue and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane filter (Millipore) and subjected to glycerol-PAGE. The phosphorylated and unphosphorylated MLC20 were detected by Western blots (see above) with antibodies against whole MLC20 (21.Sasaki Y. Uchida T. Sasaki Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), Ser19-monophosphorylated MLC20, and Thr18/Ser19-diphosphorylated MLC20, named anti-MLC20, anti-MLC-P, and anti-MLC-2P (31.Seto M. Sakurada K. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Sasaki Y. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 432: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 1 μg of poly(A)+RNA of SM3 and the stable transfectants were subjected to reverse transcription-PCR using bPDGFR-F1 (5′-AGGAGGCCCATCTACATCAT-3′) as upper primer and bPDGFR-R (5′-CCTTCATGCCAGCCATGGGCC-3′) as first strand cDNA and lower primer. These primers were designed from the sequence of rabbit PDGF-BB receptor partial cDNA reported by Inoueet al. (GenBankTM accession number ABO20215). The Western and Northern blots were quantitated by densitometry using macros for the NIH Image program (version 1.55; W. Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Student's t test was used to determine the significance of differences between the means, andp < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The levels of MLCK transcripts in SM3 cells and stable transfectants carrying pCXαK (i.e. A3, A8, and C1) were examined by Northern blot analysis, using the 3′-flanking region of MLCK cDNA as a probe. A single band of 5.8-kilobase RNA, the expected size of MLCK mRNA, was detected in the control SM3 cells (Fig. 2). The 5.8-kilobase RNA was also detected in 20 μg of rabbit aorta total RNA, confirming our result with the SM3 cells (data not shown). The signal from the 5.8-kilobase RNA was significantly lower in A3, A8, and C1 (Fig. 2); the signals from A3, A8, and C1 are only 15.3, 3.1, and 0.5%, respectively, of the signal from SM3. The blots were rehybridized with β-actin probe to normalize the data (Fig. 2). The total protein extracts from the SM3 cells and the stable transfectants were subjected to dot blot and Western blot analyses with a polyclonal MLCK antibody to analyze MLCK protein accumulated in these cell lines. Dot blot analysis detected a higher level of MLCK in SM3 cell extract than in extracts from transfectants (Fig.3 B). The result was further confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 A). The MLCK protein was detected as a 152-kDa band in the SM3 cells (Fig.3 A). The same size protein band was also detected in the total protein extracts from rabbit aorta (data not shown). The signal of the 152-kDa band was dramatically suppressed in the transfectants; the signals from A3, A8, and C1 are only 19.4, 2.9, and 12.4% of the signal from SM3 (Fig. 3 A). These results indicate that A3, A8, and C1 cell lines down-regulate the level of MLCK transcript and protein. The effect of the down-regulated MLCK on VSMC was examined by monitoring lamellipodia formation as a prerequisite for cell migratory activity (Fig.4). Lamellipodia formation was induced by exposing cells to PDGF-BB. Staining with rhodamine-phalloidin revealed that the control SM3 cells were induced to initiate lamellipodia within 10 min after exposure to PDGF-BB (Fig. 4, A–C). In striking contrast, activated lamellipodia was not evident in the stable transfectants of C1, even after prolonged exposure to PDGF-BB (Fig. 4,D–F). A3 and A8 also failed to develop lamellipodia (not shown). This observation was further confirmed by quantitative analysis. Without PDGF-BB added, only 6.1 ± 10.6% of the control SM3 cells were scored as lamellipodia-positive. Upon PDGF-BB stimulation, 26.5 ± 13.6% of the SM3 cells became lamellipodia-positive within 10 min after stimulation with PDGF-BB. At 30 min after stimulation, 21.4 ± 11.4% of cells were still detected as lamellipodia-positive (Fig.5). This activated lamellipodia was not evident when stable transfectants were exposed to PDGF-BB (Fig. 5). For example, without PDGF-BB activation, 2.97 ± 6.26% of C1 cells were scored as lamellipodia-positive (Fig. 5). The lamellipodia-positive population was increased only to 8.72 ± 8.27% at 10 min and to 5.77 ± 8.33% at 30 min after exposure to PDGF-BB, respectively. Similar results were obtained in A3 and A8 cell lines (Fig. 5).Figure 5Quantitative analysis of lamellipodia induced by PDGF-BB. We counted the cells with a fluorescent microscope to quantitatively analyze the lamellipodia induced by PDGF-BB. The percentage of the cells furnished with lamellipodia to the total cells was calculated in each field. Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. [star], p < 0.01 versus0 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We must look more carefully into the basal level of lamellipodia in SM3. We obtained three clones by subjecting SM3 to repeated subcloning as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Their levels of lamellipodia-positive cells were 6.1 ± 6.8, 16.6 ± 10.8, and 8.7 ± 1.0%. This intrinsic clonal variation indicates that the lamellipodia-positive population in A3, A8, and C1 is not altered by PDGF-BB. Therefore, we concluded that the down-regulation of MLCK causes poor responsiveness to PDGF-BB in inducing lamellipodia. To see whether or not the failure in inducing lamellipodia in the transfectants is solely attributable to the targeting of the endogenous mRNA by antisense mRNA produced in parent SM3, we transfected MLCKpME18S (see “Experimental Procedures”) to A3, A8, and C1 cells so that the plasmid neutralizes the antisense RNA by overexpressing mRNA in a sense direction. As a control, we transfected the empty vector of pME18S to the cells. The cells carrying these plasmids were marked by the fluorescence due to the co-transfected pEGFP-C1. We observed that the level of lamellipodia-positive cells in A8 was increased from 6.5 ± 1.2 to 32.8 ± 1.4% upon stimulation by PDGF-BB. The increase was not observed with the cells with the control vector, i.e. from 6.6 ± 0.72 to 6.7 ± 0.94%. Similar results were obtained with A3 cells (from 9.5 ± 0.8 to 25.0 ± 3.1%) and C1 cells (from 8.3 ± 1.3 to 24.8 ± 0.7%). We cultured cells in a modified Boyden chamber to more directly investigate the cell migratory activities of stable transfectants (29.Itoh U. Yonehara S. Schreures J. Gorman D.M. Maruyama K. Ishii A. Gahao I. Arai K. Mitajima A. Science. 1990; 247: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The control SM3 cells were stimulated by PDGF-BB at various concentrations, such as 0, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml, and the cells migrated through the membrane pores were scored. Since activated migration was detectable above 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB (data not shown), all quantitative analyses were conducted using 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Within 4 h, 108.3 ± 61.1 cells (mean ± S.D., n = 6 wells) out of 2 × 103 SM3 cells plated had migrated from the upper chamber to the lower chamber, while only 5.7 ± 10.5 A3 cells, 4.3 ± 2.2 A8 cells, and 2.5 ± 4.3 C1 cells were detected as migratory (Fig.6). These results indicate that cell migration activity of the A3, A8, and C1 lines was significantly lower than the control SM3 cells. To assess the specificity of our antisense approach, we addressed two questions: (i) whether myosin phosphorylation at MLC20 is inhibited by the down-regulation of MLCK and (ii) whether the inhibition involves the phosphorylation of Ser19 and Thr18 of MLC20, which play key roles in the activation of myosin. As shown in Fig.7, we subjected control SM3 and transfected cells to Western blot analysis for MLC20 phosphorylation. The basal phosphorylation as expressed by (MLC-P + MLC-2P)/total MLC20 of SM3 in the absence of PGF2α was 30.5% (Fig. 7 A,lane a). PGF2α enhanced the extent of phosphorylation to 83.4%. These values are consistent with previous reports (21.Sasaki Y. Uchida T. Sasaki Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31.Seto M. Sakurada K.

Similar results were obtained with the transfected cells, where MLCK expression was down-regulated (Figs. 2 and 3); PGF2α stimulated phosphorylation levels in A3, A8, and"

These “sliding clamps” have sufficiently large linear diameters to encircle duplex DNA and are perhaps even large enough to slide over certain DNA secondary structural elements. This report examines the Escherichia coli β and human proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamps for their ability to slide over various DNA secondary structures. The results show that these clamps are capable of traversing a 13-nucleotide ssDNA loop, a 4-base pair stem-loop, a 4-nucleotide 5′ tail, and a 15-mer bubble within the duplex. However, upon increasing the size of these structures (20-nucleotide loop, 12-base pair stem-loop, 28-nucleotide 5′ tail, and 20-nucleotide bubble) the sliding motion of the β and proliferating cell nuclear antigen over these elements is halted. Studies of the E. coli replicase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, in chain elongation with the β clamp demonstrate that upon encounter with an oligonucleotide annealed in its path, it traverses the duplex and resumes synthesis on the 3′ terminus of the oligonucleotide. This sliding and resumption of synthesis occurs even when the oligonucleotide contains a secondary structure element, provided the β clamp can traverse the structure. However, upon encounter with a downstream oligonucleotide containing a large internal secondary structure, the holoenzyme clears the obstacle by strand displacing the oligonucleotide from the template.

DNA polymerase III base pair(s) DNA polymerase δ proliferating cell nuclear antigen replication factor C single-stranded DNA bovine serum albumin dithiothreitol kilobase(s) The Escherichia coli chromosomal replicase, DNA polymerase III (Pol III)1holoenzyme, is rapid and processive, in keeping with the need to replicate a 4 million-bp chromosome within 30 min (1.Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 169-182Google Scholar). This enzyme is a multisubunit complex made up of three subcomplexes: the catalytic Pol III core, the β sliding clamp, and the γ complex clamp loader (2.Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The catalytic core, comprised of α (polymerase), ε (3′-5′ exonuclease), and θ subunits (3.Scheuermann R.H. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7747-7751Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 4.Maki H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.McHenry C.S. Crow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1748-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incorporates nucleotides into a growing nascent chain and proofreads the replicated sequence. Pol III core by itself is not processive; it extends a primed site by only 10–15 nucleotides each binding event (6.Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High processivity by the holoenzyme is achieved through the use of accessory proteins, the β sliding clamp, and the γ complex. The β sliding clamp is composed of two identical protomers, each having three globular domains forming a six-domain closed ring that encircles DNA (7.Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). This topological linkage of β to DNA, rather than direct chemical contact, underlies the ability of β to bind DNA tightly yet freely slide bidirectionally along a duplex (8.Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β subunit also binds the catalytic Pol III core through specific protein-protein interactions (8.Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.LaDuca R.J. Crute J.J. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7550-7557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). By simultaneously encircling DNA and binding to Pol III core, β tethers the polymerase to the template during elongation, thereby constraining it to act in a highly processive fashion (8.Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β clamp does not assemble onto DNA by itself. For this, it requires the γ complex, which acts as a clamp loader. This clamp loader is a multisubunit complex (five different subunits: γ, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ) that acts upon a primed template to assemble the β ring around the duplex in an ATP hydrolysis-driven reaction (11.Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6547-6554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12.O'Donnell M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16558-16565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the replication fork, the leading strand is synthesized continuously, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in segments called Okazaki fragments. Semidiscontinuous DNA replication is rooted in the fact that the two strands of the duplex are antiparallel; yet DNA polymerases can only extend DNA in one direction. On the leading strand, a highly processive enzyme is beneficial for the continuous mode of DNA synthesis. However, on the discontinuous lagging strand, the polymerase must rapidly recycle from the end of one Okazaki fragment to a new upstream primed site synthesized by primase. Okazaki fragments are synthesized about once every second or two. How can a polymerase that is tightly held to DNA by a ring rapidly hop from one fragment to the next? This has been addressed in previous studies. Upon completing an Okazaki fragment, the polymerase rapidly departs from the β ring, leaving it behind on the completed lagging strand fragment (12.O'Donnell M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16558-16565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The polymerase is then free to reassociate with a β clamp that has been assembled onto a new primed site by γ complex. The strategy of coupling a DNA polymerase to DNA with a clamp and ATP-driven clamp loader generalizes to eukaryotes (14.Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 15.Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 16.Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). For example, the human DNA polymerase δ replicase (Pol δ) relies on a ring shaped clamp and a clamp loader for processive synthesis (16.Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17.O'Donnell M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 12: 545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The human clamp, referred to as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), is a ring-shaped protein with dimensions similar to E. coli β (18.Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The PCNA ring, however, is formed from three identical subunits each having only two globular domains which trimerize to form a six-domain ring. PCNA is assembled onto the primed template by the ATPase action of the human clamp loader, replication factor C (RF-C) (19.Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Lee S.H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5672-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Like E. coli γ complex, RF-C is a five subunit complex, and after it assembles the PCNA ring around a primed template, Pol δ binds the clamp for processivity in DNA synthesis (19.Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Lee S.H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7361-7365Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Pol δ is thought to act on the lagging strand in similar fashion to the E. coli system, hopping among PCNA clamps and leaving the used clamps behind on the DNA where they may interact with other proteins (24.Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Dean F. Shechter D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recently, several proteins involved in replication, repair, and cell cycle control have been reported to interact with PCNA (reviewed in Ref. 25.Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 236-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For example, FEN-1, a nuclease responsible for removing ssDNA 5′ tails during Okazaki fragment maturation (26.Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and PCNA-dependent base excision repair (27.Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), binds PCNA leading to a stimulation of the nuclease activity (28.Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). PCNA is also thought to interact with human homologues of E. coli MutS and MutL (hMSH-2 and hMLH1, respectively; (29.Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar)). hMSH2 specifically binds single base pair mismatches as well as short loops of 4–16 nucleotides (30.Fishel R. Ewel A. Lee S. Lescoe M.K. Griffith J. Science. 1994; 266: 1403-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 31.Palombo F. Iaccarino I. Nakajima E. Ikejima M. Shimada T. Jiricny J. Curr.

Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). This report examines the dynamics of β and PCNA upon encountering a variety of DNA structures. Earlier studies have shown that β and PCNA slide freely over duplex DNA, consistent with their large inner diameters; β measures approximately 35 Å (not including extended side chains) (7.Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), and the inner diameter of the PCNA ring measures approximately 34 Å (36.Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). These dimensions are sufficiently large to accommodate B-form duplex DNA (diameter, ∼18 Å) and the A-form RNA-DNA heteroduplex (diameter, ∼21 Å). Given the relatively large inner diameters of β and PCNA, they may be capable of sliding across some types of DNA secondary structures, although one may expect their sliding dynamics to be halted by secondary structures of a certain size. This report examines DNA secondary structures to define those that β and PCNA can traverse, and those that block their sliding motion. The results obtained demonstrate that both β and PCNA slide over rather bulky DNA structures such as bubbles (long stretches of continuous mismatched bases), 5′ tailed flaps, loops, and stem-loops, but the sliding motion is finally blocked by each of these elements when they reach a sufficiently large size. The study also examines the consequences on DNA polymerization when the E. coli Pol III holoenzyme encounters these DNA structures. Previous studies have demonstrated that Pol III holoenzyme, upon encountering a short flush duplex in its path, simply slides over the duplex and restarts synthesis at the new 3′ end (37.O'Donnell M.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12875-12883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We find here that upon encounter with a DNA structure that β is incapable of traversing, Pol III holoenzyme does not stop but instead strand displaces the oligonucleotide containing the obstacle.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were purified according to previous protocols. βPK, PCNAPK, and EBNA1PK were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using cAMP-dependent protein kinase to specific activities of approximately 100 cpm/fmol as described (46.Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SSB was purified from induced BL21(DE3) cells (400 g of wet weight) harboring pET SSB following disruption in the French press in buffer D (1500 ml). The clarified lysate (1200 ml) was treated with 0.24 g/ml ammonium sulfate, and the pellet was repeatedly resuspended and pelleted in 100 ml of buffer E containing 0.15 g/ml ammonium sulfate (6 times) and then using 100 ml of buffer E containing 0.13 g/ml ammonium sulfate (2 times). The pellet was resuspended in buffer F containing 0.2m NaCl, dialyzed against the same buffer, and then applied to a 200 ml of heparin-agarose column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in buffer F plus 150 mm NaCl. The SSB was eluted with a 1.5-liter linear gradient of buffer F from 150 to 500 mm NaCl, and 80 fractions were collected. Fractions 46–60 were pooled (197 mg in 38 ml), dialyzed against buffer E containing 0.2 m NaCl, diluted to a conductivity equal to 160 mm NaCl, and applied to a 20-ml Mono Q column. SSB was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of buffer E from 150 to 500 mm NaCl, and 80 fractions were collected. Fractions 45–64, containing homogeneous SSB, were pooled (140 mg in 40 ml), aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. Buffer A is 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl and 30 mm sodium citrate. Buffer B is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 8 mmMgCl2. Buffer C is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 mm MgCl2, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml BSA, 2 mm DTT, and 50 mm NaCl. BamHI storage buffer is 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 200 μg/ml BSA, and 50% glycerol. Buffer D is 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1m NaCl, 30 mm spermidine, and 10% sucrose. Buffer E is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mmDTT, and 10% glycerol. Buffer F is 20 mm Hepes (pH 6.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol.HincII storage buffer is 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 200 μg/ml BSA, and 50% glycerol. XbaI storage buffer is 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 200 μg/ml BSA, and 50% glycerol. A single 18-bp EBNA1-binding site sequence was inserted into an M13mp18 vector (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The upstream primer 5′-TACGAATTC GGGAAGCATATGCTACCCTCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAG-3′ has an EcoRI site (underlined) that is also present in the M13mp18 vector as well as a unique NdeI site (bold and underlined) located within the single EBNA1-binding site sequence (shown in bold). The downstream primer 5′-ATTTTTGAGAGATCTACAAAGGCTATCAG-3′ is complementary to the M13mp18 template sequence and hybridizes over a BglII site (underlined). Polymerase chain reaction conditions were 72 °C for 1.5 min, 94 °C for 1 min, and 60 °C for 40 s for 40 cycles. The resulting 718-bp DNA fragment was purified using a polymerase chain reaction Wizard Prep column (Promega) and then digested with 200 units of EcoRI and BglII. The final 704-bp insert was isolated through agarose gel electrophoresis followed by butanol extraction and then ligated into an M13mp18 vector that had been previously cut with EcoRI and BglII and gel purified. The construct (M13EBNA1) was transformed intoE. coli XL-1 Blue competent cells. Phage containing single-stranded circular M13EBNA1 DNA was purified using two cesium chloride gradients as described (47.Turner J. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The presence of the EBNA1-binding sequence in the recombinant construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The number of nucleotides in the M13EBNA1 genome is identical to that of M13mp18 because the same number of nucleotides were deleted as were inserted. Thus, the map position numbers of M13EBNA1 are the same as those of M13mp18. All of the oligonucleotides used in these constructs were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides (250 pmol) were mixed with circular M13EBNA1 ssDNA (12.5 pmol) in 20 μl of buffer A in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The tube was placed in a 13 × 100-mm test tube containing nearly boiling water then allowed to cool to room temperature (∼22 °C). Templates containing two oligonucleotides were formed by the same procedure, except that both oligonucleotides (250 pmol each) were present in the reaction. Two DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized such that they form either 15- or 20-nucleotide bubbles (i.e. continuous mismatches; shown in boldface in Table I) flanked by duplex upon hybridization to M13EBNA1 ssDNA. The bubble is flanked by 19–20 base pairs at the 3′ end and 59–62 bp at the 5′ end. Near the 5′ end is a HincII site for linearization of the circular primed templates (Table I, underlined).Table IOligonucleotides used in the study of β and PCNA sliding over DNA containing secondary structureNameMap position (5′ end)Restriction siteSequence (5′ to 3′)Bubble-156277HincIIGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAGGGTAGCATATGCTTCCCGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTGTTATCCGCTCACABubble-206274HincIITGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAGGGTAGCATATCCTTCCCGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATACGAC AAAGGACACACTTTAAGTTATCCGCTCACAATTCCA5′ Flap-4 nucleotide6191ScrFITTTTTCCGCTCACAATTCCACACAACATACGATCCGGAAGCATAAAGTGTAAAGCCTGGGGTG CCTGATGAGTGA5′ Flap-10 nucleotide6191ScrFITTTTTTTTTTTCCGCTCACAATTCCACACAACATACGAGCCGGAAGCATAAAGTGTAAAGCCT GGGGTGCCTAATGAGTGA5′ Flap-28 nucleotide6191ScrFITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCGCTCCCAATTCCACACAACATACGAGCCGGAA GCATAATGTGTAAAGCCTGGGGTGCCTAATGAGTGAAdjacent to flap6722HincIIGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAGGGTAGCATATGCTTCCCGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAG CTGTTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTALoop-13 nucleotide6722XbaIGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAGGGTAGCATATGCTTCCCGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAG CTGAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTALoop-20 nucleotide6722XbaIGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAGGGTAGCAT?TGCTTCCCGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAG CTGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTALoop-25 nucleotide6722XbaIGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAGGGTAGCATATGCTTCCCGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAG CTGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTAStem-loop-4 bp6722XbaIGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAGGGTAGCATATGCTTCCCGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAG CTGGGGTTTTTCCCCTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTAStem-loop-8 bp6719XbaITGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAGGGTAGCATATGCTTCCCGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAAAGG CCTTTTTTTAAGGCCTTGCTGTTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTAStem-loop-12 bp6719XbaITGCAGGTCGACCTCTAGAGGAGGGTAGCATATGCTTCCCGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGGA AGGCCTTGGTTTTTCCAAGGCCTTCCGCTGTTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTAThe name of each oligonucleotide indicates the type and length of secondary structure formed.

Open table in a new tab The name of each oligonucleotide indicates the type and length of secondary structure formed. The secondary structure forming sequence is shown in bold, and the restriction enzyme site is underlined. The map position of the 5′ nucleotide on the M13EBNA1 ssDNA is noted. The 5′ flap templates contain two oligonucleotides. The first has a 5′ tail comprised of either 4, 10, or 28 T residues (Table I, shown in boldface) followed by a length of 72 nucleotides complementary to M13EBNA1 ssDNA. The second “adjacent-to-flap” oligonucleotide is a 30-mer of which, when annealed to the template, the 3′ end abuts the 5′ tail of the 5′ flap oligonucleotide. This second oligonucleotide also contains an EBNA1 site (Table I, shown in underlined boldface) and a HincII site (Table I, shown underlined). To verify that each template contained both oligonucleotides, the DNA was digested with eitherHincII (which cleaves only the adjacent-to-flap oligonucleotide) or ScrFI (which cleaves only the 5′ flap primers). Separation of products on an agarose gel revealed that all the DNA was linearized in both digests. The loop oligonucleotides contained a 13, 20, or 25 dA residue insert in a sequence complementary to M13EBNA1 ssDNA (Table I, shown in boldface). Hybridization to M13EBNA1 ssDNA results in formation of a single-stranded loop flanked by 66 bp on the 5′ side and 20 bp on the 3′ side. Linearization of the circular primed template on the 5′ side of the loop can be achieved by cleavage withXbaI (Table I, shown underlined). The three stem-loop oligonucleotides contain two inverted sequences separated by 5 T residues that form a stem-loop with a stem of 4–12 bp and a loop of 5 nucleotides. Upon hybridization to M13EBNA1 ssDNA, the stem-loop is flanked by 60–69 bp on the 5′ side and 19–24 bp on the 3′ side. An XbaI site on the 5′ side of the stem-loop allows linearization of the circular primed template. Reactions were performed in Buffer B in a volume of 100 μl. The exact amounts of clamp, clamp loader, and primed template used in each experiment are given in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before treatment with hexokinase (0.25 unit) and 300 nmol of glucose to remove ATP, which prevents further clamp loading events. DNA-bound protein was then separated from unbound protein on 5-ml Bio-Gel A15m gel filtration columns equilibrated in Buffer C at 4 °C. Fractions (180 μl) were collected, and aliquots (150 μl) were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Moles of protein bound to DNA were calculated from the area under the peak in the excluded fractions (five peak fractions, typically 12–16) using the known specific activity of the protein. Values were normalized for the total volume of each fraction. Three types of oligonucleotides were synthesized for this experiment (refer to Table II for exact sequences). Oligonucleotide 1 is a 31-mer that anneals to the M13EBNA1 template (map positions 6160–6190). Oligonucleotide 2 is designed to form a specific secondary DNA structure such as a 5′ flap, stem-loop, loop, or bubble. Each secondary structure is flanked by 15 bp on the 5′ side (except for the flap structure, which consists of a 5′ floppy tail) and 16–30 base pairs on the 3′ side. Oligonucleotide 2 anneals approximately 2.5 kb downstream of oligonucleotide 1; oligonucleotide 3 is a short 15-mer that anneals to M13EBNA1 ssDNA approximately 1 kb downstream of oligonucleotide 2. This oligonucleotide contains aClaI site that allows linearization of the multiply primed template.Table IIOligonucleotides used in replication of multiprimed linear templates by Pol III holoenzymeNameMap position (5′ end)Sequence (5′ to 3′)Primer 16190CCGCTCACAATTCCACACAACATACGAGCCGNo 2 structure 23628AAACAACATGTTCAGCTAATGCAGAACGCGFlap 2–4 nucleotide3628TTTTAAACAACATGTTCAGCTAATGCAGAACGCGFlap 2–30 nucleotide3628TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAACAACATGTTCAGCTAATGCAGAACGCGHairpin 2–4 bp3631AATAAACAACATGTTGGGGTTTTTCCCCCAGCTAATCAGAACGCGCHairpin 2–12 bp3631AATAAACAACATGTTGGAAGGCCTTGGTTTTTCCAAGGCCTTCCCAGCTAATGCAGAACGCGCLoop 2–5 nucleotide3631AATAAACAACATGTTTTTTTCAGCTAATGCAGAACGCGCLoop 2–30 nucleotide3631AATAAACAACATGTTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAGCTAATGCAGAACGCGBubble 2–6 nucleotide3634GACAATAAACAACATCAAGTCCTAATGCAGAACGCGCBubble 2–20 nucleotide3649TTCTGTCCAGACGACCTGTTATTTGTTGTACAAGTGCTAATGCAGAACGCGCLinearization 32539GAAACCATCGATAGCThe primer used to linearize M13EBNA1 ssDNA is called “Linearization 3,” and the upstream primer is primer 1.

https://openalex.org/W1909939347,"Glucose controls long-term processes in the pancreatic beta-cell such as metabolic enzymes gene expression, cell growth, and apoptosis. Such control is likely mediated via the expression of immediate-early response genes since several of these genes including c-fos are strongly induced by glucose in the beta-cell line INS-1, provided costimulation with cAMP-raising glucoincretin hormones. This study addresses the mechanism of c-fos gene activation by glucose. Glucose in the presence of chlorophenylthio-cAMP generated a low threefold induction of the c-fos/basic luciferase reporter gene, which includes only the c-fos promoter. In contrast, the c-fos/intron construct containing the first intron in addition to promoter elements showed a pronounced 16-fold induction, comparable to the increased c-fos mRNA accumulation. Similar observations were made with glucose in combination with the glucoincretins glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide 38. Deletion of a 119 bp region in intron 1 that includes a transcriptional arrest site did not affect the inductive process. In contrast, a 534 bp deletion comprising a major part of the intron reduced the induction by 75%. At the promoter level, mutating the cAMP response element reduced by more than 60% the transcriptional activation whereas mutating the serum response element had no effect. Inhibitors of protein kinase A and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases each reduced by 50% the reporter gene activation and together fully prevented the glucose-glucoincretin effect. In conclusion, the strong induction of c-fos by glucose and glucoincretins results from Ca(2+) and cAMP signaling pathways addressing both the CRE in the promoter and essential response element(s) in the first intron that are unrelated to the transcription arrest site."
https://openalex.org/W2110265381,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune (EA) MG, are caused by T cell-dependent autoantibodies that react with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on muscle and interfere with neuromuscular transmission. Thus, selective inactivation of CD4(+) AChR-specific T helper cells should lower AChR Ab levels and ameliorate disease. In the Lewis rat model of EAMG, alpha chain residues 100-116 of the AChR represent the dominant T cell epitope, which is important in helping Ab responses to this autoantigen. In the present report, we have applied a new design technique that requires no knowledge of Ag receptor sequences on errant T cells in order to develop a synthetic peptide vaccine against T cells reactive with the aforementioned T cell epitope. Immunization with the peptide 1) induced polyclonal and monoclonal Ab, which inhibited AChR 100-116 stimulation of AChR-sensitized lymphocytes and recognized Vbeta15 containing T cell receptors on AChR 100-116-specific T cell lines and clones; 2) lowered AChR Ab levels; 3) reduced the loss of muscle AChR; and 4) lessened the incidence and severity of EAMG. These findings suggest a new strategy for the functional abrogation of epitope-specific T cells that could have potential application to human autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1986697630,"Prior phenotypic analysis of a vaccinia virus gene A18R mutant, Cts23, showed the synthesis of longer than wild type (Wt) length viral transcripts during the intermediate stage of infection, indicating that the A18R protein may act as a negative transcription elongation factor. The purpose of the work described here was to determine a biochemical activity for the A18R protein. Pulse-labeled transcription complexes established from intermediate virus promoters on bead-bound DNA templates were assayed for transcript release during an elongation step that contained nucleotides and various proteins. Pulse-labeled transcription complexes elongated in the presence of only nucleotides were unable to release nascent RNA. The addition of Wt extract during the elongation phase resulted in release of the nascent transcript, indicating that additional factors present in the Wt extract are capable of inducing transcript release. Extract from Cts23 or mock-infected cells was unable to induce release. The lack of release upon addition of Cts23 extract suggests that A18R is involved in release of nascent RNA. By itself, purified polyhistidine-tagged A18R protein (His-A18R) was unable to induce release; however, release did occur in the presence of purified His-A18R protein plus extract from either Cts23 or mock-infected cells. These data taken together indicate that A18R is necessary but not sufficient for release of nascent transcripts. We have also demonstrated that the combination of A18R protein and mock extract induces transcript release in an ATP-dependent manner, consistent with the fact that the A18R protein is an ATP-dependent helicase. Further analysis revealed that the release activity is not restricted to a vaccinia intermediate promoter but is observed using pulse-labeled transcription complexes initiated from all three viral gene class promoters. Therefore, we conclude that A18R and an as yet unidentified cellular factor(s) are required for thein vitro release of nascent RNA from a vaccinia virus transcription elongation complex."
https://openalex.org/W2161591306,"UDP-GalNAc pyrophosphorylase (UDP-GalNAcPP; AGX1) catalyzes the synthesis of UDP-GalNAc from UTP and GalNAc-1-P. The 475-amino acid protein (57 kDa protein) also synthesizes UDP-GlcNAc at about 25% the rate of UDP-GalNAc. The cDNA for this enzyme, termed AGX1, was cloned in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and expressed as an active enzyme that cross-reacted with antiserum against the original pig liver UDP-HexNAcPP. In the present study, we incubated recombinant AGX1 with N<sub>3</sub>-UDP-[<sup>32</sup>P]GlcNAc and N<sub>3</sub>-UDP-[<sup>32</sup>P]GalNAc probes to label the nucleotide-binding site. Proteolytic digestions of the labeled enzyme and analysis of the resulting peptides indicated that both photoprobes cross-linked to one 24-amino acid peptide located between residues Val<sup>216</sup> and Glu<sup>240</sup>. Four amino acids in this peptide were found to be highly conserved among closely related enzymes, and each of these was individually modified to alanine. Mutation of Gly<sup>222</sup> to Ala in the peptide almost completely eliminated UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc synthesis, while mutation of Gly<sup>224</sup> to Ala, almost completely eliminated UDP-GalNAc synthesis, but UDP-GlcNAc was only diminished by 50%. Both of these mutations also resulted in almost complete loss of the ability of the mutated proteins to cross-link N<sub>3</sub>-UDP-[<sup>32</sup>P]GlcNAc or N<sub>3</sub>-UDP-[<sup>32</sup>P]GalNAc. On the other hand, mutations of either Pro<sup>220</sup> or Tyr<sup>227</sup> to Ala did not greatly affect enzymatic activity, although there was some reduction in the ability of these proteins to cross-link the photoaffinity probes. We also mutated Gly<sup>111</sup> to Ala since this amino acid was reported to be necessary for catalysis (Mio, T., Yabe, T., Arisawa, M., and Yamada-Okabe, H. (1998) <i>J. Biol. Chem</i>. 273, 14392–14397). The Gly<sup>111</sup> to Ala mutant lost all enzymatic activity, but interestingly enough, this mutant protein still cross-linked the radioactive N<sub>3</sub>-UDP-GlcNAc although not nearly as well as the wild type. On the other hand, mutation of Arg<sup>115</sup> to Ala had no affect on enzymatic activity although it also reduced the amount of cross-linking of N<sub>3</sub>-UDP-[<sup>32</sup>P]GlcNAc. These studies help to define essential amino acids at or near the nucleotide-binding site and the catalytic site, as well as peptides involved in binding and catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1583757559,"Sensitization of adenylyl cyclase (AC) by increased expression of large isoforms of the stimulatory G-protein Gos has been suggested as a mechanism that governs uterine quiescence during pregnancy. We quantified several components of the AC pathway in pregnant (P, n=21) and nonpregnant human myometria (NP, n=10). AC activity was ~sev-enfold higher in P than in NP under basal and stimulated conditions (MnCl2/GTP/GTP + isopro-terenol). In addition, relative stimulation (% of basal) by 5’-guanosine-β7-iminotriphosphate and forskolin was twofold higher in P. β-Adrenoceptor density was low and unaltered in P. Gos mRNA splice variants did not differ in P. Using antisera against different epitopes of Gos (carboxyl-/more amino-terminal), we found unchanged expression of Gos short and long (45, 47 kDa) in P. Two additional proteins in P (51, 59 kDa) were detectable only by the carboxyl-terminal antiserum and lacked GTP binding properties. The 59 kDa protein could be identified as a recently discovered cytoskeletal protein, smoothelin, which was 10-fold increased in P. These data indicate that the apparent up-regulation of large Gos species in P is mimicked by elevated smoothelin. Therefore, the increase in AC cannot be attributed to changes in Gos-or β-adrenoreceptors. Epitope sharing between Gos and smoothelin should be considered in experiments on smooth muscle tissues.—Gsell, S., Eschenhagen, T., Kaspareit, G., Nose, M., Scholz, H., Behrens, O., Wieland, T. Apparent up-regulation of stimulatory G-protein α subunits in the pregnant human myometrium is mimicked by elevated smoothelin expression. FASEB J. 14, 17–26(2000)"
https://openalex.org/W1964462770,"Using a Drosophila transgenic system we investigated the ability of GAGA factor, a putative anti-repressor, to modulate transcription-related events in the absence or presence of a bona fide activator, the Adf-1 transcription factor. In contrast to previous in vitro and in vivo data linking the binding of GAGA factor to the acquisition of DNase hypersensitivity at heat shock promoters, we observed that inserting multiple GAGA binding motifs adjacent to a minimal alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) promoter led to strongly elevated embryonic transcription without creation of a promoter-associated DNase-hypersensitive (DH) site. Establishment of DNase hypersensitivity required the presence of both GAGA and Adf-1 binding sites and was accompanied by a further, synergistic increase in transcription. Because Adf-1 is capable neither of establishing a DH site nor of promoting efficient transcription by itself in embryos, it is likely that DH site formation depends on a GAGA factor-mediated binding of Adf-1 to chromatin, perhaps facilitated by a locally remodeled downstream promoter region. More generally we suggest that GAGA factor-binding sequences may operate in a promoter-specific context, with transcriptional activation, polymerase pausing, and/or DH site formation critically dependent on the nature of the sequences (and their binding partners) linked in cis."
