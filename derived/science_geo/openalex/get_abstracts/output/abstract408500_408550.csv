https://openalex.org/W2091797644,"Rotary motors of conventional design can be rather complex and are therefore difficult to miniaturize; previous carbon nanotube artificial muscles provide contraction and bending, but not rotation. We show that an electrolyte-filled twist-spun carbon nanotube yarn, much thinner than a human hair, functions as a torsional artificial muscle in a simple three-electrode electrochemical system, providing a reversible 15,000° rotation and 590 revolutions per minute. A hydrostatic actuation mechanism, as seen in muscular hydrostats in nature, explains the simultaneous occurrence of lengthwise contraction and torsional rotation during the yarn volume increase caused by electrochemical double-layer charge injection. The use of a torsional yarn muscle as a mixer for a fluidic chip is demonstrated."

However, these interferometers are fundamentally restricted by the shot noise limit, which can only be overcome by creating quantum entanglement among the atoms. We used spin dynamics in Bose-Einstein condensates to create large ensembles of up to $10^4$ pair-correlated atoms with an interferometric sensitivity $-1.61^{+0.98}_{-1.1}$ dB beyond the shot noise limit. Our proof-of-principle results point the way toward a new generation of atom interferometers."

https://openalex.org/W1976603231,"Metabolic rewiring is an established hallmark of cancer, but the details of this rewiring at a systems level are not well characterized. Here we acquire this insight in a melanoma cell line panel by tracking metabolic flux using isotopically labeled nutrients. Metabolic profiling and flux balance analysis were used to compare normal melanocytes to melanoma cell lines in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. All melanoma cells exhibited the Warburg phenomenon; they used more glucose and produced more lactate than melanocytes. Other changes were observed in melanoma cells that are not described by the Warburg phenomenon. Hypoxic conditions increased fermentation of glucose to lactate in both melanocytes and melanoma cells (the Pasteur effect). However, metabolism was not strictly glycolytic, as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was functional in all melanoma lines, even under hypoxia. Furthermore, glutamine was also a key nutrient providing a substantial anaplerotic contribution to the TCA cycle. In the WM35 melanoma line glutamine was metabolized in the ""reverse"" (reductive) direction in the TCA cycle, particularly under hypoxia. This reverse flux allowed the melanoma cells to synthesize fatty acids from glutamine while glucose was primarily converted to lactate. Altogether, this study, which is the first comprehensive comparative analysis of metabolism in melanoma cells, provides a foundation for targeting metabolism for therapeutic benefit in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2020665022,"Mutations in cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or its mitochondrial homolog IDH2 can lead to R(−)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) production. To date, mutations in three active site arginine residues, IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172 and IDH2 R140, have been shown to result in the neomorphic production of 2HG. Here we report on three additional 2HG-producing IDH1 mutations: IDH1 R100, which is affected in adult glioma, IDH1 G97, which is mutated in colon cancer cell lines and pediatric glioblastoma, and IDH1 Y139. All these new mutants stereospecifically produced 2HG's (R) enantiomer. In contrast, we find that the IDH1 SNPs V71I and V178I, as well as a number of other single-sample reports of IDH non-synonymous mutation, did not elevate cellular 2HG levels in cells and retained the wild-type ability for isocitrate-dependent NADPH production. Finally, we report the existence of additional rare, but recurring mutations found in lymphoma and thyroid cancer, which while failing to elevate 2HG nonetheless displayed loss of function, indicating a possible tumorigenic mechanism for a non-2HG-producing subset of IDH mutations in some malignancies. These data broaden our understanding of how IDH mutations may contribute to cancer through either neomorphic R(−)-2HG production or reduced wild-type enzymatic activity, and highlight the potential value of metabolite screening in identifying IDH-mutated tumors associated with elevated oncometabolite levels."
https://openalex.org/W1967834264,"Melanomas are very aggressive neoplasms with notorious resistance to therapeutics. It was recently proposed that the remarkable phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells allows for the rapid development of both resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and invasive properties. Indeed, the capacity of melanoma cells to form distant metastases is the main cause of mortality in melanoma patients. Therefore, the identification of the mechanism controlling melanoma phenotype is of paramount importance. In the present report, we show that deletion of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), the master gene in melanocyte differentiation, is sufficient to increase the metastatic potential of mouse and human melanoma cells. MITF silencing also increases fibronectin and Snail, two mesenchymal markers that might explain the increased invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ablation of this population by Forskolin-induced differentiation or MITF-forced expression significantly decreases tumour and metastasis formation, suggesting that eradication of low-MITF cells might improve melanoma treatment. Moreover, we demonstrate that a hypoxic microenvironment decreases MITF expression through an indirect, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1)α-dependant transcriptional mechanism, and increases the tumourigenic and metastatic properties of melanoma cells. We identified Bhlhb2, a new factor in melanoma biology, as the mediator of hypoxia/HIF1α inhibitory effect on MITF expression. Our results reveal a hypoxia–HIF1α–BHLHB2–MITF cascade controlling the phenotypic plasticity in melanoma cells and favouring metastasis development. Targeting this pathway might be helpful in the design of new anti-melanoma therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2020959817,"We integrated four gene expression profile data sets, namely two different pair-matched stage I lung adenocarcinoma data sets, secondary metastatic tumors vs benign tumors and lung tumor metastasizes to the brain, and we identified one kinase, T-LAK Cell-Originated Protein Kinase (TOPK), as a putative gene that promotes metastasis. To delineate the role of TOPK in lung cancer, we showed that overexpression of TOPK, but not a catalytically inactive form of TOPK, can enhance the migration and invasion of lung fibroblasts or cells with low TOPK expression. In addition, TOPK-induced cell migration was shown to be a PI3K/AKT-dependent event. TOPK concurrently promoted AKT phosphorylation at Ser(473) and decreased the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) levels, whereas TOPK knockdown had the reverse effects. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, did not inhibit the TOPK-induced decrease in PTEN, and co-expression of PTEN significantly reduced TOPK-induced AKT phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner; these results indicate that the TOPK-mediated PTEN decrease has an upstream role in regulating PI3K/AKT-stimulated migration. Using immunohistochemical analysis of lung cancer tissue samples, we showed that a high TOPK expression level correlates strongly with reduced overall and disease-free survivals. Moreover, an inverse correlation between TOPK and PTEN expression was present and is consistent with the biochemical findings. Finally, a combination of high TOPK and low PTEN expression was inversely correlated with overall and disease-free survivals, independent of other pathologic staging factors. Our results suggest that TOPK is a potential therapeutic target in lung cancer that promotes cell migration by modulating a PI3K/PTEN/AKT-dependent signaling pathway; they also suggest that high TOPK expression, either alone or in combination with a low level of PTEN, may serve as a prognostic marker for lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2150488608,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/Neu is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast cancers and associated with aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. For deciphering the role of HER2/Neu in breast cancer, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Her2/neu transgenic mice that develop mammary tumors resembling human HER2-subtype breast cancer have been established. Several recent studies have revealed that HER2/Neu is overexpressed in and regulates self renewal of breast tumor-initiating cells (TICs). However, in the MMTV-Her2/neu transgenic mouse model, the identity of TICs remains elusive, despite previous studies showing supportive evidence for existence of TICs in Her2/neu-induced mammary tumors. Through systematic screening and characterization, we identified that surface markers CD49f, CD61 and ESA were aberrantly overexpressed in Her2-overexpressing mammary tumor cells. Analysis of these markers and CD24 detected anomalous expansion of the luminal progenitor population in preneoplastic mammary glands of Her2/neu transgenic mice, indicating that aberrant luminal progenitors originated in Her2-induced mammary tumors. The combined markers, CD49f and CD61, further delineated the CD49f(high)CD61(high)-sorted fraction as a TIC-enriched population, which displayed increased tumorsphere formation ability, enhanced tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo and drug resistance to pacitaxel and doxorubicin. Moreover, the TIC-enriched population manifested increased transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling and exhibited gene expression signatures of stemness, TGFβ signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our findings that self-renewal and clonogenicity of TICs were suppressed by pharmacologically inhibiting the TGFβ signaling further indicate that the TGFβ pathway is vital for maintenance of the TIC population. Finally, we showed that the integrin-β3 (CD61) signaling pathway was required for sustaining active TGFβ signaling and self-renewal of TICs. We for the first time developed a technique to highly enrich TICs from mammary tumors of Her2/neu transgenic mice, unraveled their properties and identified the cooperative integrin-β3-TGFβ signaling axis as a potential therapeutic target for HER2-induced TICs."
https://openalex.org/W2155735267,"An intramolecular interaction between a distal (DCRD) and a proximal regulatory domain (PCRD) within the C terminus of long Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels (Cav1.3L) is a major determinant of their voltage- and Ca2+-dependent gating kinetics. Removal of these regulatory domains by alternative splicing generates Cav1.342A channels that activate at a more negative voltage range and exhibit more pronounced Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Here we describe the discovery of a novel short splice variant (Cav1.343S) that is expressed at high levels in the brain but not in the heart. It lacks the DCRD but, in contrast to Cav1.342A, still contains PCRD. When expressed together with α2δ1 and β3 subunits in tsA-201 cells, Cav1.343S also activated at more negative voltages like Cav1.342A but Ca2+-dependent inactivation was less pronounced. Single channel recordings revealed much higher channel open probabilities for both short splice variants as compared with Cav1.3L. The presence of the proximal C terminus in Cav1.343S channels preserved their modulation by distal C terminus-containing Cav1.3- and Cav1.2-derived C-terminal peptides. Removal of the C-terminal modulation by alternative splicing also induced a faster decay of Ca2+ influx during electrical activities mimicking trains of neuronal action potentials. Our findings extend the spectrum of functionally diverse Cav1.3 L-type channels produced by tissue-specific alternative splicing. This diversity may help to fine tune Ca2+ channel signaling and, in the case of short variants lacking a functional C-terminal modulation, prevent excessive Ca2+ accumulation during burst firing in neurons.

https://openalex.org/W1984568074,"Accumulating evidence suggests that a subpopulation of breast cancer cells, referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs), have the ability to propagate a tumor and potentially seed new metastases. Furthermore, stimulation of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by factors like transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is accompanied with the generation of breast CSCs. Previous observations indicated that bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7) antagonizes the protumorigenic and prometastatic actions of TGFβ, but whether BMP7 action is mechanistically linked to breast CSCs has remained elusive. Here, we have studied the effects of BMP7, BMP2 and a BMP2/7 heterodimer on the formation of human breast CSCs (ALDHhi/CD44hi/CD24−/low) and bone metastases formation in a preclinical model of intra-cardiac injection of MDA-MB-231 cells in athymic nude (Balb/c nu/nu) mice. The BMP2/7 heterodimer was the most efficient stimulator of BMP signaling and very effectively reduced TGFβ-driven Smad signaling and cancer cell invasiveness. The tested BMPs—particularly the heterodimeric BMP2/7—strongly reduced the size of the ALDHhi/CD44hi/CD24−/low CSC subpopulation. In keeping with these in vitro observations, pretreatment of cancer cells with BMPs for 72 h prior to systemic inoculation of the cancer cells inhibited the formation of bone metastases. Collectively, our data support the notion that breast CSCs are involved in bone metastasis formation and describe heterodimeric BMP2/7 as a powerful TGFβ antagonist with anti-metastatic potency."
https://openalex.org/W1979514665,"The reduced forms of NAD and NADP, two major nucleotides playing a central role in metabolism, are continuously damaged by enzymatic or heat-dependent hydration. We report the molecular identification of the eukaryotic dehydratase that repairs these nucleotides and show that this enzyme (Carkd in mammals, YKL151C in yeast) catalyzes the dehydration of the S form of NADHX and NADPHX, at the expense of ATP, which is converted to ADP. Surprisingly, the Escherichia coli homolog, YjeF, a bidomain protein, catalyzes a similar reaction, but using ADP instead of ATP. The latter reaction is ascribable to the C-terminal domain of YjeF. This represents an unprecedented example of orthologous enzymes using either ADP or ATP as phosphoryl donor. We also show that eukaryotic proteins homologous to the N-terminal domain of YjeF (apolipoprotein A-1-binding protein (AIBP) in mammals, YNL200C in yeast) catalyze the epimerization of the S and R forms of NAD(P)HX, thereby allowing, in conjunction with the energy-dependent dehydratase, the repair of both epimers of NAD(P)HX. Both enzymes are very widespread in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and archaea, which together with the ADP dependence of the dehydratase in some species indicates the ancient origin of this repair system."
https://openalex.org/W1983976206,"The incidence of malignant melanoma is growing rapidly worldwide and there is still no effective therapy for metastatic disease. Melanoma is the second most common cancer among young adults in the UK, where incidence rates have more than quadrupled since the 1970s. Increased expression of a number of DNA repair genes has been reported in melanoma and this likely contributes to its extreme resistance to conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics. One such chemotherapeutic that is effective against a range of other cancers, but not melanoma, is cisplatin. The DNA repair proteins ERCC1 and XPF are needed to remove cisplatin-induced DNA damage and we have investigated the response of these proteins to cisplatin in melanoma. The expression of both genes is induced by cisplatin. Use of a MEK inhibitor showed that ERCC1, but not XPF induction was regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, with reduction in expression of DUSP6, the phosphatase that inactivates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), being particularly important. DUSP6 overexpression prevented cisplatin induction of both ERCC1 and XPF, resulting in increased sensitivity to cisplatin. A novel ERCC1 mRNA was found that initiated upstream of the normal transcription initiation site, and was strongly regulated by both cisplatin and the MAPK pathway and its role in cisplatin resistance merits further study. The cisplatin induction of ERCC1 and XPF provides important insights into the resistance of melanoma to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, which is one of the major obstacles to melanoma treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2032781518,"CaV1.3 channels are unique among the high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel family because they activate at the most negative potentials and display very rapid calcium-dependent inactivation. Both properties are of crucial importance in neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and substantia nigra, where the influx of Ca2+ ions at subthreshold membrane voltages supports pacemaking function. Previously, alternative splicing in the CaV1.3 C terminus gives rise to a long (CaV1.342) and a short form (CaV1.342A), resulting in a pronounced activation at more negative voltages and faster inactivation in the latter. It was further shown that the C-terminal modulator in the CaV1.342 isoforms modulates calmodulin binding to the IQ domain. Using splice variant-specific antibodies, we determined that protein localization of both splice variants in different brain regions were similar. Using the transcript-scanning method, we further identified alternative splicing at four loci in the C terminus of CaV1.3 channels. Alternative splicing of exon 41 removes the IQ motif, resulting in a truncated CaV1.3 protein with diminished inactivation. Splicing of exon 43 causes a frameshift and exhibits a robust inactivation of similar intensity to CaV1.342A. Alternative splicing of exons 44 and 48 are in-frame, altering interaction of the distal modulator with the IQ domain and tapering inactivation slightly.

Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated calcium channels regulates numerous physiological functions in the nervous system, including neurotransmitter release, generation of dendritic Ca2+ spikes, and induction of activity-dependent gene regulation. To support this diverse range of functions, neurons express a diverse complement of voltage-gated calcium channels, N-type (CaV2.2) and P/Q-type (CaV2.1) channels to mediate rapid influx of Ca2+ into the presynaptic terminal, triggering synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release (excitation-secretion coupling) (1Dunlap K.

Another splice isoform in exon 43 (CaV1.343S) was described in our accompanying article (16Bock G. Gebhart M. Scharinger A. Jangsangthong W. Busquet P. Poggiani C. Sartori S. Mangoni M.

Alternative splicing in the C terminus causes hyperpolarized shifts in the activation and inactivation properties and modulates the degree of CDI, via changes in the IQ domain, or conserved proximal and distal domains (termed PRCD and DCRD), which could alter its C-terminal gating modulator (CTM) activity. All alternatively spliced CaV1.3 channels examined in this study were functional and may contribute differentially to the overall firing property of neurons in specific nuclei, particularly in physiological and disease states. The rat CaV1.342 splice variant peptide (CCEDDSSPTWSRQNYSYYNRYPGSSMD) was subcloned in-frame at EcoRI and XhoI sites of expression plasmid pGEX-4T-1 (Ambersham Biosciences). The resulting fusion protein was expressed in the host Escherichia coli BL21 (DES) cells. This GST-fused CaV1.342 protein was purified and eluted with glutathione-agarose (Sigma, G4501). Purified CaV1.342-GST protein was used to immunize female New Zealand White rabbits once a month. Complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma, F5881) was first mixed with GST fusion protein for immunization, and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma, F5506) was used in subsequent injections once a month. Serum was pre-absorbed overnight at 4 °C with excess GST protein to remove contaminating GST IgG in the serum and the antibody of interest was affinity purified from immobilized GST fusion protein with an IgG elution buffer (Pierce). The concentration of the resulting antibody was ∼1.5 μg/μl, and was designated as pAb_CaV1.342. The polyclonal peptide antibody pAb_CaV1.342A was raised (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX) against the peptide containing exon 42A (6 amino acids MLERML; AF370009.1) and two amino acids from exon 41 (LQ). The peptide CLQMLERML was synthesized and used for generation of peptide antibody against CaV1.342A channels in rabbits. The inclusion of an additional residue C (cysteine) for pAb_CaV1.342A is to stabilize and increase the ease of affinity purification of the peptide (12Shen Y. Yu D. Hiel H. Liao P. Yue D.T.

Tissues from mouse brains, wild type and CaV1.3−/− knock-out, were homogenized in cold lysis buffer containing the following (in mm): 50 Tris, pH 8.0, 1 EDTA, and 150 NaCl. All processes were done at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min, followed by 40,000 × g for 1 h. Membrane proteins were extracted from the pellet with cold lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. The pellet was then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 1 h. Membrane proteins were extracted from the supernatant, and 20 μg of protein was separated in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane using a semi-dry transfer system (Bio-Rad). For antibody detection, the membrane was first blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with diluted primary antibody pAb_CaV1.342 (used at 1:2000), diluted primary antibody pAb_CaV1.342A (used at 1:200), or pAb_CaV1.3 antibody (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) (used at 1:200) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with diluted goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (used at 1:2000; Sigma) for 1 h. After washing, the antibody binding was detected with SuperSignal Ultra Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Adult wild type C57 mice were deeply anesthetized, and perfused transcardially with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde buffered with PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min. Brain and spinal cord were dissected and stored in a freezer at −80 °C. Frozen coronal sections at 40 μm thickness were cut in a cryostat. Freely floating sections were washed and blocked in 4% normal goat serum in TBSTx (TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 2 h. Sections were incubated with primary antibody pAb_CaV1.342 (used at 1:200) and primary antibody pAb_CaV1.342A (used at 1:100) overnight at 4 °C on the orbital shaker. After washing, sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (used at 1:500, Vector). After washing, sections were incubated with avidin-biotin complex (ABC) reagent (Vector) for 2 h, followed by DAB (0.12% H2O2 and 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine) (Sigma) for 20 min before mounting onto glass slides. Brains of deeply anesthetized wild type C57 mice were dissected out without perfusion. Frozen brain coronal sections at 20 μm thickness from both wild type C57 and CaV1.3−/− knock-out mice were prepared in a cryostat and mounted on glass slides. The brain sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing and blocking with 4% normal goat serum in TBSTx, the sections were incubated with primary antibody pAb_CaV1.342 (used at 1:200) and primary antibody pAb_CaV1.342A (used at 1:100) alone or together with mouse anti-bassoon antibody (used at 1:500; Novus Biologicals) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, slides were treated for 2 h in FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) against CaV1.3 protein and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) to detect the presence of the bassoon protein. After washing, the sections were mounted in FluorSaveTM Reagent (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) to retard fading. Preparations were analyzed using Carl Zeiss Laser Scanning System LSM 510. In control sections, one or both primary antibodies were omitted. The experiment was repeated in at least three animals. The transcript scanning method has been described in detail by Mittman et al. (14Mittman S. Guo J. Agnew W.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 274: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Soong et al. (15Soong T.W. DeMaria C.D. Alvania R.S. Zweifel L.S. Liang M.C. Mittman S. Agnew W.S. Yue D.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10142-10152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the systematic identification of loci for alternative splicing of voltage-gated calcium channel genes. Here we briefly describe the method. Pairs of primers were used to amplify 5 amplicons covering overlapping regions of the C terminus of the CaV1.3 α1-subunit. The size of the PCR products ranged from 515 to 638 bp, spanning between 2 and 4 exons. We used 1 lot of rat brain cDNA libraries (Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA, catalog numbers 639412) for the transcript scanning reactions. Initial PCRs were conducted using rat CaV1.3-specific primers situated on exons 36 and 3′-UTR of the CaV1.342 isoform. Nested PCRs were conducted using primers flanking exons 37 to 49 (supplemental Fig. S2C). The amplicons were subcloned into pGEMp®-T Easy vector and transformed into DH10B E. coli cells. A total of 237 colonies were picked as templates for nested PCR using the exon-specific primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The different splice combinations were differentiated based on their distinct migration patterns in 3% agarose gels (supplemental Fig. S2D). To verify the accuracy of gel analysis, plasmids extracted from representative colonies were sent for DNA sequencing. To characterize their functional properties, the splice variations in the C terminus were substituted into the full-length wild type CaV1.342 and constructs CaV1.3Δ41, CaV1.343S-2, CaV1.3Δ44, and CaV1.348S were generated. The CaV1.3Δ41 (deleted exon 41) has exon 41 alternatively spliced out, thus generating a truncated protein that is different from CaV1.342 (contains exon 41). The CaV1.343S-2 (truncated exon 43) is subjected to alternative splicing at the region just after PCRD, thus generating a truncated protein with an intact PCRD. The CaV1.3Δ44 (deleted exon 44) has exon 44 alternatively spliced out, generating an in-frame protein that lacks exon 44. The CaV1.348S construct (alternative 3′ splice acceptor site in exon 48) has a portion of exon 48 spliced out, generating an in-frame protein that lacks the first 45 amino acids of exon 48. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were used to characterize the wild type long form CaV1.342 and short form CaV1.342A, as well as the splice variants: CaV1.3Δ41, CaV1.343S-2, CaV1.3Δ44, and CaV1.348S. The Ca2+ currents were recorded at room temperature using the whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology technique from transiently transfected mammalian human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells according to methods described previously (17Patil P.G. Brody D.L. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Outward K+ currents were blocked by Cs+ in the internal and external solutions. Cells were transiently transfected with wild type long form CaV1.342, short form CaV1.342A, or the splice variants, CaV1.3Δ41, CaV1.343S-2, CaV1.3Δ44 or CaV1.348S, rat β2a and α2δ subunits using the standard calcium phosphate transfection method. IBa or ICa were recorded at room temperature using the whole cell patch clamp technique 48–72 h after transfection. For whole cell patch clamp recording, the internal solution (patch-pipette solution) contained the following (in mm): 138 Cs-MeSO3, 5 CsCl, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 2 mg/ml of Mg-ATP, pH 7.3 (adjusted with CsOH), 290 mosmol with glucose. The external solution contained the following (in mm): 10 HEPES, 140 tetraethylammonium methanesulfonate, 5 BaCl2, or 5 CaCl2 (pH adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH and osmolality to 290–310 with glucose). Pipettes, of 1.5–2 megohm resistance, were used. Whole cell currents, obtained under voltage clamp with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), were filtered at 1–5 kHz and sampled at 5–50 kHz, and the series resistance was typically <5 megohm after >70% compensation. A P/4 protocol was used to subtract on-line the leak and capacitive transients. Data were acquired using pClamp9 software (Molecular Devices), and analyzed and fitted using GraphPad Prism IV software and Microsoft (Seattle, WA) Excel. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using paired or unpaired Student's t test. Current-voltage (I-V) curve relationships were obtained by step depolarization from a holding potential of −100 mV to various test potentials. I-V curves were fitted according to Equation 1: I = Gmax(V-Erev)/(1 + exp[(V − V1/2act)/kI-V]), where Gmax is the maximum conductance of the cell, Erev is the reversal potential, V1/2act is the voltage for half-maximal activation, kI-V is the slope of Boltzmann function, and n is the number of tested cells. Steady-state inactivation data and CDI were fitted to Equation 2: amp1 + (1-amp1)/(1 + exp[(V − V1/2inact)/SF1) + amp2/(1 + exp[(V − V1/2inact′)SF2], where amp1 is the initial current amplitude, amp2 is the final current amplitude, V is the membrane potential of the conditioning pulse, V1/2inact is the potential for half-inactivation, and SF is the slope factor. Activation data were fitted according to Equation 3: G/Gmax = Flow/{1 + exp[(V1/2,low − V)/klow]} + (1 − Flow)/{1 + exp[(V1/2,high − V)/khigh]}, where G is the tail current, Gmax is the tail current evoked by a depolarization to +120 mV, Flow is the fraction of the low threshold component, V is the membrane potential of the test pulse, V1/2,low, V1/2, high, klow, and khigh are the half-activation potentials and slope factors for the low and high threshold components and V1/2act was calculated when G = 0.5 Gmax. In the C terminus of CaV1.3, expression of longer isoform CaV1.342 is mediated by exon skipping of exon 42A in the pre-mRNA (8Hui A. Ellinor P.T. Krizanova O. Wang J.J. Diebold R.J. Schwartz A. Neuron. 1991; 7: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The presence of exon 42A predicts a α1-subunit containing C termini 500 amino acids shorter than exon 42-containing subunits (GenBank accession number AF370010) (Fig. 1A). Although qualitative RT-PCR showed brain tissue expression of both CaV1.3 splice isoforms, with predominant exon 42 mRNA levels in both mouse and human (9Singh A. Gebhart M. Fritsch R. Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Poggiani C. Hoda J.C. Engel J. Romanin C. Striessnig J. Koschak A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20733-20744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), not much is known about differential protein expression due to lack of antibodies that differentiate between exons 42 and 42A. We therefore raised specific polyclonal antibodies against the CaV1.342 and CaV1.342A channels. For CaV1.342A channels, exons downstream of exon 42A are not encoded as the use of cassette exon 42A produced a stop codon 7 amino acids after exon 41 (Fig. 1A). A polyclonal antibody was thereby generated against a GST fusion to a 27-amino acid sequence encoded by exons 45 and 46 (Fig. 1A), yielding antibody pAb_CaV1.342. For CaV1.342A channels, a polyclonal peptide antibody was raised against exon 42A, which encodes eight amino acids downstream of exon 41 (Fig. 1A). The resulting antibody was denoted pAb_CaV1.342A. In both cases, antibodies were affinity purified before use. To establish the specificity of pAb_CaV1.342 and pAb_CaV1.342A, we analyzed membrane proteins extracted from wild type and CaV1.3−/− knock-out mouse brain tissue via Western blotting. A single protein band with the predicted size of ∼250 kDa was observed for CaV1.342 in the wild type (Fig. 1B, left) and ∼180 kDa was observed for CaV1.342A (Fig. 1B, middle), but was absent in CaV1.3−/− knock-out mouse. In addition, multiple bands were detected with commercial pAb_CaV1.3 antibody (Fig. 1B, right) in the 250 to 150 kDa range, indicating the expression of different CaV1.3 channel splice isoforms of different sizes. Visual inspection revealed that CaV1.3 channels with a longer C terminus appear to be the dominant species. In the CA3 region of the hippocampus, a similar immunostaining pattern was observed for both pAb_CaV1.342 and pAb_CaV1.342A antibodies (Fig. 1C). Strong labeling of both CaV1.342 and CaV1.342A proteins was restricted mostly to the pyramidal cell soma in the stratum pyramidale (SP) (Fig. 1C, left panels). Some interneurons in the CA3 region are also immunostained for CaV1.342 and CaV1.342A proteins. The most dense labeling was observed in the cell soma and proximal dendrites for both cell types, with diminishing intensity in the distal dendritic regions. Bassoon, a presynaptic vesicle marker, stained the stratum lucidum, a mossy fiber recipient layer of the CA3 subfield. Using polyclonal antibodies pAb_CaV1.342 and pAb_CaV1.342A, we mapped the expression patterns of CaV1.3 splice variants in the mouse brain and spinal cord tissues (Fig. 2). Stronger staining was observed for both splice variants in the septum region, the cerebellar Purkinje cells, the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, the ventral medial hypothalamus, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, and some nuclei from the brain stem including hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, and locus coeruleus. A weaker staining was observed in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, the central amygdaloid nucleus, and the lateral preoptical area. In the spinal cord, immunostaining with both pAb_CaV1.342 and pAb_CaV1.342A antibodies were confined to neurons in the gray matter, and similar staining patterns were observed in all animals examined. The staining was present at all spinal levels of the gray matter, as shown in a representative coronal section from the lumbar segment (Fig. 2). The staining was most intense at the ventral horn motor neurons, with some small neurons stained in the intermediate zone and in the dorsal horn as well. In the ventral horn neuron, both soma and the proximal dendrites were strongly stained. Alternative splicing in human CaV1.3 results in CaV1.342A channels with more pronounced activation of calcium current at negative voltages and faster inactivation due to enhanced CDI (9Singh A. Gebhart M. Fritsch R. Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Poggiani C. Hoda J.C. Engel J. Romanin C. Striessnig J. Koschak A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20733-20744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, this diminished CDI of the CaV1.342 isoform was not replicated in rat clones, and was attributed to a single valine to alanine switch in its distal carboxyl tail (Fig. 3A, highlighted purple) (19Liu X. Yang P.S. Yang W. Yue D.T. Nature. 2010; 463: 968-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Sequencing analysis of the PCR fragment amplified with primers flanking exons 48–49 revealed GTC (coding for valine) in both rat brain (Fig. 3B) and rat heart cDNA (data not shown), instead of GCC (coding for alanine) at position 2123 in rat CaV1.342 clone (Fig. 3B). The amplified fragment was cloned into cloning vector pGEM®-T Easy, and sequencing analysis for the correct clone was performed against rat CaV1.3 mRNA (GenBank accession number NM017298) before subcloning into rat CaV1.342 clone. We systematically investigated the biophysical properties of both IBa and ICa for the corrected clone CaV1.3A2123V and CaV1.342A as illustrated in Fig. 3, C–E, and TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3. The current trace profile for CaV1.342A displayed a slower inactivating IBa compared with the corrected clone CaV1.3A2123V (Fig. 3C, gray traces), but showed an early and much pronounced inactivation of ICa (Fig. 3C, black traces). In the I-V curves, CaV1.342A showed a pronounced shift in the hyperpolarized direction, indicating a more negatively activating channel in both Ba2+ and Ca2+ (Fig. 3D). This was also reflected in a pronounced hyperpolarized shift in voltage for half-maximal activation, V½act, by 11.22 mV in Ba2+ (see Table 1) and 10.87 mV in Ca2+ (see Table 2) with respect to CaV1.3A2123V (both p < 0.001; unpaired t test). This negative shift was because of the significant decrease in slope of activation, kact, by 2.43 mV in Ba2+ (see Table 1) and 2.57 mV in Ca2+ (see Table 2). From the profiles of the exemplary traces in Fig. 3C, it is clear that the corrected CaV1.3A2123V clone is not deprived of CDI, it is 2-fold smaller than the short variant CaV1.342A (f−10, 300 ms, CaV1.3A2123V, 0.35 ± 0.03, n = 14; CaV1.342A, 0.75 ± 0.04, n = 13). Hence, correction of alanine to valine in position 2123 in the rat CaV1.342 clone was sufficient to replicate the diminished CDI observed in human CaV1.342. This confirms previous experiments by Liu et al. (19Liu X. Yang P.S. Yang W. Yue D.T. Nature. 2010; 463: 968-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that the valine residue is crucial for interaction of the CTM with the calcium-sensing apparatus in the proximal C terminus and could greatly repress the CDI of CaV1.3 channels.TABLE 1Comparison of IBa electrophysiological properties of CaV1.3 channels containing long form (CaV1.3A2123V), short form (CaV1.342A), and splice variants Δ41, 43S-2, Δ44, and 48SConstructI-VG-VSSIVrevV1/2 actkactV1/2 actkactV1/2 inactkinactmVmVmVCav1.3A2123V49.29 ± 0.61−24.33 ± 0.49−8.03 ± 0.49−10.50 ± 0.9515.13 ± 0.91−44.24 ± 0.475.90 ± 0.40Cav1.342A41.59 ± 0.79ap < 0.001, compared to CaV1.3A2123V (unpaired t test).

https://openalex.org/W2128765556,"Open reading frame 45 (ORF45) of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes sustained activation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), which is crucial for KSHV lytic replication, but the exact functional roles remain to be determined. To characterize the biological consequence of persistent RSK activation by ORF45, we screened known cellular substrates of RSK. We found that ORF45 induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), increased its assembly into translation initiation complex, and subsequently facilitated protein translation. The ORF45/RSK-mediated eIF4B phosphorylation was distinguishable from that caused by the canonical AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin/ribosomal S6 kinase and MEK/ERK/RSK pathways because it was resistant to both rapamycin (an mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor) and U1026 (an MEK inhibitor). The rapamycin and U1026 doubly insensitive eIF4B phosphorylation was induced during KSHV reactivation but was abolished if either ORF45 or RSK1/2 were ablated by siRNA, a pattern that is correlated with reduced lytic gene expression as we observed previously. Ectopic expression of eIF4B but not its phosphorylation-deficient mutant form increased KSHV lytic gene expression and production of progeny viruses. Together, these results indicated that ORF45/RSK axis-induced eIF4B phosphorylation is involved in translational regulation and is required for optimal KSHV lytic replication.

Protein translation is primarily regulated at the step of initiation at which the small ribosome subunit is recruited to the 5′-end of mRNA and scans toward the start codon where the initiation complex joins the large subunit to form a complete ribosome (80 S) and begin polypeptide formation (1Gingras A.C.

Many eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) are involved in the initiation process. Most cellular mRNAs initiate translation through assembly of the cap-binding complex eIF4F on the 5′-cap structure (m7GpppN). The heterotrimeric eIF4F consists of eIF4E, the cap-binding protein; eIF4G, a scaffolding protein; and eIF4A, an RNA helicase. The 43 S preinitiation complex, which consists of the 40 S small ribosome subunit, eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA ternary complex, eIF3, and eIF1A, is recruited by the cap-binding complex to the 5′-proximal region of mRNA and scans along the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) to the start codon. The eIF4B is an auxiliary factor that potentiates ribosome recruitment to the mRNA and stimulates translation of both capped and uncapped mRNAs (1Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). eIF4B is an avid RNA-binding protein that binds to both mRNA and 18 S rRNA simultaneously (2Méthot N. Pause A. Hershey J.W.

The S6K phosphorylates rpS6 at all four serine residues, Ser-235, Ser-236, Ser-240, and Ser-244, in an mTOR-dependent manner, whereas RSK exclusively phosphorylates rpS6 at Ser-235 and Ser-236 independently of mTOR (12Ferrari S.

Viruses rely on the cellular translational machinery for synthesis of their own proteins; therefore, they have evolved a variety of strategies to control that machinery (15Gale Jr., M. Tan S.L.

Some viruses encode products that directly modify various eIFs or recruit them to viral mRNAs. Other viruses instead modulate cellular signaling pathways that regulate translation factors and ultimately hijack the host translational machinery for production of viral proteins.

We recently found that the immediate early and tegument protein open reading frame 45 (ORF45) of KSHV interacts with RSK1 and RSK2 and causes sustained activation of RSK and ERK during lytic replication (17Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We further revealed the underlying mechanism and demonstrated that ORF45 forms complexes with RSK and ERK, retains active pRSK and pERK in the complexes, and protects them from dephosphorylation, thus promoting sustained activation of these kinases (33Kuang E. Wu F. Zhu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13958-13968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed that depletion of RSK expression by siRNA or inhibition of RSK activity by specific inhibitors reduces KSHV lytic gene expression, suggesting that the RSK signaling is required for optimal KSHV lytic replication, but its exact roles remain to be determined (17Kuang E.

In the work reported here, we showed that ORF45-mediated sustained activation of ERK/RSK signaling contributes to the phosphorylation of eIF4B and plays a critical role in translation regulation during KSHV lytic infection. Body cavity-based lymphoma 1 (BCBL1) cells, a line derived from primary effusion lymphoma and latently infected with KSHV, were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and 293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. iSLK, a cell line of endothelial origin, was engineered to express doxycycline-inducible RTA (a key KSHV gene that is essential and sufficient for initiating the lytic replication program from latency). iSLK.219 (clone 10), derived from iSLK, is latently infected with a recombinant rKSHV.219 virus (34Vieira J. O'Hearn P.M. Virology. 2004; 325: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The resultant cells maintain strict latency but support robust lytic reactivation upon induction with doxycycline.

A point mutation was introduced with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to yield pHIV7-eIF4B-S422A plasmid. RSK and S6K kinase activities were assayed in vitro with GST-S6 peptide (218KEAKEKRQEQIAKRRRLSSLRASTSKSESSQK249) as described previously (17Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells seeded in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of HA-tagged RSK1 or S6K1 expression vector. After serum starvation for 24 h, the transfected cells were treated with TPA for 10 min or left untreated as controls. Whole-cell lysates were made, and the HA-RSK1 or HA-S6K1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with 50 μl of EZview Red anti-HA affinity beads. After two washes with the lysis buffer and three washes with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), the immunoprecipitated beads were resuspended in 100 μl of TBS plus 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The kinase reaction was performed by incubation of 5 μl of the precipitated complexes with 2.5 μg of GST-S6 substrate in 25 μl of 1× kinase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml BSA, 20 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The reactions were kept at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. After fractionation of samples by 10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film or analyzed by phosphorimaging. The knockdown of gene expression by a retrovirus-based siRNA vector including target sequences for RSK1, RSK2, ERKs, and ORF45 has been described previously (17Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Kuang E. Wu F. Zhu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13958-13968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The BCBL1 cells that stably express eIF4B wild type or S422A mutant were established by standard lentivirus vector protocols (43Tiscornia G. Singer O. Verma I.M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). m7GTP-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with an equal amount of whole-cell extract (∼1 mg) at 4 °C for 2–4 h and then washed four times with whole-cell lysis buffer. The proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Polysomal ribosome fractions were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described by Roux et al. (13Roux P.P. Shahbazian D. Vu H. Holz M.K. Cohen M.S. Taunton J. Sonenberg N. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14056-14064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 min before harvest, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to the culture medium. Cells were washed in PBS supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and harvested in polysome lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 1.3% sodium deoxycholate, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science). Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was layered on a 15–50% linear sucrose gradient (w/v) and centrifuged in an SW41 rotor at 35,000 rpm (150,000 × g) for 150 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 1-ml fractions were collected from the gradient. RNAs were isolated from each fraction with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Vaccinia virus vTF7-3 was amplified on Vero cells. Briefly, vTF7-3 virus stock was mixed with an equal volume of 10-fold diluted trypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen; final trypsin concentration, 0.025%) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then 1 ml of DMEM with 2.5% FBS was added to the solution to neutralize the trypsin. One milliliter of trypsin-digested vTF7-3 virus was added to a monolayer of Vero cells (>50% confluence) in a 100-mm dish and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Then the viral inoculum was removed, and 10 ml of fresh medium with 2.5% FBS per dish was added. After 3–4 days of incubation, cells were collected when most cells became round. The cells were washed with PBS once, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS per dish, subjected to three rounds of freeze/thaw at −80 and 37 °C, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min for removal of cell debris. The supernatant was collected, titrated, and stored at −80 °C. For translation reporter assays, HEK293 or RSK siRNA-transduced HEK293 cells (80–90% confluence) were infected with trypsin-digested vTF7-3 with a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 1 h at 37 °C. During the incubation, DNA-Lipofectamine complexes were prepared by mixing Lipofectamine 2000 with the reporter plasmid pGEM-REN-HCV IRES-LUC and ORF45-expressing vectors. The vTF7-3-infected cells were rinsed once and provided with fresh medium with 2.5% FBS; DNA-Lipofectamine complexes were then added. After 36 h, cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity with a Dual-Luciferase assay reporter system (Promega, Madison, WI). The recombinant Ad-RTA virus was a gift from Dr. Britt Glaunsinger at the University of California, Berkeley and was amplified in HEK293 cells as described previously (44Bechtel J.T. Liang Y. Hvidding J. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6474-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). BCBL1 cells (1 × 106 cells) were infected with a serial dilution (multiplicity of infection ranging from 1 to 1000) of Ad-RTA, and expressions of KSHV lytic genes were analyzed by Western blots. An optimal multiplicity of infection of 10 was used in most experiments. Data are shown as average values with S.D. The p value was determined by Student's t test. We recently found that KSHV ORF45 causes sustained activation of RSK1 and RSK2. We further demonstrated that depletion of RSK expression or inhibition of RSK activity reduces KSHV lytic gene expression, indicating that RSK signaling is required for optimal KSHV lytic replication (17Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Kuang E. Wu F. Zhu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13958-13968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but the exact functional roles of the persistently active RSK remain to be determined. To characterize the biological consequence of RSK activation by ORF45, we screened some of the known cellular substrates of RSK by Western blot using phosphorylation-specific antibodies (45Anjum R. Blenis J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 46Carriere A. Ray H. Blenis J. Roux P.P. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 4258-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because ORF45 of KSHV is the only one among its homologues of γ2 (Rhadinovirus) herpesviruses that is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm (47Li X. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 2531-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we were particularly interested in the cytoplasmic substrates of RSK. We found two cytoplasmic substrates, eIF4B and ribosomal protein S6, whose phosphorylations were consistently increased in cells transfected with wild-type pCR3.1-ORF45 but not in cells transfected with the mutant pCR3.1-ORF45-Δ(19–77) or pCR3.1-ORF45-F66A, both of which failed to activate RSK (Fig. 1A). Recent studies have shown that eIF4B and rpS6 can be phosphorylated by both RSK and S6K (9Shahbazian D. Roux P.P. Mieulet V. Cohen M.S. Raught B. Taunton J. Hershey J.W. Blenis J. Pende M. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 13Roux P.P. Shahbazian D. Vu H. Holz M.K. Cohen M.S. Taunton J. Sonenberg N. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14056-14064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). To determine whether S6K contributes to the phosphorylation of eIF4B and rpS6 induced by ORF45, we cotransfected HA-tagged kinase expression vectors with or without pCR3.1-ORF45 plasmid into HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated the kinases with anti-HA affinity beads to perform in vitro kinase assays. As expected, the RSK activity was dramatically induced by ORF45 and comparable with that caused by TPA stimulation (Fig. 1B, left panel, lanes 4 and 6, compare the 32P-GST-S6 signals). As reported previously (17Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), ORF45 was coimmunoprecipitated very efficiently with RSK and phosphorylated by the associated active kinases, producing strong 32P-ORF45 and 32P-RSK signals (Fig. 1B, lane 4). In contrast, the S6K activity was induced marginally by ORF45 in comparison with that induced by TPA (Fig. 1B, left panel, lanes 1 and 3, compare the 32P-GST-S6 signals). The effects of ORF45 on RSK and S6K kinase activities are more quantitatively illustrated in Fig. 1B (right bar graph) where the relative kinases activities were normalized to the amounts of input GST-S6 substrate and HA-tagged kinases. The above results suggested that RSK rather than S6K is the principal kinase activated by ORF45 and is responsible for the increased eIF4B and rpS6 phosphorylation induced by ORF45. To confirm the principal role of RSK, we next used an RSK2 kinase-dead (KD) mutant (RSK2-K100A/Y707A) and a constitutively active (CA) mutant (RSK2-Y707A) to determine whether RSK activity was needed for the ORF45-induced phosphorylation of eIF4B and rpS6. As shown in Fig. 1C, in the presence of ORF45, overexpression of the RSK2-WT and the RSK2-CA increased the phosphorylation of eIF4B and rpS6, but overexpression of the RSK2-KD did not increase or actually reduced the phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). In the absence of ORF45, overexpression of the RSK2-WT or the RSK2-CA did not induce noticeable eIF4B phosphorylation, but overexpression of the RSK2-CA increased the basal level of rpS6 phosphorylation, whereas overexpression of the RSK2-KD reduced the basal level of rpS6 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). This experiment suggests that RSK activity is required for the ORF45-induced eIF4B phosphorylation and that ORF45 specifically increases eIF4B phosphorylation by RSK. Furthermore, we used HEK293-derived stable cell lines in which both RSK1 and RSK2 have been knocked down by retrovirus-delivered siRNAs (17Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and found that depletion of both RSK1 and RSK2 reduced the levels of ORF45-induced eIF4B and rpS6 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Together, these results supported induction of eIF4B and rpS6 phosphorylation by the ORF45/RSK axis. Phosphorylation of eIF4B and rpS6 increases their associations with the translation initiation complex and subsequently promotes translation (9Shahbazian D. Roux P.P. Mieulet V. Cohen M.S. Raught B.

We next determined whether ORF45 affects the recruitment of eIF4B and rpS6 into the initiation complex using m7GTP (which mimics the m7GpppN mRNA cap)-Sepharose beads. As shown in Fig. 2A, ORF45 increased the recruitment of eIF4B and pS6 into the mRNA cap-associated complex, but the ORF45-F66A mutant had little effect (Fig. 2A). In contrast, ORF45 did not affect binding of eIF4E to m7GTP-Sepharose beads. Interestingly, ORF45 also increased association of RSK and ERK with the complex (Fig. 2A, top) in agreement with the previous study showing that RSK and ERK are recruited to polysomes during active translation (48Angenstein F. Greenough W.T. Weiler I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15078-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of ORF45 on"
https://openalex.org/W2000639701,"Peroxiredoxin IV (PrxIV) is an endoplasmic reticulum-localized enzyme that metabolizes the hydrogen peroxide produced by endoplasmic reticulum oxidase 1 (Ero1). It has been shown to play a role in de novo disulfide formation, oxidizing members of the protein disulfide isomerase family of enzymes, and is a member of the typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin family. We have determined the crystal structure of both reduced and disulfide-bonded, as well as a resolving cysteine mutant of human PrxIV. We show that PrxIV has a similar structure to other typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins and undergoes a conformational change from a fully folded to a locally unfolded form following the formation of a disulfide between the peroxidatic and resolving cysteine residues. Unlike other mammalian typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, we show that human PrxIV forms a stable decameric structure even in its disulfide-bonded state. In addition, the structure of a resolving cysteine mutant reveals an intermediate in the reaction cycle that adopts the locally unfolded conformation. Interestingly the peroxidatic cysteine in the crystal structure is sulfenylated rather than sulfinylated or sulfonylated. In addition, the peroxidatic cysteine in the resolving cysteine mutant is resistant to hyper-oxidation following incubation with high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. These results highlight some unique properties of PrxIV and suggest that the equilibrium between the fully folded and locally unfolded forms favors the locally unfolded conformation upon sulfenylation of the peroxidatic cysteine residue."

In this study, we investigated the function of scaffolding adaptor protein Gab2 in ovarian cancer cells. Gab2 is found to be overexpressed in a subset of ovarian tumors and cancer cell lines. Gab2 expression mainly regulates the migratory behaviors of ovarian cancer cells. Overexpression of Gab2 promotes the migration and invasion, and downregulates E-cadherin expression in ovarian cancer cells with low-Gab2 expression. Conversely, knockdown of Gab2 expression inhibits the migration and invasion, and promotes E-cadherin expression in ovarian cancer cells with high-Gab2 expression. By expressing Gab2 wild-type and Gab2 mutants that are defective in activation of the PI3K and Shp2-Erk pathways, we find that Gab2 inhibits E-cadherin expression and enhances the expression of Zeb1, a transcription factor involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cell migration and invasion through the activation of the PI3K pathway. Knockdown of Zeb1 expression blocks Gab2-induced suppression of E-cadherin expression and increase in cell invasion. LY294002 and GDC-0941, inhibitors of PI3K, or Rapamycin, an inhibitor of PI3K downstream target mTOR, can reverse the effects of Gab2 on migration and invasion. Overall, our studies reveal that Gab2 overexpression, via activation of the PI3K-Zeb1 pathway, promotes characteristics of EMT in ovarian cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2085227918,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) exhibit multiple molecular alterations and overexpress heparin-binding growth factors (HBGFs) and glypican-1 (GPC1), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that promotes efficient signaling by HBGFs. It is not known, however, whether GPC1 has a role in genetic mouse models of PDAC. Therefore, we generated a GPC1 null mouse that combines pancreas-specific Cre-mediated activation of oncogenic Kras (KrasG12D) with deletion of a conditional INK4A/Arf allele (Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D;INK4A/Arflox/lox;GPC1−/− mice). By comparison with Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D;INK4A/Arflox/lox mice that were wild type for GPC1, the Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D;INK4A/Arflox/lox;GPC1−/− mice exhibited attenuated pancreatic tumor growth and invasiveness, decreased cancer cell proliferation and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. These mice also exhibited suppressed angiogenesis in conjunction with decreased expression of messenger RNAs encoding several pro-angiogenic factors and molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), SRY-box containing gene (SOX17), chemokine C-X3-C motif ligand 1 (CX3CL1) and integrin β3 (ITGB3). Moreover, pancreatic cancer cells isolated from the tumors of GPC1−/− mice were not as invasive in response to fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) as cancer cells isolated from wild-type mice, and formed smaller tumors that exhibited an attenuated metastatic potential. Similarly, VEGF-A and FGF-2 did not enhance the migration of hepatic endothelial cells and immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts isolated from GPC1 null mice. These data demonstrate in an oncogenic Kras-driven genetic mouse model of PDAC that tumor growth, angiogenesis and invasion are enhanced by GPC1, and suggest that suppression of GPC1 may be an important component of therapeutic strategies in PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W1970496814,"Therapies for Alzheimer disease that reduce the production of pathogenic amyloid β (Aβ) peptides have been associated with a range of unwanted effects. For this reason, alternative strategies that promote the clearance of the peptide by preventing its aggregation and deposition in the brain have been favored. In this context we have studied doxycycline, a member of the tetracycline family of antibiotics that has shown neuroprotective effects in a number of models of neurodegenerative disease. We investigated the neuroprotective potential of doxycycline in a Drosophila model of Aβ toxicity and sought to correlate any effects with the aggregation state of the peptide. We found that administration of doxycycline to Aβ42-expressing flies did not improve their lifespan but was able to slow the progression of their locomotor deficits. We also measured the rough eye phenotype of transgenic flies expressing the E22G variant of Aβ42 and showed that doxycycline administration partially rescued the toxicity of Aβ in the developing eye. We correlated these in vivo effects with in vitro observations using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and thioflavin T binding. We found that doxycycline prevents Aβ fibrillization and favors the generation of smaller, non-amyloid structures that were non-toxic as determined by the lack of caspase 3 activation in a neuroblastoma cell line. Our confirmation that doxycycline can prevent amyloid β toxicity both in vitro and in vivo supports its therapeutic potential in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2078319463,"Dynamin 2 (Dyn2), a large GTPase, is involved in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-promoted cell migration. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Dyn2 regulates RTK-induced cell migration have not been established. Recently, we reported that tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (SHP-2) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) mediate platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα)-promoted glioma tumor growth and invasion. Here, we show that Dyn2 is an effector downstream of the PDGFRα-PI3K/SHP-2 signaling in glioma cells. Depletion of endogenous Dyn2 by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) inhibited PDGFRα-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, Erk1/2, Rac1 and Cdc42 activities, glioma cell migration and survival in vitro and tumor growth and invasion in the brains of mice. Dyn2 binds to SHP-2 and PI3K and colocalizes with PDGFRα at the invasive fronts in PDGF-A-stimulated glioma cells. Inhibition of SHP-2 by siRNA knockdown abrogated Dyn2 association with activated PDGFRα and PDGFRα activation of Rac1 and Cdc42, and glioma cell migration, thereby establishing a link between SHP-2 interaction with Dyn2 and the PDGFRα signaling. Furthermore, a dominant-negative SHP-2 C459S mutant inhibited PDGF-A-stimulated glioma cell migration, phosphorylation of Dyn2 and concomitantly blocked PDGFRα-induced Src activation. Inhibition of Src by Src inhibitors attenuated PDGF-A-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and Dyn2 and glioma cell migration. Additionally, mutations of binding sites to PI3K, SHP-2 or Src of PDGFRα impaired PDGFRα-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and Dyn2, and Dyn2 association with activated PDGFRα. Taken together, this study identifies Dyn2 as an effector that mediates PDGFRα-SHP-2-induced glioma tumor growth and invasion, suggesting that targeting the PDGFRα-SHP-2-Dyn2 pathway may be beneficial to patients with malignant glioblastomas."
https://openalex.org/W2056722854,"Tissue morphogenesis requires intricate temporal and spatial control of gene expression that is executed through specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). GRNs are comprised from individual subcircuits of different levels of complexity. An important question is to elucidate the mutual relationship between those genes encoding DNA-binding factors that trigger the subcircuit with those that play major ""later"" roles during terminal differentiation via expression of specific genes that constitute the phenotype of individual tissues. The ocular lens is a classical model system to study tissue morphogenesis. Pax6 is essential for both lens placode formation and subsequent stages of lens morphogenesis, whereas c-Maf controls terminal differentiation of lens fibers, including regulation of crystallins, key lens structural proteins required for its transparency and refraction. Here, we show that Pax6 directly regulates c-Maf expression during lens development. A 1.3-kb c-Maf promoter with a 1.6-kb upstream enhancer (CR1) recapitulated the endogenous c-Maf expression pattern in lens and retinal pigmented epithelium. ChIP assays revealed binding of Pax6 and c-Maf to multiple regions of the c-Maf locus in lens chromatin. To predict functional Pax6-binding sites, nine novel variants of Pax6 DNA-binding motifs were identified and characterized. Two of these motifs predicted a pair of Pax6-binding sites in the CR1. Mutagenesis of these Pax6-binding sites inactivated transgenic expression in the lens but not in retinal pigmented epithelium. These data establish a novel regulatory role for Pax6 during lens development, link together the Pax6/c-Maf/crystallin regulatory network, and suggest a novel type of GRN subcircuit that controls a major part of embryonic lens development."
https://openalex.org/W2040989753,"Many non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons lack internal promoters and are co-transcribed with their host genes. These transcripts need to be liberated before inserting into new loci. Using structure-based bioinformatics, we show that several classes of retrotransposons in phyla-spanning arthropods, nematodes, and chordates utilize self-cleaving ribozymes of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) family for processing their 5' termini. Ribozyme-terminated retrotransposons include rDNA-specific R2, R4, and R6, telomere-specific SART, and Baggins and RTE. The self-scission of the R2 ribozyme is strongly modulated by the insertion site sequence in the rDNA, with the most common insertion sequences promoting faster processing. The ribozymes also promote translation initiation of downstream open reading frames in vitro and in vivo. In some organisms HDV-like and hammerhead ribozymes appear to be dedicated to processing long and short interspersed elements, respectively. HDV-like ribozymes serve several distinct functions in non-LTR retrotransposition, including 5' processing, translation initiation, and potentially trans-templating."
https://openalex.org/W2094410264,"Cell identity is determined by its gene expression programs. The ability of a cell to change its identity and produce cell types outside its lineage is achieved by the activity of transcription controllers capable of reprogramming differentiation gene networks. The synovial sarcoma (SS)-associated protein, SYT–SSX2, reprograms myogenic progenitors and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) by dictating their commitment to a pro-neural lineage. It fulfills this function by directly targeting an extensive array of neural-specific genes as well as genes of developmental pathway mediators. Concomitantly, the ability of both myoblasts and BMMSCs to differentiate into their normal myogenic and adipogenic lineages was compromised. SS is believed to arise in mesenchymal stem cells where formation of the t(X/18) translocation product, SYT–SSX, constitutes the primary event in the cancer. SYT–SSX is therefore believed to initiate tumorigenesis in its target stem cell. The data presented here allow a glimpse at the initial events that likely occur when SYT–SSX2 is first expressed, and its dominant function in subverting the nuclear program of the stem cell, leading to its aberrant differentiation, as a first step toward transformation. In addition, we identified the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene, Fgfr2, as one occupied and upregulated by SYT–SSX2. Knockdown of FGFR2 in both BMMSCs and SS cells abrogated their growth and attenuated their neural phenotype. These results support the notion that the SYT–SSX2 nuclear function and differentiation effects are conserved throughout sarcoma development and are required for its maintenance beyond the initial phase. They also provide the stem cell regulator, FGFR2, as a promising candidate target for future SS therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2018794234,"Melanoma cells driven by mutant v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (B-RAF) are highly resistant to chemotherapeutic treatments. Recent phase 1 results with PLX4032/RG7204/vemurafenib, which selectively inhibits B-RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling in mutant B-RAF cells, has given encouragement to this struggling field. Nearly all patients in the phase 1–3 studies saw at least some response and the overall response rates ranged from 48 and 81%. However, despite initial tumor shrinkage, most responders in the trial experienced tumor relapse over time. These findings indicate that both intrinsic and acquired resistance may affect the clinical efficacy of PLX4032. It is critical to optimize PLX4032 activity to improve response rates and understand why some patients with the B-RAF mutation do not respond. We have previously shown that the stemness factor, Forkhead box D3 (FOXD3), is upregulated following inhibition of B-RAF–MEK signaling in mutant B-RAF melanoma cells. Here, we show that upregulation of FOXD3 following treatment with PLX4032 and PLX4720 (the non-clinical tool compound for PLX4032) confers resistance to cell death. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of FOXD3 significantly enhanced the cell death response after PLX4032/4720 treatment in mutant B-RAF melanoma cell lines. Additionally, upregulation of FOXD3 after PLX4720 treatment was attenuated in non-adherent conditions and correlated with enhanced cell death. Ectopic expression of FOXD3 in non-adherent cells significantly reduced cell death in response to PLX4720 treatment. Together, these data indicate that upregulation of FOXD3 is an adaptive response to RAF inhibitors that promotes a state of drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2019098437,"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is activated by cigarette smoke. Previously, we demonstrated that AhR is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinomas (ADs). In this study we observed that AhR expression is significantly correlated with nuclear RelA (a nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) subunit) and cytosolic interleukin-6 (IL-6) in 200 non-small cell lung cancer patients, especially among never smokers. Overexpression of AhR increased IL-6 expression in H1355 cells and immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B. As NFκB inhibitor and knockdown RelA expression greatly reduced constitutive AhR-induced IL-6 expression, we hypothesized that AhR expression, in the absence of exogenous ligand, is able to modulate NFκB activity and subsequently upregulate IL-6 expression, thus promoting the development of lung AD. Specifically, AhR overexpression significantly increased NFκB activity, whereas interference with AhR expression significantly reduced NFκB activity and IL-6 expression in H1355 cells. We demonstrated that AhR associates with RelA in the cytosol and nucleus of human lung cells. Furthermore, AhR overexpression enhanced nuclear localization of AhR and RelA, and increased the association of AhR–RelA with the NFκB response element of the IL-6 promoter. However, p50 was not involved. Our results indicate that AhR, without exposure to a ligand, associates with RelA, which then positively modulates NFκB activity and then upregulates IL-6 expression in human lung cells. Thus we have identified a new mechanism for lung tumorigenesis in non-smokers."
https://openalex.org/W2066845132,"Hormonally regulated survival factors can have an important role in breast cancer. Here we elucidate G1P3, a survival protein induced by interferons (IFNs), as a target of estrogen signaling and a contributor to poor outcomes in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Compared with normal breast tissue, G1P3 was upregulated in the malignant epithelium (50 × higher) and was induced by estrogen ex vivo. In accord with its overexpression in early stages of breast cancer (hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ), in morphogenesis assays G1P3 enhanced the survival of MCF10A acinar luminal cells causing hyperplasia by suppressing detachment-induced loss of mitochondrial potential and apoptosis (anoikis). In cells undergoing anoikis, G1P3 attenuated the induction of Bim protein, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family and reversed the downmodulation of Bcl-2 protein. Downregulation of G1P3 induced spontaneous apoptosis in BT-549 breast cancer cells and significantly reduced the growth of ER+ breast cancer cell MCF7 (P⩽0.01), further suggesting its prosurvival activity. In agreement with its induction by estrogen, G1P3 antagonized tamoxifen, an inhibitor of ER in MCF7 cells. More importantly, elevated expression of G1P3 was significantly associated with decreased relapse-free and overall survival in ER+ breast cancer patients (P⩽0.01). Our studies suggest that elevated expression of G1P3 may perturb canonical tumor-suppressing activity of IFNs partly by affecting the balance of pro- and antiapoptotic members of Bcl-2 family proteins, leading to breast cancer development and resistance to therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2013327815,"Tetrahydrofolates are essential cofactors for DNA synthesis and methionine metabolism. Malaria parasites are capable both of synthesizing tetrahydrofolates and precursors de novo and of salvaging them from the environment. The biosynthetic route has been studied in some detail over decades, whereas the molecular mechanisms that underpin the salvage pathway lag behind. Here we identify two functional folate transporters (named PfFT1 and PfFT2) and delineate unexpected substrate preferences of the folate salvage pathway in Plasmodium falciparum. Both proteins are localized in the plasma membrane and internal membranes of the parasite intra-erythrocytic stages. Transport substrates include folic acid, folinic acid, the folate precursor p-amino benzoic acid (pABA), and the human folate catabolite pABAG(n). Intriguingly, the major circulating plasma folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, was a poor substrate for transport via PfFT2 and was not transported by PfFT1. Transport of all folates studied was inhibited by probenecid and methotrexate. Growth rescue in Escherichia coli and antifolate antagonism experiments in P. falciparum indicate that functional salvage of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is detectable but trivial. In fact pABA was the only effective salvage substrate at normal physiological levels. Because pABA is neither synthesized nor required by the human host, pABA metabolism may offer opportunities for chemotherapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2027970403,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) consists of a catalytic subunit p110γ, which forms mutually exclusive dimers with one of the regulatory subunits called p101 and p84/p87PIKAP. Recently, PI3Kγ emerged as being a potential oncogene because overexpression of the catalytic subunit p110γ or the regulatory subunit p101 leads to oncogenic cellular transformation and malignancy. However, the contribution of the individual subunits to tumor growth and metastasis and the mechanisms involved are not understood. We therefore individually knocked down the PI3Kγ subunits (p84, p101 and p110γ) in MDA-MB-231 cells, which reduced in vitro migration of the cell lines. Knockdown of p110γ or p101 inhibited apoptosis, Akt phosphorylation and lung colonization in SCID mice. Similarly, the knockdown of p110γ and p101 in murine epithelial carcinoma 4T1.2 cells inhibited primary tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis, as well as lung colonization. In contrast, knockdown of p84 in MDA-MB-231 cells enhanced Akt phosphorylation and lung colonization. These findings are the first to implicate differential functions of the two PI3Kγ regulatory subunits in the process of oncogenesis, and indicate that loss of p101 is sufficient to reduce in vivo tumor growth and metastasis to the same extent as that of p110γ."

In this current study we demonstrate that curcumin activates LKB1 and decreases the cellular ATP level that activates AMPK. Activation of AMPK in turn leads to the induction of SMILE gene expression. Through its bZIP domain, SMILE specifically interacts with CREBH and not with ATF6 and inhibits CREBH transcriptional activity via competition with co-activator PGC1α, thereby highlighting a novel mechanism of differential repressive action of curcumin on ER stress-regulated genes.

HepG2 (human hepatoma cell line) cells were treated with tunicamycin followed by Western blot analysis. A significant increase of the active form of both CREBH and ATF6 protein level was observed after tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 1A). It was previously reported that tunicamycin, through CREBH and ATF6, regulates hepcidin and GRP78 gene transcription, respectively (23Vecchi C. Montosi G. Zhang K. Lamberti I. Duncan S.A. Kaufman R.J. Pietrangelo A. Science. 2009; 325: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 26Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol.

HepG2 cells were infected with adenovirus CREBH shRNA (Ad-shCREBH) and adenovirus dominant negative ATF6 cDNA (Ad-dnATF6) to knock down endogenous CREBH and to block endogenous ATF6, respectively. Tunicamycin-mediated induction of both hepcidin and GRP78 gene transcription was significantly diminished after CREBH and ATF6 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 1B). According to previous reports, tunicamycin activated hepcidin promoter (23Vecchi C. Montosi G. Zhang K. Lamberti I. Duncan S.A. Kaufman R.J. Pietrangelo A. Science. 2009; 325: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and GRP78 promoter (26Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar).To evaluate the potential role of curcumin on hepcidin and GRP78 promoter activity, a transient transfection assay was performed in HepG2 cells with hepcidin and GRP78 promoter. Curcumin treatment significantly decreased tunicamycin-stimulated hepcidin promoter activity, although no significant change was observed for GRP78 promoter activity after curcumin treatment (Fig. 1C). To further elucidate the role of curcumin in hepcidin and GRP78 gene transcription, HepG2 cells were treated with tunicamycin followed by curcumin treatment. Curcumin significantly decreased tunicamycin-stimulated hepcidin expression at the mRNA level, whereas no significant change in GRP78 mRNA level was observed after curcumin treatment (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that curcumin represses CREBH-stimulated gene transcription but not ATF6-mediated gene transcription. In the aforementioned results, it was clear that curcumin inhibits CREBH target gene transcription but not ATF6 target gene transcription. To assess whether curcumin has any role in controlling the transactivation of the transcription factors, CREBH and ATF6, a transient transfection assay was performed in HepG2 cells with hepcidin or GRP78 promoter along with CREBH or ATF6 expression vector followed by curcumin treatment. Curcumin significantly inhibited transactivation of CREBH on hepcidin promoter, although no significant inhibition of ATF6 transactivation on GRP78 promoter was observed (Fig. 2A). To confirm this differential regulatory effect of curcumin on CREBH and ATF6 transactivation, a reporter gene containing multiple copies of the an ATF6 binding site, 5X-ATF6-Luc (activated by both CREBH and ATF6), was used along with CREBH and ATF6 expression vector in a transient transfection assay in HepG2 cells. As expected from the previous results, curcumin significantly inhibited CREBH-mediated transactivation of the reporter gene, whereas no inhibition was noted for ATF6 transactivation (Fig. 2B). To further confirm these results, transient transfection was performed with Gal4-tk-Luc in HepG2 cells. Consistent with the previous findings, activation of the reporter gene by CREBH, but not by ATF6, was significantly repressed by curcumin, and no such inhibitory effect of curcumin was observed for ATF6 transactivation of the reporter gene (Fig. 2C). Next, to determine whether curcumin controls the hepcidin and GRP78 gene transcription, HepG2 cells were infected with adenovirus CREBH (Ad-CREBH) and adenovirus ATF6 (Ad-ATF6) followed by curcumin treatment. Ad-CREBH-mediated overexpression of hepcidin gene was significantly inhibited by curcumin, whereas curcumin treatment had no significant effect on Ad-ATF6-mediated overexpression of GRP78 gene transcription (Fig. 2D). Overall, these results suggest that curcumin specifically inhibits ER-bound transcription factor CREBH-mediated transactivation of its target gene but not ATF6- mediated transactivation. The inhibition of transcription factors by transcriptional co-repressors is a well known phenomenon in cellular systems. DAX1, SMILE, and SHP are notable transcriptional co-repressors that were previously reported to be involved in the cellular repression of transcription factors (13Xie Y.B. Nedumaran B. Choi H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4100-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Nedumaran B. Hong S. Xie Y.B. Kim Y.H. Seo W.Y. Lee M.W. Lee C.H. Koo S.H. Choi H.S. J. Biol.

To assess the role of these transcriptional co- repressors in our current study, a reporter assay was performed with the reporter gene, 5X-ATF6-Luc, and vectors expressing CREBH or ATF6 along with the co-repressor expression vectors listed above. We observed that among DAX1, SMILE, and SHP, only SMILE could significantly inhibit transcriptional activity of CREBH, and of great interest, SMILE did not repress ATF6 transactivity in a similar way as curcumin (Fig. 3A, left panel). To confirm this result, the transcriptional activities of SMILE, DAX1, and SHP were further investigated (Fig. 3A, right panel). The reporter plasmid Gal4-tk-Luc and indicated expression vectors encoding Gal4-DBD alone, Gal4-CREBH, or Gal4-ATF6 were cotransfected with the expression vectors of SMILE, DAX1, and SHP into HepG2 cells. As expected, only SMILE significantly repressed CREBH transactivity. As SMILE was found to be involved in the repression of CREBH transactivity, we next investigated whether SMILE could repress CREBH transactivity on the hepcidin promoter. A transient transfection assay was performed with hepcidin promoter along with CREBH and SMILE expression vector in HepG2 cells. Results clearly demonstrated that SMILE significantly inhibits CREBH transactivation on hepcidin promoter (Fig. 3B). To investigate the effect of SMILE overexpression on CREBH and ATF6 target gene transcription, HepG2 cells were infected with Ad-CREBH or Ad-ATF6 alone or with adenovirus expressing SMILE, Ad-SMILE. Interestingly Ad-SMILE significantly repressed Ad-CREBH-induced hepcidin mRNA levels (Fig. 3C, left panel), whereas Ad-SMILE had no significant effect on Ad-ATF6-induced GRP78 mRNA levels (Fig. 3C, right panel). As the results clearly indicated that SMILE could be involved in the inhibitory effect of curcumin on CREBH, we investigated the effect of curcumin on CREBH transactivation after knocking down the endogenous SMILE by siRNA (siSMILE). A transient transfection assay was performed in HepG2 cells with the reporter gene, 5X-ATF6-Luc, along with CREBH and siSMILE expression vectors. As expected, after knocking down endogenous SMILE, curcumin no longer inhibited the transcriptional activity of CREBH on the reporter gene (Fig. 3D). These results clearly demonstrate the involvement of SMILE as a co-repressor in curcumin-mediated repression of the transcription factor CREBH. To further verify the involvement of SMILE in the repression of CREBH by curcumin, Ad-FLAG CREBH-N (N, active form of CREBH) was overexpressed in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4A, left and middle panel). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody followed by Western blot analysis with indicated antibodies. We observed that CREBH interacted with endogenous SMILE. Our previous results described that SMILE did not repress ATF6 transactivity. To examin"
https://openalex.org/W2009359346,"A recent genome-wide association study identified the gene encoding lemur tyrosine kinase-2 (LMTK2) as a susceptibility gene for prostate cancer. The identified genetic alteration is within intron 9, but the mechanisms by which LMTK2 may impact upon prostate cancer are not clear because the functions of LMTK2 are poorly understood. Here, we show that LMTK2 regulates a known pathway that controls phosphorylation of kinesin-1 light chain-2 (KLC2) by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). KLC2 phosphorylation by GSK3β induces the release of cargo from KLC2. LMTK2 signals via protein phosphatase-1C (PP1C) to increase inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β on serine-9 that reduces KLC2 phosphorylation and promotes binding of the known KLC2 cargo Smad2. Smad2 signals to the nucleus in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) receptor stimulation and transport of Smad2 by kinesin-1 is required for this signalling. We show that small interfering RNA loss of LMTK2 not only reduces binding of Smad2 to KLC2, but also inhibits TGFβ-induced Smad2 signalling. Thus, LMTK2 may regulate the activity of kinesin-1 motor function and Smad2 signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2023192033,"The Hog1 stress-activated protein kinase regulates both stress responses and morphogenesis in Candida albicans and is essential for the virulence of this major human pathogen. Stress-induced Hog1 phosphorylation is regulated by the upstream MAPKK, Pbs2, which in turn is regulated by the MAPKKK, Ssk2. Here, we have investigated the role of phosphorylation of Hog1 and Pbs2 in Hog1-mediated processes in C. albicans. Mutation of the consensus regulatory phosphorylation sites of Hog1 (Thr-174/Tyr-176) and Pbs2 (Ser-355/Thr-359), to nonphosphorylatable residues, resulted in strains that phenocopied hog1Δ and pbs2Δ cells. Consistent with this, stress-induced phosphorylation of Hog1 was abolished in cells expressing nonphosphorylatable Pbs2 (Pbs2(AA)). However, mutation of the consensus sites of Pbs2 to phosphomimetic residues (Pbs2(DD)) failed to constitutively activate Hog1. Furthermore, Ssk2-independent stress-induced Hog1 activation was observed in Pbs2(DD) cells. Collectively, these data reveal a previously uncharacterized MAPKKK-independent mechanism of Hog1 activation in response to stress. Although Pbs2(DD) cells did not exhibit high basal levels of Hog1 phosphorylation, overexpression of an N-terminal truncated form of Ssk2 did result in constitutive Hog1 activation, which was further increased upon stress. Significantly, both Pbs2(AA) and Pbs2(DD) cells displayed impaired stress resistance and attenuated virulence in a mouse model of disease, whereas only Pbs2(AA) cells exhibited the morphological defects associated with loss of Hog1 function. This indicates that Hog1 mediates C. albicans virulence by conferring stress resistance rather than regulating morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2015118845,"Normal prostate and some malignant prostate cancer (PrCa) cell lines undergo acinar differentiation and form spheroids in three-dimensional (3-D) organotypic culture. Acini formed by PC-3 and PC-3M, less pronounced also in other PrCa cell lines, spontaneously undergo an invasive switch, leading to the disintegration of epithelial structures and the basal lamina, and formation of invadopodia. This demonstrates the highly dynamic nature of epithelial plasticity, balancing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition against metastable acinar differentiation. This study assessed the role of lipid metabolites on epithelial maturation. PC-3 cells completely failed to form acinar structures in delipidated serum. Adding back lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) rescued acinar morphogenesis and repressed invasion effectively. Blocking LPA receptor 1 (LPAR1) functions by siRNA (small interference RNA) or the specific LPAR1 inhibitor Ki16425 promoted invasion, while silencing of other G-protein-coupled receptors responsive to LPA or S1P mainly caused growth arrest or had no effects. The G-proteins Gα(12/13) and Gα(i) were identified as key mediators of LPA signalling via stimulation of RhoA and Rho kinases ROCK1 and 2, activating Rac1, while inhibition of adenylate cyclase and accumulation of cAMP may be secondary. Interfering with these pathways specifically impeded epithelial polarization in transformed cells. In contrast, blocking the same pathways in non-transformed, normal cells promoted differentiation. We conclude that LPA and LPAR1 effectively promote epithelial maturation and block invasion of PrCa cells in 3-D culture. The analysis of clinical transcriptome data confirmed reduced expression of LPAR1 in a subset of PrCa's. Our study demonstrates a metastasis-suppressor function for LPAR1 and Gα(12/13) signalling, regulating cell motility and invasion versus epithelial maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2093254150,"Protein kinase C (PKC)ɛ, a member of the novel PKC family, has key roles in mitogenesis and survival in normal and cancer cells. PKCɛ is frequently overexpressed in epithelial cancers, particularly in lung cancer. Using a short-hairpin RNA approach, here we established that PKCɛ is required for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) growth in vitro as well as tumor growth when inoculated into athymic mice. Moreover, sustained delivery of a PKCɛ-selective inhibitor peptide, ɛV1-2, reduced xenograft growth in mice. Both RNA interference depletion and pharmacological inhibition of PKCɛ caused a marked elevation in the number of apoptotic cells in NSCLC tumors. PKCɛ-depleted NSCLC cells show elevated expression of pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, caspase recruitment domain-containing proteins and tumor necrosis factor ligands/receptor superfamily members. Moreover, a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed that a vast majority of the genes changed in PKCɛ-depleted cells were also deregulated in human NSCLC. Our results strongly suggest that PKCɛ is required for NSCLC cell survival and maintenance of NSCLC tumor growth. Therefore, PKCɛ may represent an attractive therapeutic target for NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2022620717,"Common genetic alteration in cancer genomes is implicated for embracing an aberrant cancer gene participated in tumor progression. In this study, we identified a somatic mutated LIM and cysteine-rich domains-1 (LMCD1) as a putative metastatic oncogene in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using integrated genomic approaches. In addition to revealing genomic amplification and gene upregulation, we identified recurrent E135K (3/48 cases) mutations in HCC tissues and K237R mutation in the PLC/PRF/5 HCC cell line. Expression of mutant LMCD1 E135K or K237R reduced the stress fiber assembly, increased cortical actin accumulation and induced lamellipodial extension. Consistently, these mutations enhanced cell migration and showed activation of the Rac1-signaling pathway. Inhibition of the LMCD1/Rac1 pathway by an LMCD1 short-hairpin RNA (shLMCD1) or the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 suppressed the mutation-mediated lamellipodial protrusion and cell migration. In PLC/PRF/5 cells with endogenous K237R mutation, cell migration was enhanced by estrogen-induced LMCD1 expression but reversed by shLMCD1 treatment. Moreover, overexpression of LMCD1 E135K mutation significantly promoted systemic lung metastasis in a murine tail vein injection model. Together, our results suggest that LMCD1 mutations are potential oncogenic events in HCC metastasis to promote cell migration through the Rac1-signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1998855859,"Most studies on heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) have focused on the involvement of Hsp90 in the interphase, whereas the role of this protein in the nucleus during mitosis remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that the level of the acetylated form of Hsp90 decreased dramatically during mitosis, which indicates more chaperone activity during mitosis. We thus probed proteins that interacted with Hsp90 by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and found that nucleolin was one of those interacting proteins during mitosis. The nucleolin level decreased upon geldanamycin treatment, and Hsp90 maintained the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity to phosphorylate nucleolin at Thr-641/707. Mutation of Thr-641/707 resulted in the destabilization of nucleolin in mitosis. We globally screened the level of mitotic mRNAs and found that 229 mRNAs decreased during mitosis in the presence of geldanamycin. Furthermore, a bioinformatics tool and an RNA immunoprecipitation assay found that 16 mRNAs, including cadherin and Bcl-xl, were stabilized through the recruitment of nucleolin to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of those genes. Overall, strong correlations exist between the up-regulation of Hsp90, nucleolin, and the mRNAs related to tumorigenesis of the lung. Our findings thus indicate that nucleolin stabilized by Hsp90 contributes to the lung tumorigenesis by increasing the level of many tumor-related mRNAs during mitosis. Most studies on heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) have focused on the involvement of Hsp90 in the interphase, whereas the role of this protein in the nucleus during mitosis remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that the level of the acetylated form of Hsp90 decreased dramatically during mitosis, which indicates more chaperone activity during mitosis. We thus probed proteins that interacted with Hsp90 by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and found that nucleolin was one of those interacting proteins during mitosis. The nucleolin level decreased upon geldanamycin treatment, and Hsp90 maintained the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity to phosphorylate nucleolin at Thr-641/707. Mutation of Thr-641/707 resulted in the destabilization of nucleolin in mitosis. We globally screened the level of mitotic mRNAs and found that 229 mRNAs decreased during mitosis in the presence of geldanamycin. Furthermore, a bioinformatics tool and an RNA immunoprecipitation assay found that 16 mRNAs, including cadherin and Bcl-xl, were stabilized through the recruitment of nucleolin to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of those genes. Overall, strong correlations exist between the up-regulation of Hsp90, nucleolin, and the mRNAs related to tumorigenesis of the lung. Our findings thus indicate that nucleolin stabilized by Hsp90 contributes to the lung tumorigenesis by increasing the level of many tumor-related mRNAs during mitosis. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), 2The abbreviations used are: Hsp90heat shock protein 90GAgeldanamycinIPimmunoprecipitationCIPcalf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. a constituent molecular chaperone, is an abundant protein comprising 2% of the total cellular protein content under non-stress conditions. This protein is essential for many cellular proteins, including transcription factors, protein kinases, and nitric-oxide synthase, that are known to regulate signal transduction. It is also involved in various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Unlike Hsp70, Hsp90 does not typically act for nascent protein folding; instead, it binds to its binding proteins to stabilize protein folding (6Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4438) Google Scholar, 7Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Hsp90 reveals that the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 binds adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), which is consistent with the observation that ATP hydrolysis is required for conformational changes involved in the refolding of protein substrates or the binding proteins of Hsp90 (8Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin (GA), which is a benzoquinone ansamycin, a radicicol, and a macrocyclic anti-fungal antibiotic, competes for the ATP-binding site on Hsp90 to inhibit its activity (9Hubert D.A.

Hsp90 resides primarily in the cell cytoplasm and forms a major functional component of an important cytoplasmic chaperone complex (11Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). However, Hsp90 has also been found inside the cell nucleus and outside of cells in stressed, unstressed, and cancer cells (12Gething M.J. Sambrook J.

Most investigations of nuclear Hsp90 focus on how the protein shifts the glucocorticoid receptor into the nucleus and subsequently regulates its nuclear retention (15Sanchez E.R. Hirst M.

Nucleolin is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein in eukaryotes (18Mongelard F. Bouvet P. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 80-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It is most abundant in the cell nucleus, where it participates in mRNA regulation (19Sengupta T.K. Bandyopadhyay S. Fernandes D.J. Spicer E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10855-10863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, it is also found in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm and is involved in numerous other cellular processes, including cell growth, cytokinesis, neurogenesis, transcription, signal transduction, apoptosis, induction of chromatin condensation, mRNA regulation, and replication (18Mongelard F.

This diversity in the biological functions of nucleolin apparently results from its complex protein structure. Specifically, nucleolin contains three structure domains: (i) the highly acidic residues and a nuclear localization signal localize in the N terminus; (ii) four ribonucleoprotein RNA binding domains localize in the middle of nucleolin; and (iii) the C-terminal domain, containing arginine-glycine-glycine repeats (RGGs) participates in interactions with ribosomal proteins (22Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although several specific mRNAs, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, are reported to be protected by nucleolin recruitment (25Ishimaru D. Zuraw L. Ramalingam S. Sengupta T.K. Bandyopadhyay S. Reuben A. Fernandes D.J. Spicer E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27182-27191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), more mRNAs affected by the nucleolin need to be further addressed. Many genes, such as oncogenes, cytokine, and cell cycle genes, are regulated through the post-transcription stage. One of the major mechanisms of regulation is modulation of the mRNA stability (26Khabar K.S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 2937-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Steinman R.A. Leukemia. 2007; 21: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several factors, such as HuR and nucleolin, increase mRNA stability via their recruitment to the 3′-UTR of mRNA (20Zhang J. Tsaprailis G. Bowden G.T. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1046-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Abdelmohsen K. Lal A. Kim H.H. Gorospe M.

Bhatia D. Xia H. Castranova V. Shi X. Chen F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, numerous microRNAs control the RNA stability by their recruitment to 3′-UTR (31Fabian M.R. Sonenberg N. Filipowicz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 351-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar). Most of the 3′-UTRs acquire a poly(A) tail, which plays a critical role in gene expression associated with many processes, including mRNA stability, translocation, and translation (32Barabino S.M. Keller W. Cell. 1999; 99: 9-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). A large number of proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, nucleolin, and cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), associate with this machinery to regulate both the efficiency and specificity of mRNA expression, and they modulate its interaction with other nuclear events (20Zhang J.

In this study, we found that Hsp90 could protect nucleolin from degradation and thus facilitates the nucleolin phosphorylation by CDK1. We also identified many mRNAs binding to nucleolin in mitosis.

ATP and alkaline phosphatase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was purchased from GE Healthcare (Baie d'Urfe, Canada). Glutathione-agarose beads were from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemical reagents used were of the highest purity obtainable. Human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells and lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were grown in 90% DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an incubator. Human lung embryonic fibroblasts, IMR-90 cell line, were grown in 90% minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an incubator. Cell extracts were prepared, and the protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. An equal amount of protein was used in each experiment. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes and incubated with anti-Hsp90 antibodies at a dilution of 1:200 at 4 °C for 12 h. The immunoprecipitated pellets were subsequently incubated with protein G-Sepharose, washed three times with lysis buffer, and separated on SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were processed for immunoblotting with anti-nucleolin (1:2000), anti-Hsp90 (1:2000) and anti-CDK1 (1:2000) antibodies. The immunoprecipitated proteins were finally eluted from the beads by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The eluted proteins were dialyzed for an additional 16 h against a dialysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). One milligram of the eluted proteins was reduced with 5 mm dithiothreitol (65 °C, 1 h) and then alkylated with 15 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Before tryptic digestion, 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer was added. For in-solution digestion, trypsin was added to the protein mixture at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w) at 37 °C for 16 h. Buffer A (95% H2O, 4.9% aceotonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) was added to stop the effect of trypsin, and then the peptide mixture was dried with a high speed low temperature centrifuge. The pellet was stored at −20 °C and dissolved with buffer A to analyze by LC/MS/MS. The dried hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography fractions were reconstituted in 10 μl of buffer C (0.2% formic acid in deionized H2O) and analyzed by LTQ Orbitrap XL (San Jose, CA). Reverse phase nano-LC separation was performed on an Agilent 1200 series nanoflow system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A total of 8 μl of sample from each hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography fraction was loaded onto an Agilent Zorbax XDB C18 precolumn (inner diameter 0.3 × 5 mm, 5 μm), followed by separation using a C18 column (inner diameter 0.075 × 250 mm, 3 μm) from Micro Tech (Fontana). Buffer C was 0.1% folic acid, and buffer solution D was 0.1% folic acid in 98% acetonitrile. A linear gradient from 5 to 35% D over a 170-min period at a flow rate of 300 nl/min was applied. The peptides were analyzed in the positive ion mode by electrospray ionization (spray voltage = 1.8 kV). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode, in which one full scan was performed with m/z 300–2000 in the Orbitrap (resolution = 60,000 at m/z 400) using a rate of 30 ms/scan. The five most intense peaks for fragmentation with a normalized collision energy value of 35% in the LTQ were selected. A repeat duration of 30 s was applied to exclude the same m/z ions from the reselection for fragmentation. Peptide/protein identification was first performed with the Mascot search engine (available on the Matrix Science Web site). HeLa cells were seeded onto glass slides overnight and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C for 15 min. The cells were then rinsed with PBS two times and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 7 min. Next, the cells were pretreated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS at 25 °C for 60 min, incubated with rabbit anti-nucleolin polyclonal antibodies and mouse anti-Hsp90 monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:200 for 1 h, and treated with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) polyclonal antibodies and cyanine 5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) at a dilution of 1:250 for 1 h. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS, mounted in 90% glycerol containing DAPI, and analyzed using an immunofluorescence microscope (Personal DV Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) with deconvolution function (softWORX). Total RNA of cells was isolated with a TRIzol RNA extraction kit, and 3 mg of RNA was subjected to RT-PCR with SuperScript III. The primers used to perform PCR for nucleolin were 5′-ATGGTGAAGCTCGCGAAGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATCCTCCTCTTCATCACTGT-3′ (antisense), and primers used to perform PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-CCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′ (antisense). PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Cells (2.5 × 105) were seeded on a 3.5-cm dish and were then transfected when they reached 40–50% confluence with plasmids by using Lipofectamine 2000 in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. For use in transfection, 1 mg of GFP, GFP-nucleolin plasmids, or shRNA-Hsp90 was combined with 1 ml of Lipofectamine 2000 in 200 ml of Opti-MEM medium without serum and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were transfected by changing the medium with 2 ml of Opti-MEM medium containing the plasmids and Lipofectamine 2000 and then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 h. After change of Opti-MEM medium to 2 ml of fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were incubated for an additional 18 h. RNA interference vectors used in this study were obtained from the National RNAi Core Facility in the Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica (Taipei, Taiwan) as follows: pLKO.1-shRNA-Hsp90–2# (target sequence, 5′-CGCATGATCAAGCTAGGTCTA-3′); pLKO.1-shRNA-Hsp90–4# (target sequence, 5′-CCAACTCATGTCCCTCATCAT-3′); pLKO.1-shRNA-Hsp90–5# (target sequence, 5′-GCAGTAAACTAAGGGTGTCAA-3′); pLKO.1-shRNA-nucleolin-1# (target sequence, 5′-GCGATCTATTTCCCTGTACTA-3′); pLKO.1-shRNA-nucleolin-3# (target sequence, 5′-CCTTGGAAATCCGTCTAGTTA-3′). Mitotic cells were collected by incubating HeLa cells in complete medium with 45 ng/ml nocodazole at 37 °C, and the cells were collected after different time intervals (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h) and then prepared for immunoblotting. For another kind of cell synchronization, mitotic cells were collected by incubating HeLa cells in complete medium with 45 ng/ml nocodazole at 37 °C for 16 h. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and added with fresh medium. The releasing cells were then collected after different time intervals (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h) and lysed in RIPA buffer as described above. Equal amounts of proteins from these cell extracts were analyzed using immunoblotting. For in vitro dephosphorylation of nucleolin, the mitotic cell extracts were combined with 10 units of alkaline phosphatase in CIP buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in CIP buffer, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. pEGFP-nucleolin contained the cDNA of full-length nucleolin transcribed from the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. The pGEX6-nucleolin was constructed to express GST-nucleolin in Escherichia coli. Various nucleolin mutants, pEGFP-nucleolin (T641A/T707A) and pEGFP-nucleolin (T641D/T707D), were constructed using a PCR mutagenesis method. To purify GST-nucleolin, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were cultured to mid-log phase in 200 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (50 mg/ml). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were harvested 4 h after the treatment, suspended in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm leupeptin), and homogenized using sonication for 1 min. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with 0.2 ml of glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were washed five times with buffer A, and the GST fusion proteins were finally eluted from the beads by adding buffer A containing 20 mm glutathione. The eluted GST fusion proteins were dialyzed for an additional 16 h against a dialysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The dialyzed GST fusion proteins were then stored at −80 °C until use. For the in vitro phosphorylation analysis, full-length nucleolin protein was prepared from HeLa cells by using immunoprecipitation with anti-nucleolin antibodies, and the different GST-nucleolin fragments and the point mutations of nucleolin were purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3). These different Sp1 proteins and active CDK1 were used to examine nucleolin phosphorylation in vitro. Each reaction (20 ml) contained 1 mg of purified nucleolin, 15 ng of CDK1-cyclin B, 2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), 1 mm ATP, and 3 μl of 5× kinase buffer containing 500 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The phosphorylation reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. After the incubation, one-half of the reaction was added to 10 μl of 2× electrophoresis sampling buffer, which was then heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins in the mixtures were immediately separated using SDS-PAGE, followed by drying and autoradiography. HeLa cells were grown to 70% confluence and lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 unit/ml RNaseOUT) for 20 min on ice. The cell extract was incubated with nucleolin antibodies (MS-3) and protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound RNAs were extracted by TRIzol reagent. The levels of mRNAs were detected by RT-PCR. Heat maps were drawn using the image function. The color coding is derived using the ranking of the raw data in the distribution of measures for that sample. Shades of blue represent down-regulation, and shades of red represent up-regulation. The intensity of the color was determined by the distance (in S.D. values) from the mean of the trimmed distribution. K-Ras-derived lung tumor excised from bitransgenic mice or clinical resected specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffer formalin for 24 h, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 mm) were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). For immunohistochemistry, sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanols. Endogenous peroxidases were blocked by 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 30 min. Sections blocked by 3% BSA in PBS were incubated with appropriate diluted primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The immunal reactivity was visualized with a Vectastain ABC kit from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Although most previous studies on Hsp90 have focused on its role in interphase (3Kimmins S. MacRae T.H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), our previous studies found that Hsp90 is also important for Sp1 stability during mitosis by affecting the phosphorylation of Sp1 (17Wang S.A. Chuang J.Y. Yeh S.H. Wang Y.T. Liu Y.W. Chang W.C. Hung J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 1106-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Due to the acetylation, Hsp90 can decrease its chaperone activity (36Kovacs J.J. Murphy P.J. Gaillard S. Zhao X. Wu J.T. Nicchitta C.V. Yoshida M. Toft D.O. Pratt W.B. Yao T.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 601-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). In the present study, we first checked the acetylation level of Hsp90 during interphase and mitosis (Fig. 1A). Results revealed that the acetylation of Hsp90 dramatically decreased in mitosis compared with that seen in interphase, which indicated that Hsp90 possessed more chaperone activity in mitosis. To further study the role of Hsp90 in mitosis, we also probed the Hsp90-interacting proteins in interphase and in mitosis with mass spectrometry. Immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments were carried out using anti-Hsp90 antibodies to probe the interacting proteins of the lysates prepared from interphase and mitosis. More than 100 proteins were identified with the LC/MS-ObiTrap mass spectrometry and were then analyzed using Ingenuity to define the functional groupings of those interacting proteins (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, many interacting proteins were related to chaperones, the cytoskeleton, mRNA processing, cell adhesion, methyltransferases, and glutamyltransferases in either interphasic or mitotic cells, but the repertoires were very different. Because different nucleolin isoforms, including cDNA FLJ45706 fis, nucleolin, and putative uncharacterized protein NCL, were probed in mitosis, we decided to focus on nucleolin to study the role of Hsp90 in nucleolin. To confirm the data generated from mass spectrometry, an IP assay was performed to study the interaction between Hsp90 and nucleolin (Fig. 1B). Those results indicated that no interaction signal was found in interphase, but it indeed was present in mitosis. Furthermore, we also employed immunofluorescence to observe the localization of nucleolin and Hsp90 during the cell cycle (Fig. 1C). Data showed that the genome was more relaxed during interphase compared with other stages of the cell cycle and that the nucleolin was prominently localized at the outer layer of nucleoli and was present at a lower concentration throughout the nucleoplasm (Fig. 1C, a1 and c1); however, almost all Hsp90 remained in the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 1C, b1). Therefore, the interaction between nucleolin and Hsp90 was not obvious in the interphase stages (Fig. 1C, d1). When the cell cycle entered the prophase stage, the genome was condensed, the nuclear membrane and nucleoli were disrupted, and the nucleolin began to disperse throughout the cell and ultimately localized at the chromosome periphery (Fig. 1C, a2 and c2). In this stage, both nucleolin and Hsp90 significantly colocalized (Fig. 1C, d2). During metaphase, the chromosomes were packaged more tightly and aligned in the center area of the cell. During this phase, both nucleolin and Hsp90 were significantly colocalized around the tightly packaged chromosomes (Fig. 1C, a3, b3, c3, and d3). Subsequently, the chromosomes began to separate into two parts during anaphase (Fig. 1C, a4), and both nucleolin and Hsp90 remained colocalization (Fig. 1C, b4, c4, and d4). When two daughter cells separated during telophase, nucleolin and Hsp90 were slightly colocalized with each other (Fig. 1C, a5, b5, c5, and d5). Until the interphase stage, when two daughter cells were formed completely, nucleolin colocalized with the genome and remained in the nucleoli; however, Hsp90 was distributed within the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C, a6, b6, c6, and d6). These results indicated that Hsp90 was prominently colocalized with nucleolin during mitosis.TABLE 1Hsp90-interacting proteins in interphasic and mitotic cellsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)* Protein was interacted with Hsp90 in both interphase and mitosis.

Here, we show that all apoptosis-stimulating proteins of p53 (ASPP) family members can bind protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) via two distinct interacting motifs. ASPP2 interacts with PP1 through an RVXF PP1 binding motif, whereas the inhibitory member of the ASPP family (iASPP) interacts with PP1 via a noncanonical motif (RNYF) that is located within its Src homology 3 domain (SH3). Phe-815 is crucial in mediating iASPP/PP1 interaction, and iASPP(F815A) fails to inhibit the transcriptional and apoptotic function of p53. This study identifies iASPP as a new binding partner of PP1, interacting through a noncanonical PP1 binding motif."
https://openalex.org/W2041205704,"Reciprocal interactions between Src family kinases (SFKs) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are critical during changes in cell attachment. Recently it has been recognized that another SFK substrate, CUB-domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1), is differentially phosphorylated during these events. However, the molecular processes underlying SFK-mediated phosphorylation of CDCP1 are poorly understood. Here we identify a novel mechanism in which FAK tyrosine 861 and CDCP1-Tyr-734 compete as SFK substrates and demonstrate cellular settings in which SFKs switch between these sites. Our results show that stable CDCP1 expression induces robust SFK-mediated phosphorylation of CDCP1-Tyr-734 with concomitant loss of p-FAK-Tyr-861 in adherent HeLa cells. SFK substrate switching in these cells is dependent on the level of expression of CDCP1 and is also dependent on CDCP1-Tyr-734 but is independent of CDCP1-Tyr-743 and -Tyr-762. In HeLa CDCP1 cells, engagement of SFKs with CDCP1 is accompanied by an increase in phosphorylation of Src-Tyr-416 and a change in cell morphology to a fibroblastic appearance dependent on CDCP1-Tyr-734. SFK switching between FAK-Tyr-861 and CDCP1-Tyr-734 also occurs during changes in adhesion of colorectal cancer cell lines endogenously expressing these two proteins. Consistently, increased p-FAK-Tyr-861 levels and a more epithelial morphology are seen in colon cancer SW480 cells silenced for CDCP1. Unlike protein kinase Cδ, FAK does not appear to form a trimeric complex with Src and CDCP1. These data demonstrate novel aspects of the dynamics of SFK-mediated cell signaling that may be relevant during cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2042248859,"The first step in the synthesis of the bicyclic rings of D-biotin is mediated by 8-amino-7-oxononanoate (AON) synthase, which catalyzes the decarboxylative condensation of l-alanine and pimelate thioester. We found that the Aspergillus nidulans AON synthase, encoded by the bioF gene, is a peroxisomal enzyme with a type 1 peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1). Localization of AON to the peroxisome was essential for biotin synthesis because expression of a cytosolic AON variant or deletion of pexE, encoding the PTS1 receptor, rendered A. nidulans a biotin auxotroph. AON synthases with PTS1 are found throughout the fungal kingdom, in ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, and members of basal fungal lineages but not in representatives of the Saccharomyces species complex, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A. nidulans mutants defective in the peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase AoxA or the multifunctional protein FoxA showed a strong decrease in colonial growth rate in biotin-deficient medium, whereas partial growth recovery occurred with pimelic acid supplementation. These results indicate that pimeloyl-CoA is the in vivo substrate of AON synthase and that it is generated in the peroxisome via the β-oxidation cycle in A. nidulans and probably in a broad range of fungi. However, the β-oxidation cycle is not essential for biotin synthesis in S. cerevisiae or Escherichia coli. These results suggest that alternative pathways for synthesis of the pimelate intermediate exist in bacteria and eukaryotes and that Saccharomyces species use a pathway different from that used by the majority of fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2010634533,"Hsp12 (heat shock protein 12) belongs to the small heat shock protein family, partially characterized as a stress response, stationary phase entry, late embryonic abundant-like protein located at the plasma membrane to protect membrane from desiccation. Here, we report the structural characterization of Hsp12 by NMR and biophysical techniques. The protein was labeled uniformly with nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 so that its conformation could be determined in detail both in aqueous solution and in two membrane-mimetic environments, SDS and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. Secondary structural elements determined from assigned chemical shifts indicated that Hsp12 is dynamically disordered in aqueous solution, whereas it gains four helical stretches in the presence of SDS micelles and a single helix in presence of DPC. These conclusions were reinforced by circular dichroism spectra of the protein in all three environments. The lack of long range interactions in NOESY spectra indicated that the helices present in SDS micelles do not pack together. R(1) and R(2), relaxation and heteronuclear NOE measurements showed that the protein is disordered in aqueous solution but becomes more ordered in presence of detergent micelles. NMR spectra collected in presence of paramagnetic spin relaxation agents (5DSA, 16DSA, and Gd(DTPA-BMA)) indicated that the amphipathic α-helices of Hsp12 in SDS micelles lie on the membrane surface. These observations are in agreement with studies suggesting that Hsp12 functions to protect the membrane from desiccation."

DISC1 forms a functional complex with nuclear distribution element-like protein-1 (NDEL1), a key component that regulates microtubule organization during cell division and neuronal migration. DISC1 polymorphisms at the binding interface of DISC1-NDEL1 complex have been implicated in schizophrenia. However, it is unknown how schizophrenia risk polymorphisms perturb its interaction with NDEL1 and how they change the inherent biochemical properties of DISC1. Here, we characterize the oligomerization and binding property of DISC1 and its natural schizophrenia risk variant, S704C. Our results show that DISC1 forms octamers via dimers as building blocks and directly interacts with tetramers of NDEL1. The schizophrenia risk variant S704C affects the formation of octamers of DISC1 and exhibits higher-order self-oligomerization. However, the observed formation of new oligomeric species did not influence its binding with NDEL1. These results suggest that the improper oligomeric assembly of DISC1-S704C may underlie the observed phenotypic variation due to the polymorphism.

https://openalex.org/W2055349636,"Mutation of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is considered an initiating step in the genesis of the vast majority of colorectal cancers. APC inhibits the Wnt-signaling pathway by targeting the proto-oncogene β-catenin for destruction by cytoplasmic proteasomes. In the presence of a Wnt signal, or in the absence of functional APC, β-catenin can serve as a transcription cofactor for genes required for cell proliferation such as cyclin-D1 and c-Myc. In cultured cells, APC shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with nuclear APC implicated in the inhibition of Wnt target gene expression. Adopting a genetic approach to evaluate the functions of nuclear APC in the context of a whole organism, we generated a mouse model with mutations that inactivate the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of Apc (ApcmNLS). ApcmNLS/mNLS mice are viable and fractionation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from these mice revealed a significant reduction in nuclear Apc as compared with Apc+/+ MEFs. The levels of Apc and β-catenin protein were not significantly altered in small intestinal epithelia from ApcmNLS/mNLS mice. Compared with Apc+/+ mice, ApcmNLS/mNLS mice showed increased proliferation in epithelial cells from the jejunum, ileum and colon. These same tissues from ApcmNLS/mNLS mice showed more mRNA from three genes upregulated in response to canonical Wnt signal, c-Myc, axin-2 and cyclin-D1, and less mRNA from Hath-1, which is downregulated in response to Wnt. These observations suggest a role for nuclear Apc in the inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling and the control of epithelial proliferation in intestinal tissue. Furthermore, we found ApcMin/+ mice, which harbor a mutation that truncates Apc, to have an increased polyp size and multiplicity if they also carry the ApcmNLS allele. Taken together, this analysis of the novel ApcmNLS mouse model supports a role for nuclear Apc in the control of Wnt target genes, intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and polyp formation."
https://openalex.org/W2154354875,"In spermatogenesis, chromatin histones are replaced by arginine-rich protamines to densely compact DNA in sperm heads. Tight packaging is considered necessary to protect the DNA from damage. To better understand the nature of the forces condensing protamine-DNA assemblies and their dependence on amino acid content, the effect of neutral and negatively charged amino acids on DNA-DNA intermolecular forces was studied using model peptides containing six arginines. We have previously observed that the neutral amino acids in salmon protamine decrease the net attraction between protamine-DNA helices compared with the equivalent homo-arginine peptide. Using osmotic stress coupled with x-ray scattering, we have investigated the component attractive and repulsive forces that determine the net attraction and equilibrium interhelical distance as a function of the chemistry, position, and number of the amino acid inserted. Neutral amino acids inserted into hexa-arginine increase the short range repulsion while only slightly affecting longer range attraction. The amino acid content alone of salmon protamine is enough to rationalize the forces that package DNA in sperm heads. Inserting a negatively charged amino acid into hexa-arginine dramatically weakens the net attraction. Both of these observations have biological implications for protamine-DNA packaging in sperm heads."

https://openalex.org/W2007249723,"Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone-5 (Hic-5, or androgen receptor-associated protein 55) is a transforming growth factor-β-inducible LIM protein whose deregulation is implicated in the progression of prostate cancer. Here, we report that Hic-5 binds to Smads 1, 5 and 8, and represses bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling responses. Myc-Hic-5 but not Myc-paxillin was specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG IgG1 from lysates of HEK293 co-transfected with either Myc-Hic-5 or Myc-paxillin and FLAG-tagged Smads 1, 5 or 8. We showed that such interactions require the LIM3 domain of Hic-5 and the MH2 domain of those Smads. Anti-Hic-5 antibody specifically pulled down endogenous Smad1 in both the PC3 human prostate cell line and primary cultures of rat prostate fibroblasts, supporting that Hic-5 binds to Smad1 at the endogenous level. Bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)–Smads 1, 5 or 8, but not GST alone, pulled down in vitro transcribed and translated Hic-5, implicating that Hic-5 binds directly to Smads 1, 5 and 8. Significantly, using Hic-5 small hairpin RNA silencing and overexpression systems, we show that Hic-5 (at both the endogenous and exogenous levels) represses the ability of BMP4 to induce expression of the inhibitor of differentiation-1 (Id1; a downstream target gene of BMP), activate the Id1 gene promoter and induce apoptosis in human and rat prostate epithelial cells. Moreover, silencing of Hic-5 in PC3 cells as well as in the WPMY-1 human prostate stroma cell line greatly enhances the levels of endogenous phospho-Smad1/5/8. Finally, we provide fluorescent microscopic imaging to support that Smad1 and Hic-5 mutually interact also at the level of their nuclear export mechanisms. Collectively, these results provide the first evidence for a physical and mutual functional interaction between Hic-5 and the BMP signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2076837191,"A hallmark of human cancer is heterogeneity, reflecting the complex series of changes resulting in the activation of oncogenes coupled with inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Breast cancer is no exception and indeed, many studies have revealed considerable complexity and heterogeneity in the population of primary breast tumors and substantial changes in a recurrent breast tumor that has acquired metastatic properties and drug resistance. We have made use of a Myc-inducible transgenic mouse model of breast cancer in which elimination of Myc activity following tumor development initially leads to a regression of a subset of tumors generally followed by de novo Myc-independent growth. We have observed that tumors that grow independent of Myc expression have gene profiles that are distinct from the primary tumors with characteristics indicative of an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Phenotypic analyses of Myc-independent tumors confirm the acquisition of an EMT phenotype suggested to be associated with invasive and migratory properties in human cancer cells. Further genomic analyses reveal mouse mammary tumors growing independent of myc have a higher probability of exhibiting a gene signature similar to that observed for human ‘tumor-initiating’ cells. Collectively, the data reveal genetic alterations that underlie tumor progression and an escape from Myc-dependent growth in a transgenic mouse model that can provide insights to what occurs in human cancers as they acquire drug resistance and metastatic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2021742708,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), after secreted from cells, plays a critical role in central and peripheral neuron survival and function. The secretion of GDNF can be either constitutive or regulated by physiological stimuli; however, the detailed mechanism driving GDNF secretion is still unknown. Here, we report that sorting protein-related receptor with A-type repeats (SorLA), a member of the mammal Vps10p domain receptor, interacts with GDNF and is localized to GDNF-containing vesicles. Overexpression of SorLA significantly increases, and knockdown of SorLA by siRNA decreases, the regulated secretion of GDNF in PC12 and MN9D cells but has no effect on GDNF constitutive secretion. In addition, overexpression of a truncated form of SorLA also impairs GDNF-regulated secretion. Finally, we found that the prodomain of GDNF mediates the interaction of GDNF with SorLA under acidic conditions. Moreover, overexpression of SorLA could enhance the regulated secretion of the GDNF prodomain-GFP fusion protein, suggesting that the prodomain of GDNF is responsible for its regulated secretion. Together, these findings will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying GDNF-regulated secretion."
