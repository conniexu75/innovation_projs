During cancer treatment, tumours can become drug-resistant. In addition, so-called persister cells can emerge and form a reservoir from which resistant cancer cells can originate. Persister cells are no longer sensitive to some drugs, but Michael McManus and colleagues now report that they exist in a mesenchymal state in which they are selectively sensitive to the inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4. Targeting GPX4 could therefore represent a new therapeutic avenue to potentially prevent drug resistance. Acquired drug resistance prevents cancer therapies from achieving stable and complete responses1. Emerging evidence implicates a key role for non-mutational drug resistance mechanisms underlying the survival of residual cancer ‘persister’ cells2,3,4. The persister cell pool constitutes a reservoir from which drug-resistant tumours may emerge. Targeting persister cells therefore presents a therapeutic opportunity to impede tumour relapse5. We previously found that cancer cells in a high mesenchymal therapy-resistant cell state are dependent on the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 for survival6. Here we show that a similar therapy-resistant cell state underlies the behaviour of persister cells derived from a wide range of cancers and drug treatments. Consequently, we demonstrate that persister cells acquire a dependency on GPX4. Loss of GPX4 function results in selective persister cell ferroptotic death in vitro and prevents tumour relapse in mice. These findings suggest that targeting of GPX4 may represent a therapeutic strategy to prevent acquired drug resistance."

Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PIC and PIC-core Mediator complex at nominal resolutions of 4.7 Å and 5.8 Å, respectively. The structures reveal transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), and suggest how the core and kinase TFIIH modules function in the opening of promoter DNA and the phosphorylation of Pol II, respectively. The TFIIH core subunit Ssl2 (a homologue of human XPB) is positioned on downstream DNA by the 'E-bridge' helix in TFIIE, consistent with TFIIE-stimulated DNA opening. The TFIIH kinase module subunit Tfb3 (MAT1 in human) anchors the kinase Kin28 (CDK7), which is mobile in the PIC but preferentially located between the Mediator hook and shoulder in the PIC-core Mediator complex. Open spaces between the Mediator head and middle modules may allow access of the kinase to its substrate, the C-terminal domain of Pol II."

https://openalex.org/W2766090940,"Nutrient amendment experiments at the boundary of the South Atlantic gyre reveal extensive regions in which nitrogen and iron are co-limiting, with other micronutrients also approaching co-deficiency; such limitations potentially increase phytoplankton community diversity. Whether micronutrient co-limitation is pervasive in the ocean and whether it affects phytoplankton growth and productivity is poorly understood. Through a series of large-scale nutrient amendment experiments at the eastern boundary of the South Atlantic gyre, Thomas Browning and colleagues report extensive regions in which nitrogen and iron are co-limiting, with near co-deficiency of the trace metal cobalt and vitamin B12. These findings suggest that nitrogen–iron co-limitation is pervasive in the ocean and potentially increases phytoplankton community diversity. Nutrient limitation of oceanic primary production exerts a fundamental control on marine food webs and the flux of carbon into the deep ocean1. The extensive boundaries of the oligotrophic sub-tropical gyres collectively define the most extreme transition in ocean productivity, but little is known about nutrient limitation in these zones1,2,3,4. Here we present the results of full-factorial nutrient amendment experiments conducted at the eastern boundary of the South Atlantic gyre. We find extensive regions in which the addition of nitrogen or iron individually resulted in no significant phytoplankton growth over 48 hours. However, the addition of both nitrogen and iron increased concentrations of chlorophyll a by up to approximately 40-fold, led to diatom proliferation, and reduced community diversity. Once nitrogen–iron co-limitation had been alleviated, the addition of cobalt or cobalt-containing vitamin B12 could further enhance chlorophyll a yields by up to threefold. Our results suggest that nitrogen–iron co-limitation is pervasive in the ocean, with other micronutrients also approaching co-deficiency. Such multi-nutrient limitations potentially increase phytoplankton community diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2765981931,"Copy-number variants of chromosome 16 region 16p11.2 are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders and are among the most prevalent in autism spectrum disorders. Of many 16p11.2 genes, Kctd13 has been implicated as a major driver of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. The function of KCTD13 in the mammalian brain, however, remains unknown. Here we delete the Kctd13 gene in mice and demonstrate reduced synaptic transmission. Reduced synaptic transmission correlates with increased levels of Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), a KCTD13/CUL3 ubiquitin ligase substrate, and is reversed by RhoA inhibition, suggesting increased RhoA as an important mechanism. In contrast to a previous knockdown study, deletion of Kctd13 or kctd13 does not increase brain size or neurogenesis in mice or zebrafish, respectively. These findings implicate Kctd13 in the regulation of neuronal function relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and clarify the role of Kctd13 in neurogenesis and brain size. Our data also reveal a potential role for RhoA as a therapeutic target in disorders associated with KCTD13 deletion."
https://openalex.org/W2767056974,"Granular materials such as sand, powders and foams are ubiquitous in daily life and in industrial and geotechnical applications. These disordered systems form stable structures when unperturbed, but in the presence of external influences such as tapping or shear they 'relax', becoming fluid in nature. It is often assumed that the relaxation dynamics of granular systems is similar to that of thermal glass-forming systems. However, so far it has not been possible to determine experimentally the dynamic properties of three-dimensional granular systems at the particle level. This lack of experimental data, combined with the fact that the motion of granular particles involves friction (whereas the motion of particles in thermal glass-forming systems does not), means that an accurate description of the relaxation dynamics of granular materials is lacking. Here we use X-ray tomography to determine the microscale relaxation dynamics of hard granular ellipsoids subject to an oscillatory shear. We find that the distribution of the displacements of the ellipsoids is well described by a Gumbel law (which is similar to a Gaussian distribution for small displacements but has a heavier tail for larger displacements), with a shape parameter that is independent of the amplitude of the shear strain and of the time. Despite this universality, the mean squared displacement of an individual ellipsoid follows a power law as a function of time, with an exponent that does depend on the strain amplitude and time. We argue that these results are related to microscale relaxation mechanisms that involve friction and memory effects (whereby the motion of an ellipsoid at a given point in time depends on its previous motion). Our observations demonstrate that, at the particle level, the dynamic behaviour of granular systems is qualitatively different from that of thermal glass-forming systems, and is instead more similar to that of complex fluids. We conclude that granular materials can relax even when the driving strain is weak."
https://openalex.org/W2766363993,"Tethering proteins, known to mediate initial recognition and attachment during membrane fusion, are essential for driving the transition from the hemifused state to fusion pore formation. Membrane fusion affects many cellular events and is essential for cell survival. It is thought that the various factors that mediate this process have distinct functions. For example, tethering proteins are responsible for the initial recognition and attachment of the fusing membranes, whereas SNARE protein complexes do the rest, providing mechanical energy to distort membranes through a hemifusion intermediate to form a fusion pore. But Andreas Mayer and colleagues now provide evidence that the division of labour is not so clear cut and that the tethering factors are not the lesser partner. They find that, in yeast cells, tether proteins are also essential for the transition from the hemifused state to the fusion pore. Specifically, these proteins play a mechanical part by increasing the volume of SNARE complexes and deforming the site of hemifusion. This lowers the energy barrier for pore opening. Membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells mediates the biogenesis of organelles, vesicular traffic between them, and exo- and endocytosis of important signalling molecules, such as hormones and neurotransmitters. Distinct tasks in intracellular membrane fusion have been assigned to conserved protein systems. Tethering proteins mediate the initial recognition and attachment of membranes, whereas SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein complexes are considered as the core fusion engine. SNARE complexes provide mechanical energy to distort membranes and drive them through a hemifusion intermediate towards the formation of a fusion pore1,2,3. This last step is highly energy-demanding4,5. Here we combine the in vivo and in vitro fusion of yeast vacuoles with molecular simulations to show that tethering proteins are critical for overcoming the final energy barrier to fusion pore formation. SNAREs alone drive vacuoles only into the hemifused state. Tethering proteins greatly increase the volume of SNARE complexes and deform the site of hemifusion, which lowers the energy barrier for pore opening and provides the driving force. Thereby, tethering proteins assume a crucial mechanical role in the terminal stage of membrane fusion that is likely to be conserved at multiple steps of vesicular traffic. We therefore propose that SNAREs and tethering proteins should be considered as a single, non-dissociable device that drives fusion. The core fusion machinery may then be larger and more complex than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2765740714,"It is Ugandan governmental policy that all surgical care delivered at government hospitals in Uganda is to be provided to patients free of charge. In practice, however, frequent stock-outs and broken equipment require patients to pay for large portions of their care out of their own pocket. The purpose of this study was to determine the financial impact on patients who undergo surgery at a government hospital in Uganda.Every surgical patient discharged from a surgical ward at a large regional referral hospital in rural southwestern Uganda over a 3-week period in April 2016 was asked to participate. Patients who agreed were surveyed to determine their baseline level of poverty and to assess the financial impact of the hospitalization. Rates of impoverishment and catastrophic expenditure were then calculated. An ""impoverishing expense"" is defined as one that pushes a household below published poverty thresholds. A ""catastrophic expense"" was incurred if the patient spent more than 10% of their average annual expenditures.We interviewed 295 out of a possible 320 patients during the study period. 46% (CI 40-52%) of our patients met the World Bank's definition of extreme poverty ($1.90/person/day). After receiving surgical care an additional 10 patients faced extreme poverty, and 5 patients were newly impoverished by the World Bank's definition ($3.10/person/day). 31% of patients faced a catastrophic expenditure of more than 10% of their estimated total yearly expenses. 53% of the households in our study had to borrow money to pay for care, 21% had to sell possessions, and 17% lost a job as a result of the patient's hospitalization. Only 5% of our patients received some form of charity.Despite the government's policy to provide ""free care,"" undergoing an operation at a government hospital in Uganda can result in a severe economic burden to patients and their families. Alternative financing schemes to provide financial protection are critically needed."
https://openalex.org/W2765649616,"At most synapses in the brain, short-term plasticity dynamically modulates synaptic strength. Rapid frequency-dependent changes in synaptic strength have key roles in sensory adaptation, gain control and many other neural computations. However, some auditory, vestibular and cerebellar synapses maintain constant strength over a wide range of firing frequencies, and as a result efficiently encode firing rates. Despite its apparent simplicity, frequency-invariant transmission is difficult to achieve because of inherent synaptic nonlinearities. Here we study frequency-invariant transmission at synapses from Purkinje cells to deep cerebellar nuclei and at vestibular synapses in mice. Prolonged activation of these synapses leads to initial depression, which is followed by steady-state responses that are frequency invariant for their physiological activity range. We find that synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7), a calcium sensor for short-term facilitation, is present at both synapses. It was unclear why a sensor for facilitation would be present at these and other depressing synapses. We find that at Purkinje cell and vestibular synapses, Syt7 supports facilitation that is normally masked by depression, which can be revealed in wild-type mice but is absent in Syt7 knockout mice. In wild-type mice, facilitation increases with firing frequency and counteracts depression to produce frequency-invariant transmission. In Syt7-knockout mice, Purkinje cell and vestibular synapses exhibit conventional use-dependent depression, weakening to a greater extent as the firing frequency is increased. Presynaptic rescue of Syt7 expression restores both facilitation and frequency-invariant transmission. Our results identify a function for Syt7 at synapses that exhibit overall depression, and demonstrate that facilitation has an unexpected and important function in producing frequency-invariant transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2766363514,"Most humans have pre-existing immunity to influenza viruses. In this study, volunteers (ages of 18–85 years) were vaccinated with split, inactivated Fluzone™ influenza vaccine in four consecutive influenza seasons from 2013 to 2016 seasons. The impact of repeated vaccination on breadth and durability of antibodies was assessed as a result of vaccine strain changes. Total IgG anti-hemagglutinin (HA) binding antibodies and hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity increased in all age groups against both influenza A HA components in the vaccine post-vaccination (day 21). However, younger subjects maintained seroprotective titers to the vaccine strains, which resulted in higher seroconversion rates in the elderly, since the HAI titers in elderly subjects were more likely to decline prior to the next season. Young subjects had significant HAI activity against historical, as well as contemporary H1 and H3 vaccine strains from the mid-1980s to present. In contrast, elderly subjects had HAI activity to H1 strains from all years, but were more likely to have HAI activity to older strains from 1918-1950s. They also had a more restricted HAI profile against H3 viruses compared to young subjects recognizing H3N2 influenza viruses from the mid-2000s to present. Vaccine recipients were then categorized by whether subjects seroconverted from a seronegative or seropositive pre-vaccination state. Regardless of age, immunological recall or ‘back-boosting’ to antigenically related strains were associated with seroconversion to the vaccine strain. Overall, both younger and older people have the ability to mount a breadth of immune responses following influenza vaccination. This report describes how imprinting exposure differs across age groups, influences antibody cross-reactivity to past hemagglutinin antigenic variants, and shapes immune responses elicited by current split inactivated influenza vaccines. Understanding how current influenza vaccines are influenced by pre-existing immunity in people of different ages is critical for designing the next-generation of ‘universal’ or broadly-protective influenza vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2765765270,"Icariin, a prenylated flavonol glycoside isolated from the herb Epimedium, has been considered as a potential alternative therapy for osteoporosis. Previous research has shown that, unlike other flavonoids, icariin is unlikely to act via the estrogen receptor, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown. In this study, using rat calvarial osteoblast culture and rat bone growth models, we demonstrated that icariin promotes bone formation by activating the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway requiring functional primary cilia of osteoblasts. We found that icariin increases the peak bone mass attained by young rats and promotes the maturation and mineralization of rat calvarial osteoblasts. Icariin activated cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling of the osteoblasts by increasing intracellular cAMP levels and facilitating phosphorylation of both PKA and CREB. Blocking cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling with inhibitors of the cAMP-synthesizing adenylyl cyclase (AC) and PKA inhibitors significantly inhibited the osteogenic effect of icariin in the osteoblasts. Icariin-activated cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling was localized to primary cilia, as indicated by localization of soluble AC and phosphorylated PKA. Furthermore, blocking ciliogenesis via siRNA knockdown of a cilium assembly protein, IFT88, inhibited icariin-induced PKA and CREB phosphorylation and also abolished icariin's osteogenic effect. Finally, several of these outcomes were validated in icariin-treated rats. Together, these results provide new insights into icariin function and its mechanisms of action and strengthen existing ties between cAMP-mediated signaling and osteogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2767111477,"Summary The current evidence on handwashing and sanitation programs suggests limited impacts on health when at-scale interventions have been tested in isolation. However, no published experimental evidence currently exists that tests the interaction effects between sanitation and handwashing. We present the results of two large-scale, government-led handwashing and sanitation promotion campaigns in rural Tanzania, with the objective of tracing the causal chain from hygiene and sanitation promotion to changes in child health outcomes and specifically testing for potential interaction effects of combining handwashing and sanitation interventions. Methods The study is a factorial cluster-randomized control trial where 181 rural wards from 10 districts in Tanzania were randomly assigned to receive sanitation promotion, handwashing promotion, both interventions together or neither (control). Interventions were rolled out from February 2009 to June 2011 and the endline survey was conducted from May to November 2012, approximately one year after program completion. The sample was composed of households with children under 5 years old in the two largest villages in each ward. Masking was not possible due to the nature of the intervention, but enumerators played no part in the intervention and were blinded to treatment status. The primary outcome of interest was 7-day diarrhea prevalence for children under five. Intermediate outcomes of behavior change including improved latrine construction, levels of open defecation and handwashing with soap were also analyzed. Secondary health outcomes included anemia, height-for-age and weight-for-age of children under 5. An intention-to-treat analysis was used to assess the relationship between the interventions and outcomes of interest. Findings One year after the end of the program, ownership of improved latrines increased from 49.7% to 64.8% (95% CI 57.9%-71.7%) and regular open defecation decreased from 23.1% to 11.1% (95% CI 3.5%-18.7%) in sanitation promotion-only wards. Households in handwashing promotion-only wards showed marginal improvements in handwashing behavior related to food preparation but not at other critical junctures. There were no detectable interaction effects for the combined intervention. The associated cost-per-household gaining access to improved sanitation is estimated to be USD $194. Final effects on child health measured through diarrhea, anemia, stunting and wasting were absent in all treatment groups. Interpretation Although statistically significant, the changes in intermediate outcomes achieved through each intervention in isolation were not large enough to generate meaningful health impacts. With no observable signs of interaction, the combined intervention produced similar results. The study highlights the importance of focusing on intermediate outcomes of take up and behavior change as a critical first step in large-scale programs before realizing the changes in health that sanitation and hygiene interventions aim to deliver.

https://openalex.org/W2766531701,"Ewing sarcoma is a bone malignancy of children and young adults, frequently harboring the EWS/FLI chromosomal translocation. The resulting fusion protein is an aberrant transcription factor that uses highly repetitive GGAA-containing elements (microsatellites) to activate and repress thousands of target genes mediating oncogenesis. However, the mechanisms of EWS/FLI interaction with microsatellites and regulation of target gene expression is not clearly understood. Here, we profile genome-wide protein binding and gene expression. Using a combination of unbiased genome-wide computational and experimental analysis, we define GGAA-microsatellites in a Ewing sarcoma context. We identify two distinct classes of GGAA-microsatellites and demonstrate that EWS/FLI responsiveness is dependent on microsatellite length. At close range “promoter-like” microsatellites, EWS/FLI binding and subsequent target gene activation is highly dependent on number of GGAA-motifs. “Enhancer-like” microsatellites demonstrate length-dependent EWS/FLI binding, but minimal correlation for activated and none for repressed targets. Our data suggest EWS/FLI binds to “promoter-like” and “enhancer-like” microsatellites to mediate activation and repression of target genes through different regulatory mechanisms. Such characterization contributes valuable insight to EWS/FLI transcription factor biology and clarifies the role of GGAA-microsatellites on a global genomic scale. This may provide unique perspective on the role of non-coding DNA in cancer susceptibility and therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W2765405260,"Giraffids include the only living giraffomorph ruminants and are diagnosed by the presence of bi-lobed canines and a special type of epiphyseal cranial appendages called ossicones. The family Giraffidae ranges from the latest early Miocene until today. However they are currently extant relics with only two living representatives, the African genera Okapia and Giraffa. Giraffids were much more diverse and widespread in the past, with more than 30 fossil species described. For the past decades a number of studies intended to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of the family, but due to the lack of really good cranial material no clear consensus was reached regarding the phylogenetic relationships amongst the different members of the group. The exceptionally complete remains of a new large giraffid from the late Miocene of Spain, Decennatherium rex sp. nov., allows us to improve and reassess giraffid systematics, offering a lot of new data, both anatomic and phylogenetic, on the large late Miocene giraffids of Eurasia. The results of our cladistic analysis show Decennatherium as a basal offshoot of a clade containing the gigantic samotheres and sivatheres, characterized by the presence of a Sivatherium-like ossicone-plan among other features. Decennatherium thus offers the most ancient evidence of this Sivatherium-plan and firmly establishes the early morphological patterns of evolution of a sivathere / samothere-clade that is defined as the less inclusive clade that contains Decennatherium and Sivatherium. Finally, this large group of four-ossiconed giraffids evolutionarily links Miocene Europe and Africa indicating vicariance / migration processes among the giraffid genetic pools separated by the Mediterranean Sea."
https://openalex.org/W2766436659,"The contemporary Japanese populations largely consist of three genetically distinct groups—Hondo, Ryukyu and Ainu. By principal-component analysis, while the three groups can be clearly separated, the Hondo people, comprising 99% of the Japanese, form one almost indistinguishable cluster. To understand fine-scale genetic structure, we applied powerful haplotype-based statistical methods to genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data from 1600 Japanese individuals, sampled from eight distinct regions in Japan. We then combined the Japanese data with 26 other Asian populations data to analyze the shared ancestry and genetic differentiation. We found that the Japanese could be separated into nine genetic clusters in our dataset, showing a marked concordance with geography; and that major components of ancestry profile of Japanese were from the Korean and Han Chinese clusters. We also detected and dated admixture in the Japanese. While genetic differentiation between Ryukyu and Hondo was suggested to be caused in part by positive selection, genetic differentiation among the Hondo clusters appeared to result principally from genetic drift. Notably, in Asians, we found the possibility that positive selection accentuated genetic differentiation among distant populations but attenuated genetic differentiation among close populations. These findings are significant for studies of human evolution and medical genetics."

Here, a conditional knockout of Arl13b (retArl13b−/−) was generated by expressing Cre recombinase in retina during embryonic development beginning at ∼embryonic day 9 (E9). The results show that retArl13b−/− photoreceptors degenerate rapidly after failing to form mature transition zones and outer segments. Depletion of ARL13b in the adult by tamoxifen-inducible Cre/loxP recombination (tamArl13b−/−) destabilized axonemes and transition zones, leading to progressive photoreceptor degeneration. Significant reduction of IFT88 at tamArl13b−/− basal bodies suggested impairment of IFT upon deletion of ARL13b. scARL13b-AAV8 vector, injected into the retArl13b−/− subretinal space at eye opening, partially compensated and rescued photoreceptor degeneration.

LoxP-directed recombination is predicted to delete exon 2 resulting in a frameshift mutation and truncation of ARL13b at codon 2 of exon 3 (Fig. 2C). Genotyping of the floxed gene was performed using primers P1 and P2 flanking loxP in intron 2 with tail DNA (Fig. 2D), and primers P3 and P4 with retina DNA as template (Fig. 2E).

Both polypeptides are detectable in P17 retina knock-out lysates, as far peripheral retina still elaborates outer segments (Fig. 2H, g–i). Immunohistochemistry using retArl13b+/− frozen sections and monoclonal anti–ARL13b antibody (NeuroMab) showed that ARL13b is an outer segment protein expressed as early as P6 (Fig. 2H, a–c). At P6, ARL13b localized in nascent OS in close proximity to the basal body (Fig. 2Ha, enlargement in lower panel). At P10 and P15 maturing outer segments contained ARL13b (Fig. 2H, b and c, and lower panel enlargements). ARL13b was also detectable in the inner segment (Fig. 2H, b and c, arrows). By contrast, ARL13b was undetectable in retArl13b−/− central retina at P6, P10, and P15 (Fig. 2H, d–f); enlargements show the presence of centrioles, identified by transgenic expression of CETN2 fused to EGFP (EGFP-CETN2), but absence of fully developed transition zones. While Six3-Cre–mediated recombination starts at E9 in the central retina (26Furuta Y. Lagutin O. Hogan B.L. Oliver G.C.

Rhodopsin, detectable at P6 when nascent retArl13b+/− outer segments form (Fig. 3Aa), normally localizes distal to basal bodies (Fig. 3Aa, right panel) but mislocalized to inner segments (IS) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retArl13b−/− photoreceptor (Fig. 3A, d–f). In P10 and P15 heterozygous control retinas, rod outer segments developed rapidly, expressing rhodopsin (Fig. 3A, a–c); PDE6 (Fig. 3B, a and b); and IQCB1/NPHP5, a transition zone marker (33Ronquillo C.C.

Based on EGFP-CETN2 expression, centrioles persist as green puncta although TZ extensions are not detectable in central retArl13b−/− photoreceptors from P6 to P15 (Fig. 3A, d–f, right panels); rhodopsin and PDE6, normally destined for the OS, accumulated in the IS and ONL (Fig. 3, Ae and B, c and d). Rhodopsin was nearly completely absent in the P15 central retArl13b−/− retina, presumably degraded by endoplasmic reticulum–associated protein degradation (ERAD) (Fig. 3Af). IQCB1/NPHP5, labeling the transition zone and proximal axoneme, was absent, consistent with failure to form a functional connecting cilium and outer segment (Fig. 3C, c and d). A whole retina immunoblot (P17) revealed significant traces of rhodopsin and GRK1 originating from far peripheral retina; rod transducin (Tα) and PDE6 expressions persisted more strongly (Fig. 3D). ARL3-GDP levels appear unaffected by ARL13b knockout. Scotopic a-wave amplitudes were severely attenuated even at low light intensities (−4.5 and –1.6 log cds·m−2). (Fig. 3E). Cone pigment trafficking in heterozygous control and retArl13b−/− retinas expressing EGFP-CETN2 was also explored (Fig. 4A). Cone outer segments were identified by anti–ML-opsin (Fig. 4A, a and b) and anti–S-opsin (Fig. 4B, a and b) immunoreactivity in P10 and P15 control retinas. Control cone OS are shown connected to transition zones (yellow arrows) and basal bodies (white arrowheads) (Fig. 4, A and B, a and b, right panels). Although opsins distributed throughout mutant cones, intense accumulation was observed in bloated and deformed inner segments (Fig. 4, A and B, c and d, right panels). Peripheral proteins (GRK1, cone transducin-γ, and cone PDE6) were not detectable (not shown). Photopic b-waves, using flash intensities of −1.6 log cds·m−2 and higher, were highly suppressed at P15 (Fig. 4C). Optokinetic tracking (OKT) responses at 2 months of age were extinguished in retina-specific knock-out mice (p < 0.0001), indicating that the mice were unable to respond to light because of retArl13b−/− rod and cones being completely degenerated (Fig. 4D). By contrast, OKT responses of heterozygous knock-out mice were indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) littermates, suggesting haplosufficiency. ARL3-GDP cannot be activated by GDP/GTP exchange in the retArl13b−/− retina, whereas in the retArl3−/− retina, both ARL3-GDP and ARL3-GTP are absent. ARL3-GDP levels appear stable in the P17 retArl13b−/− retina (Fig. 3D). To explore differences in the degeneration rate, we compared the rate of retArl13b−/− retina degeneration with that of retArl3−/− retina (Fig. 5). Plastic sections of the three genotypes (WT, retArl13b−/−, and retArl3−/−) (Fig. 5A) showed severely reduced retArl13b−/− and retArl3−/− OS/IS morphology indicating the retArl13b−/− and retArl3−/− retinas degenerated as early as P15. retArl13b−/− ONL thickness decreased significantly faster at P15 and P30 than observed in retArl3−/− (Fig. 5B). At 1 month of age only one nuclear row remained in retArl13b−/− retina, whereas retArl3−/− photoreceptors retained three rows of nuclei (Fig. 5B); the different degeneration rates suggest that ARL13b may have an additional function. Ultrastructural analysis at postnatal days P10 and P15 revealed normal rod photoreceptor ciliogenesis in control animals. In P10 WT retina, basal bodies dock to the photoreceptor cell membrane, transition zones extend, disc membranes assemble, and OS are elaborated (Fig. 6A, a and b). In P10 retArl13b−/− photoreceptors, basal bodies docked to the cell membrane (Fig. 6A, c and e), rudimentary transition zones formed (yellow arrow) but ended in membranous bags (white asterisk) without recognizable disc structure (Fig. 6A, d and f). At P15, WT photoreceptor structure appears advanced with well-aligned basal bodies, transition zones and disc membrane in the OS (Fig. 6B, a and b). By contrast, P15 retArl13b−/− basal bodies are either undocked to membrane or docked to membranes with distal and subdistal appendages (Fig. 6B, c–f). Docked basal bodies (Fig. 6Bd) developed stunted TZs connected to membranous bags. Stunted TZs, revealed by electron microscopy, were not identified by confocal microscopy despite presence of the EGFP-CETN2 transgene. This may perhaps be attributed to loss of CETN2 docking sites in the knockout, thereby eliminating EGFP fluorescence. The electron microscopy results indicate a requirement of ARL13b GEF activity and ARL3-GTP for normal photoreceptor TZ structure. To explore TZ stability as a function of ARL3-GTP, we deleted ARL13b progressively at 1 month of age using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre/loxP recombination system, CAG-CreER (35Hayashi S. McMahon A.P. Efficient recombination in diverse tissues by a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre: A tool for temporally regulated gene activation/inactivation in the mouse.Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of CreER was induced by intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen on five consecutive days, and the degeneration rate was assessed in retina cryosections of eyes harvested 2, 3, and 6 weeks later (Fig. 7). At 2 weeks post tamoxifen induction (2WPI), ARL13b was present in treated WT outer segments, but undetectable in tamArl13b−/− retina (Fig. 7A, compare a and b). Although tamArl13b−/− outer segments appeared of normal length (Fig. 7A, d–f), rhodopsin, PDE6, and Tα displayed retention in the tamArl13b−/− inner segments (Fig. 7A, d–f, lower panels). Tamoxifen treatment of tamArl13b+/+ mice had no effect on rhodopsin (Fig. 7Ac), PDE6, or Tα trafficking (results not shown). At 3WPI, rhodopsin, PDE6, and Tα (Fig. 7B, a–d) were retained much more strongly in the tamArl13b−/− inner segments suggesting outer segment shortening/degeneration. At 6WPI tamArl13b−/− outer and inner segments were absent with only one row of nuclei surviving (Fig. 7, C, b–d, and G). Scotopic a-wave amplitudes were significantly reduced at 2WPI and 3WPI (Fig. 7, D and E) and extinguished at 6WPI (Fig. 7F). Cone outer segments, identified by anti–ML-opsin antibody, appeared normal and were attached to their TZ (yellow arrows) in tamoxifen-treated WT animals at 2WPI (Fig. 8Aa) and 3WPI (Fig. 8Ac). At 3WPI in tamArl13b−/− retina, ML-opsin started to mistraffic and accumulated in the inner segment (Fig. 8Ad); cone outer segments started to disintegrate accompanied by appearance of EGFP-CETN2 in the mutant inner segments (Fig. 8Ad, lower panel enlargement), as also seen for rods (Fig. 7Bd). The tamArl13b−/− photopic b-wave (Fig. 8B) and OKT (Fig. 8C) responses at 2WPI were ∼50% reduced; photopic ERG was strongly attenuated at 3WPI (Fig. 8D). At 6WPI, the photopic b-wave was completely extinguished (Fig. 8E). Anterograde IFT along microtubules depends on association of IFT particles with kinesin-2 molecular motors and IFT particles (36P"
https://openalex.org/W2765196250,"Pleasure is a key factor for physical activity behavior in sedentary individuals. Inhibitory cognitive control may play an important role in pleasure perception while exercising, especially at high intensities. In addition, separate work suggests that autonomic regulation and cerebral hemodynamics influence the affective and cognitive responses during exercise.We investigated the effects of exercise intensity on affect, inhibitory control, cardiac autonomic function, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation.Thirty-seven sedentary young adults performed two experimental conditions (exercise and control) in separate sessions in a repeated-measures design. In the exercise condition, participants performed a maximum graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer as we continuously measured oxygen consumption, heart rate variability (HRV), and PFC oxygenation. At each of 8 intensity levels we also measured inhibitory control (Stroop test), associative and dissociative thoughts (ADT), and affective/pleasure ratings. In the control condition, participants sat motionless on a cycle ergometer without active pedaling, and we collected the same measures at the same points in time as the exercise condition. We evaluated the main effects and interactions of exercise condition and intensity level for each measure using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between affect and inhibitory control, ADT, HRV, and PFC oxygenation using Pearson's correlation coefficients.For exercise intensities below and at the ventilatory threshold (VT), participants reported feeling neutral, with preservation of inhibitory control, while intensities above the VT were associated with displeasure (p<0.001), decreased inhibitory control and HRV (p<0.001), and increased PFC oxygenation (p<0.001). At the highest exercise intensity, pleasure was correlated with the low-frequency index of HRV (r = -0.34; p<0.05) and the low-frequency/high-frequency HRV ratio (r = -0.33; p<0.05). PFC deoxyhemoglobin was correlated with pleasure two stages above the VT (r = -0.37; p<0.05).Our results support the notion that exercise at high intensities influences inhibitory control and one's perception of pleasure, which are linked to changes in cardiac autonomic control and cerebral hemodynamics. These findings strengthen the existence of an integrated brain-heart-body system and highlight the importance of exercise intensity in exercise-related behavior in sedentary individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2765662469,"Idiopathic hypereosinophilia (IHE)/idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (IHES) has been defined by a persistent elevation of the blood eosinophil count exceeding 1.5×103/μL, without evidence of reactive or clonal causes. While T-cell clonality assessment has been recommended for unexplained hypereosinophilia, this approach is not often applied to routine practice in the clinic. We hypothesized that the clonality would exist in a subset of IHE/IHES patients. We aimed to investigate the candidate mutations and T-cell clonality in IHE/IHES and to explore the role of mutations in eosinophil proliferation. We performed targeted capture sequencing for 88 genes using next-generation sequencing, T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement assays, and pathway network analysis in relation to eosinophil proliferation. By targeted sequencing, 140 variants in 59 genes were identified. Sixteen out of 30 patients (53.3%) harbored at least one candidate mutation. The most frequently affected genes were NOTCH1 (26.7%), SCRIB and STAG2 (16.7%), and SH2B3 (13.3%). Network analysis revealed that our 21 candidate genes (BIRC3, BRD4, CSF3R, DNMT3A, EGR2, EZH2, FAT4, FLT3, GATA2, IKZF, JAK2, MAPK1, MPL, NF1, NOTCH1, PTEN, RB1, RUNX1, TET2, TP53 and WT1) are functionally linked to the eosinophilopoietic pathway. Among the 21 candidate genes, five genes (MAPK1, RUNX1, GATA2, NOTCH1 and TP53) with the highest number of linkages were considered major genes. A TCR assay revealed that four patients (13.3%) had a clonal TCR rearrangement. NOTCH1 was the most frequently mutated gene and was shown to be a common node for eosinophilopoiesis in our network analysis, while the possibility of hidden T cell malignancy was indwelling in the presence of NOTCH1 mutation, though not revealed by aberrant T cell study. Collectively, these results provide new evidence that mutations affecting eosinophilopoiesis underlie a subset of IHE/IHES, and the candidate genes are inferred to act their potential roles in the eosinophilopoietic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2766794970,"HIV infection causes a profound depletion of gut derived Th17 cells, contributing to loss of mucosal barrier function and an increase in microbial translocation, thus driving systemic immune activation. Despite normalization of circulating CD4+ T cell counts with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), Th17 frequency and function often remain impaired. Given the importance of interleukin (IL)-23 in the generation and stabilization of Th17 cells we hypothesized that impaired IL-23 signaling causes persistent Th17 dysfunction in HIV infection.The effects of in vitro HIV infection on responses to IL-23 in Th17 cells were examined. These included the production of IL-17, phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and the transcription of retinoic acid orphan receptor C (RORC) gene. Blood derived Th17 cells from untreated and HAART-treated HIV-infected individuals were also examined for the IL-23 induced production of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and the expression of the IL-23 receptors.In vitro HIV infection significantly inhibited IL-17 production and IL-23 induced pSTAT3 while expression of RORC RNA was unaffected. Th17 cells isolated from untreated and HAART-treated HIV-infected individuals showed complete loss of IL-23 induced pSTAT3 without a decrease in the expression of the IL-23 receptors.This study is the first to demonstrate an effect of HIV on the IL-23 signaling pathway in Th17 cells. We show that in vitro and in vivo HIV infection results in impaired IL-23 signaling which is not reversed by HAART nor is it a result of reduced receptor expression, suggesting that HIV interferes with IL-23-activated signaling pathways. These findings may explain the inability of HAART to restore Th17 frequency and function and the resulting persistent chronic immune activation observed in HIV infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2766883096,"Productions of various bacterial traits like production of virulence factors (e.g. toxins, enzymes), biofilm formation, luminescence among others, have been known to be controlled by quorum sensing (QS), a process that is dependent on chemical signals or autoinducers (AIs). Bacteria known to rely on such AIs are known to be virulent and tend to be resistant against various antimicrobial agents. Therefore, strategies aimed at the inhibition of QS pathways, are regarded as potential novel therapies in managing bacterial virulence hence reducing their ability to induce infections in humans. In the present study, a portfolio of 25 medicinal plant extracts (ethanol 50% v/v) used in southwestern Kenya were assayed against a transformed E. coli Top 10 reporter QS strain. This biosensor responds to the exogenous addition of 3-oxo-N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC6HSL) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). The large majority of the screened medicinal plants seemed to exhibit toxic effects and almost none of them induced antiquorum sensing (AQS) activity. This could be the consequence of the presence of mixed compounds in the extracts. Elaeodendron buchananii Loes and Acacia gerrardii Benth extracts that seemed to show AQS activity were further proved found to possess mild AQS but with defined antimicrobial activities, and no antibiofilm formation inhibition. As a control, an E. coli pBCA9145_jtk2828::sfGFP strain that produces constitutively GFP was used and confirmed that none of the two extracts quenched the fluorescence of sfGFP. Cytotoxicity assays with mammalian MDCK cells also did indicate that the selected extracts with putative AQS activity, also reduced the cell viability. Therefore, further studies will be needed to separate and re-test the individual compounds especially from the selected two promising plants."

It is however, not been possible to separate the renal consequences of hyperoxaluria from that of CaOx crystal deposition. We decided to utilize ethylene glycol (EG) model where hyperoxaluria and CaOx crystal deposition can be separated in time. To test our hypothesis, male rats were made hyperoxaluric by administering EG, rats were euthanized and kidneys were extracted on day 14, when occasional crystal is seen in the kidneys and day 28, when all animals have developed renal CaOx crystal deposits. Total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis and genome wide analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed to investigate differences between hyperoxaluria and crystal induced alterations in the kidneys. Immunohistochemical and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was also done for macromolecules with significant role in stone formation. All EG fed rats became hyperoxaluric by day 7, showed a few crystal deposits on day 14, and had heavy crystal deposition by day 28. There were significant changes in the expression of genes encoding for NADPH Oxidases; macromolecular crystallization modulators; genes involved in inflammasome activation; and osteogenic marker genes. Results demonstrate major differences between hyperoxaluria and CaOx crystal induced changes in the kidneys. Injury and inflammation are mainly associated with crystal deposition indicating significant role played by crystal retention."

https://openalex.org/W2765624309,"School closures, while an effective measure against the spread of disease during a pandemic, may carry unintended social and economic consequences for students and families. We evaluated these costs and consequences following a 4-day school closure in Mississippi's Harrison County School District (HCSD).In a survey of all households with students enrolled in HCSD, we collected information on difficulties related to the school closure, including interruption of employment and pay, loss of access to subsidized school meals, and arrangement of alternative childcare. We analyzed this information in the context of certain demographic characteristics of the survey respondents and households, such as race, level of education, and income. We also estimated the average number of lost work days and documented the childcare alternatives chosen by households affected by the school closure.We received 2,229 (28.4%) completed surveys from an estimated 7,851 households eligible to participate. About half (1,082 [48.5%]) of the households experienced at least some difficulty during the closure, primarily in three areas: uncertainty about duration of the closure, lost income, and the effort of arranging alternate childcare. Adults working outside the home, particularly the major wage earner in the household, were more likely to suffer lost income while schools were closed, an effect mitigated by paid leave benefits. Difficulty arranging childcare was reported most frequently by respondents with lower levels of education and households with younger children. Beyond the top three concerns expressed by households in HCSD, the survey also shed light on the issue of food insecurity when subsidized school meals are not available. Reported by 17.9% of households participating in the subsidized school lunch program, difficulty providing meals during the closure was associated with higher numbers of dependent children, selection of ""other"" as the race of the household respondent, and lower levels of education.To help prevent undue financial hardship in families of school children, public health authorities and school administrators should provide recommendations for childcare alternatives and paid leave or remote work options during prolonged school closures, particularly to households in which all adults work outside of the home."
https://openalex.org/W2765214439,"RUN and FYVE domain–containing 3 (Rufy3) is an adapter protein for small GTPase proteins and is bound to activated Rap2, a Ras family protein in the developing neuron. Previously, we reported the presence of a rapid cell polarity determination mechanism involving Rufy3, which is likely required for in vivo neuronal development. However, the molecular details of this mechanism are unclear. To this end, here we produced Rufy3 knock-out (Rufy3-KO) mice to study the role of Rufy3 in more detail. Examining Rufy3-KO neurons, we found that Rufy3 is recruited via glycoprotein M6A to detergent-resistant membrane domains, which are biochemically similar to lipid rafts. We also clarified that Rufy3, as a component of a ternary complex, induces the assembly of Rap2 in the axonal growth cone, whereas in the absence of Rufy3, the accumulation of a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor, T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 2 (Tiam2/STEF), is inhibited downstream of Rap2. We also found that Rufy3 regulates the cellular localization of Rap2 and Tiam2/STEF. Taken together, we conclude that Rufy3 is a physiological adapter for Rap2 and activates Tiam2/STEF in glycoprotein M6A-regulated neuronal polarity and axon growth."
https://openalex.org/W2767166424,"A long-standing goal in plant breeding has been the ability to confer apomixis to agriculturally relevant species, which would require a deeper comprehension of the molecular basis of apomictic regulatory mechanisms. Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees is a perennial grass that includes both sexual and apomictic cytotypes. The availability of a reference transcriptome for this species would constitute a very important tool toward the identification of genes controlling key steps of the apomictic pathway. Here, we used Roche/454 sequencing technologies to generate reads from inflorescences of E. curvula apomictic and sexual genotypes that were de novo assembled into a reference transcriptome. Near 90% of the 49568 assembled isotigs showed sequence similarity to sequences deposited in the public databases. A gene ontology analysis categorized 27448 isotigs into at least one of the three main GO categories. We identified 11475 SSRs, and several of them were assayed in E curvula germoplasm using SSR-based primers, providing a valuable set of molecular markers that could allow direct allele selection. The differential contribution to each library of the spliced forms of several transcripts revealed the existence of several isotigs produced via alternative splicing of single genes. The reference transcriptome presented and validated in this work will be useful for the identification of a wide range of gene(s) related to agronomic traits of E. curvula, including those controlling key steps of the apomictic pathway in this species, allowing the extrapolation of the findings to other plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2767174004,"Given the significant threats towards Earth's coral reefs, there is an urgent need to document the current physiological condition of the resident organisms, particularly the reef-building scleractinians themselves. Unfortunately, most of the planet's reefs are understudied, and some have yet to be seen. For instance, the Kingdom of Tonga possesses an extensive reef system, with thousands of hectares of unobserved reefs; little is known about their ecology, nor is there any information on the health of the resident corals. Given such knowledge deficiencies, 59 reefs across three Tongan archipelagos were surveyed herein, and pocilloporid corals were sampled from approximately half of these surveyed sites; 10 molecular-scale response variable were assessed in 88 of the sampled colonies, and 12 colonies were found to be outliers based on employment of a multivariate statistics-based aberrancy detection system. These outliers differed from the statistically normally behaving colonies in having not only higher RNA/DNA ratios but also elevated expression levels of three genes: 1) Symbiodinium zinc-induced facilitator-like 1-like, 2) host coral copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, and 3) host green fluorescent protein-like chromoprotein. Outliers were also characterized by significantly higher variation amongst the molecular response variables assessed, and the response variables that contributed most significantly to colonies being delineated as outliers differed between the two predominant reef coral species sampled, Pocillopora damicornis and P. acuta. These closely related species also displayed dissimilar temporal fluctuation patterns in their molecular physiologies, an observation that may have been driven by differences in their feeding strategies. Future works should attempt to determine whether corals displaying statistically aberrant molecular physiology, such as the 12 Tongan outliers identified herein, are indeed characterized by a diminished capacity for acclimating to the rapid changes in their abiotic milieu occurring as a result of global climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2767004508,"Copaifera oleoresin is one of the most used natural products in popular medicine all over the world. Among other effects (i.e., anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, microbicidal) one of the most well-known is its wound healing capacity. However, the mechanism by which the oleoresin presents its effect is still not clear. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the wound healing capacity of oleoresin obtained from Copaifera paupera, its mechanism of action and identify its major components. For these purposes, diabetic Swiss Webster mice were topically treated with oleoresin (100, 150 or 200 mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days after an excision was performed in the back of the mice. Cytokines, wound retraction and histological evaluation were conducted at 3, 7 and 10 days (for cytokines); 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14 days (for wound retraction); and 7 and 14 days (for histological evaluation). Our data indicate that oleoresin significantly reduced production of MCP-1 and TNF-α at days 7 and 10 post-excision and increased IL-10 production at both days. All treatments demonstrated an effect similar or higher to that in collagenase-treated mice. Histological evaluations demonstrated that higher dose treatment resulted in better resolution and closure of the wound and higher levels of collagen deposition and indexes of re-epithelialization even when compared with the collagenase-treated group. The treatment with oleoresin from Copaifera paupera demonstrated that it is even better than an ointment routinely used for improvement of wound healing, suggesting this oleoresin as an option for use in diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2765584778,"Despite the immense literature related to diverse human electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters, very few studies have focused on the reliability of these measures. Some of the most studied components (i.e., P3 or MMN) have received more attention regarding the stability of their main parameters, such as latency, amplitude or topography. However, spectral modulations have not been as extensively evaluated considering that different analysis methods are available. The main aim of the present study is to assess the reliability of the latency, amplitude and topography of event-related desynchronization (ERD) for the alpha band (10-14 Hz) observed in a cognitive task (visual oddball). Topography reliability was analysed at different levels (for the group, within-subjects individually and between-subjects individually).The latency for alpha ERD showed stable behaviour between two sessions, and the amplitude exhibited an increment (more negative) in the second session. Alpha ERD topography exhibited a high correlation score between sessions at the group level (r = 0.903, p<0.001). The mean value for within-subject correlations was 0.750 (with a range from 0.391 to 0.954). Regarding between-subject topography comparisons, some subjects showed a highly specific topography, whereas other subjects showed topographies that were more similar to those of other subjects.ERD was mainly stable between the two sessions with the exception of amplitude, which exhibited an increment in the second session. Topography exhibits excellent reliability at the group level; however, it exhibits highly heterogeneous behaviour at the individual level. Considering that the P3 was previously evaluated for this group of subjects, a direct comparison of the correlation scores was possible, and it showed that the ERD component is less reliable in individual topography than in the ERP component (P3)."

The gene Gnaz-a unique Gi/o subfamily member-was seen in the present study to be expressed in photoreceptors where its protein product Gαz shows a daily rhythm in its subcellular localization. Apart from subcellular localization, Gnaz displays a daily rhythm in expression-with peak values at night-in preparations of the whole retina, microdissected photoreceptors and photoreceptor-related pinealocytes. In retina, Gnaz rhythmicity was observed to persist under constant darkness and to be abolished in retina deficient for Clock or dopamine D4 receptors. Furthermore, circadian regulation of Gnaz was disturbed in the db/db mouse, a model of diabetic retinopathy. The data of the present study suggest that Gnaz links the circadian clockwork-via dopamine acting on D4 receptors-to G protein-mediated signaling in intact but not diabetic retina."

Although we recently reported the effectiveness of the ultrasound-microbubble method as a tool for transfecting the NF-κB decoy ODN into healthy rodent gingival tissue, this technique has not yet been applied to the pathological gingiva of periodontitis animal models. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the technique in transfecting the NF-κB decoy ODN into rats with ligature-induced periodontitis. Micro computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in alveolar bone loss following treatment with the NF-κB decoy ODN in the experimental group. RT-PCR showed that NF-κB decoy ODN treatment resulted in significantly reduced expression of inflammatory cytokine transcripts within rat gingival tissues. Thus, we established a transcutaneous transfection model of NF-κB decoy ODN treatment of periodontal tissues using the ultrasound-microbubble technique. Our findings suggest that the NF-κB decoy ODN could be used as a significant suppressor of gingival inflammation and periodontal disease progression."

HIMH0021, an active flavonoid compound, which is a component of the Acer tegmentosum extract, has been shown to protect against liver damage caused by alcohol consumption. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine whether HIMH0021 could regulate alcoholic fatty liver and liver injury in mice. Oral administration of 10 days of Lieber-DeCarli ethanol plus a single binge of 30% ethanol (chronic-plus-binge model) induced steatosis and liver injury and inflammation in mice, which appears similar to the condition observed in human patients with alcohol-related diseases. HIMH0021, which was isolated from the active methanol extract of A. tegmentosum, inhibited alcohol-induced steatosis and attenuated the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) during hepatocellular alcohol metabolism, both of which promote lipogenesis as well as liver inflammation. Treatment with HIMH0021 conferred protection against lipogenesis and liver injury, inhibited the expression of cytochrome P4502E1, and increased serum adiponectin levels in the mice subjected to chronic-plus-binge feeding. Furthermore, in hepatocytes, HIMH0021 activated fatty acid oxidation by activating pAMPK, which comprises pACC and CPT1a. These findings suggested that HIMH0021 could be used to target a TNFα-related pathway for treating patients with alcoholic hepatitis."

We previously reported that TRAIL expression in liver NK cells decreases markedly after hepatectomy; however, the mechanism underlying this drastic alteration remains unknown. In this study, we assessed the role of chemokine signaling in liver-resident NK cells during the perioperative period of hepatectomy. The expression levels of various chemokine receptors on liver-resident NK cells and their associations with TRAIL expression were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of various intrahepatic chemokines/cytokines was analyzed after 70% hepatectomy in mice by quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry. We further investigated whether polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-induced NK cell activation could ameliorate TRAIL expression in the liver after 70% hepatectomy in CXCR3-/- and wild-type mice. TRAIL+ NK cells strongly and exclusively expressed CXCR3, and the expression of its ligand CXCL9 was significantly decreased in the liver after hepatectomy. The kinetics of hepatic CXCL9 expression resembled the changes in hepatic TRAIL+ NK cells after hepatectomy. Among liver-resident mononuclear cells, CXCL9 was predominantly secreted by macrophages in response to interferon-γ stimulation. Although the administration of poly I:C, an inducer of interferon-γ, increased hepatic CXCL9 levels in both CXCR3-/- and wild-type mice even after hepatectomy, only wild-type mice exhibited the recovery of TRAIL expression on NK cells. Partial hepatectomy remarkably reduced the proportion of TRAIL-expressing NK cells in the liver via the downregulation of the CXCL9-CXCR3 axis in mice. These findings extend our knowledge of the factors contributing to hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after hepatectomy."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia and decreased T cell response, neutrophil function, humoral immunity failure, increasing the susceptibility to infections. Here, we investigated the susceptibility of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type I diabetic and/or immunosuppressed mice to encephalitozoonosis by Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Microscopically, granulomatous hepatitis, interstitial pneumonia and pielonephritis were observed in all infected groups. STZ treatment induced an immunossupressor effect in the populations of B (B-1 and B2) and CD4+ T lymphocytes. Moreover, infection decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and macrophages of DM mice. Furthermore, infection induced a significant increase of IL-6 and TNF-α cytokine serum levels in DM mice. IFN-γ, the most important cytokine for the resolution of encephalitozoonosis, increased only in infected mice. In addition to the decreased immune response, DM mice were more susceptible to encephalitozoonosis, associated with increased fungal burden, and symptoms. Additionally, cyclophosphamide immunosuppression in DM mice further increased the susceptibility to encephalitozoonosis. Thus, microsporidiosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of comorbidities in diabetics."
https://openalex.org/W2765262830,"Motivational interviewing (MI) is a method for building motivation for behaviour change that has potential for use in respiratory contexts. There is a paucity of published research exploring the feasibility of this intervention from the clinicians' perspective. This study aimed to explore respiratory clinicians' views of MI: Is it perceived as useful? Could it be integrated into practice? What training would be required to make it part of routine care? Nine respiratory clinicians attended a one-day MI workshop and a semi-structured face-to-face interview two weeks later. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed with thematic analysis. Four main themes are presented-1) MI's suitability for use in respiratory contexts: participants saw potential in using MI to motivate their patients to engage with prescribed respiratory interventions, such as increased physical activity. Those who experimented with new skills post-workshop were encouraged by patient responsiveness and outcomes. 2) MI's relationship with routine clinical practice: some believed they already used elements of MI, but most participants felt MI was fundamentally 'different' to their normal style of working. 3) Implementation issues: additional time would need to be made available to enable an appropriate depth of conversation. 4) Training issues: Participants sensed the complexity of MI could make it difficult to learn and that it would take them time to become competent. On-going supervision was perceived as necessary. One key challenge identified was how to suppress behaviours that are antithetical to MI. These findings lend support to the feasibility of using MI in respiratory contexts such as pulmonary rehabilitation programmes, but highlight implementation and training issues that would need to be overcome. The insights have informed the development of another study, testing the effect of a tailored training package on MI skill, specifically for respiratory clinicians delivering pulmonary rehabilitation programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2767012268,"The assignation of lineages in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) provides valuable information for evolutionary and phylogeographic studies and makes for more accurate knowledge of the distribution of this pathogen worldwide. Differences in virulence have also been found for certain lineages. MTB isolates were initially assigned to lineages based on data obtained from genotyping techniques, such as spoligotyping or MIRU-VNTR analysis, some of which are more suitable for molecular epidemiology studies. However, since these methods are subject to a certain degree of homoplasy, other criteria have been chosen to assign lineages. These are based on targeting robust and specific SNPs for each lineage. Here, we propose two newly designed multiplex targeting methods-both of which are single-tube tests-to optimize the assignation of the six main lineages in MTB. The first method is based on ASO-PCR and offers an inexpensive and easy-to-implement assay for laboratories with limited resources. The other, which is based on SNaPshot, enables more refined standardized assignation of lineages for laboratories with better resources. Both methods performed well when assigning lineages from cultured isolates from a control panel, a test panel, and a problem panel from an unrelated population, Mexico, which included isolates in which standard genotyping was not able to classify lineages. Both tests were also able to assign lineages from stored isolates, without the need for subculture or purification of DNA, and even directly from clinical specimens with a medium-high bacilli burden. Our assays could broaden the contexts where information on lineages can be acquired, thus enabling us to quickly update data from retrospective collections and to merge data with those obtained at the time of diagnosis of a new TB case."

BPH is characterized by an en- largement of prostate tissue associated with increased tone of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) which surround the single glands composing the prostate. Secretions of the glands leave the prostate through local excretory ducts during the emission phase of ejaculation. Pharmacological treatment of BPH suggests different local drug targets based on reduction of prostate smooth muscle tone as the main effect and disturbed ejaculation as a common side effect. This highlights the need for detailed investigation of single prostate glands and ducts. We combined structural and functional imaging techniques—notably, clear lipid-exchanged, acrylamide-hybridized rigid imaging/immunos- taining/insitu hybridization-compatible tissue-hydrogel (CLARITY) and time-lapse imaging—and defined glands and ducts as distinct SMC compartments in human and rat prostate tissue. The single glands of the prostate (comprising the secretory part) are characterized by spontaneous contractions mediated by the surrounding SMCs, whereas the ducts (excretory part) are quiescent. In both SMC compartments, phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 is expressed. PDE5 inhibitors have recently emerged as alternative treatment options for BPH. We directly visualized that the PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil and tadalafil act by reducing spontaneous contractility of the glands, thereby reducing the muscle tone of the organ. In contrast, the ductal (excretory) system and thus the prostate's contribution to ejaculation is unaffected by PDE5 inhibitors. Our differentiated imaging approach reveals new details about prostate function and local drug actions and thus may support clinical management of BPH.—Kügler, R., Mietens, A., Seidensticker, M., Tasch, S., Wagenlehner, F.

https://openalex.org/W2765676404,"Alaska Native people experience disparities in mortality from heart disease and stroke. This work attempts to better understand the relationships between socioeconomic, behavioral, and cardiometabolic risk factors among Yup’ik people of southwestern Alaska, with a focus on the role of the socioeconomic, and cultural components. Using a cross-sectional sample of 486 Yup’ik adults, we fitted a Partial Least Squares Path Model (PLS-PM) to assess the associations between components, including demographic factors [age and gender], socioeconomic factors [education, economic status, Yup’ik culture, and Western culture], behavioral factors [diet, cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use, and physical activity], and cardiometabolic risk factors [adiposity, triglyceride-HDL and LDL lipids, glycemia, and blood pressure]. We found relatively mild associations of education and economic status with cardiometabolic risk factors, in contrast with studies in other populations. The socioeconomic factor and participation in Yup’ik culture had potentially protective associations with adiposity, triglyceride-HDL lipids, and blood pressure, whereas participation in Western culture had a protective association with blood pressure. We also found a moderating effect of participation in Western culture on the relationships between Yup’ik culture participation and both blood pressure and LDL lipids, indicating a potentially beneficial additional effect of bi-culturalism. Our results suggest that reinforcing protective effects of both Yup’ik and Western cultures could be useful for interventions aimed at reducing cardiometabolic health disparities."
https://openalex.org/W2766175923,"Despite the extensive geological and paleontological searches in the south Levant, no terrestrial fauna of late Neogene age was yet reported. Here, we report the first evidence of ""ancient deer""-cervid in the late Miocene (Tortonian) lacustrine section of the Bira Formation at Hagal Stream, Jordan Valley, northern Israel. The section comprises rich assemblage of macrofauna fossils, mostly freshwater mollusks. The mammalian bone was discovered among the macrofauna fossils, and is described as an almost complete left humerus of an adult animal identified as an artiodactyls element probably of a cervid. This terrestrial mammal shares similar paleoenvironmental conditions with other contemporaneous localities, where cervids prevailed with bovids and other taxa. It appears that the freshwater lakes provided favorite habitat for the development of the cervids and possibly other mammals. The specific conditions of preservation of the cervid illuminate the role of post depositional processes (taphonomic constrains) in masking terrestrial fauna remains in the region. Accordingly, further efforts will be devoted to unveil the mute part of the southern Levant-east Mediterranean terrestrial faunistic realm at the end of the Miocene."
https://openalex.org/W2766540468,"In Ghana, priority-setting for reproductive health service interventions is known to be rudimentary with little wider stakeholder involvement. In recognizing the need for broad stakeholder engagement to advance reproductive care provision and utilization, it is necessary to jointly study the varied stakeholder views on reproductive care services.We applied an ethnographic study approach where field data was collected between March-May 2015 in three rural districts of northern Ghana. Data was collected among women with recent births experiences (n = 90), health care providers (n = 16) and policy actors (n = 6). In-depth interviews and focus group discussions was applied to collect all data. Each stakeholder participant's audio file was transcribed, and repeatedly read through to identify similar and divergent views in data. A coding scheme guided coding processes. All transcripts were then imported into QSR NVivo 11 for further analysis.Four themes emerged. Women participants accentuated that sex and sexuality values of men have changed over time, and drives gender roles, parity levels and decision making on reproductive care needs at community levels. Sexual stigma on reproductive care reduces the willingness of women to voice poor experiences related to their previous reproductive experiences. All stakeholders' highlighted clinical treatments for post-abortion care are minimally covered under the fee exemption policy for antenatal and postnatal care. Policy processes on service delivery protocols still is top-down in Ghana.Health teams working to improve sexual and reproductive health care must find suitable context strategies that effectively work to improve women reproductive care needs at their operational levels. Private sector participation and informal community support clutches are encouraged to advance the delivery of reproductive care services."
