https://openalex.org/W2605630275,"Despite the success of monotherapies based on blockade of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) in human melanoma, most patients do not experience durable clinical benefit. Pre-existing T-cell infiltration and/or the presence of PD-L1 in tumours may be used as indicators of clinical response; however, blood-based profiling to understand the mechanisms of PD-1 blockade has not been widely explored. Here we use immune profiling of peripheral blood from patients with stage IV melanoma before and after treatment with the PD-1-targeting antibody pembrolizumab and identify pharmacodynamic changes in circulating exhausted-phenotype CD8 T cells (Tex cells). Most of the patients demonstrated an immunological response to pembrolizumab. Clinical failure in many patients was not solely due to an inability to induce immune reinvigoration, but rather resulted from an imbalance between T-cell reinvigoration and tumour burden. The magnitude of reinvigoration of circulating Tex cells determined in relation to pretreatment tumour burden correlated with clinical response. By focused profiling of a mechanistically relevant circulating T-cell subpopulation calibrated to pretreatment disease burden, we identify a clinically accessible potential on-treatment predictor of response to PD-1 blockade."

We applied this one-step strategy to activate multiple BGCs of different classes in five Streptomyces species and triggered the production of unique metabolites, including a novel pentangular type II polyketide in Streptomyces viridochromogenes. This potentially scalable strategy complements existing activation approaches and facilitates discovery efforts to uncover new compounds with interesting bioactivities."

However, recycling agricultural and forestry wastes is a challenge. A solution may be found in the forest. Saprotrophic white-rot fungi are able to convert dead plants into consumable carbon sources. Specialized fungal enzymes can be utilized for breaking down hard plant biopolymers. Thus, understanding the enzymatic machineries of such fungi gives us hints for the efficient decomposition of plant materials. Using the saprotrophic white-rot fungus Pycnoporus coccineus as a fungal model, we examined the dynamics of transcriptomic and secretomic responses to different types of lignocellulosic substrates at two time points. Our integrative omics pipeline (SHIN+GO) enabled us to compress layers of biological information into simple heatmaps, allowing for visual inspection of the data. We identified co-regulated genes with corresponding co-secreted enzymes, and the biological roles were extrapolated with the enriched Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme (CAZymes) and functional annotations. We observed the fungal early responses for the degradation of lignocellulosic substrates including; 1) simultaneous expression of CAZy genes and secretion of the enzymes acting on diverse glycosidic bonds in cellulose, hemicelluloses and their side chains or lignin (i.e. hydrolases, esterases and oxido-reductases); 2) the key role of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO); 3) the early transcriptional regulation of lignin active peroxidases; 4) the induction of detoxification processes dealing with biomass-derived compounds; and 5) the frequent attachments of the carbohydrate binding module 1 (CBM1) to enzymes from the lignocellulose-responsive genes. Our omics combining methods and related biological findings may contribute to the knowledge of fungal systems biology and facilitate the optimization of fungal enzyme cocktails for various industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2606425707,"Sound units play a pivotal role in cognitive models of auditory comprehension. The general consensus is that during perception listeners break down speech into auditory words and subsequently phones. Indeed, cognitive speech recognition is typically taken to be computationally intractable without phones. Here we present a computational model trained on 20 hours of conversational speech that recognizes word meanings within the range of human performance (model 25%, native speakers 20–44%), without making use of phone or word form representations. Our model also generates successfully predictions about the speed and accuracy of human auditory comprehension. At the heart of the model is a ‘wide’ yet sparse two-layer artificial neural network with some hundred thousand input units representing summaries of changes in acoustic frequency bands, and proxies for lexical meanings as output units. We believe that our model holds promise for resolving longstanding theoretical problems surrounding the notion of the phone in linguistic theory."
https://openalex.org/W2606130181,"Metal tolerance proteins (MTPs) are a gene family of cation efflux transporters that occur widely in plants and might serve an essential role in metal homeostasis and tolerance. Our research describes the identification, characterization, and localization of OsMTP11, a member of the MTP family from rice. OsMTP11 was expressed constitutively and universally in different tissues in rice plant. Heterologous expression in yeast showed that OsMTP11 complemented the hypersensitivity of mutant strains to Mn, and also complemented yeast mutants to other metals, including Co and Ni. Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated OsMTP11 expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of OsMTP11 involvement in heavy metal stress responses. Promoter analysis by transgenic assays with GUS as a reporter gene and mRNA in situ hybridization experiments showed that OsMTP11 was expressed specifically in conducting tissues in rice. DNA methylation assays of genomic DNA in rice treated with Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn revealed that decreased DNA methylation levels were present in the OsMTP11 promoter region, which was consistent with OsMTP11 induced-expression patterns resulting from heavy metal stress. This result suggested that DNA methylation is one of major factors regulating expression of OsMTP11 through epigenetic mechanisms. OsMTP11 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) localized to the entire onion epidermal cell cytoplasm, while vacuolar membrane exhibited increased GFP signals, consistent with an OsMTP11 function in cation sequestration. Our results indicated that OsMTP11 might play vital roles in Mn and other heavy metal transportation in rice."

VDAC1 co-purifies with cholesterol and is functionally regulated by cholesterol, among other endogenous lipids. Molecular modeling studies based on NMR observations have suggested five cholesterol-binding sites in VDAC1, but direct experimental evidence for these sites is lacking. Here, to determine the sites of cholesterol binding, we photolabeled purified mouse VDAC1 (mVDAC1) with photoactivatable cholesterol analogues and analyzed the photolabeled sites with both top-down mass spectrometry (MS), and bottom-up MS paired with a clickable, stable isotope-labeled tag, FLI-tag. Using cholesterol analogues with a diazirine in either the 7 position of the steroid ring (LKM38) or the aliphatic tail (KK174), we mapped a binding pocket in mVDAC1 localized to Thr83 and Glu73, respectively. When Glu73 was mutated to a glutamine, KK174 no longer photolabeled this residue, but instead labeled the nearby Tyr62 within this same binding pocket. The combination of analytical strategies employed in this work permits detailed molecular mapping of a cholesterol-binding site in a protein, including an orientation of the sterol within the site. Our work raises the interesting possibility that cholesterol-mediated regulation of VDAC1 may be facilitated through a specific binding site at the functionally important Glu73 residue.

https://openalex.org/W2607434764,"The complement system, and specifically C5a, is involved in renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. The 2 receptors for complement anaphylatoxin C5a (C5aR1 and C5aR2) are expressed on leukocytes as well as on renal epithelium. Extensive evidence shows that C5aR1 inhibition protects kidneys from IR injury; however, the role of C5aR2 in IR injury is less clear as initial studies proposed the hypothesis that C5aR2 functions as a decoy receptor. By Using wild-type, C5aR1-/-, and C5aR2-/- mice in a model of renal IR injury, we found that a deficiency of either of these receptors protected mice from renal IR injury. Surprisingly, C5aR2-/- mice were most protected and had lower creatinine levels and reduced acute tubular necrosis. Next, an in vivo migration study demonstrated that leukocyte chemotaxis was unaffected in C5aR2-/- mice, whereas neutrophil activation was reduced by C5aR2 deficiency. To further investigate the contribution of renal cell-expressed C5aR2 vs leukocyte-expressed C5aR2 to renal IR injury, bone marrow chimeras were created. Our data show that both renal cell-expressed C5aR2 and leukocyte-expressed C5aR2 mediate IR-induced renal dysfunction. These studies reveal the importance of C5aR2 in renal IR injury. They further show that C5aR2 is a functional receptor, rather than a decoy receptor, and may provide a new target for intervention.-Poppelaars, F., van Werkhoven, M. B., Kotimaa, J., Veldhuis, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2605409124,"We suggest a procedure for estimating Nth degree polynomial approximations to unknown (or known) probability density functions (PDFs) based on N statistical moments from each distribution. The procedure is based on the method of moments and is setup algorithmically to aid applicability and to ensure rigor in use. In order to show applicability, polynomial PDF approximations are obtained for the distribution families Normal, Log-Normal, Weibull as well as for a bimodal Weibull distribution and a data set of anonymized household electricity use. The results are compared with results for traditional PDF series expansion methods of Gram–Charlier type. It is concluded that this procedure is a comparatively simple procedure that could be used when traditional distribution families are not applicable or when polynomial expansions of probability distributions might be considered useful approximations. In particular this approach is practical for calculating convolutions of distributions, since such operations become integrals of polynomial expressions. Finally, in order to show an advanced applicability of the method, it is shown to be useful for approximating solutions to the Smoluchowski equation."
https://openalex.org/W2605480320,"Wetlands harbor an important compliment of regional plant diversity, but in many regions data on wetland diversity and composition is still lacking, thus hindering our understanding of the processes that control it. While patterns of broad-scale terrestrial diversity and composition typically correlate with contemporary climate it is not clear to what extent patterns in wetlands are complimentary, or conflicting. To elucidate this, we consolidate data from wetland forest inventories in Brazil and examine patterns of diversity and composition along temperature and rainfall gradients spanning five biomes. We collated 196 floristic inventories covering an area >220 ha and including >260,000 woody individuals. We detected a total of 2,453 tree species, with the Amazon alone accounting for nearly half. Compositional patterns indicated differences in freshwater wetland floras among Brazilian biomes, although biomes with drier, more seasonal climates tended to have a larger proportion of more widely distributed species. Maximal alpha diversity increased with annual temperature, rainfall, and decreasing seasonality, patterns broadly consistent with upland vegetation communities. However, alpha diversity-climate relationships were only revealed at higher diversity values associated with the uppermost quantiles, and in most sites diversity varied irrespective of climate. Likewise, mean biome-level differences in alpha-diversity were unexpectedly modest, even in comparisons of savanna-area wetlands to those of nearby forested regions. We describe attenuated wetland climate-diversity relationships as a shifting balance of local and regional effects on species recruitment. Locally, excessive waterlogging strongly filters species able to colonize from regional pools. On the other hand, increased water availability can accommodate a rich community of drought-sensitive immigrant species that are able to track buffered wetland microclimates. We argue that environmental conditions in many wetlands are not homogeneous with respect to regional climate, and that responses of wetland tree communities to future climate change may lag behind that of non-wetland, terrestrial habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2605428395,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) is the causative agent of canine distemper (CD) that is a highly contagious, lethal, multisystemic viral disease of receptive carnivores. The prevalence of CDV is a major concern in susceptible animals. Presently, it is unclear whether intragenic recombination can contribute to gene mutations and segment reassortment in the virus. In this study, 25 full-length CDV genome sequences were subjected to phylogenetic and recombinational analyses. The results of phylogenetic analysis, intragenic recombination, and nucleotide selection pressure indicated that mutation and recombination occurred in the six individual genes segment (H, F, P, N, L, M) of the CDV genome. The analysis also revealed pronounced genetic diversity in the CDV genome according to the geographically distinct lineages (genotypes), namely Asia-1, Asia-2, Asia-3, Europe, America-1, and America-2. The six recombination events were detected using SimPlot and RDP programs. The analysis of selection pressure demonstrated that a majority of the nucleotides in the CDV individual gene were under negative selection. Collectively, these data suggested that homologous recombination acts as a key force driving the genetic diversity and evolution of canine distemper virus."
https://openalex.org/W2605596567,"Molting is an essential biological process throughout the life history of crustaceans, which is regulated by many neuropeptide hormones expressed in the eyestalk. To better understand the molting mechanism in Portunus trituberculatus, we used digital gene expression (DGE) to analyze single eyestalk samples during the molting cycle by high-throughput sequencing.We obtained 14,387,942, 12,631,508 and 13,060,062 clean sequence reads from inter-molt (InM), pre-molt (PrM) and post-molt (PoM) cDNA libraries, respectively. A total of 1,394 molt-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis identified some important processes and pathways with key roles in molting regulation, such as chitin metabolism, peptidase inhibitor activity, and the ribosome. We first observed a pattern associated with the neuromodulator-related pathways during the molting cycle, which were up-regulated in PrM and down-regulated in PoM. Four categories of important molting-related transcripts were clustered and most of them had similar expression patterns, which suggests that there is a connection between these genes throughout the molt cycle.Our work is the first molt-related investigation of P. trituberculatus focusing on the eyestalk at the whole transcriptome level. Together, our results, including DEGs, identification of molting-related biological processes and pathways, and observed expression patterns of important genes, provide a novel insight into the function of the eyestalk in molting regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2606836609,"Traditionally, the tribe Sophoreae sensu lato has been considered a basal but also heterogeneous taxonomic group of the papilionoid legumes. Phylogenetic studies have placed Sophoreae sensu stricto (s.s.) as a member of the core genistoids. The recently suggested new circumscription of this tribe involved the removal of traditional members and the inclusion of Euchresteae and Thermopsideae. Nonetheless, definitions and inter- and intra-taxonomic issues of Sophoreae remain unclear. Within the field of legume systematics, the molecular characteristics of a plastid genome (plastome) have an important role in helping to define taxonomic groups. Here, we examined the plastome of Maackia fauriei, belonging to Sophoreae s.s., to elucidate the molecular characteristics of Sophoreae. Its gene contents are similar to the plastomes of other typical legumes. Putative pseudogene rps16 of Maackia and Lupinus species imply independent functional gene loss from the genistoids. Our overall examination of that loss among legumes suggests that it is common among all major clades of Papilionoideae. The M. fauriei plastome has a novel 24-kb inversion in its large single copy region, as well as previously recognized 50-kb and 36-kb inversions. The 36-kb inversion is shared by the core genistoids. The 24-kb inversion is present in the eight genera belonging to three tribes: Euchresteae, Sophoreae s.s., and Thermopsideae. The phylogenetic distribution of this 24-kb inversion strongly supports the monophyly of members of Sophoreae s.s. with Euchresteae and Thermopsideae. Hence, it can be used as a putative synapomorphic characteristic for the newly circumscribed Sophoreae, including Euchresteae and Thermopsideae. However, plastome conformation suggests a slightly narrower taxonomic group because of heterogeneous results from Bolusanthus and Dicraeopetalum. The phylogenetic analysis, based on plastome sequences from 43 legumes, represents well our understanding of legume systematics while resolving the genistoid clade as a sister group to an Old World clade. It also demonstrates the value that plastomes are powerful marker for systematic studies of basal papilionoid legumes."
https://openalex.org/W2607439261,"Two rapid dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays were evaluated for detecting M. tuberculosis and related pathogens in cultures. The MN Genus-MTBC FISH assay uses an orange fluorescent probe specific for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and a green fluorescent probe specific for the Mycobacterium and Nocardia genera (MN Genus) to detect and distinguish MTBC from other Mycobacteria and Nocardia. A complementary MTBC-MAC FISH assay uses green and orange fluorescent probes specific for the MTBC and M. avium complex (MAC) respectively to identify and differentiate the two species complexes. The assays are performed on acid-fast staining bacteria from liquid or solid cultures in less than two hours. Forty-three of 44 reference mycobacterial isolates were correctly identified by the MN Genus-specific probe as Mycobacterium species, with six of these correctly identified as MTBC with the MTBC-specific probe and 14 correctly as MAC by the MAC-specific probe. Of the 25 reference isolates of clinically relevant pathogens of other genera tested, only four isolates representing two species of Corynebacterium gave a positive signal with the MN Genus probe. None of these 25 isolates were detected by the MTBC and MAC specific probes. A total of 248 cultures of clinical mycobacterial isolates originating in India, Peru and the USA were also tested by FISH assays. DNA sequence of a part of the 23S ribosomal RNA gene amplified by PCR was obtained from 243 of the 248 clinical isolates. All 243 were confirmed by DNA sequencing as Mycobacterium species, with 157 and 50 of these identified as belonging to the MTBC and the MAC, respectively. The accuracy of the MN Genus-, MTBC-and MAC -specific probes in identifying these 243 cultures in relation to their DNA sequence-based identification was 100%. All ten isolates of Nocardia, (three reference strains and seven clinical isolates) tested were detected by the MN Genus-specific probe but not the MTBC- or MAC-specific probes. The limit of detection for M. tuberculosis was determined to be 5.1x104 cfu per ml and for M. avium 1.5x104 cfu per ml in liquid cultures with the respective MTBC- and MAC-specific probes in both the MN Genus-MTBC and MTBC-MAC FISH assays. The only specialized equipment needed for the FISH assays is a standard light microscope fitted with a LED light source and appropriate filters. The two FISH assays meet an important diagnostic need in peripheral laboratories of resource-limited tuberculosis-endemic countries."
https://openalex.org/W2606732130,"Balaenid whales feed on large aggregates of small and slow-moving prey (predominantly copepods) through a filtration process enabled by baleen. These whales exhibit continuous filtration, namely, with the mouth kept partially opened and the baleen exposed to oncoming prey-laden waters while fluking. The process is an example of crossflow filtration (CFF) in which most of the particulates (prey) are separated from the substrate (water) without ever coming into contact with the filtering surface (baleen). This paper discusses the simulation of baleen filtration hydrodynamics based on a type of hydraulic circuit modeling commonly used in microfluidics, but adapted to the much higher Reynolds number flows typical of whale hydrodynamics. This so-called Baleen Hydraulic Circuit (BHC) model uses as input the basic characteristics of the flows moving through a section of baleen observed in a previous flume study by the authors. The model has low-spatial resolution but incorporates the effects of fluid viscosity, which doubles or more a whale's total body drag in comparison to non-feeding travel. Modeling viscous friction is crucial here since exposing the baleen system to the open ocean ends up tripling a whale's total wetted surface area. Among other findings, the BHC shows how CFF is enhanced by a large filtration surface and hence large body size; how it is carried out via the establishment of rapid anteroposterior flows transporting most of the prey-water slurry towards the oropharyngeal wall; how slower intra-baleen flows manage to transfer most of the substrate out of the mouth, all the while contributing only a fraction to overall oral cavity drag; and how these anteroposterior and intra-baleen flows lose speed as they approach the oropharyngeal wall."
https://openalex.org/W2606465906,"Breeding for solid-stemmed durum (Triticum turgidum L. var durum) and common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars is one strategy to minimize yield losses caused by the wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus Norton). Major stem-solidness QTL have been localized to the long arm of chromosome 3B in both wheat species, but it is unclear if these QTL span a common genetic interval. In this study, we have improved the resolution of the QTL on chromosome 3B in a durum (Kofa/W9262-260D3) and common wheat (Lillian/Vesper) mapping population. Coincident QTL (LOD = 94–127, R2 = 78–92%) were localized near the telomere of chromosome 3BL in both mapping populations, which we designate SSt1. We further examined the SSt1 interval by using available consensus maps for durum and common wheat and compared genetic to physical intervals by anchoring markers to the current version of the wild emmer wheat (WEW) reference sequence. These results suggest that the SSt1 interval spans a physical distance of 1.6 Mb in WEW (positions 833.4–835.0 Mb). In addition, minor QTL were identified on chromosomes 2A, 2D, 4A, and 5A that were found to synergistically enhance expression of SSt1 to increase stem-solidness. These results suggest that developing new wheat cultivars with improved stem-solidness is possible by combining SSt1 with favorable alleles at minor loci within both wheat species."
https://openalex.org/W2606602000,"Investigating regulation and function of the Hox genes, key regulators of positional identity in the embryo, opened a new vista in developmental biology. One of their most striking features is collinearity: the temporal and spatial orders of expression of these clustered genes each match their 3' to 5' order on the chromosome. Despite recent progress, the mechanisms underlying collinearity are not understood. Here we show that ectopic expression of 4 different single Hox genes predictably induces and represses expression of others, leading to development of different predictable specific sections of the body axis. We use ectopic expression in wild-type and noggin-dorsalised (Hox-free) Xenopus embryos, to show that two Hox-Hox interactions are important. Posterior induction (induction of posterior Hox genes by anterior ones: PI), drives Hox temporal collinearity (Hox timer), which itself drives anteroposterior (A-P) patterning. Posterior prevalence (repression of anterior Hox genes by posterior ones: PP) is important in translating temporal to spatial collinearity. We thus demonstrate for the first time that two collinear Hox interactions are important for vertebrate axial patterning. These findings considerably extend and clarify earlier work suggesting the existence and importance of PP and PI, and provide a major new insight into genesis of the body axis."

An additional 4 porcine crystalline lenses were touched with either the HV or GV for 1 minute. Following PPV, human vitreous was removed and processed for electron microscopy (EM). Eyes and lenses were fixed and sectioned for light microscopy (LM).There were no macroscopic retinal or optic nerve defects associated with either HV or GV PPVs. Cadaveric retinal specimens showed separation of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) and vacuolization and fragmentation at the nerve fiber layer (NFL) and the ganglion cell layer (GCL). ILM fragmentation and separation were found after PPV in live swine with both vitrectors. Small disruptions of the posterior capsule or structural lens defects were found after HV touch. The EM analysis revealed more fragmentation of human vitreous collagen fibrils after HV compared to GV PPV.LM and EM analysis of retina, vitreous, and crystalline lens after PPV showed similar morphological changes using the HV or the GV. Vitreous fragmentation appeared more effective with the HV. Overall this study suggests that the HV may be a promising new technology. More work is needed to quantitatively assess its safety and efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2605568759,"Streptococcus mutans, the major causative agent of dental caries, adheres to tooth surfaces via the host salivary glycoprotein-340 (gp340). This adherence can be competitively inhibited by peptides derived from the SspA/B adhesins of Streptococcus gordonii, a human commensal microbe that competes for the same binding sites. Ssp(A4K-A11K), a double-lysine substituted SspA/B peptide analogue, has been shown to exhibit superior in vitro binding affinity for a gp340-derived peptide (SRCRP2), suggesting that Ssp(A4K-A11K) may be of clinical interest. In the present work, we tested the inhibitory effects of Ssp(A4K-A11K) on adherence and biofilm formation of S. mutans by reconstructing an artificial oral environment using saliva-coated polystyrene plates and hydroxyapatite disks. Bacterial adherence (adherence period: 1 h) was assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using biotinylated bacterial cells. Biofilm formation (periods: 8, 11, or 14 h) was assessed by staining and imaging of the sessile cells, or by recovering biofilm cells and plating for cell counts. The pH values of the culture media were measured as a biofilm acidogenicity indicator. Bactericidality was measured by loss of optical density during culturing in the presence of the peptide. We observed that 650 μM Ssp(A4K-A11K) significantly inhibited adherence of S. mutans to saliva-coated polystyrene; a similar effect was seen on bacterial affinity for SRCRP2. Ssp(A4K-A11K) had lesser effects on the adherence of commensal streptococci. Pretreatment of polystyrene and hydroxyapatite with 650 μM Ssp(A4K-A11K) significantly attenuated biofilm formation, whether tested with glucose- or sucrose-containing media. The SspA/B peptide’s activity did not reflect bactericidality. Strikingly, pH in Ssp-treated 8-h (6.8 ± 0.06) and 11-h (5.5 ± 0.06) biofilms showed higher values than the critical pH. Thus, Ssp(A4K-A11K) acts by inhibiting bacterial adherence and cariogrnic biofilm formation. We further consider these results in the context of the safety, specificity, and stability properties of the Ssp(A4K-A11K) peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2606607859,"We used a mobile eye-tracking system (in the form of glasses) to study the characteristics of visual perception in decision making in the Prisoner's Dilemma game. In each experiment, one of the 12 participants was equipped with eye-tracking glasses. The experiment was conducted in three stages: an anonymous Individual Game stage against a randomly chosen partner (one of the 12 other participants of the experiment); a Socialization stage, in which the participants were divided into two groups; and a Group Game stage, in which the participants played with partners in the groups. After each round, the respondent received information about his or her personal score in the last round and the overall winner of the game at the moment. The study proves that eye-tracking systems can be used for studying the process of decision making and forecasting. The total viewing time and the time of fixation on areas corresponding to noncooperative decisions is related to the participants' overall level of cooperation. The increase in the total viewing time and the time of fixation on the areas of noncooperative choice is due to a preference for noncooperative decisions and a decrease in the overall level of cooperation. The number of fixations on the group attributes is associated with group identity, but does not necessarily lead to cooperative behavior."

Results from previous studies have suggested that the WW domain of IQGAP1 binds to the cancer-associated MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2, and that this domain might thus offer a new tool to selectively inhibit MAPK activation in cancer cells. The goal of this work was therefore to critically evaluate which IQGAP1 domains bind to ERK1/2. Here, using quantitative in vitro binding assays, we show that the IQ domain of IQGAP1 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to ERK1 and ERK2, as well as to the MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2. Furthermore, we show that the WW domain is not required for ERK-IQGAP1 binding, and contributes little or no binding energy to this interaction, challenging previous models of how WW-based peptides might inhibit tumorigenesis. Finally, we show that the ERK2-IQGAP1 interaction does not require ERK2 phosphorylation or catalytic activity and does not involve known docking recruitment sites on ERK2, and we obtain an estimate of the dissociation constant (Kd) for this interaction of 8 μm. These results prompt a re-evaluation of published findings and a refined model of IQGAP scaffolding.

https://openalex.org/W2606504480,"The cyclic dinucleotides, GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and c-di-AMP [bis-(3',5')-cyclic dimeric AMP], are potent type I IFN inducers via STING-TBK1-IRF3 cascade. They are promising adjuvants that promote antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in different preclinical models; however, an optimal outcome of vaccination depends on a balanced immune activation. Here, we characterize the process of IFN-β induction by c-di-AMP and cGAMP in an in vitro model on the basis of primary mouse dendritic cells. Results obtained show decreased IFN-β production upon prolonged cell stimulation. We demonstrate that this effect depends on c-di-AMP/cGAMP-mediated down-regulation of stimulator of IFN gene (STING) protein levels. These results were confirmed by using human peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived dendritic cells. Studies performed to explore the potential mechanism of STING modulation suggested proteolytic degradation to be a contributing factor to the observed decrease in cellular STING levels. Our work contributes to the elucidation of the molecular mode of action of vaccine constituents, which, in turn, is a prerequisite for the rational design of vaccines with predictable efficacy and safety profiles-Rueckert, C., Rand, U., Roy, U., Kasmapour, B., Strowig, T., Guzman, C.

https://openalex.org/W2606875154,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) ubiquitously exist in microorganisms, plants, and animals, and appear to modulate a wide range of critical biological processes. However, no definitive conclusion has been reached regarding the uptake of exogenous dietary small RNAs into mammalian circulation and organs and cross-kingdom regulation. One of the critical issues is our ability to assess and distinguish the origin of miRNAs. Although periodate oxidation has been used to differentiate mammalian and plant miRNAs, validation of treatment efficiency and the inclusion of proper controls for this method were lacking in previous studies. This study aimed to address: 1) the efficiency of periodate treatment in a plant or mammalian RNA matrix, and 2) the necessity of inclusion of internal controls. We designed and tested spike-in synthetic miRNAs in various plant and mammalian matrices and showed that they can be used as a control for the completion of periodate oxidation. We found that overloading the reaction system with high concentration of RNA resulted in incomplete oxidation of unmethylated miRNA. The abundant miRNAs from soy and corn were analyzed in the plasma, liver, and fecal samples of C57BL/6 mice fed a corn and soy-based chow diet using our improved methodology. The improvement resulted in the elimination of the false positive detection in the liver, and we did not detect plant miRNAs in the mouse plasma or liver samples. In summary, an improved methodology was developed for plant miRNA detection that appears to work well in different sample matrices."
https://openalex.org/W2607201739,"Background Ibutilide, a class III antiarrhythmic agent has been shown to be cardioprotective in treating atrial fibrillation, promoting cardioconversion and recently this agent has been shown to protect against ER stress induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. In this study we begin to identify the mechanism by which ibutilide exerts its cardioprotection in tunicamycin treated cardiomyocytes. We examined ER stress markers including calumenin; a calcium binding ER chaperone protein that has recently been linked to ER stress in cardiomyocytes, in our treated cells. Methods To assess the effect of ibutilide we used the well characterized in vitro model of ER stress induced apoptosis in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (RNC). RNC were treated with tunicamycin and the degree of ER stress was assessed by quantifying mRNA and protein levels of GRP78, GRP94 and calumenin, and examined the extent of apoptosis by assessing the protein levels of caspase-3/9/12, CHOP, ATF6, p-PERK, spliced XBP-1, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and the percentage of deoxynucleotidyl-transferase- mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells. Results We demonstrate ibutilide attenuated the up-regulation of ER stress markers GRP78 and GRP94 and rescued the decline in calumenin mRNA and protein levels in tunicamycin treated cardiomyocytes. The up-regulation of apoptotic markers caspase-3, CHOP, ATF6, p-PERK, spliced XBP-1, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and the percentage of TUNEL positive cells were also attenuated after ibutilide treatment while the protein levels of Caspase-9 and Caspase-12 were unaffected. Conclusions This study suggests another cardioprotective effect of the antiarrhythmic agent ibutilide whereby pretreatment leads to the attenuation of ER stress induced apoptosis by regulating calumenin expression. This study provides further evidence for the role of calumenin in the cardiomyocyte ER stress response."

Thus, this paper firstly collected 3D finger point cloud data by Structured-light Illumination method. Additional features from 3D fingerprint images are then studied and extracted. The applications of these features are finally discussed. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the helpfulness of 3D information to fingerprint recognition. Results show that a quick alignment can be easily implemented under the guidance of 3D finger shape feature even though this feature does not work for fingerprint recognition directly. The newly defined distinctive 3D shape ridge feature can be used for personal authentication with Equal Error Rate (EER) of ~8.3%. Also, it is helpful to remove false core point. Furthermore, a promising of EER ~1.3% is realized by combining this feature with 2D features for fingerprint recognition which indicates the prospect of 3D fingerprint recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2606478189,"Background Pregnancy is associated with changes in hematological and biochemistry values, yet there are no African reference intervals for clinical management of pregnant women. We sought to 1) develop laboratory reference intervals during pregnancy and up to 24 weeks postpartum and 2) determine the proportion of women in a previous clinical trial who would be misclassified as having out-of-range values using reference intervals from a United States (U.S.) population. Methods and findings This was a longitudinal sub-study of 120 clinically healthy, HIV-uninfected, self-selected pregnant women seeking antenatal care services at either of two public hospitals in western Kenya. Blood specimens were obtained from consented women at gestational ages 28 and 36 weeks and at 2, 6, 14 and 24 weeks postpartum. Median and 95% reference intervals were calculated for immune-hematological and biochemistry parameters and compared to reference intervals from a Kenyan and United States (U.S.) population, using Wilcoxon tests. Differences with p≤0.05 were considered significant. Some hematological parameters, including hemoglobin and neutrophils showed significant variations compared to reference intervals for non-pregnant women. Hemoglobin values were significantly lower during pregnancy but were comparable to the values in non-pregnant women by 6 weeks postpartum. CD4, CD8 and platelets were significantly elevated in early postpartum but declined gradually, reaching normal levels by 24 weeks postpartum. Using the new hemoglobin reference levels from this study to estimate prevalence of ‘out of range’ values in a prior Kisumu research cohort of pregnant/postpartum women, resulted in 0% out of range values, in contrast to 96.3% using US non-pregnant reference values Conclusion There were substantial differences in U.S. and Kenyan values for immune-hematological parameters among pregnant/postpartum women, specifically in red blood cell parameters in late pregnancy and 2 weeks postpartum. Use of U.S. reference intervals markedly increases likelihood of out of range values, highlighting the need for suitable locally developed reference intervals."

However, this information may be unavailable or inaccurate, particularly for patients with multiple treatment lines often attending different clinics. We trained statistical models for predicting drug exposure from current HIV-1 genotype. These models were trained on 63,742 HIV-1 nucleotide sequences derived from patients with known therapeutic history, and on 6,836 genotype-phenotype pairs (GPPs). The mean performance regarding prediction of drug exposure on two test sets was 0.78 and 0.76 (ROC-AUC), respectively. The mean correlation to phenotypic resistance in GPPs was 0.51 (PhenoSense) and 0.46 (Antivirogram). Performance on prediction of therapy-success on two test sets based on genetic susceptibility scores was 0.71 and 0.63 (ROC-AUC), respectively. Compared to geno2pheno[resistance], our novel models display a similar or superior performance. Our models are freely available on the internet via www.geno2pheno.org. They can be used for inferring which drug compounds have previously been used by an HIV-1-infected patient, for predicting drug resistance, and for selecting an optimal antiretroviral therapy. Our data-driven models can be periodically retrained without expert intervention as clinical HIV-1 databases are updated and therefore reduce our dependency on hard-to-obtain GPPs."

Cervical length measurements were carried out at 20 to 24 weeks' gestation and at 28 to 32 weeks' gestation. Both placentas of each twin pair were examined histologically after delivery. The generalized estimation equations models and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analyses.Multivariable generalized estimation equations analysis revealed that short cervical length at mid-trimester was independently associated with an increased risk for subsequent histologic chorioamnionitis, whereas short cervical length initially detected early in the third trimester was not. By using the likelihood of SPTB as an outcome variable, multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that short mid-trimester cervical length and histologic chorioamnionitis were independently associated with a greater risk for SPTB. Similarly, based on the multivariable analysis, a short third trimester cervical length was independently and significantly associated with a greater risk for SPTB.In asymptomatic women with twin pregnancies, a short mid-trimester cervical length is independently associated with an increased risk of both subsequent histologic chorioamnionitis and SPTB, whereas a short cervical length initially detected early in the third trimester is independently associated with preterm delivery, but not subsequent histologic chorioamnionitis."
https://openalex.org/W2606487224,"Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is a lipid mediator involved in sleep regulation and inflammation. PGD2 interacts with 2 types of G protein-coupled receptors, DP1 and DP2/CRTH2 (chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on T helper type 2 cells)/GPR44 to show a variety of biological effects. DP1 activation leads to Gs-mediated elevation of the intracellular cAMP level, whereas activation of DP2 decreases this level via the Gi pathway; and it also induces G protein-independent, arrestin-mediated cellular responses. Activation of DP2 by PGD2 causes the progression of inflammation via the recruitment of lymphocytes by enhancing the production of Th2-cytokines. Here we developed monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the extracellular domain of mouse DP2 by immunization of DP2-null mutant mice with DP2-overexpressing BAF3, murine interleukin-3 dependent pro-B cells, to reduce the generation of antibodies against the host cells by immunization of mice. Moreover, we immunized DP2-KO mice to prevent immunological tolerance to mDP2 protein. After cell ELISA, immunocytochemical, and Western blot analyses, we successfully obtained a novel monoclonal antibody, MAb-1D8, that specifically recognized native mouse DP2, but neither human DP2 nor denatured mouse DP2, by binding to a particular 3D receptor conformation formed by the N-terminus and extracellular loop 1, 2, and 3 of DP2. This antibody inhibited the binding of 0.5 nM [3H]PGD2 to mouse DP2 (IC50 = 46.3 ± 18.6 nM), showed antagonistic activity toward 15(R)-15-methyl PGD2-induced inhibition of 300 nM forskolin-activated cAMP production (IC50 = 16.9 ± 2.6 nM), and gave positive results for immunohistochemical staining of DP2-expressing CD4+ Th2 lymphocytes that had accumulated in the kidney of unilateral ureteral obstruction model mice. This monoclonal antibody will be very useful for in vitro and in vivo studies on DP2-mediated diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2605486013,"Sleep duration varies widely across individuals and appears to be trait-like. Differences in the stability of underlying sleep processes may underlie this phenomenon. To investigate underlying mechanisms, we examined the relationship between sleep duration and sleep continuity in baseline polysomnography (PSG) recordings from three independently collected datasets: 1) 134 healthy controls (ages 37 ± 13 years) from the São Paulo Epidemiologic Sleep Study, who spent one night in a sleep laboratory, 2) 21 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients who were treated with continuous positive airway pressure for at least 2 months (45 ± 12 years, respiratory disturbance index <15), who spent one night in a sleep laboratory with previous experience of multiple PSG studies, and 3) 62 healthy controls (28 ± 6 years) who, as part of larger experiments, spent 2 consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory. For each dataset, we used total sleep time (TST) to separate subjects into those with shorter sleep (S-TST) and those with longer sleep (L-TST). In all three datasets, survival curves of continuous sleep segments showed greater sleep continuity in L-TST than in S-TST. Correlation analyses with TST as a continuous variable corroborated the results; and the results also held true after controlling for age. There were no significant differences in baseline waking performance and sleepiness between S-TST and L-TST. In conclusion, in both healthy controls and treated OSA patients, sleep continuity was positively correlated with sleep duration. These findings suggest that S-TST may differ from L-TST in processes underlying sleep continuity, shedding new light on mechanisms underlying individual differences in sleep duration."
https://openalex.org/W2606392405,"Ubiquitin ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) negatively regulates protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF-α). Loss of pVHL causes HIF-α accumulation, which contributes to the pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. In contrast, v-Myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog-like 2 (MYBL2; B-Myb), a transcription factor, prevents VHL pathogenesis by regulating gene expression of HIF-independent pathways. Both HIF-α and B-Myb are targets of pVHL-mediated polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Here, we show that knockdown of HIF-2α induces downregulation of B-Myb in 786-O cells, which are deficient in pVHL, and this downregulation is prevented by proteasome inhibition. In the presence of pVHL and under hypoxia-like conditions, B-Myb and HIF-2α are both upregulated, and the upregulation of B-Myb requires expression of HIF-2α. We also show that HIF-2α and B-Myb interact in the nucleus, and this interaction is mediated by the central region of HIF-2α and the C-terminal region of B-Myb. These data indicate that oncogenic HIF-2α stabilizes B-Myb to suppress VHL pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2606816811,"The metformin label has recently been changed from serum creatinine (sCr)-based to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-based indication, which is expected to expand its use for patients with mild renal insufficiency. However, because the sCr level is lower in Asians than in Caucasians at the same level of renal function, this change might not expand metformin use in the Asian population. We investigated the effect of this change among Korean patients with diabetes.Data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009 to 2014 were used and included 4,127 adult patients with diabetes. The metformin eligibility was assessed by the sCr level (1.4 mg/dL for women and 1.5 mg/dL for men) or by eGFR categories (contraindicated, <30; indeterminate, ≥30, <45; likely safe, ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2) calculated by various eGFR equations including MDRD equation. We designated the 'expanding' and 'contracting' population as those who are likely safe according to eGFR among sCr-ineligible patients and those contraindicated according to eGFR among sCr-eligible patients, respectively. Results were weighted to the whole Korean adult population.All eGFR equations showed expansion in the population for whom metformin is likely safe, ranging from 14.3% to 19.9% of the sCr-ineligible population. With the MDRD equation, the expanding population was 15,264 (15.8%) and the contracting population was 0 (0.0%). Male sex and younger age were significantly associated with the expanding population.Contrary to our concern, prescribing metformin according to eGFR substantially expanded the indication of its use among the Korean diabetic patients."

https://openalex.org/W2607356628,"Despite massive investment in HIV control programs, HIV incidence rates in countries with generalized epidemics have not fallen for most of the last decade. It appears that those at risk are not adopting effective prevention strategies. Those who are unable to implement their prevention preferences are referred to as choice disabled. We examined how and to what extent structural intervention measures that support choice-disabled individuals can reduce HIV transmission and prevalence.A mathematical model was developed to describe HIV transmission among and between choice-disabled and choice-enabled individuals. Data were available from field trials identifying factors and effects of choice disability. The model was used to estimate the potential impact of an intervention strategy in which choice-disabled individuals are enabled to make prevention choices. Several scenarios were considered and compared: supporting only one or both genders; supporting only HIV- individuals or also HIV+ choice-disabled individuals.Substantial declines in HIV incidence and prevalence are observed when supportive interventions are included in the model. The magnitude of these declines depends on the scope of the intervention program. The largest positive effect occurs when the support program is offered regardless of HIV status.Addressing the effects of choice disability in any HIV intervention program could be crucial to the program's success. Structural intervention programs to support choice-disabled individuals in implementing prevention strategies greatly reduce HIV incidence and prevalence in mathematical models."
