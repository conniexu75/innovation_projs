https://openalex.org/W1571553794,"Elastin is critical to the structural integrity of a variety of connective tissues. Only a select group of enzymes has thus far been identified capable of cleaving insoluble elastin. Recently, we observed that human alveolar macrophages secrete elastase activity that is largely inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). This finding suggested that one or more of the metalloproteinases released by alveolar macrophages has elastase activity. Accordingly, we tested pure human interstitial collagenase, stromelysin, 92-kDa type IV collagenase, and 72-kDa type IV collagenase for elastolytic activity using kappa-elastin zymography and insoluble 3H-labeled elastin. The 92- and 72-kDa type IV collagenases were found to be elastolytic in both assay systems. A recombinant preparation of 92-kDa type IV collagenase with gelatinolytic activity was also found to be elastolytic. Organomercurial activation was essential to detect elastolytic activity of the native 92- and 72-kDa type IV collagenases and enhanced the elastase activity of the recombinant 92-kDa enzyme. On a molar basis the recombinant 92-kDa type IV collagenase was approximately 30% as active as human leukocyte elastase in solubilizing 3H-labeled elastin. Exogenously added TIMP in significant molar excess abolished the elastase activity of the 92- and 72-kDa type IV collagenases. Stromelysin and interstitial collagenase showed no significant elastolytic activity, although both were catalytically active against susceptible substrates. Conditioned media from cultures of human mononuclear phagocytes containing the 92-kDa enzyme produced a distinct zone of lysis in the kappa-elastin zymograms at this molecular mass. These results definitively extend the spectrum of human proteinases with elastolytic activity to metalloproteinases and suggest the enzymatic basis for elastase activity observed with certain cell types such as human alveolar macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1588015921,"Molecular cloning of human endothelial angiotensin I-converting enzyme (kininase II; EC 3.4.15.1) (ACE) has recently shown that the enzyme contains two large homologous domains (called here the N and C domains), each bearing a putative active site, identified by sequence comparisons with the active sites of other zinc metallopeptidases. However, the previous experiments with zinc or competitive ACE inhibitors suggested a single active site in ACE. To establish whether both domains of ACE are enzymatically active, a series of ACE mutants, each containing only one intact domain, were constructed by deletion or point mutations of putative critical residues of the other domain, and expressed in heterologous Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both domains are enzymatically active and cleave the C-terminal dipeptide of hippuryl-His-Leu or angiotensin I. Moreover, both domains have an absolute zinc requirement for activity, are activated by chloride and are sensitive to competitive ACE inhibitors, and appear to function independently. However, the two domains display different catalytic constants and different patterns of chloride activation. At high chloride concentrations, the C domain hydrolyzes the two substrates tested faster than does the N domain. His-361,365 and His-959,963 are established as essential residues in the N and C domains, respectively, most likely involved in zinc binding, and Glu-362 in the N domain and Glu-960 in the C domain are essential catalytic residues. These observations provide strong evidence that ACE possesses two independent catalytic domains and suggest that they may have different functions."
https://openalex.org/W2036021978,"The neocortex of the brain develops from a simple germinal layer into a complex multilayer structure. To investigate cellular interactions during early neocortical development, whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from neuroblasts in the ventricular zone of fetal rats. During early corticogenesis, neuroblasts are physiologically coupled by gap junctions into clusters of 15 to 90 cells. The coupled cells form columns within the ventricular zone and, by virtue of their membership in clusters, have low apparent membrane resistances and generate large responses to the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. As neuronal migration out of the ventricular zone progresses, the number of cells within the clusters decreases. These clusters allow direct cell to cell interaction at the earliest stages of corticogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1987098829,"Agrin is a component of the basal lamina that causes the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors on cultured muscle fibers. An agrin cDNA clone isolated from electromotor neurons of a marine ray was used to characterize the corresponding cDNAs from a rat embryonic spinal cord library. Analysis of a set of clones predicts a 1940 amino acid protein containing 141 cysteine residues. The predicted protein has nine domains homologous to protease inhibitors, a region similar to domain III of laminin, and four epidermal growth factor repeats. The agrin gene is expressed in rat embryonic nervous system and muscle. The rat agrin protein is concentrated at synapses, where it may play a role in development and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2090971571,"An orally effective, nonpeptide, vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist, OPC-21268, has been identified. This compound selectively antagonized binding to the V1 subtype of the vasopressin receptor in a competitive manner. In vivo, the compound acted as a specific antagonist of arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced vasoconstriction. After oral administration in conscious rats, the compound also antagonized pressor responses to AVP. OPC-21268 can be used to study the physiological role of AVP and may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W1601394191,"Selection of mutant Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells resistant to growth inhibition by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has led to the isolation of cell clones with distinct alterations in type I and II TGF-beta receptors. Certain mutant clones present a decreased number or complete loss of detectable type I receptor. Other clones show a loss and/or altered electrophoretic mobility of the type II receptor, with concomitant loss of the type I receptor. Using somatic cell hybridization analysis we demonstrate the recessive nature of these mutants with respect to the wild-type phenotype and define various mutant complementation groups. Among these, hybrids between cells that express only type II receptor (R mutants) and cells that express neither receptor type (DRa mutants) rescue wild-type expression of type I receptors. Moreover, these hybrids regain full responsiveness to TGF-beta 1, as measured by inhibition of DNA synthesis as well as stimulation of fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 production. These results provide evidence for an interaction between TGF-beta receptor components I and II and show that, in Mv1Lu cells, expression of both receptor types is required for mediation of biological responses to TGF-beta 1."
https://openalex.org/W1598321878,"The purified urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR) was cleaved into two fragments by mild chymotrypsin treatment. The smaller fragment (apparent Mr 16,000) possessed the ligand-binding capability, as shown by chemical cross-linking analysis. This fragment constituted the NH2-terminal part of the intact receptor, probably including the whole sequence 1-87, and contained N-linked carbohydrate. After detergent phase separation in the Triton X-114 system, the fragment was present in the water phase where its binding activity could be demonstrated in the absence of the rest of the protein. An analysis of internal homology in the amino acid sequence of u-PAR revealed the presence of three repeats of approximately 90 residues each. The ligand-binding fragment corresponds to the first repeat, supporting that this unit is a structurally autonomous domain. Domains homologous with the internal repeats of u-PAR constitute the extracellular part of Ly-6 antigens and of the squid glycoprotein Sgp-2. Like u-PAR, these proteins are attached to the membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. The hydrophilic, ligand-binding u-PAR domain identified in the present study has potential applications in interfering with cell-surface plasmin-mediated proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2021502471,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission after coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity is considered a cellular model of changes underlying learning and memory. In intact tissue, LTP has been observed only between populations of neurons, making analysis of mechanisms difficult. Transmission between individual pre- and postsynaptic hippocampal cells was studied, suggesting quantal amplitude distributions with little variability in quantal size. LTP between such pairs is manifested by large, persistent, and synapse-specific potentiation with a shift in amplitude distribution that suggests presynaptic changes. Oscillations in amplitude of transmission, apparently of presynaptic origin, are common and can be triggered by LTP."
https://openalex.org/W1525343967,"Two types of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (PI3K) have been purified 6250-fold (PI3KI) and 1250-fold (PI3KII) from the cytosol fraction of bovine thymus. Purified PI3KI and PI3KII were found to have apparent molecular masses of 110 and 190 kDa, respectively, by gel filtration. On the other hand, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, while the molecular mass of PI3KI was again estimated as 110 kDa, PI3KII showed two bands with apparent molecular masses of 110 and 85 kDa, suggesting a heterodimer form. Peptide mapping analysis demonstrated that the 110-kDa protein in PI3KII was the same protein as PI3KI. The specific activity of PI3KI was calculated as 250 nmol/min/mg of protein, while that of PI3KII was 50 nmol/min/mg of protein. The product of PI phosphorylation by PI3KI and PI3KII were confirmed as phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate by PartiSphere Sax column chromatography. The results show that there are two types of PI 3-kinase in bovine thymus. One exists as a monomer and the other as a heterodimer form. Furthermore, the biochemical properties of these two PI 3-kinases are markedly different. These two types of PI 3-kinase may be regulated differently under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1957748504,"The baculovirus expression system was used to overproduce the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen, EBNA1, in insect cells. EBNA1 overproduced via baculovirus expression (baculoEBNA1) was followed during purification to homogeneity using its ability to specifically retain the family of repeats of the latent origin of replication, oriP, onto nitrocellulose filters. A two-column procedure was developed which yields more than 1 mg of homogeneous baculoEBNA1 from 9 x 10(8) insect cells (1.5 liters). Pure baculoEBNA1 had no detectable ATPase or helicase activity. BaculoEBNA1 was labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in vivo, and analysis showed detectable levels of phosphoserine; no phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine could be detected. The baculoEBNA1 appeared dimeric in solution, and a stoichiometry of 56 baculoEBNA1 monomers per 24 EBNA1 binding sites in oriP suggests baculoEBNA1 binds its consensus site as a dimer. The binding of baculoEBNA1 to the dyad symmetry element of oriP (Kd approximately 2 nM) required more baculoEBNA1 and appeared less stable than the binding of baculoEBNA1 to the family of repeats in oriP (Kd approximately 0.2 nM)."
https://openalex.org/W1495024113,"Translocation of outer membrane precursor proteins across the Escherichia coli inner membrane is severely hampered in lipid biosynthetic mutants with strongly reduced phosphatidylglycerol (PG) levels (De Vrije, T., De Swart, R. L., Dowhan, W., Tommassen, J., and De Kruijff, B. (1988) Nature 334, 173-175; Lill, R., Dowhan, W., and Wickner, W. (1990) Cell 60, 271-280). Two independent methods were used to demonstrate that anionic lipids by virtue of their negative head-group charge are involved in membrane translocation of the precursor of the pore protein PhoE. Using a lipid transfer protein-based method we show that introduction from lipid vesicles of PG and other acidic phospholipids but not of phosphatidylcholine restores efficient translocation across the membrane of PG-depleted inner membrane vesicles. Moreover, translocation was found to be proportional to the PG content in vesicles isolated from strain HDL11 in which the PG content was altered by varying the synthesis of the PG-phosphate synthase."
https://openalex.org/W2047188149,"Metazoan eggs alter their coats after fertilization to protect the early embryo. In sea urchins, this modification consists of a rapid, coordinated set of noncovalent macromolecular assembly steps that are stabilized by protein cross-linking. The sea urchin egg uses an oxidative cross-linking reaction that requires hydrogen peroxide and a secreted peroxidase and thus faces the challenge of oxidant stress at the beginning of its development. Protection from the deleterious effects of this oxidative mechanism is afforded by regulation of the production and utilization of oxidizing species. This regulation requires a specific protein kinase C-activated oxidase and ovothiol, an intracellular antioxidant."
https://openalex.org/W2021939146,"The effect of nerve growth factor (NGF) was assessed in Xenopus oocytes expressing the human trk proto-oncogene product, p140prototrk. Oocytes injected with trk messenger RNA expressed polypeptides recognized by antibodies to the trk gene product. Exposure of these oocytes to nanomolar amounts of NGF resulted in specific surface binding of 125I-labeled NGF, tyrosine phosphorylation of p140prototrk, and meiotic maturation, as determined by germinal vesicle breakdown and maturation promoting factor (p34cdc2) kinase activation. Thus the trk proto-oncogene product can act as a receptor for NGF in a functionally productive manner."
https://openalex.org/W2054343935,"To determine the domains of the low-affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor required for appropriate signal transduction, a series of hybrid receptors were constructed that consisted of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the human low-affinity NGF receptor (NGFR). Transfection of these chimeric receptors into rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells resulted in appropriate cell surface expression. Biological activity mediated by the EGF-NGF chimeric receptor was assayed by the induction of neurite outgrowth in response to EGF in stably transfected cells. Furthermore, the chimeric receptor mediated nuclear signaling, as evidenced by the specific induction of transin messenger RNA, an NGF-responsive gene. Neurite outgrowth was not observed with chimeric receptors that contained the transmembrane domain from the EGFR, suggesting that the membrane-spanning region and cytoplasmic domain of the low-affinity NGFR are necessary for signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2158443083,"Although heavy metal ions are known to be toxic to the central nervous system (CNS), the mechanisms by which the CNS may protect itself from initial challenges of such toxic ions is unknown. The choroid plexus is the principal site of formation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which bathes the brain. We have determined in rats and rabbits that after intraperitoneal administration of lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic compounds, these toxic metal ions accumulated in the lateral choroid plexus at concentrations of Pb, Hg, and As that were 70-, 95-, and 40-fold higher, respectively, than those found in the CSF. Cd was not detected in the CSF. In addition, concentrations of these heavy metal ions were found to be many fold greater in the choroid plexus than in the brain or blood. The accumulation of Pb in the choroid plexus was dose-dependent and time-related. When the choroid plexus was preincubated, in vitro, with ouabain (1.5 mM), the uptake of Cd from the CSF side of the choroid plexus was inhibited 57%. Cadmium metallothionein was not found in the choroid plexus. Whereas the concentration of reduced glutathione in the choroid plexus was less than that in the brain cortex, the concentration of cystine was fourfold greater. The lateral choroid plexus sequesters Pb, Cd, As, and Hg. It appears to be one of the important mechanisms that protects the CSF and the brain from the fluxes of toxic heavy metals in the blood."
https://openalex.org/W1512546645,"Abstract The mutT protein, which prevents A:T----C:G transversions during DNA replication, has the following enzymatic properties. Although it prefers dGTP as a substrate, it hydrolyzes all of the canonical nucleoside triphosphates to some extent. It has no activity in the absence of divalent cations, is maximally activated by magnesium ions, and has a pH optimum of 9.0. Nucleoside triphosphates are hydrolyzed according to the following equation. dGTP----dGMP + PPi Studies with nucleotide analogues suggest that the enzyme may prefer the syn rather than the anti conformation of the nucleoside triphosphates, which might explain the role it plays in preventing mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1548178876,"Low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins encoded by the mammalian rab genes are found in membranes of the Golgi complex and endosomes, suggesting that they play a role in the movement of exocytic and endocytic vesicles. The basis for the membrane association of these proteins has not been defined. Herein, we demonstrate that terminal cysteine residues in the rab1B, rab2, and rab5 proteins undergo thioether modification by isoprenyl groups when these proteins are translated in vitro in the presence of a radiolabeled isoprenoid precursor, [3H]mevalonate. Results of gel permeation chromatography of the radiolabeled hydrocarbons suggest that these proteins are modified specifically by isoprenyl groups of the 20-carbon diterpene class, rather than the 15-carbon farnesyl class known to be involved in modification of ras proteins. The rab1 and rab2 proteins lack the carboxyl-terminal amino acid motif common to all previously identified isoprenylated proteins, i.e. CXXX, where X is an unspecified amino acid. Analysis of altered translation products generated by site-directed mutagenesis indicates that modification of rab1B protein requires an intact carboxyl-terminal sequence consisting of GGCC. This represents a new amino acid motif for isoprenylation."
https://openalex.org/W1519683126,"A highly purified preparation of protein kinase FA (where FA is the activating factor for phosphatase 1)/glycogen synthase kinase 3 from rabbit muscle readily phosphorylated bovine neurofilaments. All three neurofilament proteins, the high, middle, and low molecular proteins (NF-H, NF-M, and NF-L), were phosphorylated when intact filaments were incubated with the kinase. Experiments with individual proteins showed that NF-M was the best substrate. At protein concentrations of 0.13 mg/ml, the initial rate of NF-M phosphorylation was 30% of that observed for glycogen synthase. Km values were 0.24 mg/ml (7 x 10(-7) M tetramer) for glycogen synthase and 0.10 mg/ml (5 x 10(-7) M dimer) for NF-M. Vmax values were 0.36 mumol/min/mg for glycogen synthase and 0.035 mumol/min/mg for NF-M. Dephosphorylated NF-M was phosphorylated only half as much as native NF-M; this is consistent with the known substrate specificity of the kinase. The possible involvement of FA/GSK-3 in the phosphorylation of neurofilaments in vivo is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1955922169,"A procedure is described for isolation of active ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (bc1 complex) from potato tuber mitochondria using dodecyl maltoside extraction and ion exchange chromatography. The same procedure works well with mitochondria from red beet and sweet potato. The potato complex has at least 10 subunits resolvable by gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate. The fifth subunit carries covalently bound heme. The two largest (core) subunits either show heterogeneity or include a third subunit. The purified complex contains about 4 mumol of cytochrome c1, 8 mumol of cytochrome b, and 20 mumol of iron/g of protein. The complex is highly delipidated, with 1-6 mol of phospholipid and about 0.2 mol of ubiquinone/mol of cytochrome c1. Nonetheless it catalyzes electron transfer from a short chain ubiquinol analog to equine cytochrome c with a turnover number of 50-170 mol of cytochrome c reduced per mol of cytochrome c1 per s, as compared with approximately 220 in whole mitochondria. The enzymatic activity is stable for weeks at 4 degrees C in phosphate buffer and for months at -20 degrees C in 50% glycerol. The activity is inhibited by antimycin, myxothiazol, and funiculosin. The complex is more resistant to funiculosin and diuron than the beef heart enzyme. The optical difference spectra of the cytochromes were resolved by analysis of full-spectrum redox titrations. The alpha-band absorption maxima are 552 nm (cytochrome c1), 560 nm (cytochrome b-560), and 557.5 + 565.5 nm (cytochrome b-566, which has a split alpha-band). Extinction coefficients appropriate for the potato cytochromes are estimated. Despite the low lipid and ubiquinone content of the purified complex, the midpoint potentials of the cytochromes (257, 51, and -77 mV for cytochromes c1, b-560, and b-566, respectively) are not very different from values reported for whole mitochondria. EPR spectroscopy shows the presence of a Rieske-type iron sulfur center, and the absence of centers associated with succinate and NADH dehydrogenases. The complex shows characteristics associated with a Q-cycle mechanism of redox-driven proton translocation, including two pathways for reduction of b cytochromes by quinols and oxidant-induced reduction of b cytochromes in the presence of antimycin."
https://openalex.org/W1642206810,"A 400-kDa transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor was purified from plasma membranes of bovine liver using Triton X-100 extraction, wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography, DEAE-cellulose anion exchange chromatography, and Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration chromatography. This procedure yielded approximately 20 micrograms of the receptor from 1 kg of bovine liver. During purification, the 400-kDa TGF-beta receptor was detected by a cross-linking assay in which the TGF-beta receptor-125I-TGF-beta complex was cross-linked by disuccinimidyl suberate, a bifunctional reagent, and analyzed by 5.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. This novel 400-kDa TGF-beta receptor was also identified on cultured cells including cells reported to lack the type III receptor. The 400-kDa TGF-beta receptor, a nonproteoglycan glycoprotein, appears to be distinct from TGF-beta receptors (types I, II, III, and IV) previously identified on cultured cells and is designated as the type V receptor. The 400-kDa TGF-beta receptor as well as type I, II, and III receptors underwent internalization upon 125I-TGF-beta binding in mink lung epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1642077255,"The major surface antigen of the mammalian bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), is attached to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The VSG anchor is susceptible to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Candidate precursor glycolipids, P2 and P3, which are PI-PLC-sensitive and -resistant respectively, have been characterized in the bloodstream stage. In the insect midgut stage, the major surface glycoprotein, procyclic acidic repetitive glycoprotein, is also GPI-anchored but is resistant to PI-PLC. To determine how the structure of the GPI anchor is altered at different life stages, we characterized candidate GPI molecules in procyclic T. brucei. The structure of a major procyclic GPI, PP1, is ethanolamine-PO4-Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6 Man alpha 1-GlcN-acylinositol, linked to lysophosphatidic acid. The inositol can be labeled with [3H]palmitic acid, and the glyceride with [3H]stearic acid. We have also found that all detectable ethanolamine-containing GPIs from procyclic cells contain acylinositol and are resistant to cleavage by PI-PLC. This suggests that the procyclic acidic repetitive glycoprotein GPI anchor structure differs from that of the VSG by virtue of the structures of the GPIs available for transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1590094710,"A truncated version of the human urokinase plasminogen activator receptor has been obtained by in vitro mutagenesis by insertion of a premature nonsense codon in the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor cDNA. This results in a protein truncated immediately upstream of the region which appears to be required for membrane attachment of the receptor via a glycolipid anchor. The modified receptor cDNA inserted into an expression vector has been transfected into mouse LB6 cells. Transfectants produce a urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA)-binding protein that is secreted into the medium. It can be cross-linked to iodinated ATF (amino-terminal fragment of u-PA) and can also inhibit binding of iodinated ATF to mouse LB6 cells that express the wild type human receptor. The soluble u-PA receptor will be used in a variety of experiments aimed at identifying the role and mechanism of u-PA in physiological and pathological invasive processes, as well as in therapeutical attempts to block or decrease cancer cell invasion and in general u-PA-mediated tissue destruction."
https://openalex.org/W1497572266,"Lipoxygenases are non-heme iron dioxygenases that catalyze the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Using soybean lipoxygenase-1 as a model, we have shown that two classes of lipoxygenase inhibitors currently in development as potential antiinflammatory agents obtain a significant amount of their potency by reducing the lipoxygenase active-site iron from the active ferric state to the inactive ferrous state. It is not surprising that the members of the first of these classes, the 2-benzyl-1-naphthols, are reducing agents. The members of the second class, the N-alkyl-hydroxamic acids, were not anticipated to be sufficiently strong reducing agents to be oxidized by the lipoxygenase ferric center; that they are provides additional evidence for that iron having a high reduction potential. This brings to (at least) five the number of classes of lipoxygenase inhibitors that are capable of reducing the active-site ferric ion and suggests the generality of this approach in the rational design of lipoxygenase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1565925826,"We describe a novel method for the purification of DNA-binding proteins. Isolated mitochondria were lysed in boiling sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing buffer, the extracts were chromatographed on hydroxylapatite in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and DNA-binding activities were identified after adding a large excess of nonionic detergent (Triton X-100) and assaying fractions by a gel retardation procedure. Fractions containing DNA-binding activity were bulk renatured and chromatographed on phosphocellulose in the presence of Triton X-100. When applied to human mitochondria, the technique resulted in the purification to homogeneity of fully functional mitochondrial transcription factor 1 (mtTF1), the major activator of mammalian mitochondrial transcription. Moreover, the yield of mtTF1 purified by this method was at least 25 times higher than that obtained by conventional nondenaturing chromatographies. When yeast mitochondria were subjected to the same protein isolation scheme, a 19-kilodalton putative yeast homologue of mtTF1 was purified to homogeneity. These results suggest that the denaturation-renaturation approach may be a valuable general method for the identification and high yield purification of DNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1591151157,"The acyclic nucleoside phosphonates 9-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (HPMPA) and 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) are potent inhibitors of DNA viruses and retroviruses, respectively. Unlike nucleoside triphosphates, the metabolically active (diphosphorylated) forms of HPMPA and PMEA (designated HPMPApp and PMEApp) are synthesized in a reversible reaction in which the pyrophosphate group of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) is directly transferred to HPMPA and PMEA by purified PRPP synthetase. In this respect, PRPP synthetase does not act stereospecifically in that it recognizes both the S-enantiomer and the R-enantiomer of HPMPA as substrate. PRPP synthetase also recognizes other acyclic adenine and 2,6-diaminopurine riboside phosphonates as a substrate. It is now imperative to evaluate the potential role of PRPP synthetase, as activating enzyme, in the antiviral action of this type of molecules in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1503443971,"The phosphorylation of the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II was characterized from HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells labeled with 32Pi. Analysis of topoisomerase II immunoprecipitates from 32P-labeled HeLa cells indicated that phosphorylation of the enzyme occurred at serine residues. Incorporation of 32P into topoisomerase II was not due to other types of phosphomodifications such as poly(ADP-ribosylation) or covalent interactions of the enzyme with nucleic acids. The stability of topoisomerase II protein and topoisomerase II phosphorylation was also investigated in HeLa cells. Topoisomerase II protein was relatively stable, having a half-life of approximately 27 h. Phosphorylation of HeLa topoisomerase II was also remarkably stable with a T1/2 of 17 h."
https://openalex.org/W1504081155,"Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) is a cell lineage-specific hemopoietin required for the growth, differentiation, and survival of macrophages and their precursors. The human CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) is a 150-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein whose cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain is split by a kinase insert (KI) region of approximately 70 amino acids. We tested the ability of CSF1R KI domain deletion mutants to stimulate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PtdIns-3-kinase), an enzyme whose activity is augmented by tyrosine kinase oncogenes and receptor tyrosine kinases, and to support mitogenesis in transfected cells. Receptor immunoprecipitates from CSF1-stimulated cells contained greater than 5-fold more PtdIns-3-kinase activity compared to nonstimulated cells. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of the PtdIns-3-kinase product scraped from thin layer chromatography plates indicated that PtdIns-3-P was produced. CSF1R KI domain deletion mutants retained tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. Receptor immunoprecipitates of two partially overlapping 28 and 30 amino acid KI deletion mutants of CSF1R retained some PtdIns-3-kinase activity, in contrast to immunoprecipitates of CSF1R lacking 67 amino acids of the KI domain. Each deletion mutant stimulated CSF1-dependent DNA synthesis in transfected cells at much reduced levels compared to wild-type receptor expressing cells. These data suggest a role for the CSF1R KI domain in PtdIns-3-kinase association and for CSF1-induced thymidine incorporation into DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1520492102,"Manganese peroxidase (MnP), which normally oxidizes Mn2+ to Mn3+, is rapidly and completely inactivated in an H2O2-dependent reaction by 2 equivalents of sodium azide. The inactivation is paralleled by formation of the azidyl radical and high yield conversion of the prosthetic heme into a meso-azido adduct. The meso-azido enzyme is oxidized by H2O2 to a Compound II-like species with the Soret band red-shifted 2 nm relative to that of native Compound II. The time-dependent decrease in this Compound II-like spectrum (t1/2 = 2.3 h) indicates that the delta-meso azido heme is more rapidly degraded by H2O2 than the prosthetic heme of control enzyme (t1/2 = 4.8 h). MnP is also inactivated by phenyl-, methyl-, and ethylhydrazine. The phenylhydrazine reaction is too rapid for kinetic analysis, but KI = 402 microM and kinact = 0.22/min for the slower inactivation by methylhydrazine. Reaction with phenylhydrazine at pH 4.5 does not yield iron-phenyl, N-phenyl, or meso-phenyl heme adducts. Ethylhydrazine inactivates the enzyme both at pH 4.5 and 7.0, but only detectably produces delta-meso-ethyl-heme at pH 7.0. Reconstitution of apo-MnP with hemin or delta-meso-ethylheme yields enzyme with, respectively, 50 and 5% of the native activity. The delta-meso-alkyl group thus suppresses most of the catalytic activity of the enzyme even though a Compound II-like species is still formed with H2O2. Finally, Co2+ inhibits the enzyme competitively with respect to Mn2+ but does not inhibit its inactivation by azide or the alkylhydrazines. The results argue that substrates interact with the heme edge in the vicinity of the delta-meso-carbon. They also suggest that Mn2+ and Co2+ bind to a common site close to the delta-meso-carbon without blocking the approach of small molecules to the heme edge. An active site model is proposed that accommodates these results."
https://openalex.org/W1482295894,"Proteolytic experiments performed on transducin and Go alpha subunit strongly suggest that the amino-terminal residues of the alpha chain are involved in the interaction with beta gamma subunits. To test the possibility that the same region in Gs may fulfill a similar function, we introduced a deletion in the amino-terminal domain of Gs alpha. The properties of the wild type and the deleted alpha chains were characterized on in vitro translated proteins or after reconstitution of cyc- membranes by in vitro-translated alpha subunits. The mutant (delta 2-29) Gs alpha could still bind guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, as revealed by its resistance to trypsin proteolysis and was still able to interact with the membrane. However, (delta 2-29) Gs alpha was not ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin. In contrast to Gs alpha, addition of beta gamma subunits did not increase the rate of sedimentation of (delta 2-29) Gs alpha in sucrose gradients. Binding experiments on reconstituted membranes showed that the coupling to beta-adrenergic receptors was very low with (delta 2-29) Gs alpha. Finally, the mutant did not restore activation of adenylate cyclase of cyc- membranes. We propose that the primary functional defect is the loss of interaction with beta gamma subunits, which secondarily impairs beta gamma-dependent properties such as receptor coupling and cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. However, it remains to be established that the lack of adenylate cyclase activation also results from this impaired interaction with beta gamma subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1635774835,"Pretreatment of rat FRTL-5 thyroid cells with thyrotropin (TSH) markedly potentiated the mitogenic response to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) (Tramontano, D., Moses, A. C., Veneziani, B. M., and Ingbar, S. H. (1988) Endocrinology 122, 127-132; Takahashi, S.-I., Conti, M., and Van Wyk, J. J. (1990) Endocrinology 126, 736-745). The present study was undertaken to determine whether this synergism between TSH and IGF-I in FRTL-5 cells was correlated with changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells was determined by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using monospecific anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Cells were preincubated for up to 24 h with TSH, dibutyryl cAMP, forskolin, or cholera toxin and then incubated for an additional 1 min in the absence or presence of IGF-I. As reported by others, IGF-I rapidly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 175-kDa protein as well as a less intense band of 90-100 kDa. Pretreatment for 6-12 h with either TSH or other agents that elevate intracellular cAMP potentiated the IGF-I-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the 175-kDa substrate by 3-5-fold. Since TSH did not increase IGF receptor number of kinase activity, the effect of TSH is assumed to be exerted at a step distal to IGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Surprisingly, IGF-I-independent tyrosine phosphorylation was also increased by pretreatment with TSH. When intact cells were analyzed TSH produced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a prominent 120-125-kDa substrate and less prominent 100- and 80-kDa substrates. Assays using Triton X-100-soluble extracts incubated with MgCl2, ATP, and orthovanadate demonstrated that TSH pretreatment increased tyrosine phosphorylation over that observed in untreated cells. In this cell-free assay, TSH pretreatment enhanced the phosphorylation of multiple substrates. These studies suggest that a cAMP stimulus that initiates a trophic effect can be propagated indirectly through multiple pathways including enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1549583981,The cGMP-gated cation channel is a member of a new family of channel proteins that appear to be directly regulated by cyclic nucleotides. A protein with a subunit molecular mass of 78 kDa that exhibits cGMP-gated calcium flux when reconstituted into phospholipid-containing vesicles has been purified using 8-bromo-cGMP-agarose affinity chromatography. This channel activity is sensitive to the inhibitor l-cis-diltiazem. Treatment of the reconstituted channel with trypsin abolishes the l-cis-diltiazem sensitivity. Apparent endogenous proteolysis can also result in smaller molecular weight polypeptides that exhibit cGMP-gated channel activity but are insensitive to l-cis-diltiazem. These results show that the channel can bind cGMP and that it contains a l-cis-diltiazem inhibitory domain that is distinct from the cGMP-binding domain.
https://openalex.org/W1592924504,"Interaction of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) was investigated by monitoring the changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme, the kinase activity, and phorbol ester binding. Incubation of PKC I, II, and III with PIP2 resulted in different rates of quenching of PKC fluorescence and different degrees of inactivation of these enzymes. Other inositol-containing phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate also caused differential rates of quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of these enzymes. These latter two phospholipids were, however, less potent in the inactivation of PKCs than PIP2. The IC50 of PIP2 were 2, 4, and 11 microM for PKC I, II, and III, respectively. Inactivation of PKCs by PIP2 cannot be reversed by extensive dilution of PIP2 with Nonidet P-40 nor by digestion of PIP2 with phospholipase C. Interaction of PIP2 with the various PKC isozymes was greatly facilitated in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ as evidenced by the accelerated quenching of the PKC fluorescence, however, these divalent metal ions protected PKC from the PIP2-induced inactivation. Binding of PIP2 to PKC in the absence of divalent metal ion also caused a reduction of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding as a result of reducing the affinity of the enzyme for phorbol ester. Based on gel filtration chromatography, it was estimated that one molecule of PKC interacted with one PIP2 micelle with an aggregation number of 80-90. The PIP2-bound PKC could further interact with phosphatidylserine in the presence of Ca2+ to form a larger complex. Binding of PKC to both PIP2 and phosphatidylserine in the presence of Ca2+ was also evident by changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of PKC. As the interaction of PKC with PIP2, but not with phosphatidylserine, could be enhanced by millimolar concentrations of Mg2+, we propose that PIP2 may be a component of the membrane anchor for PKC under basal physiological conditions when [Ca2+]i is low and Mg2+ is plentiful. Under the in vitro assay conditions, PIP2 could stimulate PKC activity to a level approximately 10-20% of that by diacylglycerol. The stimulatory effect of PIP2 on PKC apparently is not due to binding to the same site recognized by diacylglycerol or phorbol ester, because PIP2 cannot effectively compete with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate in the binding assay."
https://openalex.org/W1562674170,"Recombinant human choriogonadotropin and selenomethionyl human choriogonadotropin (rhCG and SehCG) were expressed in baculovirus expression system by coinfection of SF9 insect cells by recombinant viruses, AcMNPV-hCG alpha and AcMNPV-hCG beta containing hCG alpha and hCG beta cDNAs. The expression efficiency of both rhCG and SehCG was quite high. The association of the alpha and beta subunits into a dimer was apparently complete since no detectable amount of rhCG beta was found in the rhCG eluate from the monoclonal hCG beta antibody immunoaffinity column. Both rhCG and SehCG preparations were homogeneous as indicated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The apparent molecular mass of rhCG and SehCG on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions was about 38 kDa while under reducing conditions the heterodimer dissociated to yield beta and alpha subunits with molecular masses of 22.5 and 18 kDa, respectively. The carbohydrate analysis of rhCG showing the presence of 2.1, 3.3, 7.38, 4.2, and 27.8 residues of Fuc, GalNAC, GlcNAC, Gal, and Man, respectively, per mole of the hormone was consistent with the presence of 4 N-linked high mannose type carbohydrate hydrate and 4 O-linked simple carbohydrate chains, probably made up of Gal-GalNAC. Despite the altered glycosylation, rhCG demonstrated close similarity to the native urinary hCG in amino acid composition, receptor binding, and in its ability to stimulate cAMP and steroidogenesis. This indicates that there is no specificity of carbohydrate required for biological activity. Furthermore, it implies that the alteration from the complex to high mannose type carbohydrates in rhCG does not affect its proper folding. Finally, amino acid analysis of SehCG showed that 84% of methionine residues in rhCG were replaced by selenomethionine."
https://openalex.org/W1497494715,"The phagocytosis of beta-glucan particles by human neutrophils and the associated activation of NADPH O2- forming oxidase were accompanied by an increased hydrolysis of phosphoinositides by phospholipase C, hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase D, accumulation of diglyceride (DG) mass, and [Ca2+]i rise. The reaction of phospholipid hydrolysis played a minor role in the formation of DG, which was mainly formed by de novo synthesis from glucose. The activation of this pathway was shown by the stimulation of the incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into DG, which occurred very rapidly after the challenge of neutrophils with beta-glucan particles. This DG derived from glucose was found almost completely as 1-acyl-2-acyl-glycerol (DAG). On the basis of the finding that phosphatidic acid was the precursor of DAG, an increase in the incorporation of [U-14C]acetate into DAG did not occur, and the [14C]radioactivity was in the glycerol backbone, the synthesis of DAG from [U-14C]glucose occurred very likely via dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerol 3-phosphate, stepwise acylation to phosphatidic acid, and dephosphorylation by phosphatidate phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1514786696,"Exonucleolytic editing is a major contributor to the fidelity of DNA replication by the multisubunit DNA polymerase (pol) III holoenzyme. To investigate the source of editing specificity, we have studied the isolated exonuclease subunit, epsilon, and the pol III core subassembly, which carries the epsilon, theta, and alpha (polymerase) subunits. Using oligonucleotides with specific terminal mismatches, we have found that both epsilon and pol III core preferentially excise a mispaired 3‘ terminus and therefore have intrinsic editing specificity. For both epsilon and pol III core, exonuclease activity is much more effective with single-strand DNA; with a double-strand DNA, the exonuclease is strongly temperature-dependent. We conclude that the epsilon subunit of pol III holoenzyme is itself a specific editing exonuclease and that the source of specificity is the greater melting capacity of a mispaired 3‘ terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1530812572,"Abstract Bovine heart cytochrome-c oxidase was reconstituted in liposomes and modified with N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ). EEDQ reacted mainly with subunits II and III and to a lower extent with subunit I, as shown by difference labeling with [14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. EEDQ treatment of cytochrome-c oxidase vesicles influenced ferrocytochrome c-induced proton pumping by reducing maximally the H+/e- stoichiometry from 0.84 (control) to 0.24, but had only small effects on respiration, respiratory control ratio, and proton conductivity of the proteoliposomes. By titrating the reaction rate of the control and the modified cytochrome-c oxidase vesicles versus the membrane potential, as measured with a Ph3MeP+ electrode, saturation curves are obtained, which in both cases approach 225 mV. The ratios of electron transport rates of the two proton pumps at various membrane potentials decrease between 160 and 225 mV from about 2.2 to 1, indicating that the nonlinear flow/force relationship of these proton pumps is at least partly due to slippage of proton pumping."
https://openalex.org/W1497433610,"To determine the function and specificity in factor IX of the first epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain and the eight-amino acid hydrophobic stack encoded by exon C (residues 39-46), these domains were replaced by the corresponding polypeptide regions of factor X and chimeric proteins were produced in human embryo kidney cells. Both chimeras were activated by factor XIa at a rate similar to plasma factor IX and exhibited calcium-dependent fluorescence quenching similar to plasma factor IX. Both chimeras competed equally for binding to the endothelial cell receptor. Our findings make it unlikely that the first EGF-like domain or the hydrophobic stack of factor IX are responsible for the specific binding of factor IX to its endothelial cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1582019300,"Cytochalasin B is a potent inhibitor of mammalian passive glucose transporters. The recent demonstration of sequence similarities between these proteins and several bacterial proton-linked sugar transporters suggested that cytochalasin B might be a useful tool for investigation of the galactose/H+ symport protein (GalP) of Escherichia coli. Equilibrium binding studies using membranes from a GalP-constitutive (GalPc) strain of E. coli revealed a single set of high affinity binding sites for cytochalasin B with a Kd of 0.8-2.2 microM. Binding was inhibited by D-glucose, but not by L-glucose. UV irradiation of the membranes in the presence of [4-3H]cytochalasin B photolabeled principally a protein of apparent Mr 38,000, corresponding to the GalP protein. Labeling was inhibited by greater than 80% in the presence of 500 mM D-glucose or D-galactose, the major substrates of the GalP system. The extent of inhibition of photolabeling by different sugars and sugar analogues showed that the substrate specificity of GalP closely resembles that of the mammalian passive glucose transporters. Structural similarity to the latter was revealed by tryptic digestion of [4-3H]cytochalasin B-photolabeled GalP, which yielded a radiolabeled fragment of apparent Mr 17,000-19,000, similar to that previously reported for the human erythrocyte glucose transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1516324403,"Endoglycoceramidase (EGCase) cleaves the linkage between oligosaccharides and ceramides of various glycosphingolipids (Ito, M., and Yamagata, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14278-14282). Recently, by extensive purification, it was separated from cell-lytic factor (hemolysin) and found to consist of three molecular species each with its own specificity (EGCases I, II, and III) (Ito, M., and Yamagata, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9510-9519). A detergent was required for EGCases to express full activity, possibly due to their hydrophobic nature, and thus EGCases cannot be used for research on live cells. This paper presents findings on activator proteins in the culture supernatant of Rhodococcus sp. M-777 regarding the stimulation of EGCase activity in the absence of detergents. The activator protein, exhaustively purified and designated as activator II in this study, showed a single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-, native-, and isoelectrofocussing-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis after being stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Its molecular weight and pI were 69,200 and 4.0, respectively. The activator protein enhanced the hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids in vitro and on the cell-surface by EGCase II in the absence of detergents in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, activator II stimulated the activity of EGCase II much more than that of EGCase I on using asialo-GM1 as the substrate. This activator protein was found nonspecific to substrates susceptible to hydrolysis with EGCase II. Besides activator II, strain M-777 produced a second minor molecular species of activator protein designated as activator I which appeared specific for stimulating the activity of EGCase I in contrast to activator II. Following the addition of activator II, EGCase II hydrolyzed cell-surface glycosphingolipids quite efficiently at neutral pH at which hydrolysis hardly occurred at all in its absence. When using activator II in place of Triton X-100 for stimulating EGCase II activity, it was also noted to cause no damage to intact cells. It is thus possible by activator proteins to elucidate the biological functions of endogenous glycosphingolipids in situ by EGCases."
https://openalex.org/W1523739383,"We have isolated and characterized a mouse gene encoding liver (B-type) phosphofructokinase, a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis. The gene spans approximately 21.5 kilobase pairs and consists of 22 exons. Compared with the muscle (A-type) phosphofructokinase gene, the sizes of the introns are different although exon lengths are highly conserved. Two transcription start sites 10 bases apart were determined by primer extension experiments. The immediate 5' sequence does not possess a TATA or CCAAT box but contains multiple GC boxes (positions -10, -43, -50, -62, and +28 in the 5'-untranslated region) which may be Sp1-binding sites. An unusual feature of 200 base stretches of CT repeats is present at position -480 to -693. In addition, direct repeats of CTCGAAGGAG are found at positions -447 and -478. DNase I footprinting showed five regions where liver nuclear proteins may interact. Two proximal 5'-flanking regions spanning -1 to -20 and -30 to -70, which contain GC boxes. Also protected was a region spanning -70 to -90, which contains an AP-1 like sequence (TCAGTCA). The consensus AP-1 sequence, however, did not inhibit footprinting, indicating involvement of a distinct protein. Two distal regions spanning from -450 to -470 and from -500 to -520 were also protected. The former is positioned between the direct repeats and the latter is at the start of the CT repeats. The rate of transcription of the liver phosphofructokinase gene, as measured by run-on assays, increased 5-fold in livers of previously starved mice fed a high carbohydrate diet compared to starved controls. Administration of dibutyryl cAMP blocked the increase in transcription caused by refeeding. Functional analysis of the promoter region of the gene will be necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by fasting/refeeding and by cAMP. These results provide a useful system for the study of regulatory elements in liver phosphofructokinase gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1629714094,"The phi 29 DNA polymerase, an alpha-like DNA polymerase, shows an inorganic pyrophosphate-dependent degradative activity with similar requirements to the corresponding one of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I: (a) it requires a high concentration of inorganic pyrophosphate and is reversed by polymerization; (b) like DNA polymerization, it needs a duplex DNA with protruding 5' single-strand; (c) it acts in the 3' to 5' direction releasing free dNTPs, thus, it can be considered as the reversal of polymerization; (d) although a correctly base-paired 3' primer terminus is the preferred substrate, the pyrophosphorolytic activity is able to remove mismatched 3' ends. In agreement with the structural and functional model previously proposed for the phi 29 DNA polymerase, the analysis of point mutations has revealed that the pyrophosphorolytic activity, like the polymerization activity, is located at the C-terminal portion of the molecule, involving the amino acid motif YCDTD, highly conserved in alpha-like DNA polymerases. Furthermore, the analysis of phi 29 DNA polymerase mutants indicates that pyrophosphorolysis, like DNA polymerization, also requires an efficient translocation of the enzyme along the template."
https://openalex.org/W1558491563,"We have purified to homogeneity two distinct 10-kDa proteins with potent chemotactic activity for neutrophils from porcine alveolar macrophages incubated for 24 h with Escherichia coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 10 micrograms/ml). Neutrophil chemotactic activity in alveolar macrophage supernatants was concentrated by adsorption to SP-Sephadex, and purified by cation exchange and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The first peptide, alveolar macrophage chemotactic factor (AMCF)-I, had chemotactic activity for both porcine and human neutrophils. The chemotactic activity for porcine neutrophils was detectable at 3 x 10(-10) M, peaked at 3 x 10(-8) M, and was comparable to that of zymosan-activated porcine serum. Segmental instillation of AMCF-I into porcine lungs caused marked neutrophil accumulation at 4 h in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in lung tissue. The second peptide, AMCF-II, was active at 1.4 x 10(-9) M for porcine neutrophils, but it was less active for human polymorphonuclear neutrophils than was AMCF-I. Oligonucleotide probes to regions of the N-terminal sequences of AMCF-I and AMCF-II hybridized to mRNA recovered from LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages. The N-terminal sequences and amino acid compositions indicate that AMCF-I and AMCF-II are distinct proteins, but that both have homologies with a family of peptide chemoattractants produced by human blood monocytes and platelets. Thus, alveolar macrophages stimulated with LPS produce two distinct 10-kDa cytokines with potent chemotactic activity for neutrophils. This indicates that there are two different peptide pathways by which alveolar macrophages can recruit neutrophils into the lung."
https://openalex.org/W1573096718,"Abstract Ubiquitin (Ub) conjugates to Saccharomyces cerevisiae iso-2-cytochrome c were formed in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte extract (Fraction II). In the presence of ubiquitin-aldehyde, used to inhibit ubiquitin-protein isopeptidases in Fraction II, mono-, di-, and triubiquitinated cytochrome c conjugates accumulated in a 1.2:1.0:0.2 molar ratio. CNBr digestions showed that, in all three conjugates, Ub attachment was within the first 73 amino acids of the cytochrome c. For the two most abundant conjugates, this region was further narrowed to the first 30 residues by peptide mapping with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. N-terminal protein sequencing identified Lys-13 as the major ubiquitination site in each conjugate. For di- and triubiquitinated iso-2-cytochrome c, this suggested that Ub2 and Ub3 multiubiquitin chains extend from Lys-13. This conclusion was supported by a variation of protein sequencing in which polypeptides recovered after Edman degradation were analyzed to determine at which cycle(s) radiolabeled Ub or Ubn was cleaved from the conjugate. Because of the sensitivity afforded by the use of 125I-Ub in this stutter-step sequencing method, minor ubiquitination at Lys-8 also was detected. Thus, Ub2-iso-2-cytochrome c conjugates contain mostly Ub2 at Lys-13 with a small fraction of conjugates having single Ubs on 2 residues, Lys-8 and Lys-13. Similarly, Ub3-iso-2-cytochrome c predominantly has a Ub3 chain on Lys-13, although minor species with combinations of Ub1 and Ub2 distributed on Lys-8 and Lys-13 also may be present. This specificity is discussed in the context of iso-2-cytochrome c structure."

Cells with increased cyclic hydrolase activity had lower levels of cIns(1,2)P and grew to a lower density at confluence than control cells. This relationship was strengthened by the demonstration that several cell types with differences in cyclic hydrolase activity had levels of cIns(1,2)P and saturation densities that also correlated inversely with cyclic hydrolase activity. In addition, cyclic hydrolase activity is higher in cells at confluence compared to subconfluence. These results suggest that cellular cIns(1,2)P levels are determined by cyclic hydrolase activity and play a role in the control of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2097077571,"The protonation constants and complex formation constants of ionomycin have been determined in 80% methanol/water (w/w) at 25.0 degrees C and mu = 0.050 (tetraethylammonium perchlorate). Potentiometric and spectrometric titration techniques give the following values for the mixed-mode protonation constants of ionomycin: log KH1 = 11.94 +/- 0.02 and log KH2 = 6.80 +/- 0.03. Comparison of these values with those for model compounds indicates that KH1 and KH2 refer to equilibria involving the beta-diketone and carboxylic acid moieties, respectively. Titrations of ionomycin with metal ion at fixed values of pH produced changes in the UV-visual absorbance spectra which were analyzed to give conditional complex formation constants, KMI'. The pH dependence of the values of KMI' indicated that 1:1 divalent metal ion-ionomycin (MI) complexes and protonated MHI+ complexes were formed in the pH range studied. The values of log KMI ranged from 5.30 +/- 0.11 for Sr2+ to 10.25 +/- 0.03 for Ni2+. The selectivity pattern and relative affinities (in parentheses) for the formation of the species MI are as follows: Ni2+ (2000) greater than Zn2+ (600) greater than CO2+ (440) greater than Mn2+ (47) greater than Mg2+ (1.00) greater than Ca2+ (0.21) greater than Sr2+ (0.022). Logarithmic values of KMHI, for the reaction MI + H+ in equilibrium MHI+, ranged from 5.9 (Ni2+) to 8.4 (Sr2+). Calculations using the values of the equilibrium constants determined indicate that an appreciable fraction of the complexed ionophore exists as the protonated complex, MHI+, in the pH range of 6.5-8.5."
https://openalex.org/W1500095039,"A subpopulation of galactosyl receptors (GalRs) on isolated rat hepatocytes undergo a reversible inactivation and reactivation process during constitutive recycling (McAbee, D. D., and Weigel, P. H. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2061-2069). Here, we report the reconstitution of this GalR inactivation in digitonin-permeabilized rat hepatocytes. Permeabilization of freshly isolated cells at 4 degrees C with 0.002% (w/v digitonin releases cytosol containing 35-40% of the total cellular protein, 10-15% of a lysosomal marker, and 5-10% of an early endosomal marker. Incubation of permeabilized cells with cytosol at 37 degrees C results in a time-dependent reduction of total 125I-asialoorosomucoid binding activity, which proceeds with first order kinetics (t 1/2 = 11.3 min). Only half of the total cellular GalRs are affected; maximal GalR activity loss, obtained by 30 min, is 50.5 +/- 9.5% (n = 21) of the control (4 degrees C) value. Increasing the digitonin concentration up to 0.055% does not increase the extent of inactivation. Permeabilized cells with reduced GalR activity were assessed for GalR protein content by Western blot analysis and by binding of anti-GalR antibody. The results show that the reduced 125I-asialoorosomucoid binding is due to GalR inactivation rather than receptor protein degradation. GalR inactivation does not occur in the absence of cytosol or in the presence of dialyzed cytosol. The cytosol also loses its GalR inactivating ability in the presence of an ATP-depleting system. GalR inactivation in the absence of cytosol is achieved by incubating permeabilized washed cells at 37 degrees C with ATP but not with ADP, AMP, or other NTPs. The rate and extent of inactivation are dependent on the ATP concentration. Half-maximal and maximal GalR inactivation are obtained at 0.3 and 3.0 mM ATP, respectively. In the presence of cytosol, permeabilized hepatocytes could replenish cytosolic ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. As a result, similar levels of GalR inactivation were obtained with 500-fold lower ATP concentrations. We conclude that ATP is the only cytosolic component necessary for GalR inactivation in permeabilized rat hepatocytes."

With high pressure liquid chromatography, evidence for the formation of similar adducts with methyl- and n-propylhydrazine but not tert-butyl-, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl-, or 2-phenylethylhydrazine has also been obtained. The gamma regiospecificity of the reaction of myoglobin with alkylhydrazines contrasts with the delta meso regiospecificity in the alkylation of peroxidases. Addition to the porphyrin vinyl groups is not detected, but N-alkylheme adducts appear to be formed in very low yield. Cofactor studies establish that H2O2 is absolutely required for meso heme alkylation and EPR/spin trapping studies show that alkyl free radicals are the probable alkylating species. In contrast, the reductive reaction of sperm whale myoglobin with CBrCl3 results in addition of the CCl3.radical to the 2-vinyl moiety of the heme group (Osawa, Y., Highet, R. J., Murphy, C. M., Cotter. R.J., and Pohl, L.R. (1989) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111, 4462-4467). Carbon radicals thus apparently add to different sites of the myoglobin prosthetic group under reductive and oxidative conditions, presumably because of differences in the oxidation state of the heme and/or the intrinsic reactivities of alkyl and polyhaloalkyl radicals."
https://openalex.org/W1574441776,"Trypsin digestion of pertussis toxin (PT) preferentially cleaved the S1 subunit at Arg-218 without detectable degradation of the B oligomer. The fragment produced, termed the tryptic S1 fragment, appears to remain associated with the B oligomer. Chymotrypsin digestion of PT also preferentially cleaved the S1 subunit without detectable degradation of the B oligomer. The chymotryptic S1 fragment possessed a slightly lower apparent molecular weight than the tryptic S1 fragment and was more accessible to the respective protease. Trypsin- and chymotrypsin-treated PT and PT required the presence of dithiothreitol and ATP for optimal enzymatic activity. Trypsin-treated PT showed approximately a 2-4-fold higher level of expression of ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD-glycohydrolase activities than PT. Chymotrypsin-treated PT also exhibited approximately a 2-fold greater level of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity than PT. The observed increase in activity of protease-treated PT was due primarily to a shorter time for activation in PT mediated ADP-ribosylation of transducin. In addition, trypsin-digested PT possessed the same cytotoxic potential for Chinese hamster ovary cell clustering as PT. One possible role for the generation of a proteolytic fragment of the S1 subunit of PT would be to produce a catalytic fragment with increased efficiency for ADP-ribosylation of G proteins in vivo."
