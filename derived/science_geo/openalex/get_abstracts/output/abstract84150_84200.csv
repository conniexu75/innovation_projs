Analysis of the shortest region of overlap shows the deletion to be 3p(14-23). This specific change was not seen in five of five lung cancer cell lines other than small-cell lung cancer or in two lymphoblastoid lines cultured from cells of small-cell lung cancer patients whose tumors had the 3p deletion."

https://openalex.org/W2040911288,"Microsurgical unilateral occlusion of the right common carotid artery in 140 adult male gerbils produced homolateral cerebral ischemia and a neurologic deficit (stroke) in 42 percent (group A); the other 58 percent did not develop signs of stroke (group B). Intraperitoneal injection of the opiate antagonist naloxone (1 milligram per kilogram of body weight) reversed the signs of stroke within 3 to 5 minutes in ten out of ten group A gerbils; the effect lasted up to 30 minutes, after which stroke returned. Repeated injections of naloxone reversed stroke, but all ten gerbils died within 48 hours of ligation. However, nine other group A gerbils implanted with 10-milligram naloxone pellets had continuous reversal of signs of stroke, and four survived for more than 2 weeks. Twenty-one out of 24 group B gerbils injected intraperitoneally with morphine sulfate (5 to 30 milligrams per kilogram) 9 hours after ligation developed stroke within 3 to 20 minutes; morphineinduced stroke lasted 4 to 24 hours and could be reversed by intraperitoneal injection of naloxone. Ten out of 11 other group B gerbils injected intraperitoneally with the stereoisomeric opiate agonist levorphanol 9 hours after ligation developed signs of mild stroke that were reversed by intraperitoneal injection of naloxone. Ten other group B gerbils injected intraperitoneally with dextrorphan, the inactive enantiomer of levorphanol, 9 hours after ligation did not develop signs of stroke. Intraperitoneal injection of an enkephalin analog (Sandoz FK33824; 15 milligrams per kilogram) 9 hours after ligation did not produce stroke in ten other group B gerbils. These findings suggest the involvement of endorphins and opiate receptors in the pathophysiology of stroke and suggest the possible clinical use of opiate antagonists in humans in the acute phase of stroke."

The pure stereoisomers of this compound, as well as the racemic mixture, were compared to phencyclidine for their behavioral effects on squirrel monkeys and rats trained to discriminate phencyclidine from saline. Dose-response determinations were made for responses to phencyclidine, to a racemic mixture of N-allylnormetazocine, and to the pure levo and dextro isomers of N-allylnormetazocine. In both rats and monkeys, the dextro isomer and the racemic mixture produced dose-dependent responses appropriate for phencyclidine; the levo isomer did not produce the responses appropriate for phencyclidine at any of the doses tested. In both species, the levo isomer was more potent than the dextro isomer in decreasing the rate of responding. Thus racemic N-allylnormetazocine is a mixture of compounds that produce different behavioral effects."

We have determined the locations of the coding regions for these early proteins on the phi 29 genome, and our results are in agreement with genetic evidence that the 22.4-kilodalton protein is the product of cistron 17 (p17) and the 13.9-kilodalton protein is the product of cistron 6 (p6). The 13.9-kilodalton and 10.5-kilodalton proteins are encoded on a polycistronic mRNA previously designated G3b RNA. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a HindIII restriction fragment of phi 29 DNA, the H fragment, that encodes the 13.9-kilodalton protein and contains two early promoters, G3a and G3b. The nucleotide sequence of the ribosome binding site contains a polypurine region capable of forming a very stable complex with nine bases on the 3' end of B. subtilis 16 S rRNA. This strong Shine-Dalgarno complementarity supports the hypothesis that an extensive mRNA . rRNA interaction is a requirement for efficient translation by B. subtilis ribosomes (McLaughlin, J. R., Murray, C. L., and Rabinowitz, J. C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11283-11291). The nucleotide sequences of both promoters are very similar to the consensus sequence for Escherichia coli promoters. While E. coli RNA polymerase initiates transcription from both of these promoters in vitro, only the G3b promoter is utilized by B. subtilis RNA polymerase under the same conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1558786407,"Hybrid molecules containing DNA sequences complementary to bovine pituitary mRNA were constructed in the Pst I site of pBR322 by the dC . dG tailing technique. Recombinant plasmids containing bovine prolactin (bPRL) sequences were amplified in bacteria and identified by hybridization to purified [32P]bPRL cDNA sequences. Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed on the inserts from two of the positive clones. One clone, pBPRL72, contained a 982-base pair insert that included 67 nucleotides of the 5'-untranslated region, the complete coding region of the preprolactin protein (690 nucleotides), and the entire 3'-untranslated region (150 nucleotides) of bPRL mRNA. The nucleotide sequence analysis of clone pBPRL72 predicted the sequence of a 30-amino acid signal peptide and confirmed the published amino acid sequence of the protein with one exception. A comparison of the pBPRL72 cDNA sequence with a second bPRL clone, pBPRL4, revealed four silent nucleotide differences. Three of the base changes occurred in the third position of amino acid codons, and one occurred in the 3'-noncoding region. The sequence polymorphism suggests the existence of alleles or multiple loci for bPRL that do not alter the protein structure."

https://openalex.org/W1600904576,"A study is presented which shows that /sup 125/I-EGF that was iodinated by lactoperoxidase treatment bound to cells but did not become linked to EGF receptors. /sup 125/I-EGF that was iodinated by chloramine-T treatment or /sup 125/I-EGF that was iodinated by lactoperoxidase treatment and then exposed to chloramine-T, formed linked /sup 125/I-EGF-receptor complexes. Chloramine-T-treated /sup 125/I-EGF remained able to couple to EGF receptors many hours after chloramine-T was removed. These results indicate that chloramine-T ''activates'' /sup 125/I-EGF to a new stable form that couples specifically to EGF receptors. This activation did not occur when Tris middle dot Cl was present during the chloramine-T incubation. Because Tris middle dot Cl is nucleophilic and could moderate the oxidizing effects of chloramine-T, this finding suggests that chloramine-T activates EGF as a result of its ability to oxidize certain amino acid residues in proteins. The specific linkage of chloramine-T-treated /sup 125/I-EGF to EGF receptors provides a convenient, effective method for radiolabeling EGF receptors. The percentage of human fibroblast EGF receptors cross-linked by /sup 125/I-EGF increased to 60% when turnover of EGF receptors at the cell surface was blocked by inhibiting endocytosis with phenylarsine oxide. The linkage of /sup 125/I-thrombin to protease-nexin, a cell-released factormore » that mediates the binding of /sup 125/I-thrombin to human fibroblasts, is not a chloramine-T artifact. (JMT)« less"

https://openalex.org/W1569849804,"A genomic bank has been constructed using DNA isolated from a dystrophic strain of chickens. The library was screened for myosin heavy chain (MHC) sequences using a cDNA probe and 11 positive recombinants isolated. Identity of the clones was confirmed by positive RNA selection via hybridization of the clones with muscle RNA and subsequent translation of the hybridizable RNA in vitro. Restriction maps indicate that the clones can be divided into 7 distinct groups; some of these groups do, however, share similar or homologous sequences. Hydridization of the clones to RNA derived from leg, breast, heart, and brain reveals that all of the clones code for the muscle-specific MHC isoforms. These experiments also show that there are at least 3 size classes of MHC mRNA sequences, whose relative amounts appear to be modulated in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1551858353,"We have searched for the presence of branching in the chromosomal polymer poly(ADP-ribose) as it occurs in vivo. Treatment of the polymer with phosphodiesterase asnd phosphomonoesterase results in the conversion of internal residues to the nucleoside ribosyladenosine and the conversion of points of branching to diribosyladenosine. We have detected diribosyladenosine in digests of the polymer derived from carcinogen-treated SV40 virus-formed 3T3 cells and in normal rat liver, kidney, and spleen. The frequency of residues involved in branching varied from 0.8 to 1.6 mole % over a 50-fold range of total levels of poly(ADP-ribose). Thus, branching seems to be a general feature of poly(ADP-ribose) as it occurs in vivo."

To elucidate the site of inhibition, we examined whether the halovinyl analogs are incorporated into DNA using two approaches. (i) In assays with purified DNA polymerases omitting dTTP from the reaction system, addition of either BrvdUTP or IvdUTP increased the polymerization reaction, indicating that these two analog triphosphates can be alternate substrates. (ii) When HSV-1-infected Vero cells were grown in the presence of either BrvdUrd or IvdUrd, there was an increase in the density of both the viral and cellular DNA. The viral DNA had 40% of its thymidine moiety substituted by IvdUrd when the concentration of [125I]IvdUrd was 24 microM (in the absence of added thymidine). At 30 microM BrvdUrd and 1 microM [2-14C]thymidine, the viral DNA had only 11% of its thymidine moiety substituted by BrvdUrd, presumably because of the presence of added thymidine. Following digestion of [125I]IvdUrd-substituted DNA with DNase 1, venom phosphodiesterase, and alkaline phosphatase, the radioactivity co-migrated with nonradioactive IvdUrd in thin layer chromatography. Under similar conditions, no detectable incorporation of either [125I]IvdUrd or BrvdUrd into mock-infected Vero cell DNA was observed. Thus, IvdUrd and BrvdUrd are incorporated into DNA of HSV-1 infected cells but not into DNA of uninfected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1565044443,"Messenger RNA extracted from the livers of normal, phenobarbital-treated, and trans-stilbene oxide-treated rats was translated in a mRNA-dependent protein-synthesizing system. Immunoprecipitation of the translation products by antibodies against the Ya and Yc subunits of glutathione S-transferase detected two polypeptides of molecular weights 23,500 and 25,000. Subsequently, a clone containing glutathione S-transferase sequences was identified from a rat liver double-stranded cDNA library that had been prepared by homopolymeric tailing and cloning into the Pst I site of pBR322. Confirmation of the identity of the clone was obtained by recloning the 550-bp insert DNA into the phage vector M13 and utilizing the single strand recombinant phage DNA in specific hybrid selection of mRNA followed by translation and immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the Ya and Yc subunits. This recombinant phage, M13GST94, was also utilized in a new technique to synthesize 32P-labeled cDNA specific to the glutathione S-transferase insert DNA that was used subsequently in RNA excess solution hybridization to determine the relative concentration of glutathione S-transferase mRNA. Phenobarbital treatment resulted in a 3.2-fold increase in glutathione S-transferase mRNA over levels found in control rats, while trans-stilbene oxide increased glutathione S-transferase mRNA levels 5.7-fold. The DNA sequence of the clone was determined and utilized to propose a partial amino acid sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1513760428,"The insulin-like growth factor, multiplication stimulating activity (MSA), and insulin were recently shown to stimulate proteoglycan synthesis in monolayer cultures of chondrocytes derived from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. Insulin produced significant stimulation at a concentration of less than 1 ng/ml, suggesting that insulin was acting through the insulin receptor rather than through a somatomedin receptor. In this paper we have shown that the insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II also are potent stimulators of [35S]sulfate incorporation into macromolecules recovered from the medium and cell layer matrix of the chondrosarcoma chondrocytes. Proinsulin was 3% as potent as insulin in stimulating [35S]sulfate incorporation. We identified receptors for insulin and the insulin-like growth factors, MSA, IGF-I, and IGF-II. Insulin, at concentrations 1000 times the concentration required to produce the biologic response, did not compete for binding of 125I-MSA-II-1 or of 125I-IGF-II and only partially competed for 125I-IGF-I binding. Anti-insulin receptor IgG stimulated proteoglycan synthesis and competed for 125I-insulin binding. Fab fragment prepared from anti-insulin receptor IgG completely blocked the stimulation of [35S]sulfate incorporation into macromolecules by insulin while only partially inhibiting the biologic response to insulin-like growth factors, MSA, IGF-I, and IGF-II. Similarly, the anti-insulin receptor IgG only partially inhibited the binding of 125I-IGF-I and 125I-IGF-II while completely blocking the binding of 125I-insulin. We conclude that insulin stimulates proteoglycan synthesis in the chondrosarcoma chondrocytes by acting through the insulin receptor whereas the insulin-like growth factors probably act through their own receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1491104009,"Escherichia coli mutants partially defective in CTP: phosphatidic acid cytidylyltransferase (CDP-diglyceride synthetase) are more resistant to the antibiotic erythromycin than are isogenic wild type strains. When 100 micrograms/ml erythromycin is added to nutrient agar plates, it is possible to obtain a 30-fold enrichment for cds mutants from a mutagen-treated stock, as judged by colony autoradiography (Ganong, B. R., Leonard, J. M., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1623-1629). Using this approach, we have isolated 38 new cds mutants, nine of which are unable to grow at a culture pH greater than 8. A typical conditionally lethal mutant like GN80 contains a 3 to 5% phosphatidic acid below pH 7. Above pH 8, GN80 accumulates phosphatidic acid to about 30% of the total membrane lipid, while the de novo syntheses of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol are abruptly inhibited by over 10-fold. GN80 loses viability after 60 min at pH 8.5, and the liponucleotide pool of GN80 is about one-seventh that of an isogenic wild type, GN85, under these conditions. The pH optimum of the residual CDP-diglyceride synthetase present in extracts of GN80 is 0.5 pH units lower than normal. Twenty-one of 26 spontaneous pH-resistant revertants of GN80 concomitantly regain parental levels of the enzyme. Our results constitute definitive physiological proof that CDP-diglyceride is an obligatory precursor for over 90% of the phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol in E. coli. Independent evidence for this is provided by the observation that cytidine auxotrophs, which are defective in the conversion of UTP to CTP, also accumulate very high levels of phosphatidic acid after 1 h of cytidine starvation."

It possesses structural features typical of known expressed beta-globins, including 5'-untranslated region, potential capping site, initiation and terminator codons, poly(A) addition signal, splicing signals, and intervening sequences. There is a striking 15-base homology between the putative RNA polymerase binding site of this gene and the corresponding region of a human embryonic beta-gene which may be important in the control of expression during embryonic development. The sequence of the gene predicts the sequence of the entire y2 protein, which has not previously been available. As expected from evolutionary considerations, it is more homologous to human embryonic beta-globin than to mouse adult beta-globin."
https://openalex.org/W1597357993,"Abstract The amino acid sequence at the ATP-binding site on the cGMP-dependent protein kinase has been determined. For this determination the enzyme was labeled covalently by 5'-p-fluorosulfonyl[14C]benzoyladenosine and fragmented using cyanogen bromide or digested by trypsin after succinylation. The 14C-labeled peptides were purified by gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence around the site was found to be: -Val-Glu-Leu-Val-Gln-Leu-Lys-Ser-Glu-Glu-Ser-Lys-Thr-Phe-Ala-Met-*Lys-Ile-Leu-Lys--Lys-Arg-His-Ile-Val-Asp-Thr-Arg-Gln-Gln-Glu-His-Ile-Arg-Ser-Glu-Lys-, in which *Lys is the lysine residue that was modified by the affinity reagent. When this sequence was compared with that of the ATP-binding site of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, a high degree of structural homology was observed for this site in the two proteins."

Both the rise in intracellular adenosine 3' ,5-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and cell fusion generated by these effectors are prevented by propranolol, which is a specific blocker of the beta-adrenergic receptor. Propranolol has no effect either on the precocious cell fusion provoked by prostaglandin E or on cell fusion in control cultures. The results support the idea that a rise in cyclic AMP is the critical intracellular change responsible for initiating events that culminate in myoblast differentiation 4 to 5 hours later. They also indicate that the culminate in myoblast differentiation 4 to 5 hours later. They also indicate that the hormone responsible for the positive regulation of myoblast differentiation in vitro is not acting through the beta-adrenergic receptor."

Chem. 256, 6327-6334) was found to catalyze the hydrolysis of both pyrimidine and purine cyclic 2':3'- and 3':5'-nucleotides. Hydrolysis of cyclic 2':3'-nucleotides resulted in the formation of both 2'- and 3'-nucleotides, although relative amounts of the products were variable. Hydrolysis of cyclic 2':3'-CMP or cyclic 2':3'-UMP yielded predominantly 3'-nucleotides. In contrast, hydrolysis of cyclic 2':3'-AMP produced equal amounts of 2'- and 3'-nucleotides, while the major product formed from cyclic 2':3'-GMP was 2'-nucleotide. When conventional pyrimidine and purine cyclic 3:5'-nucleotides were used as substrates, the enzyme hydrolyzed specifically the 3'-bond to yield only 5'-nucleotides. The relative rate of hydrolysis of cyclic 2':3'-nucleotides was cyclic CMP greater than cyclic UMP greater than cyclic GMP greater than or equal to cyclic AMP, respectively, whereas that for cyclic 3':5'-nucleotides was cyclic CMP greater than cyclic UMP greater than or equal to cyclic AMP greater than cyclic GMP, respectively. Furthermore, kinetic analysis suggested a single species of catalytic site on the enzyme may be involved in the hydrolysis of both pyrimidine and purine cyclic 2':3'- and 3':5'-nucleotides. These findings indicate that the present enzyme is the first multifunctional phosphodiesterase reported to date that is capable of hydrolyzing such a diversity of cyclic nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1492221275,"The biosynthesis of galactosyl-beta 1,3-N-acetylglucosamine has been demonstrated using membrane preparations from pig trachea. Unlike the UDP-galactose:2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose 4 beta-galactosyltransferase, which is inhibited by high levels of N-acetylglucosamine, the UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 3 beta-galactosyltransferase shows no inhibition at 200 mM N-acetylglucosamine. About 80% of the total disaccharide synthesized at 200 mM N-acetylglucosamine was base-labile suggesting the 1,3-linkage, alpha-Lactalbumin inhibits galactose incorporation into galactosyl-beta 1,4-N-acetylglucosamine but has little or no effect on the activity of the 1,3-galactosyltransferase. Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase readily hydrolyzed the base-stable product, but not the base-labile component. The apparent 1,3-linked disaccharide was reduced with NaBH4 and was isolated by Bio-Gel P-2 column chromatography. Methylation analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed tetramethyl galactose and a 3-substituted N-acetylglucosaminitol. Neither the beta 1,4 nor the beta 1,3 disaccharide was hydrolyzed by green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase. Both disaccharides were readily hydrolyzed by bovine testes beta-galactosidase. This is the first report on the galactosyltransferase which catalyzes the synthesis of the galactosyl-beta 1,3-N-acetylglucosamine linkage such as found in the Type I chain of human blood group substances. A tissue survey in rats showed only rat intestine to have readily detectable UDP-galactose: N-acetylglucosamine 3 beta-galactosyltransferase activity. The intestinal membrane fraction like the tracheal enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of two disaccharides as judged by base treatment, and these appear to be the beta 1,3 and beta 1,4 isomers of galactosyl-N-acetylglucosamine."

https://openalex.org/W1500967150,"Abstract The properties of the NAD-binding domain of Bungarus fasciatus venom NAD glycohydrolase were investigated by a number of biochemical techniques. Inhibitor studies indicated that an intact dinucleotide was required for effective enzyme recognition. Adenosine derivatives, AMP, ADP, ATP, adenosine diphosphoribose (ADP-rib), and 2'-phosphoadenosine diphosphoribose (phospho-ADP-rib), were linear competitive inhibitors of the NADase-catalyzed reaction. Nicotinamide analogs were noncompetitive inhibitors with Ki values that varied with the nature and position of substituent groups. Selective enzyme inactivation by 2,4-pentanedione indicated the importance of a lysinyl residue for NADase activity. The importance of a carboxyl group was also indicated by the sensitivity of the NADase toward N-ethyl-5-phenyl-isoxazolium-3'-sulfonate (Woodward's Reagent K). Reagents which modified sulfhydryl, histidyl, and arginyl residues were not effective in inactivating B. fasciatus venom NADase. The purified snake venom NADase catalyzed a transglycosidation (pyridine base exchange) reaction. The functioning of a variety of substituted pyridine bases in this reaction was demonstrated by the formation of the corresponding NAD analogs. Kinetic studies of the transglycosidation reaction were consistent with the partitioning of an enzyme-ADP-rib intermediate between water and the substituted pyridine base. Concentrations of pyridine bases required for enzyme inhibition differed significantly from those needed for the pyridine base exchange reaction, suggesting two sites or two forms of the NADase differing in affinity for pyridine bases. A number of NAD analogs were also shown to be effective ribosyl donors in the transglycosidation reaction."

The rate of formation of methemoglobin and superoxide was linearly dependent upon the concentration of nitrofurantoin and could be inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, or the prior conversion of HbO2 to ethylioscyanoferrohemoglobin. The ability of nitrofurantoin to interact with HbO2 and cause superoxide formation may represent one mechanism by which it produces red cell toxicity and suggests that generation of superoxide in erythrocytes may occur via a different mechanism than that which occurs in microsomes."

https://openalex.org/W1897720582,"Bovine lung angiotensin I-converting enzyme is rapidly and irreversibly inactivated by p-[N,N-bis(chloroethyl)amino]phenylbutyric acid (chlorambucil) and by the chlorambucil derivative of L-proline (chlorambucyl-proline). Chlorambucil is a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent that is used as an antineoplastic drug. At any one concentration, the inactivation is pseudo-first order with time. Inhibition by both substances is active site directed as suggested by the formation of a reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex prior to the alkylation reaction and by the fact that L-Phe-L-Pro, a reversible inhibitor which is competitive with substrate, is also competitive with both irreversible inhibitors in protecting the enzyme against inactivation. The second order rate constant for inactivation increases in the pH range 5-8 and reaches a value of 3.5 X 10(3) M-1 . min-1 for chlorambucil and 4.8 X 10(2) M-1 . min-1 for chlorambucyl-proline. Chlorambucyl [U-14C]L-proline reacts 1:1 with the converting enzyme and the uptake of radioactivity paralleled the loss of enzyme activity with and without protection by Phe-Pro. Once bound, the radioactive chlorambucyl proline was released (as the dihydroxy derivative) by hydroxide ion with a second order rate constant of 2.2 M-1 . min-1 at 25 degrees C. The radioactive label is also removed by hydroxylamine at pH 10. The lability of the irreversibly bound inhibitor in alkali and in hydroxylamine indicates that an ester bond is formed by the alkylation of an aspartic acid or glutamic acid side chain."
https://openalex.org/W1590760046,"We have used radiation inactivation and target theory to determine the size of the functional unit for T3 binding in rat liver chromatin. The process involves exposure of frozen chromatin samples to a beam of high energy electrons produced in a linear accelerator and subsequent measurement of the residual capacity to bind hormone. Our experiments were carried out using three forms of solubilized chromatin: 1) sonicated, containing the receptor in fragments which sedimented faster than 30 S; 2) digested by nuclease, containing the receptor in a form which sedimented at 5-6 S; 3) digested by nuclease and made 0.5 M in KCl, containing the receptor in a form which sedimented at 3.8 S. We have shown that in each sample preparation the receptor retained the ability to bind T3 with the same capacity and affinity that had previously been measured with high molecular weight chromatin. Irradiation caused a reduction in the capacity to bind T3 but did not change the affinity of the remaining receptors for the hormone. In each preparation, the radiation resulted in a simple exponential loss of binding capacity with dose, indicating that a single target size was detected. Within the variation of the measurements, the target size for each form of the receptor was the same, 59,000 daltons."
https://openalex.org/W1553499671,"Abstract Membranes prepared from highly purified rat liver lysosomes contain endogenous protein-phosphorylation activities. The transfer of phosphate to membrane fractions from [gamma-32P]ATP was analyzed by gel electrophoresis under acidic denaturing conditions. Two phosphopeptides were detected, with molecular weights of 3,000 and 14,000. Phosphorylation of these proteins was unaffected by the addition of cAMP, cGMP, or the heat-stable inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. No additional phosphorylation was observed when cAMP-dependent protein kinase was included in the reaction or when exogenous protein kinase substrates were added. The 14,000-dalton 32P-labeled product was formed rapidly in the presence of low concentrations (250 microM) of either Ca2+ or Mg2+. This product was labile under both acidic and alkaline conditions, suggesting that this protein contains an acyl phosphate, present presumably as a catalytic intermediate in a phosphotransferase reaction. The lower molecular weight species required a high concentration (5 mM) of Mg2+ for phosphorylation, and micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ stimulated the Mg2+-dependent activity. The addition of Ca2+ and calmodulin stimulated the phosphorylation reaction to a greater extent than with Ca2+ alone. This activity was strongly inhibited by 0.2 mM LaCl3 and to a lesser extent by 50 microM chlorpromazine or trifluoperazine. These results suggest that the 3000-dalton peptide may be phosphorylated by a Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent kinase associated with the lysosomal membrane."
