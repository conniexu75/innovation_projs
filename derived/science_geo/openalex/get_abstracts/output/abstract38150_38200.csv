https://openalex.org/W1671926542,"The dependence of glutamate uptake on ATP-generated proton electrochemical potential was studied in a highly purified preparation of synaptic vesicles from rat brain. At low chloride concentration (4 mM), the proton pump present in synaptic vesicles generated a large membrane potential (inside-positive), associated with only minor acidification. Under these conditions, the rate of L-[3H]glutamate uptake was maximal. In addition, L-glutamate induced acidification of the vesicle interior. D-Glutamate produced only 40% of the effect, and L-aspartate or gamma-aminobutyric acid produced less than 5%. The initial rate of glutamate-induced acidification increased with increasing glutamate concentration. It was saturable and showed first-order kinetics (KM = 0.32 mM). Correspondingly, L-glutamate induced a small reduction in the membrane potential. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was unaffected. In comparison, glutamate had no effect on acidification or membrane potential in resealed membranes of chromaffin granules. At high chloride concentration (150 mM), the vesicular proton pump generated a large pH difference, associated with a small change in membrane potential. Under these conditions, uptake of L-[3H]glutamate by synaptic vesicles was low. For reconstitution, vesicle proteins were solubilized with the detergent sodium cholate, supplemented with brain phospholipids, and incorporated into liposomes. Proton pump and glutamate uptake activities of the proteoliposomes showed properties similar to those of intact vesicles indicating that the carrier was reconstituted in a functionally active form. It is concluded that glutamate uptake by synaptic vesicles is dependent on the membrane potential and that all components required for uptake are integral parts of the vesicle membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2081562390,"Lasting modifications of the receptive fields of neurons in the visual cortex can be induced by pairing visual stimuli with iontophoretic application of the neuromodulators acetylcholine and noradrenaline or the excitatory amino acids N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and L-glutamate. The modifications are obtained in less than 1 hour and persist for more than 40 minutes. Thus, acetylcholine and norepinephrine have a permissive role in use-dependent neuronal plasticity. These results support the notion of a postsynaptic threshold for neuronal malleability that differs from that of sodium-dependent action potentials."

https://openalex.org/W2031351133,"The alpha subunits of Gs and Gi link different sets of hormone receptors to stimulation and inhibition, respectively, of adenylyl cyclase. A chimeric alpha i/alpha s cDNA was constructed that encodes a polypeptide composed of the amino terminal 60% of an alpha i chain and the carboxyl terminal 40% of alpha s. The cDNA was introduced via a retroviral vector into S49 cyc- cells, which lack endogenous alpha s. Although less than half of the hybrid alpha chain is derived from alpha s, its ability to mediate beta-adrenoceptor stimulation of adenylyl cyclase matched that of the normal alpha s polypeptide expressed from the same retroviral vector in cyc- cells. This result indicates that carboxyl terminal amino acid sequences of alpha s contain the structural features that are required for specificity of interactions with the effector enzyme, adenylyl cyclase, as well as with the hormone receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1522405441,"Many types of peptide hormone and neurotransmitter receptors mediate hydrolysis of phosphoinositides (PI) and arachidonic acid and arachidonic acid metabolite (AA) release, but the relation between these responses is not clearly defined. We have characterized bradykinin (BK)-mediated AA release and PI hydrolysis in clonal Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK-D1). Both responses occurred over a similar dose range in response to the B1 and B2 receptor agonist, BK, but not in response to the B1 receptor-selective agonist des-Arg-BK. To test whether AA release occurs via a mechanism which is sequential to and dependent upon PI hydrolysis, we used the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which activates protein kinase C. TPA treatment blocked BK-mediated PI hydrolysis in MDCK-D1 cells, while at the same time and at similar concentrations enhancing BK-mediated AA release. Thus, TPA treatment dissociated BK-mediated AA release from PI hydrolysis. In addition, treatment of MDCK-D1 cells with neomycin blocked BK-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate without reducing BK-mediated AA release. BK treatment increased formation of lysophospholipids with a time course in accord with BK-mediated AA release, indicating that at least part of the BK-mediated AA release was likely derived from activation of phospholipase A2. BK-mediated lysophospholipid production was enhanced by pretreatment with TPA, suggesting that the mechanism of AA release before and after treatment with TPA was the same. BK-mediated AA release and lysophospholipid production was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium, while the enhanced responses to BK in the presence of TPA were not dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. TPA treatment also enhanced AA release and lysophospholipid production in response to the calcium ionophore A23187. From these data we propose that BK, acting at B2 receptors, promotes AA release in MDCK cells via a mechanism which is 1) independent of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis by phospholipase C, 2) dependent upon influx of extracellular calcium and activation of phospholipase A2, and 3) enhanced by activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1547349392,"The mode of action on actin polymerization of skeletal muscle actin ADP-ribosylated on arginine 177 by perfringens iota toxin was investigated. ADP-ribosylated actin decreased the rate of nucleated actin polymerization at substoichiometric ratios of ADP-ribosylated actin to monomeric actin. ADP-ribosylated actin did not tend to copolymerize with actin. Actin filaments were depolymerized by the addition of ADP-ribosylated actin. The maximal monomer concentration reached by addition of ADP-ribosylated actin was similar to the critical concentration of the pointed ends of actin filaments. ADP-ribosylated actin had no effect on the rate of polymerization of gelsolin-capped actin filaments which polymerize at the pointed ends. The results suggest that ADP-ribosylated actin acts as a capping protein which binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments to inhibit polymerization. Based on an analysis of the depolymerizing effect of ADP-ribosylated actin, the equilibrium constant for binding of ADP-ribosylated actin to the barbed ends of actin filaments was determined to be about 10(8) M-1. As actin is ADP-ribosylated by perfringens iota toxin and by botulinum C2 toxin, it appears that conversion of actin into a capping protein by ADP-ribosylation is a pathophysiological reaction catalyzed by bacterial toxins which ultimately leads to inhibition of actin assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2027615173,"The cytoplasmic domain of transferrin receptor (TR) is essential for endocytosis of this transmembrane protein. We have investigated by electron microscopy the association of wild-type and cytoplasmic deletion mutant human TR with coated pits at the surface of transfected L cell lines. Approximately 15% of wild-type TR was concentrated in coated pits, regardless of the level of TR expression. In contrast, only 2% of deletion mutant TR was present in these structures. We also correlated the frequency of coated pits with the level of TR expression in different transfected L cell lines. Expression of more than 3 x 10(6) wild-type TR per cell was accompanied by up to a 4-fold increase in coated pits compared with nontransfected Ltk- cells. No such increase was observed in a cell line expressing a similarly high level of cytoplasmic deletion mutant TR. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain plays an active role in sorting and endocytosis of TR by providing an assembly site for coated pit formation."
https://openalex.org/W1590445803,"The gene for human neutrophil elastase (NE), a powerful serine protease carried by blood neutrophils and capable of destroying most connective tissue proteins, was cloned from a genomic DNA library of a normal individual. The NE gene consists of 5 exons and 4 introns included in a single copy 4-kilobase segment of chromosome 11 at q14. The coding exons of the NE gene predict a primary translation product of 267 residues including a 29-residue N-terminal precursor peptide and a 20-residue C-terminal precursor peptide. Analysis of the N-terminal peptide sequence suggests it contains a 27-residue pre signal peptide followed by a proN dipeptide, similar to that of other blood cell lysosomal proteases. The sequences for the mature 218-residue NE protein are included in exons II-V. The 5'-flanking region of the gene includes typical TATA, CAAT, and GC sequences within 61 base pairs (bp) of the cap site. The sequence 1.5 kilobases 5' to exon I contains several interesting repetitive sequences including six tandem repeats of unique 52- or 53-bp sequences. The 5'-flanking region also contains a 19-bp segment with 90% homology to a segment of the 5'-flanking region of the human myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene, a gene also expressed in bone marrow precursor cells and a protein stored in the same neutrophil granules as NE. In addition, like the MPO gene, the NE 5'-flanking region has several regions with greater than or equal to 75% homology to sequences 5' to c-myc, but there is no overlap between the NE-c-myc and MPO-c-myc homologous sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1515313654,"Type beta transforming growth factors (TGF) are disulfide-linked homo- and heterodimers of two related polypeptide chains, beta 1 and beta 2. The homodimers TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 are widely distributed, but the heterodimer TGF-beta 1.2 has been found only in porcine platelets (Cheifetz, S., Weatherbee, J.A., Tsang, M.L.-S., Anderson, J.K., Mole, J.E., Lucas, R., and Massague, J. (1987) Cell 48, 409-415). Here we characterize the receptor binding and biological properties of TGF-beta 1.2 and compare them with those of TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2. Three types of cell surface receptors previously identified by affinity labeling with 125I-TGF-beta 1 are available for binding to TGF-beta 1.2. These three types of receptors are detected as 65-kDa (type I), 85-95-kDa (type II), and 250-350-kDa (type III) affinity-labeled receptor complexes on electrophoresis gels. They co-exist in many cell types, have high affinity for TGF-beta 1, and varying degrees of affinity for TGF-beta 2. Of the 11 cell lines screened in the present study none showed evidence for additional receptor types that would bind TGF-beta 2 but not TGF-beta 1. In receptor competition studies, TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 1.2, and TGF-beta 2 competed for binding to type I and type II receptors with a relative order of potencies of 16:5:1 and 12:3:1, respectively, whereas all three forms of TGF-beta were equipotent as ligands for the type III receptors. The three forms of TGF-beta were equally potent at stimulating the biosynthesis of extracellular sulfated proteoglycan in BRL-3A rat liver epithelial cells, a response that presumably involves the type III receptor present in these cells. In contrast, the ability of the three ligands to inhibit the growth of B6SUt-A multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cells which display only type I receptors decreased in the order TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 1.2, and TGF-beta 2 with a relative potency of 100:30:1. The results indicate that the presence of one beta 1 chain in TGF-beta 1.2 increases (with respect to TGF-beta 2) the biological potency and binding affinity toward receptor types I and II, but the presence of a second beta 1 chain in the dimer is required for full potency."
https://openalex.org/W1591434433,Retinoic acid acts as an acute and specific inducer of tissue transglutaminase in mouse resident peritoneal macrophages. We have isolated cDNA clones for this enzyme and used them to demonstrate that this induction is due to the accumulation of tissue transglutaminase mRNA that occurs within minutes of exposure of macrophages to retinoic acid. The retinoic acid-induced increase in tissue transglutaminase mRNA is independent of concurrent protein synthesis and is due to an increased transcription of the tissue transglutaminase gene. Our results demonstrate that retinoic acid is capable of inducing acute transcriptional activation of gene expression in myeloid cells.
https://openalex.org/W1999881560,"The binding of antigen or monoclonal antibody to the T cell receptor for antigen or the closely associated CD3 complex causes increases in the concentration of intracellular ionized calcium and subsequent cell proliferation. By measuring second messenger production in primary cultures of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)--infected T cells stimulated with monoclonal antibodies specific for either CD3 or CD2, a specific impairment of membrane signaling was revealed. The HIV-1--infected T cells were unable to mobilize Ca2+ after stimulation with anti-CD3, whereas CD2-induced calcium mobilization remained intact. Furthermore, the HIV-1--infected cells proliferated poorly after CD3 stimulation, although the cells retained normal DNA synthesis in response to interleukin-2 stimulation. These results show that the signals initiated by CD2 and CD3 can be regulated independently within the same T cell; uncoupling of signal transduction after antigen-specific stimulation provides a biochemical mechanism to explain, in part, the profound immunodeficiency of patients with HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W1523834996,"The yeast fatty acid synthase consists of two multifunctional proteins, alpha and beta, arranged in an alpha 6 beta 6 complex with a molecular weight of 2.4 x 10(6). Five of the seven enzymatic activities reside in the beta subunit, while the remaining two activities, beta-ketoacyl synthase and beta-ketoacyl reductase, and the domain of the acyl carrier protein, with its prosthetic group, 4′-phosphopantetheine, are in the alpha subunit. The genes FAS1 and FAS2 coding for beta and alpha subunits, respectively, have been cloned and the sequence of FAS1 has been reported (Chirala, S. S., Kuziora, M. A., Spector, D. M., and Wakil, S. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4231-4240). In this study, we present the nucleotide sequence of the FAS2 gene. The sequence has an open reading frame, coding for a protein of 1894 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 207,863. The location of the serine site of attachment of the prosthetic group of the acyl carrier protein domain and the active cysteine-SH site of beta-ketoacyl synthase have been identified at residues 180 and 1312, respectively, in the deduced amino acid sequence. A putative NADPH binding site of beta-ketoacyl reductase has been suggested at residue 1038 based on the similarities to the consensus amino acid sequences -Gly-Ser-Ala- of the pyridine nucleotide enzymes. We could not find any sequence homology in the 5′ flanking sequence of the FAS1 and FAS2 genes that would suggest common regulatory function. However, in the sequence of these two genes there is an identical eight-base pair sequence TCATTATG at the translational initiation site suggesting that the subunit stoichiometry probably results from equal translational efficiency of the mRNAs of both FAS1 and FAS2 genes. The S1 endonuclease mapping suggests that there is a transcriptional initiation site at about 40 nucleotides upstream of the first ATG codon and a transcriptional termination site about 300 nucleotides downstream of the TAG stop codon. The gene does not contain introns as no intron consensus TACTAAC have been found in the sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2043940775,"The CD2 antigen can mediate mitogenesis of T lymphocytes after binding combinations of monoclonal antibodies. To examine the importance of the cytoplasmic domain in signaling, rat CD2 cDNA has been transfected into the human Jurkat cell line and triggering of an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) has been assayed. In cells expressing full-length CD2, a clear signal was triggered with anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, a barely detectable increase in [Ca2+]i occurred with mutant rat CD2 molecules that included only 6 or 40 amino acids of the full-length cytoplasmic domain of 116 residues. It thus appears that the CD2 cytoplasmic domain plays a role in the signaling event."
https://openalex.org/W1547302324,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) is a single polypeptide chain that contains 613 amino acids and is arranged into three structural domains. Domain I is responsible for cell recognition, II for translocation of PE across membranes and III for ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2. Treatment of PE with reagents that react with lysine residues has been shown to lead to a reduction in cytotoxic activity apparently due to a modification of domain I (Pirker, R., FitzGerald, D. J. P., Hamilton, T. C., Ozols, R. F., Willingham, M. C., and Pastan, S. (1985) Cancer Res. 45, 751-757). To determine which lysine residues are important in cell recognition, all 12 lysines in domain I were converted to glutamates by site-directed mutagenesis. Also, two deletion mutants encompassing almost all of domain I (amino acids 4-252) or most of domain I (amino acids 4-224) were studied. The mutant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli, purified, and tested for their cytotoxic activity against Swiss 3T3 cells and in mice. The data indicate that conversion of lysine 57 to glutamate reduces cytotoxic activity towards 3T3 cells 50-100-fold and in mice about 5-fold. Deletion of amino acids 4-224 causes a similar reduction in toxicity towards cells and mice. Deletion of most of the rest of domain I (amino acids 4-252) causes a further reduction in toxicity toward cells and mice indicating this second region between amino acids 225 and 252 of domain I is also important in the toxicity of PE. Competition assays indicated that the ability of PEGlu57 to bind to 3T3 cells was greatly diminished, accounting for its diminished cytotoxic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1519339778,"The mitochondrial ATP synthase beta subunit is encoded by a nuclear gene and assembled with the other subunits encoded by both mitochondrial and nuclear genes. As the next step in the analysis of the molecular mechanisms coordinating the two genetic systems, the gene for the human beta subunit was cloned, and its structure was determined. The gene contains 10 exons, with the first exon corresponding to the noncoding region and most of the presequence which targets this protein to the mitochondria. Eight Alu repeating sequences including inverted repeats were found in the 5' upstream region and introns. An S1 nuclease protection experiment revealed two initiation sites for the transcription. A typical TATA box was not present at about 30 base pairs upstream from either initiation site. Three CAT boxes (CCAAT) were found between the two initiation sites. In addition, one CAT box was found 41 base pairs upstream from the first initiation site. Two GC boxes (potential Sp1 binding sites) were located in the 5' upstream region, one of them linked to Alu repeating sequences. For determination of the promoter activity, fragments of various length from the 5' upstream region were fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and transfected into cultured cells. This experiment showed the existence of an enhancing, structure(s) for transcription between nucleotide -400 and -1100 in the upstream region."

https://openalex.org/W101673060,"In dispersed rat parotid gland acinar cells, the beta-adrenergic agonist (-)-isoproterenol, but not its stereoisomer (+)-isoproterenol, induced a transient 1.6-fold (at maximum stimulation, 2 x 10(-4) M) increase in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) within 9 s, which returned to resting levels (approximately 190 nM) by 60 s. This [Ca2+]i response was not altered by chelating extracellular Ca2+ with [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and could be completely blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonists propranolol (beta 1 + beta 2) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2) but not by atenolol (beta 1). The muscarinic-cholinergic agonist carbachol (at maximum stimulation, 10(-5) M) induced a 3-4-fold elevation in [Ca2+]i within 6 s, which slowly returned to resting levels by 8-10 min. The peak carbachol [Ca2+]i response was not substantially altered by the addition of EGTA to the extracellular medium. However, if the cells were first stimulated with isoproterenol in the EGTA-containing medium, the peak carbachol response was decreased approximately 54%. When carbachol was added to cells in the presence of high extracellular calcium, at the isoproterenol-stimulated [Ca2+]i peak, the resulting [Ca2+]i level was equal to that achieved when carbachol was either added alone or added after propranolol and isoproterenol. 8-Bromo-cyclic AMP induced a [Ca2+]i response similar to that elicited by isoproterenol, which was not additive to that by carbachol. Carbachol induced a approximately 3.5-fold increase in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production in parotid cells within 30 s. 8-Bromo-cAMP, N6,O2'-dioctanoyl-cAMP, and isoproterenol consistently induced a significant stimulation in IP3 production. The half-maximal concentration of isoproterenol required for [Ca2+]i mobilization and IP3 production was comparable (approximately 10(-5) M). Isoproterenol-induced IP3 formation was blocked by propranolol. The data show that in rat parotid acinar cells, beta-adrenergic stimulation results in IP3 formation and mobilization of a carbachol-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pool by a mechanism involving cAMP. This demonstrates an interaction between the cAMP and phosphoinositide second messenger systems in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1496703636,"By using gel filtration chromatography, following the technique of Hummel and Dreyer (Hummel, J., and Dreyer, W. (1962) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 63, 532-534), the adenine nucleotide-binding sites of isolated soluble chloroplast ATPase (CF1) and of the beta subunit were studied. CF1 possesses six adenine nucleotide-binding sites: two high affinity sites for ADP or ATP (KdH = 1-5 microM) in addition to one site where endogenous not-exchangeable ADP is bound, and three low affinity sites binding ADP or ATP with a dissociation constant (KdL = 15-20 microM) which is considerably increased in the presence of pyrophosphate. KdH is not modified by addition of pyrophosphate. The stability of nucleotide binding at the low affinity sites increases after heat activation of CF1. Removal of the delta or epsilon subunits on CF1 affects neither the number nor the binding parameters of the nucleotide-binding sites. The purified beta subunit possesses one easily exchangeable site/subunit. It is proposed that the low affinity sites on CF1 are the catalytic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1504237050,"Certain individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) produce mutant forms of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor that fail to move from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Here, we describe the cloning and expression of one such mutant allele, FH 429. The mutation causes a substitution of a Val for a Gly at residue 544. When recreated in an expressible cDNA, this substitution gives rise to an LDL receptor that is not transported to the cell surface and is rapidly degraded. Three previously mapped transport-deficient alleles of the LDL receptor were traced to the cysteine-rich repeats of the protein, suggesting that the generation of non-disulfide-bonded (free) cysteines might cause the block in transport. The FH 429 mutation is not located in a cysteine-rich region, however. We have attempted to test the role of cysteine by expressing mutant cDNAs that encode proteins blocked in transport and predicted to contain free cysteines. The results suggest that free cysteines are not obligatory for the blocked intracellular movement of mutant LDL receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1560483300,"Adherence reactions involving human leukocytes are mediated by a family of glycoprotein surface antigens composed of three different alpha subunits designated alpha L, alpha M, and alpha X, each of which is associated with a single beta subunit in an alpha 1 beta 1 heterodimer structure. We cloned the cDNA for the common beta subunit and investigated beta subunit mRNA expression in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and human granulocytic cells. Leukocyte adherence receptor beta subunit mRNA transcripts were present in low levels in HL-60 myeloblasts and promyelocytes and increased 10-fold or greater with chemically induced differentiation to more mature granulocytes (using retinoic acid and dimethylformamide) or monocyte/macrophages (using phorbol myristate acetate). Levels of beta subunit mRNA expression were also increased both in normal human peripheral blood granulocytes and in granulocytes from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Nuclear run-off assays indicated that the increased steady state level of the beta subunit mRNA in retinoic acid-differentiated HL-60 cells was secondary to enhanced beta subunit gene transcription. We conclude that mRNA levels for the beta subunit of the receptor on human leukocytes that mediates cellular adherence are increased in more mature granulocytic cells compared to immature myeloid precursors and that this enhanced mRNA expression is transcriptionally regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1540329258,"Tryptic peptide fragments of tyrosine hydroxylase isolated from 32PO4-prelabeled bovine adrenal chromaffin cells are resolved into seven phosphopeptides by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. All seven of the peptides are phosphorylated on serine residues. Three of these putative phosphorylation sites, peptides 3, 5, and 6, are rapidly phosphorylated (5-fold in 15 s) by both acetylcholine stimulation and potassium depolarization of the cells, and this phosphorylation is accompanied by a similarly rapid activation of the enzyme. Both phosphorylation and activation are transient and do not account for the prolonged increase in catecholamine biosynthesis produced by these stimuli. Peptides 4 and 7 show a much slower and sustained increase in phosphorylation (3-fold in 4 min) in response to acetylcholine and potassium. Phosphorylation of these peptides correlates with the sustained increase in catecholamine biosynthesis rather than enzyme activation. Peptides 1 and 2 are not stimulated by any agonist yet employed and thus show no relation to enzyme activation or catecholamine biosynthesis. Phosphorylation of all five peptides by acetylcholine or potassium is calcium-dependent. In contrast to the stimulation of phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase on multiple sites, forskolin stimulates the phosphorylation of only peptide 6, and this is accompanied by a coordinated activation of tyrosine hydroxylase and increased catecholamine biosynthesis. These findings show that the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in intact cells is more complex than predicted from in vitro results, that at least two protein kinases are involved in the secretagogue-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, and that the regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis, in response to phosphorylation, appears to involve both tyrosine hydroxylase activation and other mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1499007388,"Binding experiments indicate that mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase can associate with the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and that mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase can associate with this binary complex to form a ternary complex. Formation of this ternary complex enables low levels of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, in the presence of the aminotransferase, to reverse inhibition of malate oxidation by glutamate. Thus, glutamate can react with the aminotransferase in this complex without glutamate inhibiting production of oxalacetate by the malate dehydrogenase in the complex. The conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate could also be facilitated because in the trienzyme complex, oxalacetate might be directly transferred from malate dehydrogenase to the aminotransferase. In addition, association of malate dehydrogenase with these other two enzymes enhances malate dehydrogenase activity due to a marked decrease in the Km of malate. The potential ability of the aminotransferase to transfer directly alpha-ketoglutarate to the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex in this multienzyme system plus the ability of succinyl-CoA, a product of this transfer, to inhibit citrate synthase could play a role in preventing alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate from accumulating in high levels. This would maintain the catalytic activity of the multienzyme system because alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate allosterically inhibit malate dehydrogenase and dissociate this enzyme from the multienzyme system. In addition, citrate also competitively inhibits fumarase. Consequently, when the levels of alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate are high and the multienzyme system is not required to convert glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate, it is inactive. However, control by citrate would be expected to be absent in rapidly dividing tumors which characteristically have low mitochondrial levels of citrate."
https://openalex.org/W1586907848,"Modification of Tyr-345 at a catalytic site in a single beta subunit of the bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase (MF1) by 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoylinosine did not affect subsequent labeling of noncatalytic sites at Tyr-368 and His-427 in three copies of the beta subunit by 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA). These results clearly show that the beta subunit contains at least parts of the catalytic and noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites. Inactivation of MF1 by 96% with FSBA was accompanied by a decrease in the endogenous ADP content from 1.86 to 0.10 mol per mol of MF1. Decrease in the endogenous ADP content during the inactivation of the enzyme with FSBA paralleled loss in activity in a manner which suggests that the reaction of FSBA with an open noncatalytic site promoted release of ADP from another noncatalytic site until the third site reacted with FSBA. Two pKa values of about 5.9 and 7.6 were observed on the acid side of the pH optimum in the pH-rate profile for ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by MF1 in neutral acid buffers. In contrast, a single pKa of 5.9 was present in the pH-rate profile for ITP hydrolysis catalyzed by the enzyme in the same buffers. The augmented rate observed for ATP hydrolysis at pH 8.0, over that observed at pH 6.5, was lost as the enzyme was inactivated by FSBA in a manner suggesting that modulation is lost as the third noncatalytic site is modified. This suggests that ATP hydrolysis by MF1 is modulated in a pH-dependent manner by ATP binding to an open noncatalytic site. Two other modulations associated with binding of adenine nucleotides to noncatalytic sites, ADP-induced hysteretic inhibition and apparent negative cooperativity reflected by the Hill coefficient for the hydrolysis of 50-3000 microM ATP at pH 8.0, also disappeared as the third noncatalytic site reacted with FSBA."
https://openalex.org/W1904501053,"Three major forms of somatostatin were isolated from pancreas of the lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). One of the two major forms is a 14-residue somatostatin (SS-14) having the sequence AGCKNFFWKTFSSC. The homologous substitution Ser for Thr in position 12 is the first example of SS-14 from vertebrate preprosomatostatin gene I having a divergent sequence. The longest form is 37 residues in length (SS-37) and has the sequence ALRAAAVAGSPQQLLPLGQRERKAGCKNFFWKTFSSC. A 34-residue form (SS-34) identical in sequence but truncated at a single Arg residue at position 3 of SS-37 was also isolated. The yields of the three forms were SS-37 (0.43 nmol/g), SS-34 (134 nmol/g), and SS-14 (51.5 nmol/g). The identification of this nested series of somatostatins suggests that prosomatostatin processing in lamprey more closely resembles that observed for procholecystokinin than that of mammalian or other piscine prosomatostatins. Somatostatin-producing cells in the lamprey pancreas were identified by immunostaining using antiserum against SS-34 and anti-serum against mammalian SS-14."
https://openalex.org/W1650161087,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) contains a disulfide which is generally considered to be required for biological activity. A truncated linear ANP analog, des-Cys105,Cys121-ANP-(104-126) (referred to as analog I), that lacks the 2 cysteine residues of the parent peptide was synthesized. In competition binding studies using rabbit lung membranes, ANP-(103-126) and analog I displaced bound 125I-ANP-(103-126) from specific ANP binding sites 100 and 73%, respectively. The concentrations of ANP-(103-126) and analog I that produced 50% inhibition of radioligand binding to the membranes were 0.26 +/- 0.07 and 0.31 +/- 0.09 nM, respectively. Radioiodinated ANP-(103-126) and analog I were chemically cross-linked to binding sites on rabbit lung membranes, and the labeled membrane proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. 125I-Analog I specifically labeled a 65,000-dalton protein and a 135,000-dalton protein which, under reducing conditions, dissociated into 65,000-dalton subunits. In contrast, 125I-ANP-(103-126) labeled specifically a nonreducible 135,000-dalton protein, in addition to the 65,000-dalton species and the reducible 135,000-dalton species. ANP-(103-126) (100 nM) stimulated rabbit lung particulate guanylate cyclase activity, whereas analog I, at the same concentration, had no effect on cyclic GMP production and did not antagonize the effect of ANP-(103-126). From these observations, we conclude that analog I is a selective ligand which binds to approximately 73% of the total ANP binding sites present in rabbit lung membranes. Unlike ANP-(103-126), analog I does not bind to the remaining 27% of the binding sites and does not activate guanylate cyclase. Binding to the cyclase-linked ANP receptor correlates with the specific labeling by 125I-ANP-(103-126) of the nonreducible 135,000-dalton membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1512660565,"Four random mutations of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which result in thermosensitive growth have been sequenced. All of the mutations map in regions conserved by the family of ATPases which form a phosphorylated intermediate. The Gly254—-Ser mutation affects a glycine residue conserved in all of the sequenced ATPases. The Thr212—-Ile and Ala547—-Val mutations do not affect conserved amino acids, but their replacements are not found in any of the sequenced ATPases. Thr212 and Gly254 occur in the proposed phosphatase domain, whereas Ala547 is located within the putative ATP-binding site. The other mutation is a double change (Asp91—-Tyr and Glu92—-Lys) in the N-terminal domain, in which the altered glutamate is conserved in fungal and protozoan H+-ATPases. Proton efflux from whole cells and ATP hydrolysis by purified plasma membranes are more thermolabile in cells carrying the ATPase mutations than in wild-type yeast. Therefore, the defects in growth and proton transport at the nonpermissive temperature can be attributed to impairment of ATPase activity. Incubation of wild-type yeast cells with glucose before homogenization induces changes in the specific activity, Km, pH optimum, and vanadate sensitivity of the plasma membrane ATPase. The Ala547—-Val mutation results in an enzyme from starved cells with the kinetic parameters of the glucose-activated wild-type ATPase. Therefore, a single amino acid change mimics the poorly understood regulatory mechanism triggered by glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1585696270,"The present study represents detailed investigations into the nature of interactions between an intracellular tissue transglutaminase and a plasma protein, fibrinogen. We demonstrate a specific, saturable, and reversible binding of transglutaminase to fibrin(ogen). The binding was time- and temperature-dependent, was independent of divalent metal ions, did not require the release of either fibrinopeptide A or B, and was partially inhibited by the presence of sodium chloride or plasma proteins, properties similar to Factor XIII binding to fibrin(ogen). Both Factor XIII and liver transglutaminase also shared similar binding sites on fibrinogen, the A alpha- and the B beta-chains. The binding characteristics of liver transglutaminase were thus similar to Factor XIII binding to fibrin, but there were also important differences. Scatchard analyses of the binding data indicated that the affinity of liver transglutaminase (Kd = 4.17 x 10(-7) M) was at least 40-fold weaker compared with the affinity of Factor XIII to fibrinogen. Consequently, a 20-fold molar excess of Factor XIII a-chains specifically and completely inhibited the binding of liver transglutaminase to des-A-fibrinogen. The association between liver transglutaminase and fibrin(ogen) was also critically controlled by the conformational states of the two proteins. Substances capable of altering the conformation of either transglutaminase (such as guanosine 5'-triphosphate) or of fibrinogen (such as the tetrapeptide Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro and Fragment D) disrupted binding. Excess CaCl2 was able to counteract the effects of guanosine 5'-triphosphate on transglutaminase binding to fibrin. In contrast, Factor XIII binding to fibrin was unaffected by either guanosine 5'-triphosphate, CaCl2, or Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro, suggesting a more stable association between the two proteins. The physiologic implications of transglutaminase-fibrin(ogen) interactions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1523817576,"The interaction of fibrinogen and fibronectin with hepatocytes has been dissociated into distinct binding and cross-linking steps. Binding and cross-linking of 125I-labeled ligands were both decreased by transglutaminase inhibitors, but not by heparin or hirudin. Transglutaminase activity was manifest by Ca2+-dependent incorporation of [14C]putrescine into cells. Preferential cross-linking of fibrinogen A alpha over gamma chains, and lack of inhibition by heparin or hirudin indicates the involvement of tissue transglutaminase, and not Factor XIIIa. Hepatic transglutaminase activity, as well as binding and cross-linking of fibrinogen and fibronectin, were maximally supported by Ca2+, partially supported by Mn2+ and Sr2+, and markedly decreased by Mg2+ and Ba2+. In contrast, Co2+ supported binding but not cross-linking or transglutaminase activity, indicating that binding and cross-linking are dissociable events. This conclusion was corroborated by the finding that fibrinogen fragments D95 and D78 both inhibited Ca2+-dependent fibrinogen binding without being cross-linked themselves. Ligand binding in the presence of either cation was localized to the cell surface as evidenced by its trypsin sensitivity. Thus, fibrinogen and fibronectin binding to hepatocytes is independent of transglutaminase activity, whereas cross-linking of these adhesive macromolecules requires an enzymatically active cellular transglutaminase. In addition, fibrinogen binding appears to be mediated by molecular determinants present in fragment D78."
https://openalex.org/W1550036492,"Previous work has shown that the tryptic degradation pattern of the Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase varies with the presence and absence of ligands, thus providing information about conformational states of the enzyme (Addison, R., and Scarborough, G. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 10421-10426; Brooker, R. J., and Slayman, C. W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8827-8832). In the present study, sites of tryptic cleavage have been mapped by immunoblotting with N- and C-terminal specific antibodies and by direct sequencing of proteolytic products after electro-transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride filters. In the absence of ligands (likely to represent the E1 conformation), trypsin cleaved the 100-kDa ATPase polypeptide at three sites very near the N terminus: Lys-24, Lys-36, and Arg-73. Removal of the first 36 amino acid residues only slightly affected ATPase activity, but removal of the subsequent 37 residues inactivated the enzyme completely. In the presence of vanadate and Mg2+ (E2 conformation), the rate of trypsinolysis at Arg-73 was greatly reduced, and enzyme activity was protected. In addition, a new cleavage site near the C terminus (Arg-900) became accessible to trypsin. Both effects of vanadate occurred at micromolar concentrations, well within the range previously measured for vanadate inhibition of ATPase activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the Neurospora ATPase undergoes significant conformational changes at both termini of the polypeptide during its reaction cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1559876061,"Abstract Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to show that ATP hydrolysis induces a change in the properties of two nucleotide-binding sites in isolated chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1). The fluorescence donor was Lucifer Yellow vinyl sulfone (4-amino-N-[3-(vinylsulfonyl)phenyl]naphthalimide- 3,6-disulfonate), covalently bound to a unique site on the alpha subunit between nucleotide-binding sites 2 and 3. The fluorescence acceptor was the ATP analog 2'(3')-trinitrophenyladenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP), incorporated specifically into nucleotide-binding site 1. Energy transfer from Lucifer Yellow to TNP-ATP in site 1 was greater if catalysis occurred before TNP-ATP was incorporated than if no catalysis occurred, indicating that one of the nucleotide-binding sites near the Lucifer Yellow had changed its properties to those of site 1 as a result of catalysis. The amount of energy transfer increased with the degree of substrate excess during catalysis, as expected if catalysis were required for the new site 1 location. ADP, which binds to CF1, but is not a substrate for hydrolysis, caused little energy transfer. Titration of site 3 with TNP-ATP showed greater energy transfer from Lucifer Yellow when catalysis had not occurred, indicating that sites 1 and 3 switched properties as a result of catalysis. The amount of energy transfer declined exponentially with time between removal of substrate and addition of TNP-ATP to site 1, with a half-time of 1.5-2 h at room temperature. This result suggests that the change that results in switching of nucleotide-binding sites 1 and 3 relaxes in the absence of substrate. Our results show that the asymmetry of the nucleotide-binding sites of CF1 is not a permanent feature of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1585641599,"Somatostatin is a 14-amino-acid peptide hormone that is proteolytically excised from its precursor, prosomatostatin, by the action of a paired-basic-specific protease. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mat alpha) synthesizes an analogous peptide hormone precursor, pro-alpha-factor, which is proteolytically processed by at least two separate proteases, the products of the KEX2 and STE13 genes, to generate the mature bioactive peptide. Expression in yeast of recombinant DNAs encoding hybrids between the proregion of alpha-factor and somatostatin results in proteolytic processing of the chimeric precursors and secretion of mature somatostatin. To determine if the chimeras were processed by the same enzymes that cleave endogenous pro-alpha-factor, the hybrid DNAs were introduced into kex2 and ste13 mutants, and the secreted proteins were analyzed. Expression of the pro-alpha-factor-somatostatin hybrids in kex2 mutant yeast resulted in secretion of a high molecular weight hyperglycosylated precursor. No mature somatostatin was secreted, and there was no proteolytic cleavage at the Lys-Arg processing site. Similarly, in ste13 yeast, only somatostatin molecules containing the (Glu-Ala)3 spacer peptide at the amino terminus were secreted. Our results demonstrate that in yeast processing mutants, the behavior of the chimeric precursors with respect to proteolytic processing was exactly as that of endogenous pro-alpha-factor. We conclude that the same enzymes that generate mature alpha-factor proteolytically process hybrid precursors. This suggests that structural domains of the proregion rather than the mature peptide are recognized by the processing proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1607125614,"Starved whole cells of alkalophilic Bacillus firmus OF4 that are equilibrated at either pH 10.2, 9.5, or 8.5 synthesize ATP in response to a pH gradient that is imposed by rapid dilution of the cyanide-treated cells into buffer at pH 7.5. If a valinomycin-mediated potassium diffusion potential (positive out) is generated simultaneously with the pH gradient, then the rate of ATP synthesis and the level of synthesis achieved is much higher than upon imposition of a pH gradient alone. By contrast, imposition of a large chemical gradient of Na+, either in the presence or absence of a concomitant diffusion potential, fails to result in ATP synthesis. We conclude that this organism does not possess a sodium-motive ATPase that can be made to synthesize detectable levels of ATP by imposition of a suitably large chemical or electrochemical gradient of Na+. On the other hand, a proton-translocating ATPase is in evidence when protons are provided at very high pH, corroborating our earlier work on extremely alkalophilic bacilli. Oxidative phosphorylation must, then, be catalyzed in these organisms by a proton-translocating ATPase even though the putative bulk driving forces for such a catalyst are low under optimal growth conditions. Stable, imposed pH gradients of 1 unit, comparable to the magnitude of the total electrochemical proton gradient of growing cells, result in much lower ATP concentrations than observed in such cells. We hypothesize that ATP synthesis in growing cells utilizes protons that are made available by some localized pathway between proton pumps and the ATP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1544739469,"beta-Adrenergic receptor (beta AR) blocking agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) can induce modest increases in beta AR-stimulated activity, such as rate and force of contraction in cardiac tissue. The molecular basis for this activity has been elusive. Previous studies have suggested that these compounds do not stimulate cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation even though activation of adenylate cyclase is the generally accepted mechanism for beta AR promotion of target cell response. In the current studies, we show that several beta AR antagonists with ISA (dichloroisoproterenol, pindolol, and celiprolol) stimulate cAMP accumulation five-, two-, and threefold, respectively, in S49 lymphoma cells, but only if cells are simultaneously incubated with the diterpene forskolin. The KI values observed for inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation or of beta AR [( 125I]iodocyanopindolol) binding for each of the beta blockers with ISA were comparable in magnitude to their respective EC50 values for forskolin-potentiated cAMP accumulation. The forskolin-potentiated responses of these compounds were abolished by the beta AR-antagonist propranolol. These results indicate that the ISA of beta-blocking drugs most likely results from a modest beta AR-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity. The results further suggest that treatment of target cells with forskolin provides a means to define partial agonism at receptors that are linked to stimulation of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1754364929,"Abstract The present paper demonstrates the terminal de- and reglycosylation of a rat hepatocyte plasma membrane glycoprotein, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV). Cultured hepatocytes were used in pulse-chase experiments with [3H]L-fucose and [14C]N-acetyl-D-mannosamine as markers for terminal carbohydrates, [3H]D-mannose as marker of a core-sugar, and [35S]L-methionine for labeling the protein backbone. Membrane DPP IV was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody which bound selectively at 4 degrees C to the cell-surface glycoprotein. The times of maximal labeling of hepatocyte plasma membrane DPP IV were 6-9 min for [3H]L-fucose, 20 min for [3H]D-mannose, and 25 min for [35S]L-methionine. When antibodies were bound to cell-surface DPP IV at 4 degrees C, the immune complex remained stable for more than 1 h after rewarming to 37 degrees C, despite ongoing metabolic and membrane transport processes. This was shown by pulse labeling with [35S]L-methionine at 37 degrees C, followed by cooling to 4 degrees C, and addition of antibody against plasma membrane DPP IV. During rewarming, the radioactivity in the complex remained constant. In a similar experiment with [3H]L-fucose, the radioactivity in the immune complex declined rapidly, indicating a defucosylation of the plasma membrane glycoprotein. Using the same experimental design with [3H]D-mannose, the radioactivity in the immune complex remained constant, showing that the core-sugar D-mannose is not cleaved from the membrane glycoprotein. Terminal reglycosylation (refucosylation and resialylation) was demonstrated as follows. Hepatocytes were maintained at 37 degrees C in a medium supplemented with tunicamycin in order to block the de novo synthesis of N-glycosidically bound carbohydrate chains. At 4 degrees C the antibody against DPP IV bound only to cell surface glycoprotein. During the rewarming period at 37 degrees C, radioactivity from [3H]L-fucose and [14C]N-acetyl-D-mannosamine became incorporated into the immune complex. This indicates a fucosylation and sialylation of the glycoprotein originally present at the cell surface. The mechanisms whereby terminal de- and reglycosylation of plasma membrane glycoproteins may occur during membrane recycling are discussed."

The half-maximum concentration required for the activation of the 200-kDa catalyst is 5.4.10(-9) M, whereas the one required for activation of the 47-kDa catalyst is 1.8.10(-10) M. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the 47-kDa catalyst specifically recognize both forms of the enzyme in purified state as well as in bacterial extracts on immunoblots. The antibody inhibits at similar titer adenylate cyclase activity of the purified forms as well as the activity present in dialyzed urea extract of the bacteria. It also prevents the penetration of the invasive B. pertussis adenylate cyclase into human lymphocytes. The inhibition induced by the antisera is specific to B. pertussis enzyme, since both calmodulin-dependent brain and sperm adenylate cyclase are not affected by the antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1532047358,"The plasma membrane H+-ATPase of Neurospora is a 100-kDa integral membrane protein which appears, on the basis of hydropathy analysis of its amino acid sequence, to span the lipid bilayer at least eight times. To investigate the assembly and processing of the ATPase, a full-length cDNA has been constructed for use in in vitro transcription and translation experiments. Comparison of three different forms of the ATPase (nascent protein, nascent protein cotranslationally inserted into membranes, and mature protein) revealed no difference in electrophoretic mobility. Furthermore, the nascent and mature forms gave identical peptide patterns after partial proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, suggesting that the ATPase does not contain an NH2-terminal signal peptide which is cleaved upon membrane insertion. Consistent with this interpretation, the NH2-terminal peptide has been purified from a tryptic digest of the ATPase and found to lack only the initiator methionine residue; the penultimate alanine is acetylated based on analysis by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy. Although the ATPase contains one potential site of N-linked glycosylation, its electrophoretic mobility was unchanged following digestion with endoglycosidase H and it did not incorporate [3H]mannose or bind concanavalin A. Thus, the Neurospora plasma membrane-ATPase appears to undergo minimal post-translational processing, and its membrane insertion is probably mediated by internal sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1543079543,"In Streptococcus faecalis (faecium), the cytoplasmic pH is regulated by proton extrusion via a proton translocating F1F0-ATPase; the level of this enzyme increases in response to cytoplasmic acidification (Kobayashi, H., Suzuki, T., and Unemoto, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 627-630). We describe here two novel acid-sensitive mutants, designated AS8 and AS17, that contain ATPase activity but fail to grow on acid media. Our data suggested that in mutant AS17, acidification of the cytoplasm stimulates synthesis of the F0 sector of the ATPase but not the F1 sector. The accumulation in the plasma membrane of F0 sectors devoid of F1 results in enhanced proton permeability, and as a consequence mutant AS17 is unable to regulate the cytoplasmic pH in acid media. The genetic defect may reside in a gene that regulates expression of the F1F0-ATPase. Mutant AS8 does not generate a proton motive force. Our results suggest that the F1F0-ATPase can hydrolyze ATP but fails to translocate protons due to a defect in one of the subunits of the F0 sector."

FDNP[14C]ADP was found to label the active site of mitochondrial F1-ATPase slowly at room temperature but with high specificity. F1 was effectively protected from the labeling reagent by ATP or ADP. An average number of 1.3 covalent label per F1 is sufficient for 100% inhibition of the ATPase. About 73% of the radioactive label was found covalently attached to beta subunits, 9% on alpha, practically none on gamma, delta, and epsilon. Cleavage of the labeled enzyme by pepsin and sequencing of the major radioactive peptide showed that the labeled amino acid residue in beta subunit was Lys beta 162. These results show that Lys beta 162 is indeed at the active site of F1 as assumed in the recently proposed models (Fry, D. C., Kuby, S. A., and Mildvan, A. S. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1487931076,"The C-terminal two-thirds of the rat liver ATP synthase beta subunit has been overexpressed and exported to the Escherichia coli periplasm under the direction of the alkaline phosphatase (phoA) promoter and leader peptide. The processed soluble protein contains the 358 amino acids from glutamate 122 to the rat liver beta C-terminal serine 479, including all the regions that have been predicted by chemical and genetic modification studies to be involved in nucleotide, Pi, and Mg2+ binding. Through a simple sequence of Tris/EDTA/lysozyme treatment, osmotic lysis, and alkaline pH washes, the processed beta subunit fragment can be prepared in greater than 95% purity and at a yield of greater than 20 mg/liter of culture. It interacts with 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) which exhibits a strong enhancement of fluorescence upon binding. A similar enhancement is observed upon interaction with TNP-ADP. Enhancement observed with both TNP-nucleotides is markedly reduced by prior addition of either ATP or ADP and almost completely prevented by the ATP synthase inhibitor 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. Both TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP bind at a stoichiometry of approximately 1 mol of nucleotide/mol of beta subunit fragment. Under the same conditions, TNP-AMP does not exhibit a fluorescence enhancement. This work demonstrates that, in the absence of interaction with other ATP synthase subunits, the rat liver beta subunit sequence from glutamate 122 to the C terminus exhibits no more than one readily detectable nucleotide binding domain. This success in producing a functional beta subunit fragment has significance for the pursuit of genetic and physical studies focused on the structure and function of the rat liver ATP synthase beta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1503592371,"Incubation of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, a target for the nonselective herbicide glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine), with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide in the presence of glycine ethyl ester resulted in a time-dependent loss of enzyme activity. The inactivation followed pseudo-first order kinetics, with a second order rate constant of 2.2 M-1 min-1 at pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C. The inactivation is prevented by preincubation of the enzyme with a combination of the substrate shikimate 3-phosphate plus glyphosate, but not by shikimate 3-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, or glyphosate alone. Increasing the concentration of glyphosate during preincubation resulted in decreasing the rate of inactivation of the enzyme. Complete inactivation of the enzyme required the modification of 4 carboxyl groups per molecule of the enzyme. However, statistical analysis of the residual activity and the extent of modification showed that among the 4 modifiable carboxyl groups, only 1 is critical for activity. Tryptic mapping of the enzyme modified in the absence of shikimate 3-phosphate and glyphosate by reverse phase chromatography resulted in the isolation of a [14C]glycine ethyl ester-containing peptide that was absent in the enzyme modified in the presence of shikimate 3-phosphate and glyphosate. By amino acid sequencing of this labeled peptide, the modified critical carboxyl group was identified as Glu-418. The above results suggest that Glu-418 is the most accessible reactive carboxyl group under these conditions and is located at or close to the glyphosate binding site."

Saturation curves for glutamine synthetase activity versus ATP with ADP as the changing fixed inhibitor were not hyperbolic; greater apparent Vmax values were observed in the presence of added ADP than the Vmax observed in the absence of ADP. Hill plots of data with ADP present curved upward and crossed the plot with no added ADP. The stoichiometry of adenine nucleotide binding to glutamine synthetase was examined. Two molecules of [gamma-32P]ATP were bound per subunit in the presence of methionine sulfoximine. These ATP molecules were bound at an allosteric site and at the active site. One molecule of either [gamma-32P]ATP or [14C]ADP bound per subunit in the absence of methionine sulfoximine; this nucleotide was bound at an allosteric site. ADP and ATP compete for binding at the allosteric site, although ADP was preferred. ADP binding to the allosteric site proceeded in two kinetic phases. A Vmax value of 1.55 units/mg was measured for glutamine synthetase with one ADP tightly bound per enzyme subunit; a Vmax value of 0.8 unit/mg was measured for enzyme with no adenine nucleotide bound at the allosteric site. The enzyme activation caused by the binding of ADP to the allosteric sites was preceded by a lag phase, the length of which was dependent on the ADP concentration. Enzyme incubated in 10 mM ADP bound approximately 4 mol of ADP/mol of native enzyme before activation was observed; the activation was complete when 7-8 mol of ADP were bound per mol of the octameric, native enzyme. The Km for ATP (2 mM) was not changed by ADP binding to the allosteric sites. ADP was a simple competitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.05 mM) of ATP for glutamine synthetase with eight molecules of ADP tightly bound to the allosteric sites of the octamer. Binding of ATP to the allosteric sites led to marked inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1604260784,"The yeast plasma membrane proton-pumping ATPase forms a phosphorylated intermediate during the hydrolysis of ATP. The fraction of enzyme phosphorylated during steady-state ATP hydrolysis was studied as a function of substrate concentration (MgATP), Mg2+ concentration, and pH. The dependence of the fraction of enzyme phosphorylated on the concentration of MgATP is sigmoidal, and the isotherms can be fit with parameters and mechanisms similar to those used to describe ATP hydrolysis. The isotherm is significantly more sigmoidal at pH 5.5 than at pH 6.0, with the limiting percentage (100.mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme) of enzyme phosphorylated being 70% and 6%, respectively, at the two pH values. The maxima in the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis occur at higher concentrations of Mg2+ and higher pH than the maxima in the fraction of enzyme phosphorylated. This suggests that the rate-determining step for ATP hydrolysis is different from that for enzyme phosphorylation and the hydrolysis of phosphoenzyme is enhanced by Mg2+ and high pH. The rate of phosphoenzyme formation was investigated with the quenched-flow method, but only a lower bound of 140 s-1 could be obtained for the rate constant at MgATP concentrations greater than 2.5 mM. Since the turnover number for ATP hydrolysis under similar conditions is 14 s-1, the rate-determining step in ATP hydrolysis occurs after enzyme phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1981583333,"The ATP synthase of chloroplasts consists of a proton-conducting portion, CF0, and a catalytic portion, CF1. The smaller subunits of CF1, in particular delta, may play a key role in the coupling of proton transport to ATP synthesis. Purified subunit delta, when added to partially CF1-depleted thylakoid membranes, can restore photophosphorylation (Engelbrecht, S., and Junge, W. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 172, 213-218). We report here that it does so by blocking proton conduction through CF0. Thylakoids were CF1-depleted by incubation in hypoosmolar NaCl/EDTA solutions. Variation of the NaCl concentrations and of the incubation times not only changed the overall degree of CF1 depletion but also the subunit composition of solubilized CF1, namely CF1 containing delta and CF1(-delta). This was quantified by immunoelectrophoresis and by fast protein liquid chromatography. Proton conduction was measured by flash spectrophotometry by using standard electrochromic and pH-indicating absorption changes. The removal of integral CF1 was correlated with high electric conductance of thylakoid membranes, an increased extent of rapid proton leakage, and loss of ATP synthesis activity, which exceeded the percentual loss of CF1. The removal of predominantly CF1(-delta) resulted in comparatively lesser effects on the loss of ATP synthesis and on the extent and velocity of proton leakage. On the same line, addition of integral CF1 and of purified delta diminished the electric leak in CF1-depleted thylakoids. Both approaches, the controlled removal of CF1 and CF1(-delta), respectively, and addition of delta and CF1 showed that delta can act as a stopcock to the exposed proton channel CF0."
https://openalex.org/W1538030507,"The usefulness of the indicator dye method for the detection of transient enzyme-product intermediates has been very limited due to the near impossibility of resolving the apparent single exponential time courses resulting from sequences of steps linked by rather similar rate constants. We propose here a novel approach, the proton-product time course method, a procedure which can extract a great deal of the mechanistic information which remains buried in conventional proton release-time course measurements. The method involves nothing more than measuring the ratio, r, of the moles of H+ released to the moles of product formed as a function of time. We derive the theory relating this r function to mechanisms of varying complexity, explore the theoretical behavior of the function in various possible mechanistic situations, and employ the new approach in an experimental system. We demonstrate the fact that the proton/product time course ratio method can provide evidence of the existence of hidden steps in transient state kinetic studies, that it can determine accurate thermodynamic pK values of the intermediate complexes involved in those steps, and that it can produce time courses of individual intermediates which are obscure to conventional kinetic methods."
