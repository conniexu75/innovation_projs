https://openalex.org/W2037473273,"The proto-oncogene bcl-2 inhibits apoptotic and necrotic neural cell death. Expression of Bcl-2 in the GT1-7 neural cell line prevented death as a result of glutathione depletion. Intracellular reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides rose rapidly in control cells depleted of glutathione, whereas cells expressing Bcl-2 displayed a blunted increase and complete survival. Modulation of the increase in reactive oxygen species influenced the degree of cell death. Yeast mutants null for superoxide dismutase were partially rescued by expression of Bcl-2. Thus, Bcl-2 prevents cell death by decreasing the net cellular generation of reactive oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W2139360111,"The mammalian interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE) has sequence similarity to the C. elegans cell death gene ced-3. We show here that overexpression of the murine ICE (mICE) gene or of the C. elegans ced-3 gene causes Rat-1 cells to undergo programmed cell death. Point mutations in a region homologous between mICE and CED-3 eliminate the ability of mICE and ced-3 to cause cell death. The cell death caused by mICE can be suppressed by overexpression of the crmA gene, a specific inhibitor of ICE, as well as by bcl-2, a mammalian oncogene that can act to prevent programmed cell death. Our results suggest that ICE may function during mammalian development to cause programmed cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2025948021,"The genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major concern thought to impact on immunologic escape and eventual vaccine efficacy. Here, simple and rapid methods are described for the detection and estimation of genetic divergence between HIV strains on the basis of the observation that DNA heteroduplexes formed between related sequences have a reduced mobility in polyacrylamide gels proportional to their degree of divergence. Reliable phylogenetic subtypes were assigned for HIV-1 strains from around the world. Relationships between viruses were closest when derived from the same or epidemiologically linked individuals. When derived from epidemiologically unlinked individuals, the relationships between viruses in a given geographic region correlated with the length of time HIV-1 had been detected in the population and the number of strains initiating widespread infection. Heteroduplex mobility analysis thus provides a tool to expedite epidemiological investigations by assisting in the classification of HIV and is readily applicable to the screening and characterization of other infectious agents and cellular genes."
https://openalex.org/W1980725176,"Yeast strains were constructed in which a single telomere could be eliminated from the end of a dispensable chromosome. In wild-type cells, elimination of a telomere caused a RAD9-mediated cell cycle arrest, indicating that telomeres help cells to distinguish intact chromosomes from damaged DNA. However, many cells recovered from the arrest without repairing the damaged chromosome, replicating and segregating it for as many as ten cell divisions prior to its eventual loss. Telomere elimination caused a dramatic increase in loss of the chromosome in all strains examined, demonstrating that yeast telomeres are also essential for maintaining chromosome stability. Thus, in spite of checkpoint and DNA damage repair systems, many chromosomes that lose a telomere are themselves destined for loss."
https://openalex.org/W2074991560,"Hydrogen exchange pulse labeling and stopped-flow circular dichroism were used to establish that the structure of the earliest detectable intermediate formed during refolding of apomyoglobin corresponds closely to that of a previously characterized equilibrium molten globule. This compact, cooperatively folded intermediate was formed in less than 5 milliseconds and contained stable, hydrogen-bonded secondary structure localized in the A, G, and H helices and part of the B helix. The remainder of the B helix folded on a much slower time scale, followed by the C and E helices and the CD loop. The data indicate that a molten globule intermediate was formed on the kinetic folding pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2082340361,"CD38 is a 42-kilodalton glycoprotein expressed extensively on B and T lymphocytes. CD38 exhibits a structural homology to Aplysia adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyl cyclase. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a metabolite of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) with calcium-mobilizing activity. A complementary DNA encoding the extracellular domain of murine CD38 was constructed and expressed, and the resultant recombinant soluble CD38 was purified to homogeneity. Soluble CD38 catalyzed the formation and hydrolysis of cADPR when added to NAD+. Purified cADPR augmented the proliferative response of activated murine B cells, potentially implicating the enzymatic activity of CD38 in lymphocyte function."
https://openalex.org/W2095129531,"In cultures of embryonic and adult mouse striatum, we previously demonstrated that EGF induces the proliferation of putative stem cells, which give rise to spheres of undifferentiated cells that can generate neurons and astrocytes. We report here that the spheres of undifferentiated cells contain mRNA and protein for the FGF receptor (FGFR1). Indirect immunocytochemistry demonstrated that many of the cells within the EGF-generated spheres were immunoreactive for FGFR1. Exogenous application of bFGF to the EGF-generated cells induced the proliferation of two progenitor cell types. The first, a bipotent progenitor cell, gave rise to cells with the antigenic and morphological properties of neurons and astrocytes; the other gave rise to cells with neuronal characteristics only. bFGF-generated cells with neuronal morphology exhibited electrophysiological properties indicative of immature central neurons. These results support the hypothesis that sequential actions of growth factors play a role in regulating the generation of neurons and astrocytes in the developing CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2118016880,"We have reproduced the process of protein transport across and of protein integration into the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum membrane by the use of proteoliposomes reconstituted from pure phospholipids and purified membrane proteins. The transport of some proteins requires only two membrane protein complexes: the signal recognition particle receptor, needed for targeting of a nascent chain to the membrane, and a novel complex, the Sec61p complex, that consists of Sec61p and two smaller polypeptides. The translocation of other proteins also needs the presence of the translocating chain-association membrane (TRAM) protein. The integration of two membrane proteins of different topologies into the membrane does not require additional components. These results indicate a surprising simplicity of the basic translocation machinery. They suggest that the Sec61p complex binds the ribosome during translocation and forms the postulated protein-conducting channel."
https://openalex.org/W2083579647,"The refinement of early connections in the visual pathway requires electrical activity in the retina before the onset of vision. Using a multielectrode array, we have shown that the spontaneous activity of cells in the neonatal ferret retina is correlated by patterns of periodically generated traveling waves. Here, we examine developmental changes in the characteristics of the waves and show that retinal ganglion cells participate in these patterns of activity, which are seen during the same period as synaptic modification in the lateral geniculate nucleus; that the waves subside gradually as the connectivity in the lateral geniculate nucleus stabilizes; and that their spatial structure allows for refinement of the retinotopic map, as well as for eye-specific segregation in the lateral geniculate nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2008818819,"Hydrogen-deuterium exchange measurements are becoming increasingly important in studies of the dynamics of protein molecules and, particularly, of their folding behavior. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has been used to obtain the distribution of masses within a population of protein molecules that had undergone hydrogen exchange in solution. This information is complementary to that from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) experiments, which measure the average occupancy of individual sites over the distribution of protein molecules. In experiments with hen lysozyme, a combination of ESI-MS and NMR was used to distinguish between alternative mechanisms of hydrogen exchange, providing insight into the nature and populations of transient folding intermediates. These results have helped to detail the pathways available to a protein during refolding."
https://openalex.org/W2010462935,"The role of costimulatory signals in T cell induction was evaluated in mice lacking the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene. In vitro secondary antiviral T cell responses were absent unless IL-2 was added, confirming the crucial role of IL-2 in vitro. In vivo, primary and secondary cytotoxic T cell responses against vaccinia and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus were within normal ranges. B cell reactivity to vesicular stomatitis virus was not impaired. T helper cell responses were delayed but biologically functional. Natural killer cell activity was markedly reduced but inducible. These normal in vivo immune responses in IL-2-deficient mice question the importance of IL-2 as defined by in vitro studies."
https://openalex.org/W2169150729,"There are striking parallels between the regulation of gene expression along the dorsoventral (DV) axis of Drosophila embryos and lymphoid-restricted expression in the mammalian immune system. Both depend on regulatory factors containing rel domains (dorsal and NF-kappa B) that are controlled at the level of nuclear transport. A novel Rel-containing gene in Drosophila, Dif (dorsal-related immunity factor), provides a potential link between these seemingly disparate processes. Although Dif maps close to dorsal, it does not appear to participate in DV patterning, but instead mediates an immune response in Drosophila larvae. Dif is normally localized in the cytoplasm of the larval fat body, but quickly accumulates in the nucleus upon bacterial infection or injury. Evidence is presented that once in the nucleus, Dif binds to kappa B-like sequence motifs present in promoter regions of immunity genes. These results suggest that mammalian and insect immunity share a common evolutionary origin."
https://openalex.org/W2787012987,"We have isolated a rat cDNA clone that displays 75% amino acid homology with the mouse δ and rat κ opioid receptors. The cDNA (designated pRMuR-12) encodes a protein of 398 amino acids comprising, in part, seven hydrophobic domains similar to those described for other G protein-linked receptors. Data from binding assays conducted with COS-1 cells transiently transfected with a CMV mammalian expression vector containing the full coding region of pRMuR-12 demonstrated μ receptor selectivity. In situ hybridization mRNA analysis revealed an mRNA distribution in rat brain that corresponds well to the distribution of binding sites labeled with μ-selective ligands. Based upon these observations, we conclude that pRMuR-12 encodes a μ opioid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2002485919,"Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a transcription factor that regulates expression of the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) in activated T cells. The DNA-binding specificity of NFAT is conferred by NFATp, a phosphoprotein that is a target for the immunosuppressive compounds cyclosporin A and FK506. Here, the purification of NFATp from murine T cells and the isolation of a complementary DNA clone encoding NFATp are reported. A truncated form of NFATp, expressed as a recombinant protein in bacteria, binds specifically to the NFAT site of the murine IL-2 promoter and forms a transcriptionally active complex with recombinant protein fragment react with T cell NFATp. The molecular cloning of NFATp should allow detailed analysis of a T cell transcription factor that is central to initiation of the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2027575989,"The adult appendages of Drosophila develop from imaginal discs. An early step in disc patterning involves the formation of developmental boundaries that subdivide the discs into compartments. Anterior and posterior compartments are established in the embryo. Later in development a new boundary originates to subdivide the wing disc into dorsal and ventral compartments, which correspond to the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the adult wing. We report here that spatially localized expression of the homeobox gene apterous (ap) specifies the identity of dorsal cells in the wing. The boundary of cell lineage restriction between dorsal and ventral compartments coincides with the limit of the domain of ap expression. Using genetic mosaics, we show that juxtaposition of dorsal and ventral cells induces formation of the wing margin. We present evidence that the dorsal-ventral boundary promotes growth and serves as a pattern-organizing center in the wing disc."
https://openalex.org/W2001467625,"The shc oncogene product is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases and after its phosphorylation interacts with the adapter protein Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2). In turn, Grb2 interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, mSOS. Because several Src family kinases participate in T cell activation and Shc functions upstream of Ras, the role of Shc in T cell signaling was examined. Shc was phosphorylated on tyrosine after activation through the T cell receptor (TCR), and subsequently interacted with Grb2 and mSOS. The Src homology region 2 (SH2) domain of Shc directly interacted with the tyrosine-phosphorylated zeta chain of the TCR. Thus, Shc may couple TCR activation to the Ras signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2020644185,"A β-glucoside encoded by a cloned Zea mays complementary DNA (Zm-p60.1) cleaved the biologically inactive hormone conjugates cytokinin-O-glucosides and kinetin-N3-glucoside, releasing active cytokinin. Tobacco protoplasts that transiently expressed Zm-p60.1 could use the inactive cytokinin glucosides to initiate cell division. The ability of protoplasts to sustain growth in response to cytokinin glucosides persisted indefinitely after the likely disappearance of the expression vector. In the roots of maize seedlings, Zm-p60.1 was localized to the meristematic cells and may function in vivo to supply the developing maize embryo with active cytokinin."
https://openalex.org/W2163987346,"Huntington's Disease (HD) is notable for selective neuronal vulnerability in the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. We have investigated in human and rodent tissues the expression of the gene (IT15) whose mutation causes HD. IT15 is widely expressed, with highest levels of expression in brain, but also in lung, testis, ovary, and other tissues. Within the brain, expression is widespread with a neuronal pattern and is not enriched in the basal ganglia. Expression of IT15 is not reduced in the brain of HD patients when corrected for actin (though it is slightly decreased in the striatum when uncorrected, consistent with neuronal loss). Thus, the widespread distribution of IT15 expression does not correspond with the restricted distribution of neuropathologic changes in HD. We suggest that pathophysiology may relate to abnormal cell type-specific protein interactions of the HD protein."
https://openalex.org/W2051024700,"Intense stimuli, such as trains of depolarizing pulses or the caffeine-induced release of calcium from intracellular stores, readily depress the secretory response in neuroendocrine cells. Secretory responses are restored by rest periods of minutes in duration. This recovery was accelerated when the concentration of cytosolic calcium was moderately increased and probably resulted from calcium-dependent replenishment of a pool of release-ready granules. Continuously increased concentrations of calcium led the over-filling of such a pool. Subsequently, secretory responses to stronger calcium stimuli were augmented. Hormone-induced calcium transients with a plateau phase of increased concentration of calcium may enhance the secretory response in this way."
https://openalex.org/W2019277702,"Pre-steady state kinetics of misincorporation were used to investigate the addition of single nucleotides to nascent RNA by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase during transcription elongation. The results were fit with a branched kinetic mechanism that permits conformational switching, at each template position, between an activated and an unactivated enzyme complex, both of which can bind nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) from solution. The complex exists most often in the long-lived activated state, and only becomes unactivated when transcription is slowed. This model permits multiple levels of nucleotide discrimination in transcription, since the complex can be ""kinetically trapped"" in the unactivated state in the absence of the correct NTP or if the 3' terminal residue is incorrectly matched. The transcription cleavage factor GreA (or an activity enhanced by GreA) increased the fidelity of transcription by preferential cleavage of transcripts containing misincorporated residues in the unactivated state of the elongation complex. This cleavage mechanism by GreA may prevent the formation of ""dead-end"" transcription complexes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1976578327,"A system for stable transformation of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites was developed that exploited the susceptibility of Toxoplasma to chloramphenicol. Introduction of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene fused to Toxoplasma flanking sequences followed by chloramphenicol selection resulted in parasites stably expressing CAT. A construct incorporating the tandemly repeated gene, B1, targeted efficiently to its homologous chromosomal locus. Knockout of the single-copy gene, ROP1, was also successful. Stable transformation should permit the identification and analysis of Toxoplasma genes important in the interaction of this opportunistic parasite with its host."
https://openalex.org/W2081128958,"The natural arrest of vertebrate unfertilized eggs in second meiotic metaphase results from the activity of cytostatic factor (CSF). The product of the c-mosxe proto-oncogene is thought to be a component of CSF and can induce metaphase arrest when injected into blastomeres of two-cell embryos. The c-Mosxe protein can directly activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP kinase kinase) in vitro, leading to activation of MAP kinase. MAP kinase and c-Mosxe are active in unfertilized eggs and are rapidly inactivated after fertilization. Microinjection of thiophosphorylated MAP kinase into one blastomere of a two-cell embryo induced metaphase arrest similar to that induced by c-Mosxe. However, only arrest with c-Mosxe was associated with activation of endogenous MAP kinase. These results indicate that active MAP kinase is a component of CSF in Xenopus and suggest that the CSF activity of c-Mosxe is mediated by MAP kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2092099867,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and activin signal primarily through interaction with type I and type II receptors, which are transmembrane serine-threonine kinases. Tsk 7L is a type I receptor for TGF-beta and requires coexpression of the type II TGF-beta receptor for ligand binding. Tsk 7L also specifically bound activin, when coexpressed with the type IIA activin receptor. Tsk 7L could associate with either type II receptor and the ligand binding specificity of Tsk 7L was conferred by the type II receptor. Tsk 7L can therefore act as type I receptor for both activin and TGF-beta, and possibly other ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2026708081,"Paired tight-seal whole-cell recordings were obtained from neighboring Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices. Under voltage clamp, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents resulted from the activity of GABAergic interneurons, stellate and basket cells. Up to 8o% of inhibitory postsynaptic currents in paired recordings were in register. This correlation was not affected by antagonists of glutamate receptors, faded with distance, and was abolished by tetrodotoxin. Earlier work showed that voltage-gated Ca2+ entry into a Purkinje cell elicits a transient presynaptic inhibition of inhibitory postsynaptic currents. It is now shown that this inhibition is not restricted to the stimulated cell, but that it is transmitted to its neighbors. The results indicate that Purkinje cells exchange information by an unconventional mechanism involving retrograde control of inhibitory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2019628762,"N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-evoked currents were recorded from acutely isolated rat hippocampal neurons, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and a rapid perfusion system. Histamine, at concentrations from 0.5 to 100 microM, reversibly enhanced NMDA currents by up to 50%. The effect cannot be ascribed to activation of the known histamine receptors (H1, H2, H3) but is occluded by spermine. These results suggest an interaction of histamine with the polyamine-binding site on the NMDA receptor complex. This modulatory action could allow the histaminergic system to determine time and loci of NMDA receptor-mediated events, such as memory formation according to behavioral state."
https://openalex.org/W2049709989,"Amide (NH) proton exchange rates were measured in 0.0 to 0.7 M guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) for 23 slowly exchanging peptide NH protons of ribonuclease A (RNase A) at pH* 5.5 (uncorrected pH measured in D2O), 34 degrees C. The purpose was to find out whether GdmCl induces exchange through binding to exchange intermediates that are partly or wholly unfolded. It was predicted that, when the logarithm of the exchange rate is plotted as a function of the molarity of GdmCl, the slope should be a measure of the amount of buried surface area exposed to GdmCl in the exchange intermediate. The results indicate that these concentrations of GdmCl do induce exchange by means of a partial unfolding mechanism for all 23 protons; this implies that exchange reactions can be used to study the unfolding and stability of local regions. Of the 23 protons, nine also show a second mechanism of exchange at lower concentrations of GdmCl, a mechanism that is nearly independent of GdmCl concentration and is termed ""limited structural fluctuation."""
https://openalex.org/W2080802821,"Rice prolamines are sequestered within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen even though they lack a lumenal retention signal. Immunochemical and biochemical data show that BiP, a protein that binds lumenal polypeptides, is localized on the surface of the aggregated prolamine protein bodies (PBs). BiP also forms complexes with nascent chains of prolamines in polyribosomes and with free prolamines with distinct adenosine triphosphate sensitivities. Thus, BiP retains prolamines in the lumen by facilitating their folding and assembly into PBs."
https://openalex.org/W2056963317,"Calmodulin is a highly conserved regulatory protein found in all eukaryotic organisms which mediates a variety of calcium ion-dependent signalling pathways. In the Drosophila retina, calmodulin was concentrated in the photoreceptor cell microvillar structure, the rhabdomere, and was found in lower amounts in the sub-rhabdomeral cytoplasm. This calmodulin localization was dependent on the NINAC (neither inactivation nor afterpotential C) unconventional myosins. Mutant flies lacking the rhabdomere-specific p174 NINAC protein did not concentrate calmodulin in the rhabdomere, whereas flies lacking the sub-rhabdomeral p132 isoform had no detectable cytoplasmic calmodulin. Furthermore, a defect in vision resulted when calmodulin was not concentrated in the rhabdomeres, suggesting a role for calmodulin in the regulation of fly phototransduction. A general function of unconventional myosins may be to control the subcellular distribution of calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W2020484913,"Hydrolysis of GTP by the photoreceptor G protein transducin (Gtα) was found to occur with kinetics identical to the inactivation of its effector cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), but was too slow (tens of seconds) in dilute rod outer segment (ROS) suspensions to account for subsecond recovery of the light response. Raising the concentration of ROS membranes increased the rates of GTP hydrolysis and PDE inactivation in parallel as much as 6-fold. Holo-PDE and its γ subunit had weak effects on GTPase kinetics (<1.6-fold and <1.3-fold, respectively). ROS membranes stripped of PDE retained ∼90% of a GTPase accelerating activity that was protease sensitive, indicating that they contain a GTPase-accelerating factor distinct from PDE."
https://openalex.org/W2057932143,"During development of the vertebrate visual system, an orderly projection of ganglion cells from the retina onto the superior colliculus (SC) is established. Mechanisms that might govern this process include the coordinated action of guidance and corresponding receptor molecules that are specifically distributed on the axons and their targets. In birds and mammals, information for axonal guidance and targeting appears to be confined to the time when the retinocollicular projection is being formed. Here we show that putative guidance activities for temporal and nasal retinal axons, which are not detectable in the normal adult SC, appear after optic nerve transection in adult rats. Both embryonic and adult retinal axons are able to respond to these guiding cues, although the guidance activities detectable in the deafferented adult rat SC might be different from those found during development. These findings imply that it might be possible to reestablish an ordered projection after lesions in the adult mammalian visual system."
https://openalex.org/W2066769245,"We have studied the spatial deployment of synapses arising from different axons that converge on the same developing neuromuscular junctions. Labeling the competing synaptic ""cartels"" with different dyes in mouse muscle showed that, perinatally, each axon adds similar terminal areas, whereas later, areas occupied by the competing cartels diverged by gradual elimination of one axon's synapses and ongoing addition of synaptic area by the other. Activity-dependent labeling of synapses capable of vesicle recycling in snake muscle also revealed a gradual change in territories occupied by competing inputs, implying that an axon maintained some functional synapses even as others in its cartel were being eliminated. Thus the process of synapse elimination is gradual, with loss of one viable synapse after another, until an axon is left with no synaptic territory and withdraws."
https://openalex.org/W2006098333,"A mutant mouse strain has been generated in which a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy (H) chain variable (V) region gene is placed into the heavy chain locus in its natural position, replacing the JH elements. In homozygous mutant mice, essentially all B cells in the spleen express the transgenic VH region in their antibodies. The proper location of the transgene relative to the constant region genes allows it to participate in isotype switching and undergo somatic hypermutation. Immunoglobulin transgenic mice generated in this fashion by gene targeting should prove useful for the exploration of immunoregulatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1969279272,"Calculations for a simple model electron transfer system and tuna cytochrome c demonstrate a dichotomy in the distance dependence of the effective coupling. In one regime, the effective coupling varies exponentially with distance and depends primarily on the average properties of the bridging material; in the other regime, the effective coupling has a complex distance dependence and is more sensitive to the details of the bridging material. Experiments and theory indicate that both regimes may occur in biological systems, providing a perspective on a recent controversy over the nature of the distance dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2092961177,"Recent reports have shown that the nuclear phosphoprotein Fos is induced by light in a mammalian circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. To learn how light and circadian phase affect the binding of Fos to DNA, we analyzed the photic and temporal regulation of immunoreactive Jun protein expression and AP-1 DNA-binding activity in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus. Immunohistochemistry and gel mobility shift assays suggest that AP-1 activity during the night and after a light pulse consists of constant, as well as variable, protein components; JunD could be identified as a constituent of both dark- and light-activated binding complexes, whereas binding by JunB and Fos could be implicated only after photic stimulation. Since JunD or JunB could be colocalized with Fos in individual suprachiasmatic nucleus cell nuclei, light may be acting in at least some suprachiasmatic nucleus cells by altering AP-1 protein composition rather than binding site occupancy."
https://openalex.org/W1994189194,"Structures of the protein-chromophore complex and the apoprotein form of neocarzinostatin were determined at 1.8 angstrom resolution. Neocarzinostatin is composed of a labile chromophore with DNA-cleaving activity and a stabilizing protein. The chromophore displays marked nonlinearity of the triple bonds and is bound noncovalently in a pocket formed by the two protein domains. The chromophore pi-face interacts with the phenyl ring edges of Phe52 and Phe78. The amino sugar and carbonate groups of the chromophore are solvent exposed, whereas the epoxide, acetylene groups, and carbon C-12, the site of nucleophilic thiol addition during chromophore activation, are unexposed. The position of the amino group of the chromophore carbohydrate relative to C-12 supports the idea that the amino group plays a role in thiol activation."
https://openalex.org/W2030199372,"Replication of the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pT181, which occurs by the rolling circle mechanism, is accompanied by the covalent attachment of a ≈ 12-residue oligodeoxy-nucleotide to one subunit of the dimeric plasmid-coded initiator protein, RepC. This oligonucleotide represents the plasmid sequence immediately 3′ to the initiating nick site. The resulting heterodimeric protein lacks the topoisomerase and replication activities of unmodified RepC, suggesting that the regulation of plasmid DNA replication requires post-replicational inactivation of the initiator protein as well as control of its synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2152715004,"Transcripts homologous to the rat brain sodium channel β subunit (β1) are prominently expressed in both innervated and denervated adult skeletal muscle and in heart, but not in neonatal skeletal or cardiac muscle. Regulation of β1 mRNA expression closely parallels that of SkM1 α during development, after denervation in adult muscle, and in primary muscle culture, but does not follow SkM2 expression under any condition examined. In oocytes, β1 interacts functionally with SkM1 to modulate the abnormally slow inactivation kinetics observed with this α subunit expressed alone. We conclude that a common β1, subunit is expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain and that in skeletal muscle, this subunit is specifically associated with the SkM1, rather than the SkM2, sodium channel isoform."
https://openalex.org/W1971445812,"We have investigated the role of Ca2+ in the excitation of Limulus photoreceptors by intracellular injection of the Ca2+ buffer, 5,5'-dibromo-BAPTA. Buffer with free Ca2+ of 0.5 or 5 microM slowed the rising edge of the light response over 100-fold and greatly reduced both the transient and plateau phases of the light response, as expected if Ca2+ elevation is necessary for all phases of excitation. Injection of buffers with free Ca2+ of 5 or 45 microM, levels normally reached during light, evoked sustained inward current as expected if Ca2+ is sufficient for excitation. The transduction cascade appears due to a single pathway that sequentially involves 1,4,5-trisphosphate inositol, Ca2+, and cyclic GMP."
https://openalex.org/W2029010064,"The short cytoplasmic peptide segment connecting domains III and IV of voltage-gated sodium channels (III–IV linker) is essential for fast inactivation. To test the functional similarity between the III–IV linker and the potassium channel inactivation particle, we attached the III–IV linker to the amino terminus of a noninactivating potassium channel. This chimeric channel inactivated rapidly and displayed biophysical properties similar to Shaker A-type potassium channels. Recovery from inactivation in the chimeric channels was accelerated by high external potassium, consistent with the idea that potassium ions passing through the channel displaced the III–IV linker inactivation particle. A mutation that completely abolishes fast inactivation in rat brain sodium channels also completely abolished inactivation in the chimera. These results demonstrate that the sodium channel III–IV linker can function as a fast inactivation gate and suggest a functional relationship between the fast inactivation processes of sodium and potassium channels."
https://openalex.org/W2067968784,"The product of the Wnt-1 proto-oncogene is a secreted glycoprotein that is normally produced in regions of the embryonic neural tube. We show here that expression of mouse Wnt-1 cDNA in the rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line causes a dramatic conversion from a round to a flat cell morphology. In addition, PC12 cells expressing Wnt-1 (PC12/Wnt-1) fail to extend neurites after treatment with NGF, despite the presence and activation of high affinity NGF receptors encoded by the trk gene and the induction of early response genes. Furthermore, PC12/Wnt-1 cells fail to express several neuron- and chromaffin-specific genes, indicating that PC12/Wnt-1 cells have assumed a new phenotype. Although NGF and FGF utilize similar signal transduction pathways in PC12 cells, only FGF is capable of inducing a morphological response and synthesis of transin mRNA in PC12/Wnt-1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2035195443,"The mitochondrial cofactor dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) was observed to potentiate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), but not non-NMDA, receptor-mediated whole-cell responses in cultured neurons. This potentiation was readily reversed by the oxidizing agent 5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitro-benzoic acid) (DTNB). DHLA was unable to increase NMDA responses previously potentiated by dithiothreitol, nor did it have an effect on NMDA receptors alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide. Single-channel recordings revealed that DHLA produced an increase in NMDA channel open frequency, with no change in single-channel conductance or open time. In contrast, lipoic acid reversed the potentiation of NMDA-evoked responses produced by dithiothreitol and had no effect on NMDA receptors previously oxidized by DTNB. DHLA and lipoic acid are pervasively found substances that readily permeate cellular membranes and thus may influence NMDA receptor activity in vivo by modifying its redox site."

A mouse strain was generated by gene targeting to replace the mouse kappa light chain constant (C) region gene with the human C kappa gene. Mice homozygous for the replacement mutation (C kappa R) produced normal concentrations of serum antibodies, most of which carry chimeric kappa light chains, and mounted normal immune responses to hapten-protein conjugates. This technology provides a feasible option for the generation of high-affinity humanized antibodies by means of the powerful somatic hypermutation-selection mechanism."

The flagellum is connected by a flexible link (hook) to the motor axis, which passes through the center of a structure called the basal disk. The basal disk functions with the L-P ring complex as a bushing, enabling the rotation of the motor in the cell wall. The protein subunits of the basal disk of Wolinella succinogenes form an Archimedian spiral. The polymerization of subunits from a nucleation point at the motor in the form of a spiral allows constant growth of the basal disk. The disk is thought to provide a reinforcement at the flagellar insertion at the cell pole and to disperse forces that are generated by the momentum of the flagellar rotation."
