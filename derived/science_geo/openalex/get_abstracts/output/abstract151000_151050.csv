https://openalex.org/W1984571968,"A missense mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of the Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) has been identified as the defect responsible for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) hyporesponsiveness in C3H/HeJ mice. TLR-4 and TLR-2 have recently been implicated in LPS signaling in studies where these receptors were overexpressed in LPS non-responsive 293 human embryonic kidney cells. However, the signaling role of TLR-4 or TLR-2 in human cells with natural LPS response remains largely undefined. Here we show that human dermal microvessel endothelial cells (HMEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells express predominantly TLR-4 but very weak TLR-2 and respond vigorously to LPS but not toMycobacterium tuberculosis 19-kDa lipoprotein. Transient transfection of non-signaling mutant forms of TLR-4 and anti-TLR-4 monoclonal antibody inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation in HMEC, while a monoclonal antibody against TLR-2 was ineffective. In contrast to LPS responsiveness, the ability of HMEC to respond to 19-kDa lipoprotein correlated with the expression of TLR-2. Transfection of TLR-2 into HMEC conferred responsiveness to 19-kDa lipoprotein. These data indicate that TLR-4 is the LPS signaling receptor in HMEC and that human endothelial cells (EC) express predominantly TLR-4 and weak TLR-2, which may explain why they do not respond to 19-kDa lipoprotein. The differential expression of TLRs on human EC may have important implications in the participation of vascular EC in innate immune defense mechanisms against various infectious pathogens, which may use different TLRs to signal.

LPS is a potent activator of cells of the immune and inflammatory systems, including macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells, and contributes to the systemic changes seen in septic shock (1.Wenzel R.P.

Crit. Care Med. 1999; 27: 1608-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The basic paradigm of septic shock is that microbial antigens such as Gram-negative bacterial LPS, Gram-positive bacterial cell wall components, such as soluble peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and bacterial lipoproteins, initiate an uncontrolled network of host-derived proinflammatory mediators, which ultimately lead to cardiovascular shock and death (1.Wenzel R.P.

Vertebrates and invertebrates initiate a series of defense mechanisms following infection by various microorganisms by sensing the presence of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as bacterial LPS (5.Janeway Jr., C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Host organisms have developed a set of receptors that can specifically recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and are referred to as pattern recognition receptors (6.Medzhitov R.M.

A family of such pattern recognition receptors involved in innate immune recognition and cellular activation in response to bacterial LPS, lipoproteins, PGN, and LTA has recently been discovered to be human toll-like receptors (TLRs) (8.Yang R.-B.

Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6451) Google Scholar). TLR family members are transmembrane proteins containing repeated leucine-rich motifs in their extracellular portions, similar to other pattern recognition proteins of the innate immune system (18.Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 19.Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). TLRs also contain a cytoplasmic domain which is homologous to the signaling domain of the IL-1 receptor, and activation of TLRs result in activation of NF-κB and induction of cytokines and costimulatory molecules required for the activation of the adaptive immune response (18.Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 19.Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A.

The toll gene controls dorsoventral pattern formation during the early embryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster (21.Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) and initiates a signaling pathway homologous to mammalian NF-κB activation cascade (19.Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A.

Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). At least eight mammalian Toll-like receptor family members (TLR-1–8) have been identified to date, but the function of each individual family member is uncertain. The C3H/HeJ and C57BL10/ScCr mouse strains are hyporesponsive to LPS, while they respond normally to Gram-positive challenge. As a consequence they have dramatically enhanced susceptibility to Gram-negative pathogens (22.Rosenstreich D.L. Berry L.J. Handbook of Endotoxin. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers, New York1985: 82-122Google Scholar). Study of these mice over the past 20 years has shown that hyporesponsiveness to LPS maps to a single autosomal locus (lps) (22.Rosenstreich D.L. Berry L.J. Handbook of Endotoxin. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers, New York1985: 82-122Google Scholar). Recently, this defect in the LPS response was found to be due to a missense mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of TLR-4 in C3H/HeJ (17.Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6451) Google Scholar, 23.Qureshi S.-T.

Lariviere L. Qureshi S.T. Malo D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5666-5670PubMed Google Scholar) and due to an independent mutation at the lps locus in the C57BL10/ScCr strain resulting in the absence of TLR-4 message (17.Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6451) Google Scholar). These genetic studies strongly suggest that TLR-4 is the signal transducing component in the LPS receptor complex (15.Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 17.Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also showed that mice in which the TLR-4 gene has been deleted have the same defects as mice with mutations in lps. Transient transfection experiments using LPS non-responsive human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) revealed that both TLR-2 (8.Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 9.Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres T.M. Rothe M. J. Exp.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar) overexpression can enable these cells to respond to LPS, suggesting that perhaps TLR-2 can also be considered a lipopolysaccharide receptor. However, more recent reports have shown that mice lacking TLR-2 can still respond to LPS in the same way as wild type animals (26.Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). Several studies have identified TLR-2 as the receptor mediating the cellular responses to Gram-positive bacteria (27.Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Hajjar A.M. Stevens A. Wilson C.B. Bassetti M. Aderman A. Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar), PGN, LTA (10.Schwandner, R., Dziarski, R., Wesche, R. H., Rothe, M. & Kirschning, C. J. J. Biol.

Weis J.H. Wooten R.M. Wies J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2382-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and fungi (27.Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Hajjar A.M. Stevens A. Wilson C.B. Bassetti M. Aderman A. Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). However, the specific role of these TLRs in LPS-responsive human cells is yet undefined. Monocytes and macrophages, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells (EC) play a pivotal role in the development of innate immune responses against invading microorganisms. We therefore investigated the mechanisms involved in bacterial LPS and lipoprotein-induced activation of vascular EC. We have previously shown that the LPS-induced signal transduction pathway to activate NF-κB shares the IL-1 receptor signaling molecules, including MyD88, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), IRAK-2, and TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (28.Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J Mancinelli R. Xu X.-P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that a crucial signaling component in the LPS receptor complex in human dermal microvessel endothelial cells (HMEC) may belong to the IL-1 receptor/TLR superfamily (28.Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J Mancinelli R. Xu X.-P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated the expression pattern of TLRs in HMEC, HUVEC, monocytes, and THP-1 cells. To investigate the role of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in LPS-induced NF-κB activation in HMEC, we studied the effects of function-blocking mAbs and of transient transfection of C3H/HeJ TLR-4 or an intracellular deletion mutant of TLR-4 together with a NF-κB-responsive reporter gene. Our results indicate that HMEC express TLR-1, TLR-3, TLR-4, and TLR-5 and respond to LPS by TLR-4- and soluble CD14-dependent manner. We observed very weak TLR-2 in HMEC and HUVEC, which explains their lack of response to mycobacterial 19-kDa lipoprotein. Transfection of TLR-2 confers the responsiveness of HMEC to 19-kDa lipoprotein. Human THP-1 cells (from ATCC) were cultured in RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The immortalized HMEC (29.Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (generous gift of Dr. Candal, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) were cultured in MCDB-131 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin in 24-well plates, and used between passages 10 and 14. Tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human mononuclear cell fraction was obtained by Ficoll density-gradient sedimentation at the interface. Monocytes (>95% pure) were isolated using a one-step discontinuous Percoll gradient (46%) of the mononuclear fraction. Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were isolated and cultured as described previously (30.Sironi M. Breviario F. Prosperio P. Biondi A. Vecchi A. Van Damme J. Dejana E. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 549PubMed Google Scholar). The neutralizing anti-human TLR-2 mAb 2392 was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA) and was generated by immunization of BALB/c mice with purified soluble extracellular domain of human TLR-2 (8.Yang R.-B.

Several approaches were taken to demonstrate specificity of the antibody to TLR-2 (8.Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J.

The neutralizing anti-human TLR-4 mAb was a generous gift of Kensuke Miyake (Saga Medical School, Nabeshima, Saga, Japan) (31.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis 19-kDa lipoprotein was obtained from Patrick Brennan and John Belisle (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO; under NIH Contract NO1-AI-75320). Protein freeEscherichia coli K235 LPS was obtained from Stefanie N. Vogel (Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD). Purified RsDPLA was obtained from Nilofer Qureshi (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), and human recombinant soluble CD14 from Sanna Goyert (North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY). ELAM-NF-κB luciferase and pCMV-β-galactosidase vectors were used as described previously (28.Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J Mancinelli R. Xu X.-P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN TLR-4 cDNAs were obtained from Bruce Beutler (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA). A flag-tagged mutant human TLR-4 construct with a deletion in the intracellular domain (TLR-4 Dicd), lacking the 155 COOH-terminal amino acids of the wild type TLR-4 was obtained from Tularik (San Francisco, CA). Wild type human TLR-2 construct was a gift from Ruslan Medzhitov (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The plasmids were prepared with an endotoxin-free Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). HMEC were plated at a concentration of 50,000 cells/well in 24-well plates. Cells were co-transfected the following day with FuGene 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following manufacturer's instructions. Reporter genes pCMV-β-galactosidase (0.05 μg) and ELAM-NF-κB-luciferase (0.5 μg), and pCMV empty vector (0.5 μg) or C3H/HeJ TLR-4 (0.5 μg), an intracellular deletion mutant of TLR-4 (TLR-4 Dicd) (0.5 μg) or C3H/HeN TLR-4 (0.5 μg) were co-transfected. After overnight transfection, cells were stimulated for 6 h with 50–100 ng/ml LPS or 10 ng/ml human TNF-α (R & D Systems). Cells were then lysed in 60 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activity was measured with a Promega kit and a luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by calorimetric method to normalize transfection efficiency as described previously (28.Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J Mancinelli R. Xu X.-P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Data shown are mean ± S.D. of three or more independent experiments and are reported as a percentage of LPS-stimulated NF-κB promoter activity, or relative luciferase activity. Total RNA was isolated from HMEC, HUVEC, and THP-1 cells using a Qiagen kit (Valencia, CA) following manufacturer's instruction and treated with RNase-free DNase I. For RT reaction, the MMLV preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was applied. PCR amplification was performed with Taq gold polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA) for 32 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (for TLR-2 and TLR-4), and 35 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (for TLR-1, TLR-3, and TLR-5). The oligonucleotide primers used for RT-PCR were: TLR-1, 5′-CTATACACCAAGTTGTCAGC and 5′GTCTCCAACTCAGTAAGGTG; TLR-2, 5′-GCCAAAGTCTTGATTGATTGG and 5′-TTGAAGTTCTCCAGCTCCTG; for TLR-3, 5′-GATCTGTCTCATAATGGCTTG and 5′-GACAGATTCCGAATGCTTGTG; for TLR-4, 5′-TGGATACGTTTCCTTATAAG and 5′-GAAATGGAGGCACCCCTTC; and for TLR-5, 5′-CTAGCTCCTAATCCTGATG and 5′-CCATGTGAAGTCTTTGCTGC. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA was isolated by the guanidine isothiocyanate method with minor modifications. Total RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis through 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels, followed by Northern blot transfer to Gene Screen Plus membranes (NEN Life Science Products). The plasmids containing human TLR-2, TLR-4, or actin cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckingamshire, United Kingdom). Membranes were pre-treated and hybridized in 50% formamide (Merck, Rahway, NJ) with 10% dextran sulfate (Sigma) and washed twice with 2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 60 °C for 30 min, and finally washed twice with 0.1× SSC at room temperature for 30 min. Membranes were exposed for 4–48 h at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Surface expression of TLR-2 in HMEC and THP-1 cells was determined using mouse mAb to TLR-2 (2392). The mouse monoclonal TLR-2 antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum (CalTag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Samples were acquired on Becton-Dickinson FACScan (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA). HMEC were cultured on eight chamber microscope slides. Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde solution (4%), incubated with mouse anti-TLR-2 mAb in PBS buffer, or rabbit polyclonal anti-TLR-2 antiserum, and incubated for 1 h. Primary antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum or, in the case of rabbit polyclonal antisera, goat anti-rabbit antiserum (CalTag). Samples were viewed and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. To investigate the involvement of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in LPS-responsive human vascular EC, we first analyzed the expression pattern of TLRs in HMEC, HUVEC, monocytes, or THP-1 cells by RT-PCR (TLR-1–5) and by Northern blot, immunofluorescent staining, and FACS analysis (TLR-2 and TLR-4). HMEC expressed TLR-1, TLR-3, TLR-4, and TLR-5, but only a weak TLR-2 transcript by RT-PCR (Fig.1 A). THP-1 cells expressed all five TLRs, including TLR-2 (Fig. 1 A). The weak expression of TLR-2 by RT-PCR in HMEC is consistent with our previous observation (28.Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J Mancinelli R. Xu X.-P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and was also observed in primary HUVEC (Fig. 1 A). Northern blot analysis detected only the 3.4-kilobase pair band consistent with the TLR-4 expression in HMEC and HUVEC, and no TLR-2 message was observed in these two types of EC, while both TLR-2 and TLR-4 mRNA were detected in monocytes (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analysis of HMEC with anti-TLR-2 mAb 2392 showed no TLR-2 expression in HMEC, while THP-1 cells showed positive staining (Fig. 1, Cand D). We have previously observed that both TLR-4 and TLR-2 were expressed in HMEC by immunostaining using a non-affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum against TLR-2 and TLR-4 (28.Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J Mancinelli R. Xu X.-P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). However, the availability of a mAb against TLR-2 now allows us to show that there is no TLR-2 expression in HMEC and that the polyclonal anti-TLR-2 antiserum most likely cross-reacts, possibly with another TLR expressed in HMEC (data not shown). In C3H/HeJ mice, the missense mutation in the intracytoplasmic domain of TLR-4 acts as a dominant negative molecule, possibly by sequestering the downstream adapter and signaling molecules (e.g. MyD88 and IRAK1), and prevents LPS-induced signaling and NF-κB activation (17.Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 5666-5670PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the functional role of TLR-4 in LPS-induced NF-κB activation in HMEC, we transiently transfected these cells with C3H/HeJ TLR-4 cDNA and tested their responses to LPS by monitoring expression of a reporter gene driven by NF-κB-responsive enhancer of the ELAM gene. We found that the ELAM reporter construct was induced in HMEC by low concentrations of LPS, that this response was not further modulated by expression of full-length (wild type) TLR-4 in these cells (data not shown). Co-expression of the C3H/HeJ TLR-4 construct blocked LPS induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A), while it was unable to block TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the overexpression of the C3H/HeJ TLR-4 specifically blocks LPS signaling. Overexpression of the wild type TLR-4 cDNA from C3H/HeN substrain did not have any effect on LPS-induced EC activation (Fig. 2 A). Overexpression of an intracellular deletion mutant of TLR-4 (TLR-4 Dicd) with carboxyl-terminal truncation also led to significant and dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-mediated NF-κB activation in HMEC (Fig. 2 C), while NF-κB activation in responses to other stimuli, including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, was unaffected (data not shown). The region of the intracellular domain deleted in TLR-4 Dicd is homologous to a region of the IL-1R intracellular domain that is required for association with IRAK in response to LPS (32.Croston G.E. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16514-16517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These results suggest that TLR-4 Dicd acts as a dominant-negative construct to inhibit the “endogenous” response of HMEC to LPS. Taken together, these results indicate that overexpression of these non-signaling constructs specifically inhibits LPS-mediated NF-κB activation in human vascular endothelial cells. To further confirm the functional role of TLR-4 in LPS-induced NF-κB activation in endothelial cells, we pre-incubated HMEC with function-blocking mAbs against human TLR-2 (2392) or TLR-4 and measured LPS-mediated cellular activation. The anti-TLR-4 mAb significantly blocked LPS-induced NF-κB activation, while an isotype-matched control Ab and the anti-TLR-2 mAb were ineffective (Fig.3). Taken together, our findings reveal that LPS signaling in HMEC is mediated specifically via TLR-4 and not TLR-2. Our data do not preclude a contributory role for other TLR family members but concur with genetic evidence in mice and hamsters, in which a mutation in TLR-4 abrogates LPS signaling whereas a mutation in TLR-2 does not (17.Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Our findings support the hypothesis that TLR-4 is essential in LPS signaling in vivo. Bacterial lipoprotein is one of the most abundant proteins in the outer membrane of enteric Gram-negative bacteria (34.DiRienzo J.M. Nakamura K. Inouye M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 481-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and acts synergistically with LPS to induce proinflammatory cytokine production and lethal shock (35.Zhang H. Peterson J.W. Niesel D.W. Klimpel G.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4868-4878PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that LPS and lipoproteins activate cells via different mechanisms. Recent studies indicate that TLR-2, but not TLR-4, is the required receptor for the cellular responses to microbial lipoproteins (10.Schwandner, R., Dziarski, R., Wesche, R. H., Rothe, M. & Kirschning, C. J. J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17406–17409Google Scholar, 13.Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.-B. Belisle J.T. Bleharski J.R. Maitland M. Norgard M.V.

Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar) and cell wall components such as PGN and LTA (10.Schwandner, R., Dziarski, R., Wesche, R. H., Rothe, M. & Kirschning, C. J. J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17406–17409Google Scholar, 12.Heine H. Kirschning C.J. Lien E. Monks B.G. Rothe M. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6971-6975PubMed Google Scholar). Since we did not observe TLR-2 expression in HMEC, we next investigated the ability of these cells to respond to M. tuberculosis 19-kDa lipoprotein, which is a potent inducer of NF-κB and IL-12 in monocytes via TLR-2 (13.Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.-B. Belisle J.T. Bleharski J.R. Maitland M. Norgard M.V. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Godowski P.J. Modlin R.L. Science. 1999; 285: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). HMEC were stimulated with increasing concentrations of 19-kDa lipoprotein (10–1,000 ng/ml) for 5 h, and NF-κB activation was measured by ELAM reporter construct luciferase activity. 19-kDa lipoprotein was unable to induce NF-κB activation in HMEC, even at 1,000 ng/ml (Fig.4). However, expression of wild type TLR-2 cDNA in HMEC conferred responsiveness to 19-kDa lipoprotein (Fig. 4), whereas transfection of vector alone did not. In HMEC transfected with TLR-2, 19-kDa lipoprotein-induced NF-κB activation was inhibited by pre-incubation of the cells with anti-TLR-2 mAb (10 μg/ml) but not with control IgG1 Ab (Fig. 3) or with anti-TLR-4 mAb (data not shown). HUVEC were stimulated with LPS (50 ng/ml) or 19-kDa lipoprotein (50 ng/ml) for 6 h and the supernatants were collected for IL-6 measurement (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). 19-kDa lipoprotein did not induce any IL-6 release from HUVEC while LPS induced a mean of 4-fold increase in IL-6 production compared with resting cells in triplicate experiments (data not shown). LPS is a complex glycolipid consisting of a proximal hydrophobic lipid A moiety, a distal hydrophilic O-antigen polysaccharide region, and a core oligosaccharide that joins the lipid A and O-antigen structures. The lipid A portion of the molecule is the biologically active portion responsible for LPS responses, and removal of the fatty acid side chains from the lipid A moiety inactivates LPS (36.Zahringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison C.D. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1999: 93-114Google Scholar). A special nontoxic pentaacyl diphosphoryl lipid A derived from the LPS ofRhodobacter sphaeroides (RsDPLA) is an LPS antagonist bothin vivo and in in vitro experimental conditions (37.Qureshi N. Jarvis B.W. Takayama K. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1999: 687-698Google Scholar). Based on LPS binding studies, RsDPLA is believed to competitively antagonize LPS activity at its cell surface receptor, leading to inhibition of transmembrane signal transduction (37.Qureshi N. Jarvis B.W. Takayama K. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1999: 687-698Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated whether RsDPLA blocks LPS- or 19-kDa lipoprotein-induced signaling in native or TLR-2-transfected HMEC, respectively. Pretreatment of HMEC with RsDPLA blocked LPS-induced NF-κB activation but had no effect on 19-kDa lipoprotein-induced activation of TLR-2-transfected HMEC (Fig.5). Furthermore, RsDPLA (1 μg/ml) did not affect IL-1- or TNF-α-induced NF-κB gene activation in HMECs (data not shown), indicating that the antagonistic activity of RsDPLA is closely linked to and specific to cell-surface components utilized by LPS. Since we showed that TLR-4 is the most likely receptor on HMEC that accounts for LPS responsiveness, our observations suggest that RsDPLA may selectively inhibit LPS-TLR-4 interaction. We have previously shown that in contrast to monocytes and macrophages, EC do not express membrane CD14, and that LPS-induced EC activation is absolutely dependent on the presence of soluble form of the CD14 receptor (sCD14) present in serum (38.Arditi M. Zhou J. Dorio R. Rong G.W. Goyert S.M. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the role of sCD14 in LPS-TLR-4 signaling for EC activation, we tested the response of HMEC to LPS in serum-free media, and serum-free media supplemented with recombinant human sCD14. LPS-induced NF-κB activation in HMEC was serum- and soluble CD14-dependent. LPS (100–1,000 ng/ml) was unable to induce NF-κB activation in serum-free media, and addition of sCD14 (1 μg/ml) was able to restore LPS-induced cellular activation (Fig. 6). However, 19-kDa lipoprotein induced similar levels of NF-κB in TLR-2-expressing HMEC cultured in both serum-containing and in serum-free media (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that, in contrast to LPS, which absolutely requires sCD14 to trigger TLR-4 and activate HMEC, 19-kDa lipoprotein is able to activate TLR-2-transfected HMEC in the absence of serum or sCD14. Our data demonstrate that human microvascular ECs, which are one of the first lines of defense against invading microbial agents, including Gram-negative bacteria, actively participate in innate immune responses, and that LPS-induced responses in EC are specifically mediated via TLR-4. TLR-4 in human vascular EC participates in sensing LPS by a mechanism that is soluble CD14-dependent. After detecting the LPS molecules, TLR-4 transmits the information across the cell membrane, leading to the activation of NF-κB and regulation of several responsive genes. Similar to mice where mutations of TLR-4 result in exaggerated susceptibility to Gram-negative infections, humans who develop severe Gram-negative infections may have TLR-4 mutations at a higher rate. Our results also indicate a differential expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in human vascular endothelial cells. This results in brisk EC responses to Gram-negative LPS but no EC responses to bacterial lipoproteins such as M. tuberculosis 19-kDa lipoprotein or to Gram-positive bacterial cell wall components such as PGN and LTA, 2M. Arditi, E. Faure, O. Equils, L. Thomas, and F. X. Zhang, unpublished data. which require TLR-2 to signal. The biological relevance of this observation is unclear and needs to be further investigated. Because the mammalian TLR family has many members, it is possible that the innate immune system and its individual cell types use different combinations of TLRs to recognize different groups of microbial pathogens. Finally, our findings indicate that TLR-4 may be a potential target in the development of novel treatment strategies for Gram-negative sepsis and endotoxic shock. We thank Drs.

In the present study, we determined if the class B scavenger receptors, CD36 and SR-BI, are involved in regulating nitric-oxide synthase localization and function. We demonstrate that CD36 and SR-BI are expressed in endothelial cells, co-fractionate with caveolae, and co-immunoprecipitate with caveolin-1. Co-incubation of cells with 10 μg/ml high density lipoprotein (HDL) prevented oxLDL-induced translocation of eNOS from caveolae and restored acetylcholine-induced nitric-oxide synthase stimulation. Acetylcholine caused eNOS activation in cells incubated with 10 μg/ml oxLDL (10–15 thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) and blocking antibodies to CD36, whereas cells treated with only oxLDL were unresponsive. Furthermore, CD36-blocking antibodies prevented oxLDL-induced redistribution of eNOS. SR-BI-blocking antibodies were used to demonstrate that the effects of HDL are mediate by SR-BI. HDL binding to SR-BI maintained the concentration of caveola-associated cholesterol by promoting the uptake of cholesterol esters, thereby preventing oxLDL-induced depletion of caveola cholesterol. We conclude that CD36 mediates the effects of oxLDL on caveola composition and eNOS activation. Furthermore, HDL prevents oxLDL from decreasing the capacity for eNOS activation by preserving the cholesterol concentration in caveolae and, thereby maintaining the subcellular location of eNOS. Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) depletes caveolae of cholesterol, resulting in the displacement of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) from caveolae and impaired eNOS activation.

Anggard E.E. Botting R.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Responsiveness to receptor-dependent stimuli, such as acetylcholine, is decreased in the initial phase of the disease process, whereas responsiveness to receptor-independent stimuli such as the calcium ionophore A23187 is not altered. Therefore, the early pathogenesis is characterized by attenuated endothelial NO production in response to extracellular stimuli, even though the capacity for maximal enzyme activation and the breakdown of NO are not affected. As the disease progresses, nonspecific inhibition of NO bioavailability occurs, which is at least partly due to enhanced inactivation of NO by superoxide anions (2.Harrison D.G. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1994; 89, Suppl. 1: 87-102PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Cohen R.A. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1995; 38: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 4.Flavahan N.A. Circulation. 1992; 85: 1927-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The chronic inhibition of NO synthesis in rabbit models of hypercholesterolemia accelerates the development of vascular dysfunction and intimal lesions, providing additional evidence that the impairment of NO synthesis promotes atherogenesis (5.Cayatte A.J. Palacino J.J. Horten K. Cohen R.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar).In vitro investigations have further shown that oxLDL1 inhibits NO-mediated responses (6.Plane F. Jacob M. McManus D. Bruckdorfer K.R. Atherosclerosis. 1993; 103: 73-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have demonstrated that the endothelial isoform of NO synthase (eNOS) is localized in plasmalemmal caveolae and that caveolin is a negative regulator of eNOS enzymatic activity (7.Feron O. Michel J.B. Sase K. Michel T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Caveolae are lipid domains that typically represent about 1–4% of the total plasma membrane surface area (8.Rothberg K.G. Ying Y. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2931-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The structure and function of caveolae is dependent on the amount of cholesterol associated with the domain. Cholesterol plays a key role in controlling the morphology of caveolae and the localization of proteins to caveolae (8.Rothberg K.G. Ying Y. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J.

We recently demonstrated that oxLDL depletes plasma membrane caveolae of cholesterol, leading to the translocation of eNOS from caveolae to an intracellular membrane compartment and the inhibition of acetylcholine-induced eNOS activation (12.Blair A.

The class B scavenger receptors, CD36 and SR-BI, are thought to be involved in the process of atherogenesis and both are enriched in caveolae (13.Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z.

One of the striking features of CD36 and SR-BI is their broad and overlapping ligand binding specificity. For instance, both receptors bind HDL, native LDL, and oxidized LDL, but not the many polyanions that are bound by the class A scavenger receptors (16.Rigotti A. Atton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 17.Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of many of these receptor-ligand interactions is not known. We recently demonstrated that oxLDL binding to CD36, but not SR-BI, promotes the efflux of caveola cholesterol to oxLDL. In addition, we have shown that caveolae are the initial sites of SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of HDL cholesterol esters (18.Graf G.A. Connell P.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12043-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and that caveolae are acceptor membranes for newly synthesized cholesterol (11.Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). To further understand the mechanisms by which cholesterol status affects endothelial NO production, the present studies were designed to determine whether HDL modifies the effects of oxLDL on eNOS subcellular localization and function in cultured endothelial cells. Since there is a negative relationship between serum HDL levels and the risk for atherosclerosis (19.Grundy S.M. JAMA. 1986; 256: 2849-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 20.Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that HDL reverses the negative effects of oxLDL on eNOS localization and activation in caveolae. Additional experiments were performed to determine the roles of CD36 and SR-BI receptors in these processes, and the basis for the effects of HDL.

Protein A-Sepharose beads were first blocked by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C with Chinese hamster ovary cell lysate (200 μg/ml) plus 30 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Blocked beads were then used to preclear the experimental fractions that had been adjusted to 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Precleared fractions were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody before adding blocked Protein A-Sepharose beads and incubating an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed five times in high salt (500 mm NaCl) immunoprecipitation buffer, and then placed in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Cellular fractions were dissolved in 0.015% (w/v) deoxycholate, concentrated by precipitation with 7% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and washed in acetone. Pellets were suspended in 1× sample buffer plus 1.2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 95 °C for 5 min immediately prior to loading. Proteins were separated on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel at 50 mA (constant current) and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 50 V (constant voltage) for 2 h. Membranes were blocked with blotting buffer for 60 min at 22 °C. Primary antibodies were diluted in blotting buffer and incubated with blocked membranes for 60 min at 22 °C. Membranes were washed four times for 10 min in wash buffer. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgGs directed against the appropriate host IgGs were diluted and incubated with membranes as described for primary antibodies. Membranes were washed four times for 10 min in wash buffer and visualized using chemiluminescence. LDL (d = 1.019–1.05 g/ml) and HDL (d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) were isolated from fresh human plasma by density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (28.Fisher W.R. Schumaker V.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 247-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29.Kelley J.L. Kruski A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The HDL3 subfraction (d = 1.13–1.18 g/ml) was isolated from other HDL subfractions using a density gradient fractionator (Isco). The HDL3 subfraction was used for all of the experimental treatments described herein. The purity of each lipoprotein fraction was assayed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. LDL apolipoproteins were iodinated by the iodine monochloride method (30.Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 400–600 cpm/ng LDL protein. Oxidized LDL was prepared by incubating fresh LDL with 10 μmCuSO4 at 37 °C for 16 h. The material was dialyzed against a sterile solution (150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 100 μg/ml polymyxin B, pH 7.4) and then sterilized by filtration. The cholesterol, triglyceride (31.Krieger M. McPhaul M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3845-3853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein (32.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) content of the lipoprotein were determined by standard methods. The homogeneity of each preparation was determined by SDS-PAGE. The extent of LDL oxidation was estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis and by measuring the amount of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances generated with a colorimetric assay for malondialdehyde (33.Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (11025) Google Scholar). NOS activation was determined in whole endothelial cells grown in 24-well plates by measuring [3H]l-arginine conversion to [3H]l-citrulline using methods previously described. This procedure provides a direct assessment of the acute activation of existing eNOS while keeping signal transduction mechanisms intact (34.Davda R.K. Chandler L.J. Crews F.T. Guzman N.J. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells were placed inl-arginine-deficient, serum-free media containing 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture, 0.15% Nystatin, 0.15% gentamycin and 0.10% Tylosin for 18 h at 37 °C. The medium was replaced with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 500 μl/well), pH 7.4, containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 7.5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1.2 mmNa2HPO4, and 0.37 mmKH2PO4 for a 60-min preincubation at 37 °C. In selected wells (blanks), 500 μl of 1N trichloroacetic acid was added in lieu of PBS. After the preincubation period, the incubation for NOS activation was initiated by aspirating the PBS from the wells and replacing it with 400 μl of PBS containing 0.75 μCi/ml [3H]l-arginine. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the absence of exogenous stimulation (basal) or in the presence of acetylcholine (10−6m), with or without the addition of 10 μg/ml oxLDL and/or HDL. The NOS reaction was terminated by adding 500 μl of ice-cold 1 ntrichloroacetic acid to each well. The preincubations were performed in the presence of oxLDL, nLDL, IgGs, or buffer as described under “Results.” The cells were freeze-fractured twice in liquid nitrogen for 2 min with thawing at 37 °C for 5 min, and scraped with a rubber spatula. The contents of each well were aspirated and transferred to ice-cold sialonized glass test tubes. Ether extraction was performed three times with water-saturated ether. The samples were neutralized with 1.5 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 8, applied to Dowex AG50WX-8 (Tris form) columns, and eluted with 1 ml of 40 mm HEPES buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mmEGTA. [3H]l-Citrulline generated was collected in glass scintillation vials and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In individual experiments performed in 24-well plates, four wells were used for each treatment group. Findings were confirmed in three independent experiments. NOS activation in the intact cells was completely inhibited by 2 mmnitro-l-arginine methyl ester. [3H]l-Arginine uptake was measured following nLDL or oxLDL pretreatment as done in the experiments evaluating eNOS localization and eNOS activation. Uptake was similar in nLDL- and oxLDL-treated cells. Basal (non-stimulated) eNOS activation over 15 min was 40 ± 6.8 fmol of [3H]l-citrulline/well. The selective uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL into cells was determined using [3H]cholesterol oleate (18.Graf G.A. Connell P.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12043-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were rinsed twice with PBS (37 °C). Growth medium containing 5% human lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) and 10 μg/ml [3H]cholesterol oleate-HDL was added to the cells for the indicated times. Following incubation, uptake was terminated by aspirating the medium and washing the cell monolayers four times with Tris-saline (4 °C). The cells were dissolved in 1m NaOH and the amount of radiation determined by scintillation counting. Total cellular protein was determined by Lowry (32.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thin layer chromatography and liquid scintillation counting was used to measure the amount of [3H]sterol in each sample (11.Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Each sample was adjusted to a volume of 1 ml with distilled water. Methanol (1.2 ml) containing 2% (v/v) acetic acid was added to the sample before vortexing two times, 30 s each. Chloroform (1.2 ml) was then added and the sample vortexed two times, 30 s each. The organic and aqueous phases were separated in a Beckman Clinical Centrifuge at 1200 × g, 15 min at room temperature. The organic phase was dried under nitrogen and then suspended in 50 μl of the solvent system (80:20:1; petroleum ether:ethyl ether:acetic acid). Pure cholesterol was dissolved in the solvent system and used as a standard (5 μg/spot). Lipids were visualized by charring with sulfuric acid-ethanol and heating at 180 °C for 10 min. Unlabeled cholesterol was added to each fraction to facilitate visualization. The appropriate spots were scraped and the amount of radiation quantified by liquid scintillation counting. To each 0.25-ml sample, 1 ml of hexane:isopropanol (3:2) was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The organic phase was saved while the aqueous phase was re-extracted. The organic phases were combined and dried to completeness with nitrogen. The sample was solubilized in 600 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in chloroform, and dried to completeness with nitrogen. The sample was then solubilized in 300 μl of water, and the total cholesterol was determined as described previously (35.Carr T.P. Andresen C.J. Rudel L.L. Clin. Biochem. 1993; 26: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that oxLDL inhibits receptor-dependent stimulation of eNOS and alters the subcellular distribution of eNOS (12.Blair A. Shaul P.W. Yuhanna I.S. Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32512-32519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The class B scavenger receptors, CD36 and SR-BI, bind oxLDL. Therefore, to examine the possible involvement of these receptors in mediating the effect of oxLDL on eNOS distribution and function, we determined if these proteins are expressed in endothelial cells. We subfractionated quiescent endothelial cells to isolate caveolae and resolved 15 μg from each subcellular fraction by SDS-PAGE. The material was transferred to nylon and immunoblotted with CD36, SR-BI, caveolin-1, clathrin, and transferrin receptor IgGs (Fig.1 A). CD36, SR-BI, and caveolin-1 were highly enriched in the caveola fraction. The yield of CD36, SR-BI, and caveolin-1 in the caveola fraction was determined by immunoblot analysis in the linear range of detection (data not shown). The estimated yield, with respect to the plasma membrane fraction, of CD36 was 56 ± 9%, SR-BI was 62 ± 7%, and caveolin-1 was 51 ± 5%. The non-caveola proteins, clathrin and transferrin receptor, were not associated with the caveola fraction. Recently Stan et al. (36.Stan R.V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and Waugh et al. (37.Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) suggested that isolated caveolae are contaminated with vesicles with similar biophysical properties as caveolae. Therefore, to verify that CD36 and SR-BI are associated with caveolin-containing membranes we used caveolin-1 IgG to immunoprecipitate caveola membranes from caveolin-enriched membrane fractions. The immunoprecipitated material (PEL) and the remaining supernatant (SUP) were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for caveolin-1, CD36, and SR-BI. Caveolin-1 IgG quantitatively co-immunoprecipitated CD36 (Fig.1 B, PEL versus SUP) and SR-BI (Fig. 1 C, PEL versus SUP). These findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the localization of CD36 (13.Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) to caveolae. Since plasma levels of HDL cholesterol are inversely correlated with the risk of developing atherosclerosis, we next determined if HDL reverses the effects of oxLDL on eNOS localization and function. Cells were treated with 10 μg/ml lipoprotein in LPDS for 1 h at 37 °C and then subfractionated to isolate caveolae. For experiments with both oxLDL and HDL, oxLDL (10 μg/ml) was incubated with cells for 60 min, and then HDL (10 μg/ml) was added for an additional 15 min prior to subfractionation. Equal amounts of protein (15 μg) from each subcellular fraction were analyzed for the presence of eNOS and caveolin-1 by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A). eNOS and caveolin-1 were highly enriched in caveolae isolated from cells treated with nLDL or HDL. In contrast, oxLDL caused the translocation of eNOS and caveolin-1 from caveolae to an intracellular membrane fraction. The addition of HDL to the treatment medium containing oxLDL induced the redistribution of eNOS and caveolin-1 back to the caveola fraction. Furthermore, HDL restored acetylcholine-induced stimulation of eNOS activity (Fig. 2 B). We used a commercially available CD36-blocking antibody (FA6.152) to determine if CD36 mediates the effects of oxLDL on eNOS location and function. Cells were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml oxLDL in the presence of LPDS, LPDS plus nonspecific IgG (2 μg/ml), or LPDS plus CD36 IgG (2 μg/ml). The cells were then subfractionated to isolate caveolae, and 15 μg of protein from each fraction was analyzed by immunoblot for the presence of eNOS and caveolin-1 (Fig.3 A). Incubation of cells with nonspecific IgG did not prevent the oxLDL-induced translocation of caveolin-1 and eNOS to the intracellular membrane fraction. However, co-incubation with CD36-blocking antibody inhibited oxLDL-induced movement of caveolin-1 and eNOS. We also determined if the CD36-blocking antibody would prevent oxLDL-induced suppression of acetylcholine-induced eNOS stimulation (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the effects on eNOS localization, nonspecific IgG did not prevent oxLDL-induced inhibition of eNOS activity whereas CD36 IgG permitted eNOS activation. We used a SR-BI-blocking antibody characterized by Temel et al. (38.Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13600-13605Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) to determine if HDL binding to SR-BI is responsible for reversing the effects of oxLDL on eNOS distribution and function. Cells were treated with oxLDL or oxLDL plus HDL as described above in the presence of nonspecific IgG (500 μg/ml) or SR-BI IgG (500 μg/ml). The cells were then subfractionated to isolate caveolae, and 15 μg of protein from each fraction was analyzed by immunoblot for the presence of eNOS and caveolin-1 (Fig. 4 A). In the presence of nonspecific IgG, HDL was able to restore the localization of eNOS and caveolin-1 to caveolae. However, co-incubation with SR-BI IgG, which blocks the binding of HDL to SR-BI (38.Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13600-13605Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), prevented HDL from preserving the localization of caveolin-1 and eNOS to caveolae. In addition, SR-BI-blocking IgG interfered with HDL restoration of acetylcholine-induced stimulation of eNOS (Fig. 4 B). To determine if HDL prevents oxLDL-induced depletion of caveola cholesterol, we incubated cells with 10 μg/ml oxLDL, 10 μg/ml HDL, or both for 0–60 min, and then measured the mass of cholesterol associated with caveolae. Fig. 5 A shows that oxLDL depleted caveola-associated cholesterol by 40 min, whereas treatment with 10 μg/ml HDL did not alter the total cholesterol mass associated with caveolae (Fig. 5 B). The addition of 10 μg/ml HDL to the oxLDL treatment medium attenuated the capacity of oxLDL to deplete caveolae of cholesterol (Fig. 5 C). We next determined if HDL-mediated protection from cholesterol depletion by oxLDL was due to the inhibition of cholesterol transport out of caveolae by oxLDL, or the transport of cholesterol into caveolae from HDL. Cells were radiolabeled with [14C]acetate for 18 h to label intracellular cholesterol (22.Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y.-S. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). HDL and oxLDL (10 μg/ml each) were added simultaneously for 0–60 min. The cells were then processed to measure the amount of [14C]cholesterol associated with caveolae and the mass of cholesterol associated with caveolae. The amount of [14C]cholesterol associated with caveolae decreased rapidly and was depleted by 40 min (Fig.5 D). However, the mass of cholesterol associated with caveolae was not changed (Fig. 5 D). These data suggest that HDL does not inhibit cholesterol depletion but rather serves as a cholesterol donor. To test this, cellular cholesterol pools were radiolabeled as described above and HDL was labeled with [3H]cholesterol ester (18.Graf G.A. Connell P.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12043-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). [3H]HDL and oxLDL were added to cells as described above. Fig. 5 Edemonstrates that, as endogenous [14C]cholesterol leaves caveolae, [3H]cholesterol ester derived from HDL appears in caveolae. The present observations reveal that CD36 mediates the rapid and dramatic effects of oxLDL on eNOS localization and function in caveolae. In addition, we demonstrate that SR-BI mediates the ability of HDL to protect caveolae from oxLDL-induced depletion of cholesterol and eNOS redistribution. These findings indicate that at least some of the athero-protective features of HDL may be due to direct effects on endothelial cell signal transduction mechanisms that are localized to plasmalemmal caveolae. The class B scavenger receptors, CD36 and SR-BI, were expressed in the endothelial cells used in this investigation (Fig. 1). Subcellular fractionation studies suggested that these proteins are associated with caveolae. Recently, Stan et al. (36.Stan R.V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and Waugh et al. (37.Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) have used co-immunoprecipitation experiments to suggest that isolated caveolae are contaminated with non-caveola low density membranes. To confirm that CD36 and SR-BI are associated with caveola membranes, we first isolated caveolae and then immunoprecipitated the membrane fragments with caveolin-1 IgG. Greater than 90% of CD36 and SR-BI co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-1 from isolated caveola fractions. These new data along with previously published confocal studies (15.Babitt J. Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. Xu S. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) demonstrate that a significant proportion of CD36 and SR-BI are associated with endothelial caveolae. Because CD36 is known to bind oxLDL, we determined if this protein is responsible for the effects of oxLDL on caveolae and eNOS function. We demonstrated that the addition of a CD36- blocking antibody to the oxLDL treatment medium inhibits the ability of oxLDL to cause the redistribution of eNOS and caveolin-1 (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the addition of CD36-blocking antibodies maintained the ability of eNOS to be activated by acetylcholine (Fig. 3 B). HDL protected caveolae from the effects of oxLDL; however, SR-BI-blocking antibodies eliminated this protection (Fig. 4). SR-BI has been reported to bind oxLDL but SR-BI-blocking antibodies did not affect the oxLDL-induced reduction in eNOS activity (data not shown). These data provide a mechanism whereby oxLDL and HDL can specifically interact with caveolae, namely through the scavenger receptors CD36 and SR-BI. We further examined the mechanism of HDL protection. Two possibilities were tested. First, does HDL prevent cholesterol efflux to oxLDL? Our data demonstrate that HDL does not prevent the efflux of caveola sterols to oxLDL (Fig. 5). Second, we tested the possibility that HDL serves as a sterol donor and replaces the sterol effluxed to oxLDL. By radiolabeling the cellular sterol pool, we were able to demonstrate that the radiolabeled endogenous sterol in caveolae was depleted in the presence of oxLDL and HDL without a corresponding decrease in caveola cholesterol mass. These data suggested that HDL replaces the sterol that is lost from caveolae upon exposure to oxLDL. We previously demonstrated that SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of cholesterol esters into caveolae (18.Graf G.A. Connell P.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12043-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To directly determine if HDL replaces caveola sterols, we radiolabeled cellular cholesterol pools with14C and HDL with [3H]cholesterol ester. The removal of endogenous [14C]sterol from caveolae was matched by an accumulation of [3H]cholesterol ester in caveolae. These data demonstrate that the lipid composition of caveolae can be regulated by CD36, SR-BI, oxLDL, and HDL. Importantly, the lipoprotein-mediated alterations in caveola composition are directly related to a physiologic phenomena, namely the generation of nitric oxide. In summary, we have shown that oxLDL-induced redistribution of eNOS from caveolae and the subsequent inability to efficiently activate eNOS with acetylcholine is mediated by the class B scavenger receptor, CD36. These findings provide a potential mechanism by which elevations in oxLDL rapidly attenuate the capacity for NO production by the endothelium. As such, they may at least partially explain the repeated observation in many experimental models and in humans that hypercholesterolemia-induced vascular disease and atherosclerosis are characterized by an early, selective impairment of agonist-stimulated endothelium-dependent relaxation, and that this is due to a decrease in bioavailable endothelium-derived NO (1.Vane J.R. Anggard E.E. Botting R.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that HDL prevents the depletion of caveola-cholesterol by oxLDL in a SR-BI-dependent manner. This process may be critical to the athero-protective effects of HDL. Additional studies of the effects of oxLDL and HDL on caveolae composition and eNOS activation will increase our fundamental knowledge of the regulation of endothelial NO production under both normal conditions and during altered cholesterol balance, thereby further revealing the pathogenic link between hypercholesterolemia and endothelial dysfunction.

Medina L. Moloney D. Philipsberg G. Scartozzi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1997; 231: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2.Chou C.F. Smith A.J. Omary M.B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3578-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Changes in cell physiology may be accompanied by transient and dramatic alteration inO-GlcNAc levels (4.Kearse K.P. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1701-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Such rapid changes have led to proposals that post-translational modification by O-GlcNAc may be analogous to protein phosphorylation. Indeed, in most cases, proteins bearing O-GlcNAc are also found to be phosphorylated (1.Haltiwanger R.S. Busby S. Grove K. Li S. Mason D. Medina L. Moloney D. Philipsberg G. Scartozzi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1997; 231: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5.Miller M.W. Caracciolo M.R. Berlin W.K. Hanover J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The relationship between O-GlcNAc and phosphorylation is obviously complex and may be a key to understanding the function of O-GlcNAc addition. Another clue to understanding the role of O-GlcNAc in cell physiology derives from in vitro studies on the role of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in insulin resistance. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway mediates the metabolic interconversion of intracellular glucose to UDP-GlcNAc, the substrate for OGT. The work of a number of investigators has implicated the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in insulin resistance (6.Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Hebert L.F. Daniels M.C. Zhou J.X. Crook E.D. Turner R.L. Simmons S.T. Neidigh J.L. Zhu J.S. Baron A.D. McClain D.A. J. Clin.

Chen W. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2173-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Because OGT uses UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate, it is likely that the OGT participates in some aspect of mammalian insulin resistance (10.Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 11.Hanover J.A. Zhennan L. Lee G. Lubas W.A. Sato S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A final clue was the identification of a homolog of OGT in the plantArabidopsis. This protein (spindly) corresponds to the protein product of the spy locus responsible for regulating the gibberellin signaling pathway (12.Jacobsen S.E. Binkowski K.A. Olszewski N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9292-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Mutations at this locus yield a phenotype exhibiting constitutive activation of the gibberellin pathway (13.Ogas J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R165-R167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although similar mutations have yet to be identified in mammalian OGT, this enzyme is also likely to serve a signaling role. The enzyme responsible for O-linked GlcNAc addition, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide β-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (O-GlcNAc transferase, OGT)1 was initially isolated from rat liver as a heterotrimer of 350 kDa, containing two 110-kDa subunits and one 78-kDa subunit (14.Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rabbit red blood cells, however, only the 110-kDa subunit was routinely observed (10.Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody to the 110-kDa rat enzyme recognized both the 110- and 78-kDa subunits by Western blot analysis (15.Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (607) Google Scholar), suggesting that both proteins had common peptide epitopes. The larger subunit has recently been cloned from humans, nematodes (10.Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and rats (15.Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the human cDNA, encoding the 103-kDa subunit, in HeLa cells increased O-GlcNAc transferase activity. However, because mammalian cells have endogenous activity, the possibility that the cloned protein was indirectly stimulating endogenous activity could not be rigorously excluded (10.Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 15.Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Here we show that expression of the human OGT cDNA in Escherichia coli, an organism that has no endogenous activity, results in an active enzyme capable of modifying recombinant substrates in vitro. This argues that other subunits are not essential for enzyme activity, although other regulatory subunits may exist in vivo. The cDNAs from humans, rats, and nematodes encode for proteins of molecular mass 103, 116, and 128 kDa, respectively. There are 13 tandem tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) in the nematode protein compared with 11 in rat and 9 in human. The TPR is a 34-amino acid repeat containing the 8 following loosely conserved residues: W-L-G-Y-A-F-A-P (16.Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 17.Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). A recent crystal structure suggests that each degenerate repeat forms a pair of antiparallel α-helices resulting in a superhelical structure believed to be the site of protein-protein interaction (17.Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Here we show that the TPR domain in human OGT is important for glycosylation of proteins such as Nup 62 and casein kinase II as well as peptides such as YSDSPSTST. Yet the first six TPRs are not absolutely required for catalytic activity. The recombinant enzyme is also shown to be capable of autoglycosylation, and removal of the first six TPRs increases this activity. The number of proteins known to be modified by OGT is steadily increasing since it was identified on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (18.Holt G.D. Snow C.M. Senior A. Haltiwanger R.S. Gerace L. Hart G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1157-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 19.Hanover J.A. Cohen C.K. Willingham R.S. Park M.K. J. Biol.

In this study we show that two enzymes that play a key role in glycogen metabolism, glycogen synthase kinase-3 and casein kinase II, can be modified with recombinant OGT in vitro. These data are consistent with a proposed role of OGT in modulating insulin resistance in mammals. Human OGT, clone Lv4F, (10.Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pET 32B (Novagen) using the EcoRV and NotI restrictions sites to make clone A. Clone B was isolated by excising the 441-bpBglII-BglII fragment from clone A and religating with T4 DNA ligase. Clone C was isolated by excising the 726-bpEcoRV-NsiI fragment and religating using a linker made from the following primers (p)ACAGGAAGCTCTGATGCA and (p)TCAGAGCTTCCTGT. Clone D was isolated by subcloning theEcoRI-NotI fragment from Lv4F into pET 32C (Novagen). Clone E was isolated by excising the 1819-bpAflII-NotI fragment from Clone A, filling in the 5′-overhangs with Klenow and using T4 DNA ligase for blunt-end ligation. Clone F was isolated by excising the 1212-bpEspI-EspI fragment from Clone A and religating with T4 DNA ligase. Clone G was isolated by excising the 341-bpXhoI-XhoI fragment from clone A and religating with T4 DNA ligase. All clones were sequenced through the cloning sites to confirm the coding sequence. Cultures of BL21 (DE3) cells containing the pET 32 human OGT clone expression vector were grown overnight at room temperature at 220 rpm in LB media (Digene) supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml). Cells were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min in a Beckman GS-6R centrifuge. The pellet was freeze-thawed and resuspended in 1/20 of the original volume in 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysozyme digestion was performed at 30 °C for 15 min. The lysate was sonicated on ice (2 × 10 s, setting 3, Misonix Ultrasonic Processor) until all the DNA was sheared. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min was frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. Expressed S-Tag fusion proteins in the supernatant were purified on S-Protein-agarose (Novagen) using the manufacturer's protocol. The S-Tag rapid assay kit (Novagen) was used to quantify the yield of S-Tag fusion proteins. The S-Tag horseradish peroxidase Lumiblot Kit (Novagen) was used to quantify the yield of full-length S-Tag proteins. Incubations were performed using S-protein-purified OGT, clones A–G (0.3–6 μg), UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (35 Ci/mmol, 0.5–20 μm, DuPont) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 12.5 mm MgCl2 as standard assay conditions. The macromolecular substrates were recombinant-purified Nup 62 (2.3 μg) prepared as described previously (20.Lubas W.A. Smith M. Starr C.M. Hanover J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1684-1694Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or casein kinase II (2.2 μg, NE Biolabs). The 40-μl reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C at 220 rpm for 60–90 min. Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Novel Experimental Technology) and boiling samples for 3 min. SDS-PAGE was performed using precast 10% or 8–16% Novex gels (Novel Experimental Technology). Gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 60 min and destained overnight with 10% acetic acid, 30% methanol. Glycosylation with [3H]GlcNAc was visualized, after treatment with Enlightening (DuPont) for 20 min, by fluorography using X-Omat film (Kodak). Densitometry data were quantified using the Fotodyne imaging system and Collage 4.0 software. OGT enzyme activity was also measured using ScintiStrip wells (Wallac) or nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) precoated with Nup 62, as described previously (10.Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 20.Lubas W.A. Smith M. Starr C.M. Hanover J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1684-1694Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The peptide glycosylation assay was performed as described previously (14.Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The reaction mixture for a standard assay included S-protein-purified OGT (0.3–6 μg), HPLC-purified peptide YSDSPSTST or YSDSGSTST (250 μg, Lofstrand Labs Limited), 1 μCi of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (35 Ci/mmol, DuPont), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 12.5 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 40 μl. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C at 220 rpm for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 450 μl of 50 mm formic acid to the supernatant. The S-Tag pellet was rinsed twice with 50 μl of water, and the pooled supernatant was loaded onto 0.5-ml Sephadex (SP-C25, Sigma) columns equilibrated in 50 mm formic acid. The columns were washed with 8 ml of formic acid and eluted with 2 ml of 0.5 m NaCl. Incorporation of [3H]GlcNAc into the peptides was quantitated using scintillation chromatography. The amount of OGT bound to the S-Tag beads in each assay was confirmed by Western blot analysis using the S-Tag horseradish peroxidase Lumiblot Kit (Novagen). Rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) -3β (47-kDa monomer), human glioblastoma casein kinase II containing both α (44 kDa, catalytic) and β (26 kDa, regulatory) subunits, rat testis casein kinase I (36-kDa monomer, with a truncation of the labile C terminus at Ser318), murine cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (38-kDa catalytic subunit), murine mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, 42 kDa), and rat calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (33 kDa, containing the first 325 amino acids) were purchased as purified and recombinant proteins from NE Biolabs. We originally isolated human OGT cDNA using the Genetrapper cDNA-positive selection system (10.Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Because E. coli has no endogenousO-GlcNAc transferase activity, this makes it an ideal system for expression and characterization of the recombinantO-GlcNAc transferase. Therefore, we inserted the OGT cDNA into the pET 32 vector for expression in E. coli. Soluble OGT activity was isolated directly from the E. colisupernatant as shown in Fig. 1. Note that OGT glycosylation is quite specific. The enzyme does not modify any soluble E. coli proteins (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) under conditions in which Nup 62 is highly modified (Fig.1 A, lane 4). Because O-GlcNAc glycosylation can readily be observed in bacteria transformed with OGT cDNA, it appears that this enzyme is sufficient for activity, and other mammalian subunits are not essential. Subcloning of OGT into the pET 32 vector produces a fusion protein containing an N-terminal epitope tag permitting easy purification. A soluble 114-kDa fusion protein can be highly purified in a single step using S-protein beads as shown in Fig. 1 B, lane 3. When incubated with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, the recombinant OGT adds [3H]GlcNAc to Nup 62 in a reaction linearly dependent upon enzyme concentration and time (Fig.2 and data not shown). The reaction is completely inhibited by UDP (Fig. 2, lane 6) as had been previously described for the mammalian enzyme (14.Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified recombinant enzyme exhibits a specific activity and kinetic parameters similar to the enzyme isolated from rabbit blood (10.Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and rat liver (14.Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). These quantitative data strongly suggest that the addition of the N-terminal epitope tag did not significantly effect enzyme activity. In addition to Nup 62 we tested to see if OGT could modify other peptide substrates and proteins. Fig. 4 A again shows that OGT glycosylation is quite specific. The enzyme can modify a peptide YSDSPSTST, which had previously been shown to be a substrate for the rat enzyme, but does not modify another similar peptide YSDSGSTST, which was shown not serve as an acceptor (21.Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given this specificity, we asked if any of the kinases known to be involved in insulin signaling might be substrates for OGT. As Fig.4 B demonstrates, recombinant OGT can modify two mammalian kinases, casein kinase II and GSK-3β, but not cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, casein kinase I, mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2), or calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Both casein kinase II and GSK-3β phosphorylate glycogen synthase and modulate its activity. Starting with the active recombinant enzyme, deletion mutants of OGT were made as shown in Fig.5 A to characterize the domains of OGT that are responsible for catalysis. Human OGT has only 9 tetratricopeptide repeats compared with rat, which has 11, and nematode, which has 13. N-terminal deletions removing the first 3 repeats (clone B), the first 6 repeats (clone C), or the entire TPR domain (clone D), and three C-terminal deletions labeled clones E, F, and G were constructed as shown in Fig. 5 A. The recombinant deletion mutations were purified using S-Tag chromatography and probed with S-protein-horseradish peroxide reductase conjugate to confirm that the predicted single full-length species were obtained for each clone (Fig. 5 B). Each of these mutants was analyzed for the ability to modify Nup 62, casein kinase II, and the peptide YSDSPSTST (TableI). Deletion of the first 3 tetratricopeptide repeats in clone B results in a significant loss of activity (58%) for Nup 62, whereas removal of the first 6 tetratricopeptide repeats in clone C results in an almost complete loss of activity toward Nup 62 as a substrate. C-terminal deletions, clones E, F, and G, had no measurable activity suggesting that this part of the protein is essential for catalysis. This is consistent with the high level of conservation seen between human and rat cDNA in the C-terminal region. There is 99% identity at the protein level in the C-terminal 872 amino acids of rat and human OGT. Casein kinase II, which was a much poorer substrate than Nup 62, appeared to be modified only by the full-length enzyme clone A. In contrast, the peptide YSDSPSTST was preferentially modified by clone B lacking the first three tetratricopeptide repeats, suggesting the first three tetratricopeptide repeats were partially inhibiting its glycosylation. Taken together these data suggest that the tetratricopeptide repeats contribute to the substrate specificity of OGT. Although all of the tetratricopeptide repeats are not essential for catalytic activity, they do appear to be necessary for optimal glycosylation of full-length proteins.Table IThe O-GlcNAc transferase activity of deletion mutantsOGT cloneNup 62Casein kinase IIYSDSPSTST%%%A10010074B420100C209D000E000F000G000OGT activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentage activity was normalized individually for each substrate. Open table in a new tab OGT activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentage activity was normalized individually for each substrate. In analyzing the glycosylation products made by the various forms of the enzyme (Fig. 5 C), we noted that clone C preferentially catalyzes self-glycosylation. We then measured autoglycosylation of clones A, B, and C in the absence of an exogenous substrate (Fig.6 B). Although comparable levels of A, B, and C were used (Fig. 6 A), clones A and B still had significantly lower levels of autoglycosylation than clone C (Fig. 6 B). We also used galactosyltransferase labeling to identify terminal O-GlcNAc residues on the purified recombinant enzymes (Fig. 6 C) to see if OGT had already partially modified itself in E. coli. If clones A and B were already highly modified in E. coli, this could explain why they were poor substrates for autoglycosylation in the in vitro assays. The galactosyltransferase labeling, however, showed that clone C also had the highest level of autoglycosylation inE. coli. This confirms that clones A and B are poorer substrates for autoglycosylation than clone C. Taken together, these data suggest that removal of the first 6 TPRs interferes with the recognition of Nup 62 as a substrate and augments autoglycosylation. Evidence is accumulating thatO-GlcNAc addition can act as a regulatory modification involved in signal transduction pathways. In plants, the OGT homolog spindly (spy) is involved in suppression of the gibberellin signaling pathway (12.Jacobsen S.E. Binkowski K.A. Olszewski N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9292-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a large number of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins have been previously identified as substrates for OGT. Many of these proteins are directly involved in signal transduction. Examples include RNA polymerase II and the transcription factors, Ap1, Sp1, serum response factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor, and the pancreatic-specific transcription factor. Also modified are the estrogen receptor, oncogenes such as c-myc, v-erb, SV40 large T antigen, and the tumor suppressor gene, p53. It has been shown that glycosylation of p53 in its C-terminal regulatory domain enhances its DNA binding activity (22.Shaw P. Freeman J. Bovey R. Iggo R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 921-930PubMed Google Scholar), whereas glycosylation of an Sp1-derived peptide inhibits its binding to the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 110 (23.Roos M.D. Kaihong S. Baker J.R. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this paper we have shown that recombinant human OGT expressed in E. coli is fully active and capable of modifying recombinant proteins in vitro. This should make it possible to clarify the role that glycosylation plays in signal transduction. The ability to modify recombinant proteins should make it easier to study the effect ofO-GlcNAccylation on protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in vitro. Our data suggest that OGT glycosylation is quite specific. We were unable to detect any glycosylation of bacterial proteins isolated along with recombinant OGT in the total supernatant fraction from E. coli. However, autoglycosylation of OGT was observed. Because catalytically active OGT can be isolated from E. coli, which has no endogenousO-GlcNAc activity, autoglycosylation is not likely to be essential for enzyme activity. However, autoglycosylation may play an important role in the regulation of enzyme activity or substrate specificity in vivo. We are presently carrying out a more detailed mutational analysis of OGT to identify residues required for catalytic activity and autoglycosylation. When the substrate Nup 62 is added as a substrate, it is quite efficiently recognized and modified by recombinant OGT with kinetic properties nearly identical to the native enzyme. The data we have presented strongly argue that the TPR domain is required for the interaction with protein substrates such as Nup 62. Although TPR motifs follow a general consensus sequence, the individual motifs in a domain are unique and may be involved in specific protein-protein interactions. In the case of Ssn6p, a TPR-containing protein responsible for glucose repression in yeast, only 4 of the 10 TPRs are essential and distinct subsets of TPR motifs have been shown to be responsible for repression of different classes of genes (24.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). TPRs 1–3 associate with the corepressor Tup1; TPRs 4–7 are involved in repression of oxygen-regulated genes; whereas TPRs 8–10 appear to be required for repression of glucose-regulated genes. Similarly in the case of the peroxisomal import protein PAS8p it appears that TPRs 1–3 specifically interact with the peroxisomal targeting signal (25.Terlecky S.R. Nuttley W.M. McCollum D. Sock E. Subramani S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3627-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Based on these precedents, we sought to identify those tetratricopeptide repeats important for substrate recognition. Our data suggest that optimal binding of Nup 62 and casein kinase II appears to require the intact TPR domain. Although the first 3 tetratricopeptide repeats are not absolutely necessary for glycosylation of Nup 62, they do appear to contribute to substrate recognition. In contrast the first three tetratricopeptide repeats are not required for glycosylation of the peptide YSDSPSTST and in fact may inhibit the access of the peptide to the catalytic site. Interestingly, removal of the first six tetratricopeptide repeats severely inhibits OGT glycosylation of exogenous substrates, yet this enzyme is still catalytically active and undergoes autoglycosylation more readily, suggesting that the first six tetratricopeptide repeats are not essential for catalysis. Taken together these data suggest that the TPR domain is important in substrate recognition, and it should be possible to alter OGT substrate specificity by interfering with TPR substrate binding. This could provide a useful means of selectively inhibiting glycosylation of specific substrates. Recombinant OGT was shown to specifically modify two purified recombinant kinases GSK-3 and casein kinase II, two enzymes critical in the regulation of glycogen synthesis. Other kinases in the insulin-signaling cascade such as protein kinase A, casein kinase I, mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2), and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II were not found to be substrates for OGT in vitro. OGT glycosylation of kinases such as GSK-3 and casein kinase II suggests a potential mechanism for cross-talk between glycosylation and the insulin-mediated phosphorylation cascade. Both of these kinases are involved in phosphorylating glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting step in glycogen synthesis. Casein kinase II was originally isolated as GSK-5, and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by GSK-3 requires prior phosphorylation by casein kinase II. GSK-3 has been shown to inhibit both glycogen synthase and insulin receptor substrate-2 (26.Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). OGT may also be directly implicated in glucose-induced insulin resistance mediated via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. It has been shown that hyperglycemia can lead to 2–4-fold increases in UDP-GlcNAc levels (27.Yki-Jarvinen H. Virkamaki A. Daniels M.C. McClain D. Gottschalk W.K. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 449-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28.Wang J. Liu R. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Rossetti L.

This is consistent with the K m of OGT being in the physiologic range and responding to dynamic changes in intracellular glucose. As expected therefore, the K m for the nucleocytoplasmic enzyme UDP-GlcNAc is similar to that found for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Glc transporters present in microsomal vesicles exposed to the cytoplasm (30.Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Thus, by responding to physiologic changes in cytoplasmic UDP-GlcNAc levels, OGT glycosylation of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins may act as an intracellular glucose sensor. Glycosylation of transcription factors, kinases, or vesicle-associated proteins in response to changes in intracellular glucose concentration would provide a potential mechanism for insulin resistance. During final revision of this manuscript, a report appeared describing the expression and characterization of OGT in baculovirus. In agreement with our findings, these authors present data suggesting that the C terminus is likely to contain a catalytic domain (31.Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Using synthetic peptides as substrates, they conclude that OGT has three distinct values for the K m of UDP-GlcNAc. Although use of synthetic peptide substrates may provide some useful information about binding at the catalytic site of OGT, it is doubtful that synthetic peptides with millimolar K m values are binding in the same manner as physiologic protein substrates like Nup 62 (K m = 1.2 μm). It is possible that larger protein substrates may interact with the TPR domain of OGT and then all potential glycosylation sites in close proximity to the C-terminal catalytic site would be glycosylated. This is similar to the mechanism for protein phosphorylation by certain kinases in which the docking site is important for specificity but does not undergo phosphorylation itself. In our studies, we chose to focus upon E. coli as an expression system after our original observation that proteins expressed in the baculovirus system are efficiently glycosylated by the endogenous insect OGT (32.Bailer S.M. Berlin W.K. Starr C.M. Starr Hanover J.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Expression of OGT in the baculovirus system can, therefore, produce mixed heteromers confounding the ability to accurately characterize the activity of homotrimers of the recombinant enzyme. Because E. coli lacks an endogenous activity, the expression system we have described should facilitate additional mutational analysis not possible in a system with high levels of endogenous activity. Expression in E. coli also allows for production of very large amounts of recombinant material required for solving the three-dimensional structure of OGT as well as subsequent structure-function studies. We are currently pursuing these studies."

The goal of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of CYP7A1transcription by bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in its native promoter and cellular context and to identify FXR response elements in the gene. In Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with retinoid X receptor α (RXRα)/FXR, only chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) were able to stimulate a heterologous promoter/reporter containing an ecdysone response element. In HepG2 cells, all bile acids (25 μm) were able to repressCYP7A1/luciferase reporter activity, and only CDCA and DCA further repressed reporter activity when cotransfected with RXRα/FXR. The concentration of CDCA required to inhibit 50% of reporter activity (IC50) was determined to be approximately 25 μm without FXR and 10 μm with FXR. Deletion analysis revealed that the bile acid response element located between nucleotides −148 and −128 was the FXR response element, but RXRα/FXR did not bind to this sequence. These results suggest that bile acid-activated FXR exerts its inhibitory effect onCYP7A1 transcription by an indirect mechanism, in contrast to the stimulation and binding of FXR to intestinal bile acid-binding protein gene promoter. Results also reveal that bile acid receptors other than FXR are present in HepG2 cells. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) transcription is repressed by bile acids.

The feedback repression ofCYP7A1 transcription by bile acids is an important physiological mechanism for maintaining bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis. Two bile acid response elements, BARE-I and BARE-II, have been identified previously (2.Chiang J.Y.L. Stroup D. J. Biol.

These DNA sequences contain AGGTCA direct repeats similar to the elements recognized by nuclear receptors, which regulate transcription of target genes in response to ligands such as steroids and thyroid hormones, retinoids, and fatty acids. A direct repeat separated by four nucleotides (DR4) in BARE-I region (nt −75 to −54) is bound by the oxysterol receptor LXR and by COUP-TFII, the activating ligand for which is unknown (4.Stroup D.

Although deletion of BARE-I did not affect bile acid responsiveness of theCYP7A1, deletion of the BARE-II (nt −149 to −118), which contains overlapping DR1 and DR5 motifs, abolished this response (3.Stroup D. Crestani M. Chiang J.Y.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G508-G517PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the nuclear receptor HNF4 and retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα)/retinoid acid receptor-α heterodimers, respectively, bind DR1 and DR5 elements in the rat CYP7A1promoter (5.Crestani M. Sadeghpour A. Stroup D. Gali G. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2192-2200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these results, we hypothesized that some nuclear receptors may respond to bile acids and repress CYP7A1expression (4.Stroup D. Crestani M. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Biol.

It was originally shown that the orphan nuclear receptor FXR, expressed only in the liver, gut, kidney, and adrenal cortex, activates transcription in response to micromolar amounts of farnesol and its metabolites (8.Seol W.

FXR is a member of nuclear receptors subfamily consisting of ecdysone receptor (EcR), vitamin D3 receptor, and liver orphan receptors (LXRα and -β), which are most closely related to FXR. It has been suggested that FXR is involved in the feedback control of isoprenoid synthesis and cell growth (11.Weinberger C. Trends Endocrinol.

The studies presented here attempted to dissect the mechanism of transcriptional repression of the CYP7A1 by the bile acid-activated FXR. Human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC HB8065) (Manassas, VA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.. Penicillin G/streptomycin and fetal bovine serum were from Celox (Hopkins, MN) and Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA), respectively. Bile acids and their conjugates were supplied by Sigma. Reporter lysis buffer and luciferase assay system were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCMVβ was from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The expression plasmid for rat FXR (pRSV-FXR) was obtained as described previously (9.Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.W. Weinberger C. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for human RXRα, pCMX-hRXRα, was a gift from Dr. R. Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Rat, human, and hamster CYP7A1/luciferase chimeric plasmids used were constructed as described previously (3.Stroup D. Crestani M. Chiang J.Y.L. Am. J.

HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (50:50) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown in 12-well plates to confluence in 3 to 4 days. DNA was transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method. The ratio of plasmid used was 2.5 μg of CYP7A1/luciferase reporter gene, 0.5 μg of pCMVβ as internal standard for transfection efficiency, and 0.5 μg of receptor expression plasmid. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of bile acids, the RXR-specific ligand LG100268 (100 nm, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, La Jolla, CA), or farnesol (50 μm). Cells were harvested 40 h after glycerol shock, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured by luminometer (Lumat model LB9501, Berthold System, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) and normalized by dividing the relative light units by β-galactosidase activity. Statistical analyses were performed using Sigma plot software. Each assay was done in triplicate, and individual experiments were repeated at least three times. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5000 units/ml penicillin, and 5000 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) in a water-jacketed incubator held at 37 °C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. An FXR-dependent transactivation assay was assembled in CHO K1 cells similar to that described in Forman et al. (9.Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J.

Cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates (Falcon) at 104 cells/well the day before transfection. Plasmids were introduced into cells by calcium phosphate transfection (19.Kitareewan S. Burka L.T.

Each well received 1.25 μg of ecdysone response element (EcRE)5-ΔMTV-CAT (5 copies of an ecdysone response element inserted in the MTV promoter upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene), 1.25 μg of pCH111 (SV40 early promoter linked to the β-galactosidase gene) to normalize CAT activity, and 0.25 μg each of expression plasmids for rat FXR and mouse RXRα. Plasmids were added to cells for 7 h and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Activators were added in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 5% charcoal-adsorbed fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C for 22 h. CAT and β-galactosidase activities were measured from cell lysates prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing (19.Kitareewan S. Burka L.T. Tomer K.B. Parker C.E. Deterding L.J. Stevens R.D.

Crestani M. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by filling in single-stranded 5′-overhangs with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and were purified through 15% polyacrylamide gels. RXRα and FXR were synthesized in vitro using TNT coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) programmed with the expression plasmids pCMX/RXRα and pcDNA3FXR, respectively. To test the ability of various bile acids and their taurine or glycineconjugates to activate FXR, transient transfection assay was employed. CHO cells were transfected with rat FXR and mouse RXRα using a reporter plasmid that contains five copies of an ecdysone response element fused to the upstream of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter/CAT reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 1, DCA (3α, 12α) and CDCA (3α, 7α) at 25 μm activated FXR by 13- and 17-fold, respectively. Glyco- and tauro- conjugates of DCA and CDCA were inactive, as were cholic acid (CA; 3α, 7α, 12α) and its taurine and glycine conjugates (TCA andGCA), taurolithocholic acid (TLCA, 3α), taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA, 3α, 6α), and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA; 3α, 7β) and its conjugate, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). These data are in agreement with those observed in CV-1 cells that hydrophobic bile acids (CDCA and DCA) are more active FXR ligands than hydrophilic bile acids (12.Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K.

The major hydrophilic bile acids in mice and rats, α- and β-muricholic acids (3α, 6β, 7α/β), were not able to activate FXR as described by other investigators (12.Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 13.Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V.

Hydrophobic bile acids are able to penetrate through cell membranes by simple diffusion, whereas sodium taurocholate cotransporter facilitates the transport of tauro conjugates into cells. The absence of a bile acid transporter in CHO cells may explain the inability of conjugated bile acids to induce FXR-dependent transcription. We reported previously that bile acids repressed CYP7A1/luc reporter activity in confluent cultures of HepG2 cells but had no effect on reporter activity in CHO or nonconfluent HepG2 cells (16.Crestani M. Stroup D. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2419-2432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the effect of FXR on liver-specific CYP7A1 transcription in its native cellular context by cotransfecting FXR and RXRα expression plasmids along with a rat CYP7A1/luciferase reporter plasmid into confluent cultures of HepG2 cells. RXRα/FXR heterodimer stimulated the reporter activity of the rat CYP7A1/luciferase plasmid (p-416/Luc) by 2-fold without bile acids (Fig.2). FXR or RXRα alone also stimulated reporter activity. Interestingly, the RXRα-selective ligand, LG100268, suppressed the reporter activities stimulated by RXRα/FXR or RXRα alone but not by FXR alone. Farnesol (50 μm), a weak activator of FXR, did not have any effect on the activity stimulated by these receptors. This is in agreement with other reports that farnesol was unable to activate FXR (13.Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 14.Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). These results suggested that RXRα/FXR was able to stimulate CYP7A1transcription without the addition of an exogenous FXR ligand. It is possible that the RXR-selective ligand could activate the RXRα homodimer or the RXRα/FXR heterodimer, both of which repressCYP7A1 transcription. We then studied the effect of CDCA on CYP7A1 transcription in HepG2 cells cotransfected with a rat CYP7A1/luciferase reporter (p-416/Luc) and RXRα/FXR expression plasmids. CDCA (25 μm) repressed rat reporter activity by 50% in HepG2 cells without overexpression of FXR (Fig.3 A). This indicates that either endogenous bile acid receptors were activated or other mechanisms, such as the protein kinase C pathway (20.Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Hylemon P.B. Paumgartner G. Stiehl A. Gerok W. Keppler D. Leuschner U. Bile Acids and Cholestasis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1995: 39-50Google Scholar), may be involved in repression of CYP7A transcription. When the reporter plasmids were cotransfected with RXRα/FXR, reporter activity was stimulated 100% without bile acids. CDCA repressed the FXR-stimulated activity by 80%. The addition of LG268 (0.1 μm) repressed CYP7A1 reporter activity by 70% (Fig.3 B). The combination of CDCA and LG268 further reduced reporter activity significantly (Fig. 3 B). It is clear that a bile acid and/or an RXR-selective ligand can activate RXRα/FXR heterodimer, which acts as a bile acid receptor and repressesCYP7A1 transcription. We reported previously that bile acid repression of CYP7A1 transcription was liver-specific because bile acids failed to repress the reporter activity in non-liver cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells (3.Stroup D. Crestani M. Chiang J.Y.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G508-G517PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we carried out the same experiments in CHO cells. The addition of 25 μm CDCA did not affect the reporter activity in confluent CHO cells, in contrast to HepG2 cells (Fig. 3 C). However, when CHO cells were transfected with RXRα/FXR, CDCA (25 μm) repressedCYP7A1 promoter activity by 50%. At higher concentrations, CDCA stimulated reporter activity independent of FXR (data not shown). These experiments clearly demonstrated that RXRα/FXR was required for mediating bile acid repression of CYP7A1 promoter activity by physiological concentration of CDCA when non-hepatocytes were used in the transfection assay. Thus endogenous bile acid receptors may be present in HepG2 cells for liver-specific repression ofCYP7A1 transcription. The ectopically expressed FXR can function as a bile acid receptor when activated by bile acids in both HepG2 and CHO cells. All bile acid and taurine conjugates tested in our transfected HepG2 cells (25 μm of CDCA, CA, DCA, and UDCA) had some repressive effects on rat CYP7A1 reporter activity (Fig. 4). In general, hydrophobic bile acids (CDCA and DCA) were more effective than hydrophilic bile acids (UDCA and CA) in repression of CYP7A1reporter activity. Only the inhibitory effects of CDCA and DCA were more pronounced when RXRα and FXR were overexpressed in HepG2 cells. Overexpression of a human liver bile acid transporter in HepG2 cells did not affect the repression of CYP7A/luciferase reporter activity by these bile acids and FXR (data not shown). The dose responses of CDCA on the inhibition of rat CYP7A1promoter activity were studied. The concentration of CDCA that required for inhibition of 50% (IC50) of promoter activity was estimated to be approximately 25 μm (Fig.5), consistent with that reported previously (12.Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 13.Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A.

When RXRα and FXR were cotransfected, the IC50 was estimated to be approximately 10 μm. To test the specificity of FXR in mediating bile acid response, we also did the same experiment with HNF4 and COUP-TFII. These two orphan receptors activated CYP7A1 gene, but overexpression of these two receptors in HepG2 cells did not enhance the CDCA response (data not shown). We have demonstrated previously that BARE-II located between nt −149 and −118 of the rat CYP7A1 promoter was a major bile acid response element. BARE-I, located between nt −75 and −54 only played a minor role in the bile acid response but could confer the bile acid repression to a heterologous promoter (2.Chiang J.Y.L. Stroup D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Stroup D. Crestani M. Chiang J.Y.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G508-G517PubMed Google Scholar). To map the FXR response element, we deleted nt from −74 to −54 in BARE-I or −148 to −128 in BARE-II or both sequences from wild type p-416/Luc plasmid and measured the inhibitory effects of CDCA and FXR on CYP7A1transcriptional activity. The reporter activity of the wild-type plasmid was stimulated by FXR and repressed by CDCA (Fig.6). Deletion of nucleotides from −74 to −54 in the rat CYP7A1/luc plasmid (p-416Δ BARE-I) greatly stimulated basal promoter activity as we reported previously (3.Stroup D. Crestani M. Chiang J.Y.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G508-G517PubMed Google Scholar). Cotransfection with RXRα and FXR did not stimulate basal promoter activity, but the bile acid repression was still observed (Fig. 6). These results suggested that the sequences from nt −74 to −54 conferred the stimulation by FXR in the absence of bile acids and confirmed that the deleted sequence is not important in mediating bile acid response with or without FXR. When a sequence from nt −148/−128 of BARE-II was deleted (p-416ΔBARE-II), CDCA still inhibited promoter activity. However, CDCA did not repress promoter activity when overexpressed with RXRα/FXR. When both BARE-I and BARE-II were deleted (p-416ΔBARE-I +II), similar results were obtained as with p-416ΔBARE-II. These experiments revealed that the FXR response element was localized in nucleotides −148 to −128 and also suggested that endogenous bile acid receptors in HepG2 cells were able to repressCYP7A1 transcription via sequences other than the region from −148 to −128. We next studied the effect of RXRα/FXR on human and hamster CYP7A1/luc reporter activity in HepG2 cells. Fig.7 shows that CDCA strongly repressed the reporter activities of two human constructs, ph-1887/Luc and ph-371/Luc and hamster p-1607/Luc, without cotransfection of RXRα/FXR. In contrast to their effect on rat reporter activity, cotransfection of RXRα/FXR reduced the basal promoter activity of both human and hamster reporter plasmids. Reporter activities of both the human and hamster CYP7A1/luc genes were inhibited 80% by CDCA-activated RXRα/FXR. We performed EMSA to study interaction of FXR with BARE-I and BARE-II sequences. As a positive control, in vitro synthesized RXRα/FXR heterodimer bound to an inverted repeat of AGGTCA with one-base spacing (IR1 of hsp27 EcRE). RXRα/FXR bound rather weakly to the BARE-I probe (nt −74/−53) (Fig. 8 A). FXR or RXRα alone did not bind to these probes. However, the BARE-II probe (nt −149/−118) did not bind to in vitro synthesized RXRα/FXR, despite that BARE-II was shown to be a FXR response element by transfection assays. Rat and rabbit were found to have identical sequences in the BARE-I region, whereas mouse and hamster have identical half-site sequences as the rat and rabbit except several nucleotides located between two half-sites. The human corresponding sequences do not have the DR4 motif because the absence of a G at the 3 position of the 5′ half-site TGGTCA (Fig. 8 B). The mouse and hamster sequences did bind FXR, but the corresponding human sequences did not. We have studied the effect of bile acid activated-FXR onCYP7A1 transcriptional regulation in HepG2 cells. Results from this study and others (12.Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol.

Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar) provide strong evidence that FXR is activated by bile acids and functions as a bile acid receptor to repress CYP7A1 transcription. These results support our receptor-mediated mechanism for bile acid feedback regulation ofCYP7A1 transcription. How does the bile acid activated-FXR regulate CYP7A1 transcription in hepatocytes is not known. Our data suggest that FXR confers its effects via CYP7A1 DNA sequences found between nucleotides −148 and −128. This sequence is completely conserved in all characterized CYP7A1 promoters, including those from human, rat, mouse, hamster, and rabbit (21.Crestani M. Galli G. Chiang J.Y.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, although FXR did not bind to this FXR response element, it did bind weakly to a DR4 motif in BARE-I. This may explain our finding that without bile acid activation, FXR binds and stimulates ratCYP7A1. Furthermore, we also showed that FXR strongly repressed human CYP7A1 without binding to the gene. Therefore, it appears that FXR does not have to bind to DNA to repressCYP7A1 transcription. It is also apparent that the DR4 motif in rat −74/−53 has a broad binding affinity to many orphan receptors including COUP-TFII, LXRα, and FXR. It is not likely that FXR competes with LXRα for CYP7A1 binding as suggested by Wanget al. (12.Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Neither FXR nor LXRα bind to the humanCYP7A1 promoter (22.Chen J. Cooper A.D. Levy-Wilson B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), yet CDCA-activated FXR strongly suppresses human CYP7A1 transcription. Our results showed that all bile acids and conjugates tested were able to inhibit CYP7A1 transcription in confluent HepG2 cells with or without cotransfection with FXR. In general, hydrophobic bile acids are more effective than hydrophilic bile acids in inhibition ofCYP7A1 transcription, consistent with in vitroand in vivo studies (1.Chiang J.Y.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 176-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 12.Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol.

Post S.M. Twisk J. Curr. Pharmaceut. Des. 1997; 3: 59-84Google Scholar). However, conjugated bile acids were not able to active FXR in CV-1 cells. When liver bile acid transporter was cotransfected in CV-1 cells, conjugated bile acids were able to activate FXR (12.Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). It is clear that the absence of conjugated bile acid transporters in non-liver cells explain the discrepancy. We observed that cotransfection of FXR was required for inhibition of CYP7A1 transcription by physiological concentration of CDCA in CHO cells, thus explaining our previous observation that bile acid inhibition was liver-specific. Furthermore, other liver-specific transcription factors are also required for FXR down-regulation of CYP7A1 transcription. CDCA was shown to be effective in both activation of FXR by transfection assays and enhancing of FXR interaction with steroid receptor coactivator-1 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay (14.Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism for FXR mediated down-regulation ofCYP7A1 transcription is that FXR may compete with other orphan receptors for the common partner, RXR, hence suppressing gene transcription without DNA binding (squelching effect). The BARE-II of the rat gene contains a DR5, which binds RXR/retinoid acid receptor-α (5.Crestani M. Sadeghpour A. Stroup D. Gali G. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2192-2200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, human and hamster CYP7A1 are not stimulated by retinoic acid because they lack a DR5 motif (18.DeFabiani E. Crestani M. Marrapodi M. Pinelli A. Chiang J.Y.L. Galli G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The corresponding sequence in the human gene instead binds CPF (26.Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and BTEB, a member of Sp1 family of transcription factors (27.Foti D. Stroup D. Chiang J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, FXR may interact with CPF or BTEB and prevent them from activating human CYP7A1 transcription. Another possibility is that FXR may compete with other nuclear receptors for limiting coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator-1. One candidate, HNF4, binds to the DR1 motif in BARE-II and plays a role in the transactivation ofCYP7A1 transcription (5.Crestani M. Sadeghpour A. Stroup D. Gali G. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2192-2200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, bile acid-activated FXR also can function as a positive transcription factor to stimulate the transcription of the ileal bile acid-binding protein gene (IBABP) (13.Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). Different mechanisms for the negative regulation of the CYP7A1 observed in the liver and positive regulation of the IBABP in the intestine may exist. It is possible that FXR binding to the IR1 motif inIBABP efficiently recruits coactivator, which stimulates gene transcription. The absence of an IR1 in CYP7A1 may preclude FXR from binding such that its negative regulation occurs by one of indirect mechanisms described above. We observed that FXR, RXRα, or RXRα/FXR stimulated the ratCYP7A1 transcription in the absence of ligand. This is not the case for human CYP7A1, which lacks the DR4 motif. Many orphan receptors such as LXRs are able to stimulate gene transcription without ligand binding (28.Peet D.J. Janowski B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Upon binding of RXR-selective ligand LG100268 to RXRα or CDCA to FXR, RXRα/FXR heterodimers interact with coactivators (12.Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Therefore, RXRα/FXR heterodimer is activated by the selective ligands of either receptors. Binding of both ligands further enhances receptor activity. This finding is interesting since LG268 was reported to activate some RXR heterodimers including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/RXRα and RXRα/LXRα (29.Mukherjee R. Davies P.J.A. Crombie D.L. Bischoff E.D. Cesario R.M. Jow L. Hamann L.G. Boehm M.F. Mondon C.E. Nadzan A.M. Paterniti J.R.J. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). We observed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/RXRα inhibited CYP7A1 reporter activity in HepG2 cells by interfering with HNF4 binding to the gene (30.Marrapodi M. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that there is a general mechanism for negative regulation of theCYP7A1 by these RXR heterodimers. It should be emphasized that the promoter context and liver-specific expression are important factors to be considered when dissectingCYP7A1 transcriptional control elements. Endogenous nuclear receptors are expressed at very low levels in HepG2 cells but may mask some of the results obtained by overexpressing FXR. Experiments performed in non-liver cells are often difficult to interpret because they lack liver-specific transcription factors responsible for regulating CYP7A1 transcription. Receptor activation and ligand binding assays are usually performed in non-liver cells (CV-1) using the reporter containing several copies of the cognate response element. These assays are useful for identification of ligands for orphan nuclear receptors, but it is necessary to verify these experiments in a liver cell line with a reporter containing the nativeCYP7A1 promoter. It is significant that our results suggest the presence of endogenous bile acid receptors in HepG2 cells. It is possible that a family of bile acid receptors may be present in the liver. The identification of FXR as a bile acid receptor is an important step toward the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of bile acid feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis. It also provides a strategy for screening cholesterol-lowering drugs targeted to genes in bile acid synthesis pathways. FXR antagonists should stimulate the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids by stimulating CYP7A1,CYP27A1, and CYP8B1 transcription and also reducing bile acid reabsorption by inhibiting IBABP gene expression (13.Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 31.Grober J. Zaghini I.

The consequences of NO exposure on cell viability were tested in RAW264.7 cells (a cell type with low non-heme iron levels) and hepatocytes (cells with high non-heme iron content). Whereas micromolar concentrations of the NO donorS-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine induced apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells, millimolar concentrations were required to induce necrosis in hepatocytes. Caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release were evident in RAW264.7 cells, but only cytochrome c release was detectable in hepatocytes following high doseS-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine exposure. Pretreating RAW264.7 cells with FeSO4increased intracellular non-heme iron to levels similar to those measured in hepatocytes and delayed NO-induced cell death, which then occurred in the absence of caspase-3 activation. Iron loading was also associated with the formation of intracellular dinitrosyl-iron complexes (DNIC) upon NO exposure. Cytosolic preparations containing DNIC as well as pure preparations of DNIC suppressed caspase activity.

The consequence of NO exposure on cells depends on a number of poorly characterized factors. Cell type certainly plays an important role. Macrophages, thymocytes, neuronal cells, pancreatic islets, and some tumor cells are very sensitive to NO and undergo apoptosis (1.Terenzi F. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Casado M. Hortelano S. Leoni S. Bosca L.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3120-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) are resistant to NO toxicity. Many cell types that are resistant to NO toxicity can even be protected from either type of death by physiologically relevant levels of NO. The level of NO exposure is another key factor in determining the effect of NO on cell viability. For example, low concentrations of NO prevent apoptosis in serum-starved PC12 cells while high concentrations lead to necrotic cell death (10.Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Kim S.S. Han J.A. Yoo Y.M. Kim K.M. Lee G.H. Yun H.Y. Green A. Li J. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6740-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As part of the study of the role of NO in apoptosis, an interesting relationship between NO and caspase activity has emerged. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play an essential role in the signaling cascade leading to apoptosis. Upon exposure to a proapoptotic signal, zymogen forms of caspases constitutively present in cells became proteolytically cleaved and activated. Initiator caspases such as caspase-8, -9, and -10 can cleave other caspases, while executioner caspases, including caspase-3, -6, and -7, cleave death substrates (11.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar,12.Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). By inhibiting caspase activity through theS-nitrosylation of the cysteine within the active site of the enzyme, NO inhibits apoptosis in hepatocytes (3.Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 4.Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31437-31441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). All caspases tested have been shown to be susceptible to reversible inhibition by NO through this redox modification (14.Li J. Billiar T.R. Talanian R.V. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). However, the observation that NO-mediated apoptosis in macrophages, thymocytes, and several tumor cells involves the activation of caspase (15.Messmer U.K. Reimer D.M. Brune B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 349: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and consequent caspase-dependent cell death has created an unexplained paradox. How can NO inhibit cell death by blocking caspase activity in some cells while inducing cell death through activation of caspases in others? We postulated that one explanation would come from understanding the chemical fate of NO in cells. In order for NO toS-nitrosylate proteins, it must give up an electron to favor the formation of a nitrosonium (NO+)-like species (16.Lipton S.A. Choi Y.B. Pan Z.H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.S. Sucher N.J. Loscalzo J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). Potential electron acceptors in cells include non-heme iron and oxygen (17.Vanin A.F. Malenkova I.V. Serezhenkov V.A. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 1997; 1: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 18.Miwa M. Stuehr D.J. Marletta M.A. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 955-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Oxygen availability should not differ in vitrobetween cells susceptible to NO-induced cell death and cells protected from cell death by NO. Because it has been shown that increased cellular non-heme iron levels protect cells from NO-induced cytotoxicity in cultured hepatocytes (19.Kim Y.M. Bergonia H. Lancaster Jr., J.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we focused our attention on the role of cellular non-heme iron content in NO cytotoxicity. We addressed this question using hepatocytes, a cell type protected from apoptosis by NO through the efficient S-nitrosylation of caspases (3.Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol.

Purified rat hepatocytes were isolated from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g; Harlan Sprague-Dawley) by a collagen perfusion method (21.Stadler J. Bergonia H.A. Di Silvio M. Sweetland M.A. Billiar T.R. Simmons R.L. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Highly purified hepatocytes (>98%) were obtained by repeated centrifugation at 400 × gfollowed by further purification over 30% Percoll. Hepatocytes with >95% viability by trypan blue exclusion were suspended in Williams' medium E supplemented with 1 μm insulin, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% low endotoxin calf serum. Cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes (5 ml/dish) and 12-well plates (1 ml/well) at a concentration of 1 × 106 and 2 × 105 cells/ml, respectively, and precultured in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 95% air) at 37 °C for 16 h. The RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was maintained with complete Williams' medium E containing 10% calf serum. RAW264.7 cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes or 12-well plates with a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and then incubated in a CO2 incubator for 8 h. For some experiments, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated in complete Williams' medium E containing 80 μm FeSO4 for 24 h, and then cells were washed with fresh medium. Cell cultures were treated with different concentrations of SNAP or 2,000 units/ml TNFα and 0.2 μg/ml ActD in some experiments. Cell viability was determined by the crystal violet staining method, as described previously (22.Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 30% ethanol and 3% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Plates were washed four times with tap water. After drying, cells were lysed with 1% SDS solution, and dye uptake was measured at 550 nm using a 96-well plate reader. Cell viability was calculated from relative dye intensity compared with untreated samples. Cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml chymostatin). Cytosolic fractions were prepared for cytochrome c release by homogenization and differential centrifugation, as described previously (11.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting analysis of caspase-3 and PARP by sonication and centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Proteins (20 μg) were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE for PARP and 14% SDS-PAGE for caspase and cytochrome c and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were hybridized with cytochrome c or caspase-3 antibody, and protein bands were visualized by exposing to x-ray film, as described previously (22.Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Cultured hepatocytes were washed with PBS, harvested using a plastic scraper, and pelleted by centrifugation at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 s at 4 °C. Fragmented cytosolic DNA was prepared by the method of Leist et al. (23.Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Tiegs G. Germann P.G. Wendel A. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1220-1234PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellets were resuspended in 740 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) and occasionally shaken while on ice for 40 min. The cytosolic fraction was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cytosol aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were extracted with a mixture of phenol and chloroform. One-tenth volume of 3m sodium acetate was added to the solution, and DNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. After storing at 20 °C overnight, a DNA pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and washed twice with 75% ethanol. The pellet was dried and resuspended in 80 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After digesting RNA with RNase (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 40 min, samples (15 μl) were electrophoresed through a 1.2% agarose gel in 450 mm Tris borate plus EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). DNA was photographed under visualization with UV light. Cell suspensions in 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) containing the protease inhibitor mixture were lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. The crude cytosol was obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Recombinant human caspase-3 (8 ng) was mixed with DNIC-containing cytosol (200 μg of protein) or chemically synthesized DNIC in Hepes buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, and the protease mixture in a final volume of 20 μl and incubated at room temperature. The caspase-3-like activity was measured by colorimetric assay using the peptide-based substrate Ac-DEVD-p-nitroanilide, as described previously (4.Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). For thein vitro cleavage assay of PARP and ICAD,35S-labeled PARP and ICAD were prepared by coupled in vitro transcription/translation with T7 polymerase and purified PARP or ICAD gene-containing plasmid in a reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). The labeled protein (6 μl) was mixed with the cytosolic fraction in a final volume of 18 μl in 100 mmHepes (pH 7.4). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and then mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-sample buffer. The cleaved products were separated on SDS-PAGE. After drying, the gel was exposed to x-ray film at room temperature. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured in culture medium. For total LDH activity, cell lysate was prepared from control cells in the culture by adding 1100volume of 10% Triton X-100 into the culture medium, incubating at room temperature for 15 min, and centrifuging at 80 × g for 10 min. All samples were dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C overnight. The LDH activity was measured by using an automated procedure on a Technitron RA-500 autoanalyzer. Total iron was determined using a colorimetric method after acid-permanganate treatment according to Fish (24.Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Heme iron was analyzed by the pyridine-chromogen method (25.Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Non-heme iron was calculated from the difference between total iron and heme iron. Using EPR spectroscopy, DNIC were detected in SNAP-treated cells. Cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in a small volume of PBS. Cell concentration was adjusted by measuring total protein using a Lowry protein assay kit (P5656; Sigma). An equal volume of cell suspension was placed in a sample tube and frozen in liquid nitrogen for EPR spectroscopy. Quantitative cellular DNIC were determined by the intensity of the EPR spectrum at g = 2.04 with the standard curve of chemically synthesized DNIC. EPR examination was performed at 77 K as described previously (26.Yee E.L. Pitt B.R. Billiar T.R. Kim Y.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L512-L518PubMed Google Scholar). ForS-nitrosothiol measurement, cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Cell extract was prepared by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. NO bound to thiols was displaced by the addition of HgCl2 to the cell lysates (4.Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Following NO displacement, protein was removed by centrifugation with a Centricon-3 concentrator (Amicon). Total S-nitrosothiols were calculated by measuring the difference in nitrite plus nitrate concentration before and after the addition of HgCl2. Nitrite plus nitrate was measured with an NO analyzer (NO-2000, Ki-Woo Biotech). Nitrite and nitrate were not detectable in cell lysates without HgCl2 addition. The cytosolic S-100 fraction and nuclei were isolated as described previously (4.Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 40 μl of S-100 (∼10 mg/ml), 10 μl of nuclei solution (∼1 × 106 nuclei), and 400 ng of rh-caspase-3 pretreated with DNIC in a final volume of 80 μl of reconstitution buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 4 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The combinations were incubated at 37 °C for 140 min and occasionally mixed. The reaction solution was then mixed with 500 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml of proteinase K) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The solution was extracted with phenol/chloroform. DNA isolation and electrophoresis were carried out as described previously (4.Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce). Data are presented as means ± S.D. of at least three separate experiments except where results of blots are shown, in which case a representative experiment is depicted in the figure. Comparisons between two values were analyzed using Student'st test. Differences were considered significant atp values ≤ 0.05. Cell types differ considerably in their sensitivity to the cytotoxic actions of NO, and in many instances exposure to high levels of NO is required for either apoptosis (15.Messmer U.K. Reimer D.M. Brune B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 349: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27.Albina J.E. Cui S. Mateo R.B. Reichner J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5080-5085PubMed Google Scholar) or necrosis (2.Okuno S. Shimizu S. Ito T. Nomura M. Hamada E. Tsujimoto Y. Matsuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34272-34277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Concentrations of NO generated by the inducible NO synthase inhibit apoptosis in hepatocytes (3.Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 4.Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar); however, it is unknown whether higher levels will lead to cell death. Isolated rat hepatocytes were treated with increasing concentrations of the NO donor SNAP for 24 h, and cell viability was measured. No change in cell viability was observed at SNAP concentrations up to 1 mm, but higher concentrations reduced cell viability, reaching 80% cytotoxicity at 4 mm SNAP (Fig. 1 A). Oxidized SNAP (4 mm) did not affect hepatocyte viability, confirming that the cytotoxic factor released from the donor was NO. This cell death was not accompanied by DNA fragmentation (Fig.1 B); however, a known inducer of apoptosis, TNFα plus ActD (TNFα/ActD), resulted in hepatocyte death (Fig. 1, B andC) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 D). Medium levels of LDH were measured as a marker of cell lysis and necrosis. SNAP concentrations that caused cell death significantly increased LDH activity in culture medium in a dose-dependent manner, while TNFα/ActD resulted in much lower LDH release (Fig.1 E) associated with greater cell death (Fig. 1, Band C). These results indicate that levels of NO generated by millimolar concentrations of an NO donor induce necrosis, not apoptosis, in cultured rat hepatocytes. Similar studies were carried out in the macrophage cell line RAW264.7, a cell type known to be more sensitive to NO-induced toxicity. The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of SNAP for 18 h. Concentrations of SNAP between 0.5 and 1.25 mm were associated with cell death (Fig.2 A) accompanied by DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 2 B). Oxidized SNAP (1 mm) did not cause cell death or DNA fragmentation. Caspase-3-like activity is known to increase in apoptotic hepatocytes (4.Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). No increase in caspase-3-like activity was observed in SNAP-treated hepatocytes. Interestingly, high concentrations of SNAP reduced the basal activities even lower, and this was reversed by incubating the cytosol with 5 mm DTT for 20 min, suggesting that the caspase was S-nitrosylated following NO exposure (Fig.3 A). As expected, cytosol from hepatocytes treated with TNFα/ActD had increased caspase-3-like activity at 8 h, but DTT had no effect on activity (Fig.3 B). Consistent with the observations on caspase-3 activity, PARP, a well known caspase-3 substrate, was cleaved into 85-kDa fragments in the cells as well as by the cytosol from TNFα/ActD-treated hepatocytes (Fig. 3, C andD), but not in SNAP-treated cells. Furthermore, the active 17-kDa fragment of caspase-3 was identified only in the TNFα/ActD-treated cells (Fig. 3 E). Another cellular event associated with cell death is the release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria. Therefore, we next examined whether mitochondrial cytochrome c was released into cytosol using Western blot analysis. Treatment with 2 mm SNAP or TNFα/ActD both resulted in cytochrome c release into cytosol (Fig.3 F). We next determined if the NO-induced apoptotic cell death observed in RAW264.7 cells was associated with caspase-3 activation. Fig. 4 A shows that SNAP increased caspase-3-like activity in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation of the cytosol with DTT caused only small increases in activity, indicating that caspases were notS-nitrosylated. PARP was cleaved in SNAP-treated RAW264.7 cells as well as by the cytosol from these cells (Fig. 4, Band C). Western blot analysis confirmed the appearance of the active fragment (p17) of caspase-3 only in the SNAP-treated cells (Fig. 4 D). Caspase-3 activation occurred in association with mitochondrial cytochrome c release into cytosol (Fig.4 E). Thus, in clear distinction from necrotic death observed in hepatocytes, where caspases are not activated but cytochromec is released, NO induces both caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release in apoptotic RAW264.7 cells. The inhibition of caspase activity by the peptide-based caspase-3-like inhibitor Ac-DEVD-cho protects cells from caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death (4.Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 28.Milligan C.E. Prevette D. Yaginuma H. Homma S. Cardwell C. Fritz L.C. Tomaselli K.J. Oppenheim R.W. Schwartz L.M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 385-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The treatment of hepatocytes with Ac-DEVD-cho did not prevent cell death induced by 2 mm SNAP; however, removal of NO using a known NO scavenger, red blood cells (RBC; 4 mm of hemoglobin), did prevent cell death (Fig.5 A). As expected, hepatocyte apoptosis induced by TNFα/ActD was completely inhibited by Ac-DEVD-cho (Fig. 5 A). Ac-DEVD-cho also completely inhibited caspase-3-like activity (Fig. 5 B) and DNA fragmentation in TNFα/ActD-treated hepatocytes (Fig. 5 C). In RAW264.7 cells, Ac-DEVD-cho partially inhibited SNAP-induced RAW264.7 cell death, while NO-scavenging RBC completely inhibited SNAP-induced cell death (Fig. 6 A). Both Ac-DEVD-cho and RBC prevented the increase in caspase-3-like activity (Fig. 6 B) and completely inhibited SNAP-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6 C). These data confirm the finding that NO induces necrosis in hepatocytes and indicates that the cell death in RAW264.7 cells most likely is a combination of apoptosis and necrosis.Figure 6Effects of caspase inhibitor on cell viability, caspase-3-like activity, and DNA fragmentation in SNAP-treated RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells were treated with 1 mm SNAP in the presence or absence of Ac-DEVD-cho (280 μm) or RBC (2 mm hemoglobin). Cell viability (A), caspase-3-like activity (B), and DNA fragmentation (C) were measured by the same methods as described in Figs. 1 and 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Hepatocytes are iron-rich compared with RAW264.7 cells, and it is known that NO readily reacts with non-heme iron to form iron-nitrosyl complexes (21.Stadler J.

To determine if iron content accounted for the difference in NO sensitivity between hepatocytes and the macrophage cell line, we preloaded RAW264.7 cells with iron. Preincubation of RAW264.7 cells with 80 μm FeSO4 for 24 h increased intracellular non-heme iron to a level comparable with hepatocytes but had no effect on the level of heme iron (Fig.7 A).

We have observed that these receptors differ substantially in their membrane trafficking after endocytosis. B2AR expressed in stably transfected HEK293 cells exhibits negligible (<10%) down-regulation after continuous incubation of cells with agonist for 3 h, as assessed both by radioligand binding (to detect functional receptors) and immunoblotting (to detect total receptor protein). In contrast, DOR exhibits substantial (≥50%) agonist-induced down-regulation when examined by similar means. Degradation of internalized DOR is sensitive to inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis. Flow cytometric and surface biotinylation assays indicate that differential sorting of B2AR and DOR between distinct recycling and non-recycling pathways (respectively) can be detected within ∼10 min after endocytosis, significantly before the onset of detectable proteolytic degradation of receptors (∼60 min after endocytosis). Studies using pulsatile application of agonist suggest that after this sorting event occurs, later steps of membrane transport leading to lysosomal degradation of receptors do not require the continued presence of agonist in the culture medium. These observations establish that distinct GPCRs differ significantly in endocytic membrane trafficking after internalization by the same membrane mechanism, and they suggest a mechanism by which brief application of agonist can induce substantial down-regulation of receptors.

Endocytosis of receptors is a process that can contribute to functional resensitization of signal transduction by promoting dephosphorylation and recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane (1.Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2.Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Endocytosis also contributes to down-regulation of receptors, a process that leads to functional desensitization of signal transduction by reducing the number of receptors present in the plasma membrane and promoting degradation of receptors in lysosomes (3.Kallal L.

These processes of receptor regulation are thought to involve membrane trafficking of receptors via distinct recycling or degradative pathways and can mediate opposite effects on the regulation of functional signal transduction (1.Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2.Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv.

Consequently, understanding mechanisms that direct GPCRs to distinct membrane pathways is of fundamental physiological importance. Although a great deal has been learned about the mechanism mediating the initial endocytosis of certain GPCRs from the plasma membrane, relatively little is known about mechanisms that determine the specificity of GPCR trafficking after endocytosis. Sequestration and down-regulation of the B2AR are differentially affected by pharmacological manipulations and selectively perturbed by receptor mutation, suggesting that these processes are mediated by separate endocytic mechanisms (8.Campbell P.T.

Indeed, previous studies provide evidence for endocytosis of receptors by various membrane structures, including clathrin-coated pits (11.Goodman O.J. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B.

However, the ability of dominant-negative mutant dynamin to inhibit down-regulation of the B2AR suggests that the endocytic pathway mediating rapid internalization and recycling of receptors may also contribute to a slower process of receptor down-regulation (15.Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that structurally distinct GPCRs can differ significantly in their endocytic trafficking. For example, substance P and thrombin receptors are differentially targeted to distinct recycling and degradative pathways, respectively (16.Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17.Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol.

However, in this case it is not known whether these GPCRs are endocytosed by the same or different membrane mechanism(s). Indeed, structurally homologous receptors can be endocytosed by distinguishable membrane mechanisms (18.Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus fundamental questions remain about the relationship between the membrane pathways that target GPCRs to distinct recycling or degradative fates. First, in addition to its role in degradation of a limited fraction of receptors, can rapid endocytosis of GPCRs via clathrin-coated pits serve as a major pathway targeting certain GPCRs to lysosomes? Second, if this is true, are distinct GPCRs sorted to different membrane pathways after endocytosis by the same endocytic vesicles? Third, does lysosomal degradation of internalized receptors require the continued presence of agonist in the culture medium? We have addressed these questions by comparing the endocytic membrane trafficking of epitope-tagged B2AR and δ-opioid receptors (DOR). Both of these receptors undergo rapid, agonist-induced endocytosis by a conserved, β-arrestin and dynamin-dependent mechanism mediated by clathrin-coated pits (11.Goodman O.J. Krupnick J.G.

Here we demonstrate that, despite the similarity in their mechanism of endocytosis, B2AR and DOR differ significantly in membrane trafficking after internalization.

Stably transfected cells were selected in 500 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and clones expressing similar numbers of FLAG-tagged B2AR (B2AR 3) or FLAG-tagged DOR (DOR 5) were identified by fluorescence flow cytometry (23.Keith D.E.

B2AR 3 expressed the FLAG-tagged B2AR at 2.3 pmol/mg protein, as estimated by radioligand binding using [3H]dihydroalprenolol. DOR 5 expressed FLAG-tagged DOR at 0.8 pmol/mg protein, as estimated by radioligand binding using [3H]diprenorphine (see below for methods). A stably transfected clone of HEK293 cells expressing both the FLAG-tagged B2AR and HA-tagged DOR (B2DOR 1) was generated by cotransfecting cells with both constructs and selecting as above for expression of both receptors. These cells express FLAG-tagged B2AR at 0.7 pmol/mg and HA-tagged DOR at 0.2 pmol/mg. Cell monolayers were lifted with PBS supplemented with 2 mm EDTA, washed twice with PBS by centrifugation (200 × g for 5 min), and lysed in 10 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by four passes using a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Large particulates and nuclear material were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and a crude membrane and cytosol fraction was isolated. Binding assays were conducted in 120 μl of 25 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Assay tubes contained 50–100 μg of the crude membrane preparation (determined by the method of Bradford et al. (33.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) using reagents from Bio-Rad) and 2 nm [3H]diprenorphine (opioid binding) or 10 nm [3H]alprenolol (adrenergic binding) and were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Incubations were terminated by vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters (Packard Instruments) and repeated washes with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Scintiverse, Fisher) using a Beckman LS 6500 instrument. Bound counts represented ≤10% of input radioligand. Nonspecific binding, defined by assays conducted in the presence of 10 μm naloxone (opioid binding) or alprenolol (adrenergic binding), was ≤10% of total counts isolated on filters. All assays were conducted in triplicate with similar results. Results are expressed as mean picomoles of radioligand specifically bound per mg of crude membrane preparation assayed. Agonist-induced down-regulation of receptors was assayed in intact cells using a previously described method (34.Law P.-Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 72: 1-4Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers of cells expressing FLAG-tagged B2AR (B2AR 3) or DOR (DOR 5) were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μm isoproterenol or 10 μm DADLE (Research Biochemicals), respectively. To ensure a saturating concentration of peptide agonist over the incubation period, monolayers incubated with DADLE were supplemented with fresh peptide every hour during the incubation. At the end of the incubation, cells were lifted with PBS supplemented with EDTA and washed four times by centrifugation with 10 ml of warm (37 °C) PBS. Then cells were washed once by centrifugation in 10 ml of Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (KHRB: 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 25 mm glucose, 55 mm sucrose, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.3). Radioligand binding was carried out in 120 μl of KHRB containing equal amounts of washed cells (50–100 μg of protein) and ligand concentrations as above. Incubations were carried out for 30 min at room temperature, and cells were harvested and washed using vacuum filtration on glass fiber filters as above. For all determinations, bound radioligand represented ≤10% of total radioligand present in the incubation, and nonspecific binding (defined as above) was ≤10% of counts isolated on glass fiber filters. Monolayers of cells expressing FLAG-tagged B2AR (B2AR 3) or DOR (DOR 5) were incubated in the absence or presence of the appropriate agonist (as indicated in the text). For experiments using inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis, monolayers were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 μg/μl leupeptin (Calbiochem), 200 μm chloroquine (Sigma), or 50 mm ammonium chloride (Sigma) before agonist addition, and these reagents were present in the medium during agonist incubation. Equal amounts of cell lysate (prepared by extracting monolayers with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma)) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted for FLAG-tagged receptor using M1 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by detection using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblots were quantitated by densitometric scanning of films exposed in the linear range. Proteolytic degradation of surface-biotinylated receptors was estimated using a previously described protocol (20.Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected cells expressing FLAG-tagged B2AR or DOR were surface-biotinylated by incubation at 4 °C with 30 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce), rinsed with Tris-buffered saline to quench the biotinylation reaction, warmed to 37 °C, and incubated under various conditions as described in the text, and then chilled on ice to stop further membrane trafficking. Cells were extracted and receptor immunoprecipitates were prepared, and biotinylated receptor protein recovered in immunoprecipitates was detected by streptavidin overlay. Enzymatic deglycosylation was performed by incubating receptor immunoprecipitates in the presence of PNGase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 60 min at 37 °C. Receptor degradation was indicated by a loss of biotinylated protein recovered in immunoprecipitates and was quantitated by densitometric scanning of streptavidin overlays exposed in the linear range. Samples representing equal numbers of cells were loaded in each lane. Recycling of epitope-tagged receptors back to the plasma membrane was estimated by assaying the recovery of immunoreactive receptors accessible at the cell surface to monoclonal antibody recognizing the extracellular epitope tag. This assay is a variant of a previously described flow cytometric assay for estimating receptor internalization (35.Cao T.C. Mays R.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24592-24602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell monolayers expressing FLAG-tagged B2AR or DOR were incubated in the presence of 10 μm of the appropriate agonist (isoproterenol or etorphine, respectively) for 30 min at 37 °C to drive agonist-induced internalization to steady-state levels (23.Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 29.von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), then rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and subsequently incubated at 37 °C in the presence of the appropriate antagonist (10 μm alprenolol or naloxone (Research Biochemicals)) to block additional endocytosis of receptors. At the indicated time points, monolayers were chilled on ice to stop membrane trafficking, and cells were lifted with a protease-free Cell Dissociation Buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Resuspended cells were then incubated at 4 °C for 60 min in the presence of 10 μg/ml M1 anti-FLAG antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) that had been conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes) using standard methods, and receptor immunoreactivity was quantitated by fluorescence flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, CA). Fluorescence intensity of 10,000 cells was collected for each sample. Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson) was used to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity of single cells in each population. All experiments were conducted ≥3 times with similar results. The mean values for each experiment were averaged to obtain the overall mean fluorescence intensity and S.E. reported in the figure. Recycling of antibody-labeled receptors from the endocytic pathway was estimated using an alternate flow cytometric assay. FLAG-tagged B2AR present in the plasma membrane of stably transfected cells were specifically labeled with fluorescein-conjugated M1 anti-FLAG antibody (5 μg/ml), which binds the FLAG epitope in a calcium-dependent manner. Cell monolayers were incubated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min at 37 °C to stimulate receptor internalization and then rinsed three times with calcium, magnesium-free PBS supplemented with 0.4% EDTA in order to elute antibody bound to residual receptors remaining in the plasma membrane and selectively label endocytosed receptors. At this point, different protocols were followed to measure recycling under different conditions. To measure recycling in the presence of antagonist, samples were incubated at 37 °C in DMEM in the presence of 10 μm alprenolol (to block additional endocytosis) and then chilled at the indicated time point to stop membrane trafficking. Cells were again rinsed three times at 4 °C with EDTA-supplemented PBS to elute antibody from antibody-labeled receptors that recycled to the cell surface during the incubation with antagonist. To measure recycling in the presence of agonist, samples were incubated at 37 °C in EDTA-supplemented PBS containing 10 μm isoproterenol. Under these conditions, antibody bound to receptors that recycle back to the plasma membrane was immediately eluted and was therefore not re-endocytosed in the presence of isoproterenol. Control experiments indicated that >95% of surface receptors were eluted within 1 min under these conditions. At the indicated time point, monolayers were again chilled to 4 °C, lifted, washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry (as above) to detect antibody bound to internalized receptors remaining within the cell. Receptor recycling was measured biochemically by the loss of internalized receptor protein specifically labeled with disulfide-linked (cleavable) biotin. The assay is a variant of a previously described method using cleavable biotin to detect internalization (35.Cao T.C. Mays R.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24592-24602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected cells expressing B2AR or DOR were surface-biotinylated with 30 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-S-S biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C and quenched by three washes with ice-cold TBS. At this point, samples were saved on ice to measure total surface-biotinylated receptor. The remaining samples were incubated with media containing the appropriate agonist (10 μmisoproterenol or etorphine) for either 30 or 10 min and then immediately chilled on ice to stop internalization. Samples used to measure internalization of receptor at this time point were set aside at 4 °C. Samples used to assay recycling were rinsed with PBS to remove residual agonist, rewarmed to 37 °C for 30 min in media containing the appropriate antagonist (10 μm alprenolol or naloxone), and then chilled to 4 °C to stop membrane trafficking. In order to estimate the amount of residual biotinylated receptor remaining in the endocytic pathway, monolayers were treated for 15 min at 4 °C with glutathione strip solution (50 mmglutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, 10% fetal bovine serum in water) to cleave biotin groups from receptors accessible at the cell surface. Cells were then washed for 20 min at 4 °C with iodoacetamide buffer (50 mm iodoacetamide, 1% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4) to quench residual glutathione, extracted, immunoprecipitated, and processed for streptavidin overlay. Colocalization of FLAG-tagged B2AR and HA-tagged DOR expressed in a single cell line was examined using a modification of a previously described protocol for dual fluorescence immunohistochemical staining (20.Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on glass coverslips (Corning) were treated with 10 μm isoproterenol and 10 μm etorphine (Research Biochemicals) for 60 min, washed, fixed with a 4% formaldehyde solution in PBS, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in Blotto (3% dry milk in TBS + 1 mm CaCl2). Specimens were incubated with anti-FLAG M1 antibody (IgG2b, 5 μg/ml) and mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA.11, IgG1, 5 μg/ml, Berkeley Antibody Co.) for 30 min, washed, incubated with subtype-specific rabbit anti-mouse IgG2b antibody (0.5 μg/ml, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) to label the M1 antibody, washed again, and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Blotto. Finally, the B2AR (labeled with M1 monoclonal and rabbit anti-mouse IgG2b) and the DOR (labeled with anti-HA mouse monoclonal) were visualized by incubating with Texas Red donkey anti-rabbit (5 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and fluorescein isothiocyanate subtype-specific anti-mouse IgG1 (2 μg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Stained specimens were examined by conventional epifluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a 60× NA1.4 objective and standard fluorescein/Texas Red dichroic filter sets. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC1000 confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss 100× NA1.3 objective. Negligible bleed through was confirmed in dual labeling experiments by imaging single-labeled control specimens. The estimated depth of optical sections under the confocal imaging conditions used was 0.5–1 μm. An immunocytochemical “pulse-chase” assay was developed to estimate the degree to which a “pulse” of internalized B2AR or DOR was accessible to a subsequent “chase” of endocytosed transferrin. Briefly, stably transfected cells expressing either FLAG-tagged B2AR or DOR (grown on glass coverslips) were preincubated at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM; receptors were surface-labeled with 5 μg/ml M1 antibody, and cells were incubated with 10 μmisoproterenol or etorphine for 30 min to drive endocytosis of antibody-labeled receptors. Next, cells were chilled on ice, rinsed with EDTA-supplemented PBS to elute antibody bound to residual receptors remaining in the plasma membrane, rewarmed to 37 °C for 15 min in serum-free media lacking agonist but containing Texas Red-conjugated diferric transferrin (50 μg/ml, Molecular Probes), and coverslips fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in Blotto (3% dry milk in TBS + 1 mm CaCl2), and antibody-labeled B2AR or DOR was detected using fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (2 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Dual-label fluorescence microscopy was performed as described above. As an initial step toward comparing the effects of agonist on numbers of B2AR and DOR present in cells, we used an established radioligand binding assay (34.Law P.-Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 72: 1-4Google Scholar) to measure down-regulation of receptor binding activity following incubation of cells in the presence of agonist for 3 h. This time point was chosen because, whereas both B2AR and DOR have been previously shown to undergo substantial down-regulation after incubation of cells for 18–24 h in the continuous presence of agonist, down-regulation has also been observed for certain GPCRs at much shorter times (e.g. Refs. 5.Hoxie J.A.

Previous work has shown that this enzyme utilizes NADPH, shows a marked preference for all-trans-retinal over 11-cis-retinal, and is tightly associated with the outer segment membrane. This paper reports the identification of a novel member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, photoreceptor RDH (prRDH), using subtraction and normalization of retina cDNA, high throughput sequencing, and data base homology searches to detect retina-specific genes.

The enzymatic properties of recombinant bovine prRDH closely match those previously reported for RDH activity in crude bovine rod outer segment preparations. In situ hybridization and RNA blotting show that the PRRDH gene is expressed specifically in photoreceptor cells, and protein blotting and immunocytochemistry show that prRDH localizes exclusively to both rod and cone outer segments and that prRDH is tightly associated with outer segment membranes.

Photoisomerization of the chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans is the initiating event in vision, inducing a conformational change in the attached protein that renders it competent to activate a photoreceptor-specific G-protein. Visual pigment activation and inactivation occur on time scales of hundreds of microseconds and hundreds of milliseconds, respectively (1.Baylor D.A. Lamb T.D. Yau K.-W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 288: 589-611Google Scholar). Regeneration of the visual pigment requires release of all-trans-retinal and binding of a new molecule of 11-cis-retinal, a process that occurs on a time scale of minutes (2.Dowling J.E. Nature. 1960; 188: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3.Alpern M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1971; 217: 447-471Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 4.Zimmerman W.H. Yost M.T.

Vision Res. 1998; 38: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Photobleaching of visual pigments was discovered by Kuhne (6.Kuhne W. On the Photochemistry of the Retina and on Visual Purple. Macmillan Press Ltd., London1878Google Scholar), who observed that light-exposed rhodopsin undergoes a rapid conversion from pink to yellow followed by a slow conversion to a colorless, UV-absorbing product. Wald and Hubbard (7.Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1935; 19: 351-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8.Wald G. Hubbard R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1949; 32: 367-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the yellow product of visual pigment bleaching is all-trans-retinal that is subsequently reduced enzymatically to the colorless product, all-trans-retinol. Kuhne (6.Kuhne W. On the Photochemistry of the Retina and on Visual Purple. Macmillan Press Ltd., London1878Google Scholar) made the further observation that efficient visual pigment regeneration requires close apposition of the neural retina and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).1 This requirement is now known to reflect an obligatory movement of all-trans-retinol from the rod outer segment (ROS) to the RPE, followed by isomerization from the all-trans-to the 11-cis-configuration, oxidation of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal, and a return of 11-cis-retinal from the RPE to the outer segment (Fig.1; Refs. 2.Dowling J.E.

The joining of 11-cis-retinal and opsin regenerates the visual pigment and completes the cycle of events, which together are referred to as the visual cycle. The rate-limiting step in the visual cycle at high light levels appears to be the conversion of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol within the outer segment (4.Zimmerman W.H. Yost M.T. Daemen F.J.M. Nature. 1974; 250: 66-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5.Saari J.C. Garwin G.G. Van Hooser J.P. Palczewski K. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although the chemical transformations that comprise the visual cycle are understood in outline, many of the relevant proteins remain poorly characterized, and several were unknown until recently. Within the outer segment, recent work (12.Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13.Weng J. Mata N.L.

Mutations in ABCR are responsible for autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (14.Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H. Shroyer N.F. Hutchinson A. Chidambaram A. Gerrard B. Baird L. Stauffer D. Peiffer A.

Mutations in ABCR may also represent a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (19.Allikmets R. Shroyer N.F. Singh N. Seddon J.M. Lewis R.A. Bernstein P. Peiffer A. Zabriskie N. Li Y.

Retinol dehydrogenase (RDH), the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol (by convention named for the reverse reaction), was the first visual cycle enzyme to be identified (8.Wald G.

In this paper we report the amino acid sequence of bovine and human photoreceptor RDH (prRDH) as deduced from cDNA and genomic DNA sequences, the exclusive localization of prRDH to rod and cone outer segments, and the enzymatic properties of recombinant prRDH produced in transfected mammalian cells. 11-cis-Retinal was a gift from Hoffmann-La Roche; other reagents used in the RDH assays were obtained from Sigma. Retinoids were stored under argon in the dark at −80 °C, and their integrity was monitored by examining an absorbance spectrum prior to each experiment. Total RNA was isolated from bovine retina and frontal cortex using the guanidinium-phenol method (27.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by oligo(dT) chromatography (FastTrak II; Invitrogen), and 2 μg each of bovine retina and frontal cortex poly(A)+ RNA was used for first strand cDNA synthesis with 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase and 200 units of Superscript II (Life Sciences). Subtraction and normalization were performed using bovine retina cDNA as tester and bovine frontal cortex cDNA as driver as described ((28) PCR-Select kit; CLONTECH) with minor modifications to the published protocol. In brief, the retina cDNA was divided into two portions and ligated to two different adapters that were modified to encode an EcoRI restriction site 5′-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGCCGCCCGAATTCGT and 5′-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAGCGTGGTCGCGGAATTCGT. Ligation efficiency was assessed by PCR of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sequences using primers 5′-ACCACTGTCCACGCCATCAC and 5′-AGTGGTCGTTGAGGGCAATG that amplify a segment of the bovine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sequence that lacks anRsaI site. The two portions of retina cDNA were denatured and annealed in the presence of 20-fold excess driver cDNA and 20% PEG 8000. In a second cycle of annealing the two primary hybridization samples were mixed without denaturing, and a 20-fold excess of freshly denatured driver cDNA was added. After the second round of annealing, those double-stranded retina cDNA segments that were flanked by two different adapters were amplified in two rounds of PCR (Advantage cDNA PCR;CLONTECH), digested with EcoRI, size-selected for fragments greater than 300 bp by agarose gel electrophoresis, and cloned into the EcoRI site of λgt10. To identify and eliminate abundant cDNA clones, the cDNA library was plated at a density of 300 plaques per 10-cm plate, and nitrocellulose filter replicas were prepared and hybridized under standard conditions with a probe prepared from the subtracted and normalized retina cDNA. Approximately 50% of the clones showed little or no hybridization, and 1000 of these were individually picked into 96-well trays in ∼200 μl of lambda dilution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgSO4). Five microliters of the phage eluate was used for insert amplification in a 30-μl PCR with λgt10-specific primers 5′-CTTTTGAGCAAGTTCAGCCTGGTTAAGT and 5′-GAGGTGGCTTATGAGTATTTCTTCCAGGGTAA. Twenty microliters of each PCR product was incubated with 5 μl of 7.5 m ammonium acetate containing 0.4 mg/ml yeast tRNA and 25 μl of isopropyl alcohol for 30 min on a shaker platform followed by a 30-min centrifugation at 2,000 × g at 4 °C. The precipitated PCR products were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 20 μl of 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA and analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Approximately 90% of the PCR showed single inserts, and these were subjected to automated sequence analysis. Sequences were compared with the GenBankTM nonredundant data base using the BLASTN and BLASTX programs and to the GenBankTM EST data base using the BLASTN program. Multiple independent cDNAs encoding bovine and human prRDH were isolated by DNA hybridization to oligo(dT)-primed cDNA libraries from adult human retina (29.Nathans J. Thomas D. Hogness D.S. Science. 1986; 232: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar) and adult bovine retina. The bovine retina cDNA library was prepared in λZAP Express (Stratagene) from poly(A)+RNA. The central 95% of the coding region of mouse prRDH was amplified by PCR from a mouse eye cDNA library (30.Sun H. Macke J.P. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8860-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) using primers based on the bovine prRDH sequence. The cloned murine prRDH PCR product was used for Northern blot and in situ hybridization. The humanPRRDH gene was isolated from a Sau3AI partial-digest human genomic library in λEMBL3 (a gift of Y. Wang) by hybridization with a human prRDH cDNA probe. The complete sequence of the bovine prRDH coding region was deduced from the sequences of three independent cDNA clones. The sequence of the human prRDH coding region was deduced from two independent cDNA clones and from sequencing the six exons from cloned genomic DNA. Chromosome mapping of human prRDH was performed using the GeneBridge 4 and Stanford TNG radiation hybrid panels (Research Genetics). The GeneBridge 4 panel was screened by PCR with a primer pair from the 3′-noncoding sequences of human prRDH that produce a 147-bp fragment (forward primer, 5′-AACAACCAGACCTCTTCATTCCAC; reverse primer, 5′-CAGAGGAGTCTATGCCTGAAAATAAAG). Statistical analysis using RHMAPPER localized the PRRDH gene between marker WI-8049 and marker WI-7557 at a distance of 3.05 centiRay3,000 from the latter, but with a less-than-significant log-of-the-odds score of 0.54. The Stanford TNG panel was screened by PCR with a primer pair from intronic sequences flanking human prRDH exon 5 that produce a 275-bp fragment (forward primer, 5′-GAGTGGTTGGGGCATCAGACTTACT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCAACATACCTGAGCCACGTCTTGG-3′). Statistical analysis using the Stanford Genome Center Radiation Hybrid server localized prRDH near marker SHGC-15369 on chromosome 19 with a log-of-the-odds score of 5.66 at a distance of 33 centiRay10,000. SHGC-15369 is not ordered on the chromosome map, but it is linked to marker WI-7557, the human gene for DNA cytosine-(5)-methyltransferase (GenBankTM accession number X63692) on chromosome 19p13.3–13.2. (Genome Data Base locus D19S830). To verify further the chromosomal location of prRDH, a fragment from the 3′-untranslated region of human prRDH cDNA was used to probe a genomic Southern blot from a somatic cell hybrid panel (Oncor). This analysis assigned prRDH to either chromosome 1 or chromosome 19. RNA was isolated from adult rat or bovine tissues using the guanidinium thiocyanate method (27.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). For rapid screening of the tissue specificity of bovine EST clones, RNA dot blots were prepared with total RNA from retina, heart, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, skeletal muscle, cerebellum, and cerebrum and hybridized with the PCR-amplified inserts described above. For Northern blotting, 20 μg of total RNA from each tissue was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon filter. Filters were hybridized under standard conditions with either the 0.5-kb BamHI-BglII fragment of the bovine prRDH cDNA (for the bovine RNA blot) or the PCR-amplified mouse prRDH open reading frame (for the rat RNA blot) and washed in 0.1× SSC at 65 °C. For in situ hybridization to bovine retina, the cornea and lens were removed, and the retina was fixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, cryoprotected overnight in 30% sucrose, frozen in OCT, and sectioned at 20 μm. A 1.2-kb fragment of bovine prRDH cDNA containing the complete coding region was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and transcribed in vitro using T3 or T7 RNA polymerases to prepare antisense or sense probes, respectively. In situhybridization was performed with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes as described previously (30.Sun H. Macke J.P. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8860-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) except that high stringency washes and RNase treatment were used as described by Wilkinson et al. (31.Wilkinson D.G. Bailes J.A. McMahon A.P. Cell. 1987; 50: 79-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar).In situ hybridization to sections of whole mouse eye was performed by the same method. A fusion protein containing amino acids 5–312 from human prRDH fused to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase was produced inEscherichia coli, purified by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and used for immunization of rats. An analogous fusion containing the same human prRDH segment fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP; New England Biolabs) was produced inE. coli and purified by amylose affinity chromatography. The purified MBP fusion protein was used for affinity purification of immune sera after covalent coupling to Affi-Gel 10 matrix (Bio-Rad). A second immunogen was prepared using a pair of synthetic C-terminal peptides from bovine prRDH. Both peptides contain the sequence CFRTPVWPR but differ in having either a free carboxylate or an amide at the C terminus. The two peptides were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, cross-linked to BSA carrier protein with glutaraldehyde (32.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), and used to immunize rabbits. The antiserum was affinity-purified using the peptide mixture coupled to an Affi-Gel-10 matrix. ROS were prepared by sucrose gradient centrifugation from dark-adapted bovine retinas or from human retinas obtained from the Lions Eye Bank in Denver, CO, as described (33.Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To prepare total retinal protein, bovine retinas were resuspended in PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40 containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and debris. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) or estimated by comparison to a dilution series of BSA following gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Immunoblots were sequentially incubated with affinity-purified rat anti-human prRDH antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody (The Jackson Laboratory). Bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Macaque retinas were collected following cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and overnight fixation of isolated eyecups in the same buffer. After cryoprotection in 8% sucrose and embedding in OCT, 10–20-μm frozen sections were prepared, fixed for 30 s in acetone, incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 0.05% SDS and 5% normal goat serum, and incubated in PBS containing affinity-purified primary antibody at 1:50 in PBS containing 0.05% SDS and 5% normal goat serum overnight at 4 °C, and washed 3 times in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 followed by 3 washes in PBS. Biotinylated, fluorescein-conjugated, or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Vector) was diluted 1:200 to 1:500 in PBS with 5% normal goat serum and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Biotinylated antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase and the avidin-biotin complex method (Vector) with diaminobenzidine substrate. Rhodamine-conjugated peanut agglutinin (Vector) was used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Confocal images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 510. The bovine prRDH open reading frame was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to contain a HindIII site in place of the stop codon and then fused in frame to a DNA segment encoding six histidines followed by the C-terminal 9 codons of bovine rhodopsin (the latter is recognized by mAb 1D4 (34.Hodges R.S. Heaton R.J. Parker J.M.R. Molday L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11768-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This modified prRDH open reading frame was expressed in transiently transfected 293 cells using a pCIS vector (35.Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Protein Eng. Technol. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar). Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were disrupted in a Polytron homogenizer, and the membranes were purified by centrifugation onto a sucrose shelf and then concentrated by centrifugation as described (36.Merbs S.L. Nathans J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 869-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Membrane pellets from 293 cells transfected with RDH and from untransfected 293 cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml of 50 mmHEPES, pH 6.5, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA at a protein concentration of 175 μg/ml and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. RDH reactions for HPLC analysis were performed as follows. Four-fold serial dilutions of membranes were prepared in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2) containing 0.5% BSA. A reaction buffer was prepared that contained 200 μm NADPH, 1% BSA, 1% CHAPS, 0.01% α-tocopherol, and 50 μm 11-cis-or all-trans-retinal in buffer B. The RDH reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of diluted membranes to 20 μl of the reaction buffer. The samples were incubated at 32 °C for 15 min, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 40 μl of ethanol containing 0.5 m O-ethylhydroxylamine. For spectrophotometric analysis of the RDH reaction, the following components were first assembled, aliquoted, and frozen on dry ice: 1) 3.5 μg of 293 membranes, 1% BSA, 20% glycerol, and 1% CHAPS in buffer B (200 μl aliquots); and 2) NADPH or NADH at variable concentrations, 40 μm all-trans-retinal, 0.1% BSA, 2% glycerol, and 0.1% CHAPS in 2× buffer B (220-μl aliquots). Each RDH reaction was started by thawing 1 aliquot of each type and then mixing them together in a quartz cuvette. The cuvette was placed in a water-jacketed cuvette holder maintained at 32 °C, and spectra were recorded between 300 and 600 nm with a Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer over the ensuing 20 min. Under these conditions, the rate of conversion of retinal to retinol proceeds linearly for at least the first 30 min of the reaction. Incubation in 0.25m O-ethylhydroxylamine for 15 min at room temperature quantitatively converts retinal to O-ethyl retinal oxime, which can be readily resolved from retinol by C-18 reverse phase HPLC (37.Van Kuijk F.J.G.M. Handelman G.J. Dratz E.A. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 348: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Following the 15-min incubation, retinoids were extracted with 80 μl of hexane, dried under argon, dissolved in 100 μl of methanol, and resolved by HPLC on a 25-cm C-18 column with 100% methanol as the mobile phase. The column was monitored at 335 nm, a wavelength at which the extinction coefficients of all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinal oxime are equal. To identify genes expressed specifically in the retina, we constructed a library from bovine retina cDNA that had been simultaneously normalized and subtracted with bovine brain cDNA. One thousand cDNA clones were identified that contained low abundance sequences, as judged by their failure to hybridize to a probe consisting of the pool of normalized and subtracted retina cDNA. Approximately 0.5 kb of sequence was determined from each of these clones. A comparison of these 1,000 partial sequences with the GenBankTM data base revealed a novel sequence with significant homology to 17-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17-β-HSD1), a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This novel sequence was of interest because of the possibility that it codes for the long-sought photoreceptor all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase. As described below, this appears to be the case, and we therefore refer to this clone as prRDH (photoreceptor retinol dehydrogenase). A search of the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base with the original prRDH sequence resulted in the identification of only one EST with a nearly identical DNA sequence (clone 76 g1; GenBankTM accession number w22972). Subsequent searches with a full-length prRDH sequence identified a second EST (GenBankTM accession number w22947, clone 76e7) that derives from the 3′-untranslated region. Both ESTs are part of a collection of 5,000 ESTs sequenced from a human retina cDNA library that was not normalized. 2J. P. Macke and J. Nathans, unpublished results. These data suggest that prRDH expression may be limited to the retina. Isolation of cDNA clones from human and bovine retina cDNA libraries and characterization of their complete coding sequences revealed open reading frames of 311 and 312 codons, respectively, encoding proteins with calculated molecular masses of"

We have now cloned, overexpressed, and purified LpxC from the hyperthermophile Aquifex aeolicus.

(1996) Science 274, 980–982) does not inhibit A. aeolicus LpxC. To determine whether or not broad-spectrum deacetylase inhibitors can be found, we have designed a new class of hydroxamate-containing inhibitors of LpxC, starting with the structure of the physiological substrate. Several of these compounds inhibit both E. coli and A. aeolicus LpxC at similar concentrations. We have also identified a phosphinate-containing substrate analog that inhibits both E. coli and A. aeolicus LpxC, suggesting that the LpxC reaction proceeds by a mechanism similar to that described for other zinc metalloamidases, like carboxypeptidase A and thermolysin. The differences between the phenyloxazoline and the substrate-based LpxC inhibitors might be exploited for developing novel antibiotics targeted either against some or all Gram-negative strains. We suggest that LpxC inhibitors with antibacterial activity be termed “deacetylins.” UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC) catalyzes the second step in the biosynthesis of lipid A, a unique amphiphilic molecule found in the outer membranes of virtually all Gram-negative bacteria.

R., Pelak, B. A., Gerckens, L. S., Silver, L. L., Kahan, F. M., Chen, M. H., Patchett, A. A., Galloway, S. M., Hyland, S. A., Anderson, M. S., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1996) Science 274, 980–982) does not inhibit A. aeolicus LpxC. To determine whether or not broad-spectrum deacetylase inhibitors can be found, we have designed a new class of hydroxamate-containing inhibitors of LpxC, starting with the structure of the physiological substrate. Several of these compounds inhibit both E. coli and A. aeolicus LpxC at similar concentrations. We have also identified a phosphinate-containing substrate analog that inhibits both E. coli and A. aeolicus LpxC, suggesting that the LpxC reaction proceeds by a mechanism similar to that described for other zinc metalloamidases, like carboxypeptidase A and thermolysin. The differences between the phenyloxazoline and the substrate-based LpxC inhibitors might be exploited for developing novel antibiotics targeted either against some or all Gram-negative strains. We suggest that LpxC inhibitors with antibacterial activity be termed “deacetylins.” UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase bovine serum albumin bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane dithiothreitol fast protein liquid chromatography Lipid A from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium consists of a β,1′-6-linked disaccharide of glucosamine that is phosphorylated at the 1- and 4′-positions and is derivatized with up to seven fatty acyl chains (1.Raetz C.R.H.

The enzymes of lipid A biosynthesis are therefore ideal targets for the development of new antibiotics (10.Onishi H.R. Pelak B.A. Gerckens L.S. Silver L.L. Kahan F.M. Chen M.H. Patchett A.A.

The second and committed enzyme of lipid A biosynthesis in E. coli (LpxC)1 catalyzes the N-deacetylation of UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine, yielding a free amino group that is immediately acylated with anotherR-3-hydroxymyristoyl chain by LpxD (SchemeFS1) (8.Kelly T.M.

Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Chiral phenyloxazoline-based hydroxamates (Fig. 1), which are presumed to coordinate the active site metal of LpxC, have recently been described (10.Onishi H.R. Pelak B.A. Gerckens L.S. Silver L.L.

Some of these compounds display significant antibacterial activity against E. coli cells, but they are not active against P. aeruginosa (10.Onishi H.R. Pelak B.A. Gerckens L.S. Silver L.L. Kahan F.M.

P. aeruginosa LpxC is ∼20 times more resistant to the phenyloxazoline-based inhibitors than is E. coli LpxC (see below). Despite the limitations in the spectrum of the available inhibitors, the zinc ion-dependent mechanism of LpxC is very attractive from the perspective of medicinal chemistry, since extraordinarily potent inhibitors of other zinc metalloamidases have been described, including the blood pressure-lowering drugs captopril and enalapril (21.Patchett A.A.

The question of whether deacetylase inhibitors could be designed that effectively inhibit LpxCs from all Gram-negative bacteria has not been explored.Figure 1Structures of previously identified phenyloxazoline-based hydroxamic acid inhibitors L-573,655 and L-161,240. The compound LNTI-229, synthesized in the present work, is the racemic form of L-161,240. The S-isomer (not shown) of L-161,240 was also prepared as a control, since it had not been tested in previous studies (10.Onishi H.R. Pelak B.A. Gerckens L.S. Silver L.L. Kahan F.M. Chen M.H.

Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) affords a unique opportunity to study a thermostable LpxC variant that might be amenable to x-ray crystallography studies. A. aeolicus grows at 95 °C, making it one of the most thermophilic bacteria yet described (23.Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short G.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). As an obligate chemilithoautotroph, it grows in an atmosphere of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, solely in the presence of inorganic salts (23.Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short G.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 24.Brock T.D. Madigan M.T. Martinko J.M. Parker J. Biology of Microorganisms. 7th Ed. Prentice Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1994Google Scholar). From a comparison of 16 S rRNA sequences, A. aeolicus is one of the earliest diverging eubacteria on the evolutionary tree (23.Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short G.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the fact that A. aeolicus LpxC is the least homologous to E. coli LpxC (32% identity and 51% similarity over 277 amino acid residues) of the ∼30 LpxCs identified so far (19.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Therefore, a comparison of A. aeolicus LpxC andE. coli LpxC might reveal conserved mechanistic features and facilitate the design of broad-spectrum LpxC inhibitors. We now report the cloning, overexpression, and purification to homogeneity of LpxC from A. aeolicus. This hyperthermophilic enzyme efficiently deacetylates the physiological E. coliLpxC substrate UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine at 30 °C. However, A. aeolicus LpxC is optimally active at much higher temperatures (70 °C) than is the E. colienzyme (40 °C). Interestingly, the phenyloxazoline-based hydroxamates that are potent inhibitors (K i ∼50 nm) of the E. coli deacetylase (10.Onishi H.R. Pelak B.A. Gerckens L.S. Silver L.L. Kahan F.M. Chen M.H. Patchett A.A. Galloway S.M. Hyland S.A. Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R.H. Science. 1996; 274: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) have no activity against A. aeolicus LpxC, even at concentrations as high as 1 mg/ml (3–5 mm). We have therefore designed a new class of LpxC inhibitors that incorporate part of the structure of the natural substrate. Some of these new inhibitors are equally active against A. aeolicus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa LpxCs, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. These inhibitors should serve as leads for the development of novel antibiotics with activity against the entire spectrum of Gram-negative organisms.

The A. aeolicus lpxCgene was identified by a BLASTp search (19.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) using the E. coli LpxC sequence against the complete genome sequence ofA. aeolicus (23.Deckert G. Warren P.V.

Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Primers were designed to the N- and C-terminal regions of the A. aeolicus lpxC gene (5′-CTGACAGGATCCAATTCAGAGAGCTTGGACGG-3′ and 5′-CGAGCAGCGCATATGGGATTAGAAAAGACGG-3′, respectively). These primers were used in a polymerase chain reaction containing genomic A. aeolicus DNA (50–100 μg) as the template, kindly provided by Dr. Karl O. Stetter (23.Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short G.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). A. aeolicus lpxC was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (according to the manufacturer's specifications) in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing a 0.2 μm concentration of each dNTP and 0.5 μmconcentration of each primer for 25 polymerase chain reaction cycles (95 °C denaturation, 55 °C annealing, 72 °C polymerization). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withBamHI and NdeI restriction enzymes at positions introduced by the primer sequences. A band of the correct size predicted for the digested lpxC gene was purified by gel electrophoresis and ligated into the T7 expression vector, pET21a (Novagen), that had been cut in the multiple cloning site with the same enzymes. The final DNA sequence of the cloned lpxC gene in the plasmid, pAaLpxC, was confirmed to match the published sequence exactly (23.Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short G.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), and this construct was used for the expression and purification of the A. aeolicus LpxC protein. A matched expression plasmid containing the E. coli lpxCgene in the pET21a background was constructed by excising E. coli lpxC from the pET11a-envA expression plasmid (17.Young K. Silver L.L. Bramhill D. Cameron P. Eveland S.S. Raetz C.R.H. Hyland S.A. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30384-30391Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) using theBamHI and NdeI restriction sites. The E. coli lpxC gene was then ligated into pET21a that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes, and the resulting plasmid, pEcLpxC, was sequenced to verify that it contained the correct E. coli lpxC sequence. The plasmids pET21a, pAaLpxC, and pEcLpxC were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (26.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Cultures were prepared by growing single colonies of these three strains overnight in LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. The overnight cultures were then used to inoculate two fresh 50-ml cultures consisting of rich induction medium (27.Nair S.K. Calderone T.L. Christianson D.W. Fierke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17320-17325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for each strain; these were grown at 34 °C toA 620 = 0.4–0.5. At this point, 1 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 100 μm ZnSO4 were added to one of the two cultures of each strain in order to induce LpxC expression. After being grown in parallel for an additional 3 h at 34 °C, the induced and uninduced cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed by resuspension in 15 ml of 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7, containing 20% glycerol and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 ×g for 10 min as above. The washed cells were resuspended in 5 ml of the same buffer with DTT at 2 mm and were broken using a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. Cell-free crude extracts were made by centrifugation of the lysates at 2000 × gfor 20 min. Total protein concentrations of the extracts were determined using the BCA procedure (28.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) (Pierce). The E. coli LpxC substrate, [α-32P]UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-GlcNAc, was prepared and purified as described previously by acylation of [α-32P]UDP-GlcNAc using purified E. coliLpxA (generously provided by T. J. O. Wyckoff, Duke University) (8.Kelly T.M. Stachula S.A. Raetz C.R.H. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19866-19874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R.H. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Initial rates of LpxC-catalyzed deacetylation of this substrate were determined using crude extracts of E. coli containing pET21a (0.2 mg/ml), pAaLpxC (0.1–1.0 μg/ml), or pEcLxpC (1.0 μg/ml). These assays were performed at temperatures ranging from 1 to 80 °C, as indicated, and contained 3 μm[α-32P]UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-GlcNAc (5 × 106 cpm/nmol), 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.5 mm AMP. The buffer used for these assays was 40 mm bis-tris, pH 5.9, when measured at 30 °C. The pH of this buffer does change slightly as a function of temperature, from pH 6.2 when measured at 1 °C to pH 5.5 when measured at 60 °C. However, this does not affect the qualitative interpretation of the assay results. The activity assays were performed in plastic microcentrifuge tubes in a reaction volume of 20 μl. At each time point (chosen so that the total conversion to product was less than 10%), 5-μl portions of each reaction mixture were removed and added to 1 μl of 1.25 m NaOH to stop the reaction. The base-treated samples were incubated for an additional 10 min at 30 °C to ensure complete hydrolysis of the ester-linked acyl chains from the LpxC substrate and product and then were neutralized by the addition of 1 μl of 1.25 m acetic acid and 1 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The neutralized samples were incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged for 2 min in a microcentrifuge. Portions of the supernatants (2 μl) were spotted onto PEI-cellulose TLC plates for separation of the remaining substrate (detected as [α-32P]UDP-GlcNAc) from the product (detected as [α-32P]UDP-GlcN). After air drying, the plates were washed for 5 min with methanol before chromatography to improve resolution. The plates were then developed with 0.2 maqueous guanidine-HCl as the solvent system. The radioactive spots on the plates were analyzed using a PhosphorImager equipped with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) to determine the yields of product produced in each reaction mixture. A. aeolicus LpxC activity assays with the purified protein were performed in essentially the same way, except that the 0.5 mm AMP was omitted. Steady-state kinetic parameters and S.E. values for the deacetylation of [α-32P]UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-GlcNAc catalyzed by A. aeolicus LpxC were determined at 30 °C (3.1 nm enzyme, 0.5–30 μm substrate) or 60 °C (1.6 nm enzyme, 0.25–10 μmsubstrate) in 40 mm bis-tris, pH 5.5. The Kaleidagraph (Synergy software) curve-fitting program was used to determine the steady-state kinetic parameters according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Three liters of rich induction medium (27.Nair S.K. Calderone T.L. Christianson D.W. Fierke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17320-17325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were inoculated with 100 ml of an overnight culture of BL21(DE3)/pLysS/pAaLpxC and grown at 34 °C toA 620 = 0.4–0.5. At this point, expression ofA. aeolicus LpxC was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 0.1 mm ZnSO4. After 6 h, the cells were harvested, and the resulting 20 g of wet cell paste was resuspended in 83 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, containing 2 mm DTT and frozen in two batches at −80 °C. Each batch was processed separately at 4 °C. The resuspended cell pellet was lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. The cellular debris was removed by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Ti-50.2 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 60 min. The supernatant from this step (34 ml) was diluted 3-fold with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm DTT and loaded onto a 75-ml DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column, equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 125 ml of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm DTT and 0.1m KCl. Most of the A. aeolicus LpxC protein was then eluted in a single step consisting of 50 ml of 25 mmHepes, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm DTT and 0.3 mKCl. This fraction was dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm DTT, and then diluted to approximately 80 ml with the same buffer. The dialyzed sample was loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto a Q-Sepharose Fast-Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) FPLC column (HR16/10, 20 ml) that had been equilibrated in 25 mmHepes, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm DTT. After loading the protein, the column was washed with an additional 40 ml of the equilibration buffer, and then a linear gradient (500 ml) of 0–0.3m KCl in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm DTT was used to elute the column. LpxC emerged in a sharp peak at 0.12–0.13 m KCl. This protein was desalted and concentrated to about 8 ml using an Amicon ultrafiltration apparatus, and the resulting protein was loaded onto a Sephacryl-200 HiPrep (S-200 26/10; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column in two separate batches of 4 ml each. The S-200 column was pre-equilibrated and eluted in 50 mm bis-tris buffer, pH 6.0, containing 150 mm NaCl at 1 ml/min. The LpxC activity and protein eluted from this column in a single peak and were judged to be ∼90–95% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentration of total protein at each step was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with BSA as the standard (28.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Purified protein was stored at ≥1 mg/ml in 50 mm bis-tris, pH 6.0 buffer, containing 150 mm NaCl and frozen at −80 °C. Electrospray mass spectrometry (Duke University Mass Spectrometry Facility, Research Triangle Park, NC) showed that the LpxC purified in this manner was homogeneous, with a predicted molecular weight of 32013 ± 3, corresponding to the predicted molecular weight ofA. aeolicus LpxC with the N-terminal fMet residue removed. Purified E. coliLpxC (20.Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R.H. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and purified A. aeolicus LpxC were used for characterizing inhibitors. Stock solutions (10 mg/ml) of each inhibitor were made in 100% Me2SO, and any further dilutions of these compounds were also made in 100% Me2SO. E. coli LpxC (5 nm) or A. aeolicus LpxC (7.8 nm) was incubated with varied concentrations of each inhibitor in the presence of 1 mg/ml BSA and 10% Me2SO, for 20–40 min on ice prior to starting the assays. The LpxC/inhibitor stocks were then diluted 2.5-fold into assay mixtures containing 3 mmUDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine in 40 mm bis-tris, pH 5.5, at 30 °C, to give a final enzyme concentration of 2 nm E. coli LpxC or 3.1 nm A. aeolicus LpxC. Assay tubes were supplemented with each of the inhibitors and additional Me2SO, if necessary, to maintain the same concentration of the inhibitor and Me2SO in the assay as was present in the preincubation with enzyme. The initial velocities were plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration for each compound. The resulting data were fit to Equation 1 as follows, vi /vc=IC50 /([I]+IC50)Equation 1 where v i represents the initial velocity at a given concentration of inhibitor and v c represents the initial velocity of a control reaction containing no inhibitor, to yield the IC50 for inhibition at 30 °C by each compound. The K i values for inhibition of E. coliLpxC by three of the most potent inhibitors (LNTI-229, TU-514, and TU-517) were determined using the same assay conditions (40 mm bis-tris, pH 5.5, at 30 °C) at varied substrate concentrations (1–10 μm). The initial velocities measured at each concentration of inhibitor (0–500 nm for LNTI-229 and 0–11 μm for TU514 and TU-517) and substrate were fit simultaneously to Equation 2 using the Systat data analysis software (version 5.2; Systat, Inc.) in order to determine theK i for LpxC inhibition. v=[S][Vmax]/{Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S]}Equation 2 A 5-ml culture of E. coli strain R477 (7.Galloway S.M.

The most intensively studied are theN-acyl homoserine lactones, which have diverse roles as signaling molecules in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria (1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Among Gram-positive bacteria, structurally similar but chemically distinct γ-butyrolactones play determining roles in antibiotic production and sporulation in Streptomyces species (2.Yamada Y. England R. Hobbs G. Bainton N. Roberts D. Microbial Signalling and Communication. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1999: 177-196Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Streptomycetes are mycelial soil bacteria with a developmental program that results in sporulation. They also produce a wide variety of antibiotics with important uses in medicine and in agriculture. These antibiotics are the products of complex biosynthetic pathways, activated typically in a growth phase-dependent manner (3.Chater K.F. Bibb M.J. Bio/Technology. 1996; 7: 57-105Google Scholar). In liquid culture, antibiotic production generally occurs in stationary phase (4.Gramajo H.C. Takano E. Bibb M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 5.Takano E. Gramajo H.C. Strauch E. Andres N. White J. Bibb M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2797-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), while in surface-grown cultures, it usually coincides with the onset of morphological differentiation, i.e. the formation of aerial hyphae. The most intensively studied γ-butyrolactone is A-factor (2-isocapryloyl-3R-hydroxymethyl-γ-butyrolactone), which is required for streptomycin production and sporulation inStreptomyces griseus (6.Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Vining L.C. Stuttard C. Genetics and Biochemistry of Antibiotic Production. Butterworth-Heinemann, Newton, MA1994: 103-119Google Scholar). A-factor binds to a cytoplasmic protein that in its absence represses streptomycin production and morphological differentiation (7.Ohnishi Y. Kameyama S. Onaka H. Horinouchi S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Other γ-butyrolactones have also been shown to induce antibiotic biosynthesis, e.g. the virginiae butanolides of Streptomyces virginiae (8.Yamada Y. Nihira T. Sakuda S. Bio/Technology of Antibiotics. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 63-79Google Scholar, 9.Yamada Y. Actinomycetol. 1995; 9: 57-65Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, since at least 60% of Streptomyces species appear to produce γ-butyrolactones (9.Yamada Y. Actinomycetol. 1995; 9: 57-65Crossref Google Scholar), these compounds are likely to play important roles as extracellular signaling molecules in the biology of these organisms. Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), the most genetically characterized streptomycete, produces at least four antibiotics, including the blue-pigmented polyketide actinorhodin (Act),1 and the red-pigmented tri-pyrolle undecylprodigiosin (Red), both of which are produced in a growth phase-dependent manner (4.Gramajo H.C.

This paper identifies four low molecular weight compounds present in the supernatants of transition and stationary phase cultures ofS. coelicolor that can elicit the precocious production of Act and Red when added exogenously to the strain. One of the compounds, SCB1, was purified and its structure ((2R,3R,1′R)-2-(1′-hydroxy-6-methylheptyl)-3-hydroxymethylbutanolide) determined using electron impact mass spectrometry (EI-MS), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and circular dichroism (CD).

Confluent lawns of S. coelicolor spores were spread on SMMS plates and allowed to dry. For most assays, 6- or 11-mm diameter holes were made in the agar with a cork-borer, and the bottoms of the holes sealed with 1% agar. Samples in methanol (diluted with an equal volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA) or culture supernatants (up to 200 μl) were pipetted into the holes, and the plates incubated at 30 °C for 30–37 h. For some assays, samples were applied directly to the lawn of spores. To determine the minimum concentration of SCB1 required for precocious antibiotic production, the chemically synthesized compound was added to 8 ml of SMMS agar at varying concentrations, and the agar poured into 9-cm diameter Petri dishes. Confluent lawns of M145 spores were added, and the plates incubated at 30 °C for 30–37 h. Culture supernatants were boiled for 30 min or incubated at 80 °C for 1 h. Protease K, Pronase, and trypsin (all from Sigma) were incubated with culture supernatants at 37 °C for 1 h. The ability of the treated samples to elicit antibiotic production was assayed as described above. Spores of S. coelicolorstrain M145 were harvested from a MS (formerly known as SFM; Ref. 14.Floriano B. Bibb M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) agar plate and used to generate a three-stage seed culture. Successive seed cultures were grown in shake flasks using a 2% (v/v) inoculum. The cultures were grown at 28 °C and 240 rpm; the primary seed was incubated for 48 h, and the secondary and tertiary seeds for 24 h. The tertiary seed culture was used to inoculate (2% v/v) 300 liters of TSB, which was incubated with pH control at 28 °C for 69 h with an airflow rate of 150 liters min−1, an agitator tip speed of 2 ms−1 and an overpressure of 0.5 barg. Approximately 120 g of wet mycelium liter−1were obtained at harvest. The pH of the culture supernatant was adjusted from 8.4 to 7.1 with sulfuric acid, and the resulting 280 liters extracted with 140 liters of ethyl acetate. The extract was dried with MgSO4 and evaporated to give 24.5 g of oil. The oily sample was resuspended in 100 ml of 100% methanol and 20 ml were loaded onto a Silica gel 60 extra pure (Merck) column (bed volume of 230 ml). The sample was eluted with 70% ethyl acetate, 30% n-hexane, yielding fifteen 50-ml fractions. This procedure was repeated five times. Each fraction was subjected to the bioassay. Positive fractions were pooled, filtered through a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filter (Sartorious), and evaporated to give 495 mg of oily sample. Further purifications were all performed with a C18 reverse phase column (4.6 mm × 25 cm Spherisorb 5-μm ODS2, Waters) on a ConstaMetric HPLC equipped with a UV detector (ABI Spectroflow 757) set at 210 nm, and with a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. The oily sample was resuspended in 90% methanol to give a final volume of 10 ml; 200-μl aliquots were loaded onto the column and eluted with a linear gradient of 20% to 100% acetonitrile. Three 7.5-ml fractions were collected and subjected to the bioassay. This procedure was repeated 50 times, and the active fractions were pooled and evaporated to give 190 mg of sample. The material was resuspended in 3 ml of 100% methanol, and 50-μl samples were loaded onto the column and eluted with a linear gradient of 46.3–49.6% acetonitrile. Nine 1-ml fractions were collected and evaporated. This procedure was repeated 23 times. Each fraction was subjected to the bioassay, and the 23 active fractions (one per run) were loaded separately onto the column and eluted with a linear gradient of 46.3–49.6% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peaks were collected manually using a chart recorder (BBC Servogor 120) and subjected to the bioassay. The 23 active peaks (one per run) with the same retention time were pooled and evaporated. The sample was resuspended in 240 μl of 100% methanol, and 20-μl aliquots were loaded onto the column and eluted isocratically with 47% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. For each of the 12 runs, peaks were collected manually and assayed for bioactivity. Active peaks with the same retention time from each of the 12 runs were pooled, evaporated, and resuspended in 140 μl of 100% methanol. Seven 20-μl aliquots were loaded onto the column and eluted with a linear gradient of 47–47.5% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peaks were collected manually and assayed for bioactivity. Active fractions with the same retention time were pooled, evaporated, and resuspended in 140 μl of 100% methanol. Seven 20-μl aliquots were loaded onto the column and eluted isocratically with 42.5% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peaks were collected manually from each of the seven runs and subjected to the bioassay, and single fractions with bioactivity were evaporated, resuspended in 20 μl of 100% methanol, loaded onto the column, and eluted with a linear gradient of 20–50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Each peak was collected manually and subjected to the bioassay. Active peaks with the same retention time were pooled. Partially purified samples were stored at 4 °C in an evaporated state, and the purified sample was stored at −20 °C in 100% methanol. 3-(Hydroxymethyl)butanolide was made by reduction of diethyl formylsuccinate with NaBH4 and converted to 3-(trimethysilyloxymethyl)butanolide by trimethylsilylation (15.Nihira T. Shimizu Y. Kim H.-S. Yamada Y. J. Antibiot. 1988; 41: 1828-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 1-Bromo-4-methylpentane was purchased from Aldrich. Infrared (IR) spectra were determined as films on a Horiba model FT-120 Fourier transform-IR spectrophotometer.1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian model Unity Inova 600 spectrometer at 600 MHz using CHCl3 δH7.25 as an internal reference in CDCl3 solution. Optical rotation (CD) values were measured on a Jasco P-1020 polarimeter. Mass spectra were obtained on a Jeol JMS-DX-303 spectrometer.

For diethyl 2-(4′-methylpentyl)malonate (Fig. 3,1), sodium (1.65 g) was added to 40 ml of absolute ethanol, and the mixture stirred at 55 °C until no sodium was visible. After cooling the mixture to <50 °C, diethyl malonate (12.4 g) was added dropwise and refluxed for 20 min. 1-Bromo-4-methylpentane (11.64 g) was added dropwise to the solution with stirring. After refluxing for 2 h, the reaction mixture was evaporated to remove ethanol, acidified with 3 n HCl, and extracted with CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated to yield 16.1 g of crude 1. For 2-(4′-methylpentyl)malonic acid (Fig. 3, 2), crude1 (11 g) was mixed with KOH solution (11 g in 35 ml of water and 80 ml of methanol) and left overnight at room temperature with stirring. The reaction mixture was evaporated to remove methanol, acidified with 3 n HCl, and extracted with CH2Cl2. After drying over anhydrous Na2SO4, the CH2Cl2layer was evaporated to yield white crystals of 2 (8.2 g, yield 96%). For 6-methylheptanoic acid (Fig. 3, 3), the white crystals of 2 (8.1 g) were heated at 145 °C in the presence of boiling stones for 8 h. 10% NaHCO3 solution (200 ml) was added, and the mixture extracted once with hexane to remove neutral impurities. The water layer was acidified with 3 n HCl, followed by CH2Cl2 extraction. The CH2Cl2 layer was dried, evaporated, and the residue was purified by distillation yielding 3.7 g of3 (yield 60%). Physicochemical data for 3 are as follows: EI-MSm/z 145 (M+H)+, 127 (M+H-H2O)+; 1 H NMR δ (CDCl3, 400 MHz) 2.32 (2H, dd, J = 8 and 7 Hz, CH2-COOH), 1.59 [2H, dt, J = 15 and 7 Hz, (CH3)2CH-CH2], 1.51 [1H, m, (CH3)2CH], 1.31 (2H, m, -CH2-), 1.17 (1H, t, J = 6 Hz, -CH2-CH2-COOH), 1.15 (1H, t, J = 7 Hz, -CH2-CH2-COOH), 0.84 [6H, d, J-7 Hz, (CH3)2-CH]; IR (film) 3037 and 1713 cm−1. Racemic A-factor (Fig. 3, 4) (0.7 g, yield 52%) was synthesized by reacting 3-(trimethyl-silyloxymethyl)butanolide (1.03 g) with 6-methylheptanoic acid chloride (0.99 g) in the presence of lithium diisopropylamine in dry tetrahydrofuran under N2(15.Nihira T. Shimizu Y. Kim H.-S. Yamada Y. J. Antibiot. 1988; 41: 1828-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 6-Methylheptanoic acid chloride was prepared from 3with oxalyl chloride. Physicochemical data were identical to those reported (16.Mori K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983; 39: 3107-3109Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Racemic A-factor (100 mg in 5 ml of ethanol) was reduced with 1.1 eq of NaBH4 at 4 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 3 n HCl, and the solution extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was evaporated, and the residue purified by C18 reverse-phase HPLC (Capcell Pak C18, 4.6 × 250-mm column (Shiseido Co.

Physicochemical data for synthetic (2S,3S,1′R)-SCB1 (Fig. 3,8) were as follows: [α]D23 = +28.2° (c. 0.065, CHCl3); 1H NMR, EI-MS, and IR data were identical to those for (2R,3R,1′S)-SCB1. Exponential phase (A 450 = 0.4), late exponential phase (A 450 = 0.7), early transition phase (A 450 = 1.0), late transition phase (A 450 = 1.5), and stationary phase (A 450 = 2.0) culture supernatants of S. coelicolor M145 grown in SMM were assayed for their ability to elicit precocious production of the pigmented antibiotics Act and Red in lawns of the same strain grown on SMMS. While supernatants from exponential and early transition phase cultures showed no activity, those from late transition phase and stationary phase cultures appeared to elicit production of both antibiotics (Fig.4 A). Exponential phase culture supernatants concentrated 50-fold by freeze-drying failed to show activity. Essentially the same results were obtained when M145 was grown in complex YEME and TSB liquid media, and when MM, R2, and R2YE rather than SMMS were used to assay for precocious antibiotic production. The ability of the culture supernatants to cause premature Act and Red production on several defined and complex media suggests that the activity of the factor(s) responsible is not highly dependent on the nutritional state of the culture, and is consistent with a key role for the factor(s) in determining the onset of antibiotic production. To establish unambiguously that the observed pigment production reflected synthesis of both of the colored antibiotics, mutants carrying deletions in one or other of the pathway-specific activator genes for Act (actII-ORF4) and Red (redD) synthesis, M511 and M510, respectively, were used as lawns in the bioassay. The late transition and stationary phase culture supernatants stimulated the production of Act in M510 and Red in M511 (Fig. 4 B), confirming the induced synthesis of both of the pigmented antibiotics. Interestingly, the stimulatory effect was only observed when the culture supernatants were added within 8 h of spreading the lawns of M145, M510, or M511 spores; later addition had no effect. When a stationary phase culture supernatant of M145 that possessed stimulatory activity was dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, all activity was lost. Use of a Centricon-3 (Amicon) filter indicated that the molecular weight of the active factor(s) was less than 3000. The stimulatory activity was resistant to protease and heat treatment (100 °C for 30 min and 80 °C for 1 h); it was stable in acidic conditions (pH1.0 for 30 min), unstable in alkali (pH12.0 for 10 min), and was readily extracted into ethyl acetate and chloroform. Moreover, C18reverse phase HPLC using an acetonitrile/water mobile phase gave a peak with bioactivity that eluted at approximately 50% acetonitrile. All of these properties are characteristics associated with γ-butyrolactones. A 300-liter culture of S. coelicolor M145 was grown in TSB at 28 °C for 69 h, and the supernatant extracted with ethyl acetate at neutral pH. After evaporation, the oily extract was passed through a silica gel column using 70% ethyl acetate, 30% n-hexane as solvent, and fractions with stimulatory activity were obtained. Further purification was achieved by C18 reverse phase HPLC using an acetonitrile gradient as mobile phase. To maximize the separation of individual peaks, an analytical column was used throughout the remainder of the purification. Two rounds of C18 reverse phase HPLC yielded two peaks with bioactivity. The major peak eluted at 47.0% acetonitrile, and the minor peak at 48.2%. The minor peak was later shown to contain at least two stimulatory activities. Further purification was performed only with the major peak. Six additional rounds of C18 reverse phase HPLC gave a single peak with stimulatory activity, which was designated SCB1. A small peak with stimulatory activity that had a retention time just slightly longer than that of SCB1 (10.8 min versus 9.9 min on 42.5% acetonitrile isocratic elution) was also identified, but there was too little material for structural determination. Thus, S. coelicolor produces at least four compounds that can induce precocious antibiotic production. One-dimensional 600-MHz 1H NMR (Fig. 5) indicated that the purified compound possessed a typical 2,3-disubstituted γ-butyrolactone skeleton, as evident from the signals at 4.43, 4.03, 3.99, 3.77, 3.70, 2.79, and 2.66 ppm. The signals at 4.43 and 3.99 ppm correspond to methylene protons at C-4 (Fig. 3, 5), and those at 3.77 and 3.70 ppm to hydroxymethylene protons at C-5. The signals at 4.03, 2.79, and 2.66 ppm correspond to three methine protons at C-1′, C-3, and C-2, respectively. The remaining signals at 1.56, 1.33 (3 protons), 1.19 (2 protons), and 0.87 ppm (6 protons) appeared to originate from an alkyl side chain at C-2, although the broad signal of contaminating H2O at 1.7 ppm overlapped the 1.56 ppm signal, preventing determination of the number of protons in the 1.56 ppm signal. However, the doublet signal at 0.87 ppm corresponds to six protons of two methyl groups and indicated the presence of a terminal isopropyl moiety. Supposing that two to four methylene protons in the 1.56 ppm signal were masked by the 1.7 ppm H2O signal, the structure of the C-2 side chain could be either 1′-hydroxy-5′-methylhexyl (n = 2) or 1′-hydroxy-6′-methylheptyl (n = 3). To confirm these predictions, a two-dimensional H-H COSY spectrum of SCB1 was determined (Fig.6). All of the expected couplings were observed. H­4b (3.99 ppm)→H­4a (4.43)↓ H­3 (2.79 ppm)→H­5a+b (3.77 and 3.70 ppm)↓ H­2 (2.66 ppm)→H­1′ (4.03 ppm)→H­2′ (1.56 ppm) SCHEME 1Several attempts to eliminate contaminating water from the sample were unsuccessful, reflecting the limiting amount of purified compound (∼320 μg) available; this prevented determination of the number of methylenes between C-1′ and the terminal isopropyl moiety by1H NMR. However, EI-MS of the purified compound gave a clear parent signal of m/z 245 (M+H)+, indicating that SCB1 has a 1′-hydroxy-6′-methylheptyl group at C-2, and a molecular weight of 244.Figure 6Two-dimensional H-H COSY spectrum of SCB1. The numbers adjacent to the signals indicate the cross-peaks between the corresponding protons in SCB1 (see Fig.5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The coupling constant between H-2 and H-3 (J 2,3=9.5 Hz) was different from that of VB-A (J 2,3=7.4 Hz) (17.Yamada Y. Sugamura K. Kondo K. Yanagimoto M. Okada H. J. Antibiot. 1987; 40: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but agreed well with that of IM-2 (J 2,3=9.3 Hz) (18.Sato K. Nihira T. Sakuda S. Yanagimoto M. Yamada Y. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1989; 68: 170-173Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that SCB1 possesses an IM-2-type stereochemistry about C-2, 3 and 1′. To confirm the IM-2-type nature of SCB1, the retention time of the purified compound upon C18 reverse phase HPLC was compared with those of synthetic IM-2-type and VB-type γ-butyrolactones. Samples were prepared by NaBH4 reduction of synthetic A-factor followed by purification on reverse-phase HPLC. Natural SCB1 and the IM-2-type reduced A-factor derivative eluted at 11.8 min, while the VB-type reduced A-factor eluted at 10.2 min, indicating that natural SCB1 has an IM-2-like stereochemistry, either 2R,3R,1′R or the enantiomeric 2S,3S,1′S. To determine the absolute configuration of SCB1, the IM-2-type enantiomers (2R,3R,1′R and 2S,3S,1′S) and the VB-type enantiomers (2R,3R,1′S and 2S,3S,1′R) of SCB1 were chemically synthesized (Fig. 3). Racemic A-factor was synthesized by acylating 3-(trimethylsilyloxymethyl)butanolide with 6-methylheptanoic acid chloride. Reduction with NaBH4 and separation by C18 reverse-phase HPLC gave racemic mixtures of the IM-2-type and VB-type compounds. Separation of each racemic mixture by chiral HPLC yielded optically pure compounds. Since natural VB-A and IM-2 possess negative optical rotations (CD-) and their absolute configurations had been determined unambiguously to be 2R,3R (19.Mizuno K. Sakuda S. Nihira T. Yamada Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 50: 10849-10858Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), each of the chemically synthesized stereoisomers that possessed a negative optical rotation was assigned as 2R,3R. The elution time of natural SCB1 from a Chiralpak AD column using hexane:ethanol (92:8) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 was 33.3 min, identical to that of the synthetic 2R,3R,1′R isomer, whereas the 2S,3S,1′S isomer eluted after 30.4 min. Consequently, the structure of natural SCB1 was deduced to be (2R,3R,1′R)-2-(1′-hydroxy-6-methylheptyl)-3-hydroxymethylbutanolide (Fig. 3). The minimum concentration of each of the four stereoisomers of SCB1 needed to induce antibiotic production in the SMMS plate bioassay was determined to be: SCB1 (2R,3R,1′R), between 128 and 256 nm (Fig. 7); (2S,3S,1′S), 410 and 4100 nm; (2R,3R,1′S), 410 and 4100 nm; (2S,3S,1′R), 780 and 7800 nm. The concentration of SCB1 required to elicit antibiotic production in S. coelicolor appears to be considerably higher than the levels of A-factor (about 1 nm; Ref. 20.Hara O. Beppu T. J. Antibiot. 1982; 35: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and virginiae butanolides (about 3 nm; Ref. 21.Kawabuchi M. Hara Y. Nihira T. Yamada Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 157: 81-85Crossref Google Scholar) required to induce antibiotic production inS. griseus and S. virginiae, respectively, but corresponds to the level of stimulatory activity observed on bioassay of transition and stationary phase supernatants of SMM-grown cultures (the zones of antibiotic production indicated stimulatory activity equivalent to approximately 250 nm SCB1). Interestingly, high concentrations of SCB1 (>1,000 nm) inhibited Act and Red production in S. coelicolor (Fig. 7), but had no inhibitory effect on growth or morphological differentiation. An inhibitory effect was also observed for high concentrations (>1, 400 nm) of racemic VB-C on virginiamycin production in S. virginiae, 2T. Nihira, unpublished data. and for high concentrations of A-factor (410–4100 nm) on the formation of aerial mycelium in S. griseus (Ref. 11.Anisova L.N. Blinova I.N. Efremenkova O.V. Kozmin Yu.P. Onoprienko V.V. Smirnova G.M. Khokhlov A.S. Izv. Akad. Nauk. SSSR Ser. Biol. 1984; 1: 98-108Google Scholar; the effect on streptomycin production was not reported). Both A-factor and a C5 derivative of IM-2 elicited precocious antibiotic production in S. coelicolor at concentrations of 26,000 and 495,000 nm, respectively, far higher than those required for SCB1 (<256 nm), while VB-C was inactive at a concentration of 440,000 nm. A γ-butyrolactone, SCB1, with the ability to induce the precocious production of both Act and Red in S. coelicolor,was purified to homogeneity and its structure determined. SCB1 does not correspond to any of the six γ-butyrolactones reported to be made byS. coelicolor (12.Efremenkova O.V. Anisova L.N. Bartoshevich Y.E. Antibiot. Med. Biotekhnol. 1985; 9: 687-707Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The biological activity of these compounds in S. coelicolor was not described, although they restored streptomycin production and sporulation to an A-factor-deficient mutant of S. griseus, albeit at a 500-fold higher concentration than A-factor itself. Whether SCB1 also has this activity remains to be determined. SCB1 may be identical to factor I, a γ-butyrolactone made by Streptomyces viridochromogenes (22.Gräfe U. Reinhardt G. Schade W. Eritt I. Fleck W.F. Radics L. Biotechnol. Lett. 1983; 5: 591-596Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1); while the C2, C3 positions of Factor I were defined as trans (i.e.2S,3S or 2R,3R), and the configuration of the hydroxyl at C1′ as β (23.Sakuda S. Yamada Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 1817-1820Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), as in SCB1, the absolute configuration of the molecule was not determined. While this compound was able to induce leucomycin production and aerial mycelium formation in S. griseus ZIMET 43682, its role in the producing organism was not reported. Recently, γ-butyrolactone-like compounds were identified in S. coelicolor that were able to elicit precocious morphological differentiation (21.Kawabuchi M. Hara Y. Nihira T. Yamada Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 157: 81-85Crossref Google Scholar) but not antibiotic production2 in the producing strain, the converse of the phenotypes associated with SCB1. It thus appears that S. coelicolor produces several different γ-butyrolactones with distinct biological activities. Each of the three chemically synthesized stereoisomers possess markedly weaker activities than SCB1, indicating that the C2, C3, and C1′ positions play important roles in determining the specificity of the γ-butyrolactone for its presumed binding protein. A-factor and IM-2-C5 could both elicit antibiotic production in S. coelicolor, but at much higher concentrations than SCB1. The carbonyl group at the C1′ position of A-factor is susceptible to reduction; consequently, a low level of SCB1 present in the A-factor sample may be responsible for the relatively high apparent stimulatory activity of A-factor compared with that of IM-2-C5 and VB-C. In addition to SCB1, three other stimulatory activities were observed in culture supernatants of S. coelicolor. Two of these eluted markedly later than SCB1 from the C18 column, and are likely to be γ-butyrolactones with longer carbon side chains than SCB1. While they may correspond to Acl-1a and Acl-1b (12.Efremenkova O.V. Anisova L.N. Bartoshevich Y.E. Antibiot. Med. Biotekhnol. 1985; 9: 687-707Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), since all of the streptomycete γ-butyrolactones whose structures have been absolutely determined possess the 2R,3Rconfiguration, it seems more likely that they correspond to the 2R,3R diastereomers of these compounds. Interestingly, the stimulatory effect elicited by addition of culture supernatants containing these compounds to lawns of S. coelicolor spores was only observed if the supernatants were applied within 8 h of plating out the lawns; later addition had no stimulatory effect. This is reminiscent of the “decision phase” described for the effective addition of A-factor to a culture ofS. griseus deficient in A-factor production (12.Efremenkova O.V. Anisova L.N. Bartoshevich Y.E. Antibiot. Med. Biotekhnol. 1985; 9: 687-707Google Scholar, 24.Neumann T. Piepersberg W. Distler J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1953-1963Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar); restoration of streptomycin production was only observed if A-factor was added within 10 h of inoculation. It will be interesting to determine the molecular basis for this apparent growth phase-dependent response to γ-butyrolactone addition. In S. griseus, only one γ-butyrolactone, A-factor, appears to regulate streptomycin production, and in Streptomyces lavendulae, a single γ-butyrolactone, IM-2, induces production of the nucleoside antibiotics showdomycin and minimycin (25.Hashimoto K. Nihira T. Sakuda S. Yamada Y. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1992; 73: 449-455Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, S. virginiae produces at least five virginiae butanolides (VB-A, B, C, D, and E) that stimulate virginiamycin production, each with a different minimum effective concentration (26.Kondo K. Higuchi Y. Sakuda S. Nihira T. Yamada Y. J. Antibiot. 1989; 42: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Like S. virginiae, S. coelicolor appears to produce several γ-butyrolactones that are capable of stimulating the production of at least two chemically distinct antibiotics. It will be interesting to determine how these γ-butyrolactones elicit their pleiotropic effect on antibiotic production."

Leishmania live as either extracellular, flagellated promastigotes in the digestive tract of their sandfly vector or as aflagellated amastigotes within the phagolysosomes of mammalian macrophages (1.Molyneux D. Killick-Kendrick R. Peters W. Killick-Kendrick R. The Leishmaniases in Biology and Medicine. 1. Academic Press, London1987: 122-168Google Scholar). Much research has focused on the unusually high levels of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1-anchored surface molecules present in these organisms (2.Ferguson M.A. Brimacombe J.S. Cottaz S. Field R.A. Guther L.S. Homans S.W. McConville M.J. Mehlert A. Milne K.G. Ralton J.E. Roy Y.A. Schneider P. Zitzmann N. Parasitology. 1994; 108: S45-S54Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), particularly the unique glycoconjugate, lipophosphoglycan (LPG), abundant in promastigotes (3.McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), and the metalloprotease GP63 (or leishmanolysin) (4.Frommel T.O. Button L.L. Fujikura Y. McMaster W.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic acylated surface proteins (HASPs; originally named GBP and GA/CP inLeishmania major) are a family of related surface molecules expressed only in infective parasite stages (5.Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6.Pimenta P.F.P. Da Silva P.P. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Sacks D.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 468-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These proteins are unusual in that they lack a “classical” endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretory signal sequence, a GPI-anchor consensus, or membrane-spanning domains but are surface-localized (6.Pimenta P.F.P. Da Silva P.P. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Sacks D.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 468-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), partition into the hydrophobic phase on Triton X-114 separation, and fractionate with lipid species (5.Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mechanism of transport and attachment to the cell surface is unclear, although it has been suggested that this may occur by virtue of a close association with LPG via an HASP repeat region with homology to the peptidoglycan binding domain of Staphylococcus aureusprotein A (6.Pimenta P.F.P. Da Silva P.P. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Sacks D.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 468-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). More recent studies have not substantiated this hypothesis, as HASPs are still presented on the surface of infective metacyclic parasites in the absence of LPG (7.Rangarajan D. Gokool S. McCrossan M.V. Smith D.F. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3359-3366PubMed Google Scholar).Leishmania (and other trypanosomatids) possess a conventional eukaryotic secretory pathway (8.Clayton C. Hausler T. Blattner J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 325-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Al-Qahtani A. Teilhet M. Mensa-Wilmot K. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and require a signal sequence for translocation of secreted proteins into the ER (10.Tobin J.F. Wirth D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, a number of specialized features are apparent in the secretory systems of Leishmania and related organisms, particularly the necessity to traffic large quantities of lipid-anchored molecules to the cell surface. In addition, and uniquely to these parasites, all exo- and endocytosis at the cell surface occurs via the flagellar pocket, an invagination of the plasma membrane at the base of the single flagellum (11.Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12.Overath P. Stierhof Y.-D. Wiese M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Absence of ER secretory signals within the HASP family would preclude ER transport through the classical secretory pathway, i.e.via translocation through a sec61p complex into the ER lumen. This suggestion is supported by the observation that HASPB is not glycosylated, despite the presence of several consensusN-glycosylation sites. 2T. M. Alce and D. F. Smith, unpublished data. 2T. M. Alce and D. F. Smith, unpublished data. These properties place HASPB among a group of eukaryotic proteins that lack an ER-targeting secretory signal but are still exported out of the cell, by so called “non-classical” transport (13.Kuchler K. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 421-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14.Cleves A.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R318-R320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examples of proteins undergoing non-classical export include fibroblast growth factors-1 and -2, interleukin-1, yeast a-factor, and galectin. Export of Saccharomyces cerevisiae a-factor is the best understood; this short, 12-amino acid lipoprotein is exported via an ATP binding cassette transporter (15.Kuchler K. Sterne R.E. Thorner J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3973-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). By contrast, galectin appears to be released from the plasma membrane of mammalian cells through vesicular budding (16.Mehul B. Hughes R.C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly via a novel pathway involving a transporter (17.Cleves A.E. Cooper D.N.W. Barondes S.H. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 5: 1017-1026Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It is unclear at present whether the examples of “non-classically” exported proteins cited above use the same or different mechanisms, and it is highly possible that several auxiliary systems are present.Here we report that the 18-amino acid N-terminal region of HASPB is acylated in vivo and is sufficient to target a heterologous protein (Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein, GFP) to the cell surface of Leishmania. In addition, we demonstrate that HASPB is also exported by mammalian cells, suggesting that this pathway is also present in higher eukaryotes.DISCUSSIONIn the absence of a secretory signal sequence, a GPI-anchor consensus, or transmembrane domain, the pathway and mechanisms that facilitate localization of the HASP family proteins to theLeishmania cell surface have been unknown to date. Here, a deletion strategy has identified the extreme N terminus of HASPB as being essential for surface presentation of the protein. The presence of N-myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs within these residues indicates that dual acylation may mediate membrane association and also potentially act as the cell surface anchor for HASPB.Two Signals Are Required for Plasma Membrane TargetingMetabolic labeling indicated that glycine 2 and cysteine 5 in the HASPB N-terminal region are required for myristoylation and palmitoylation. Co-translational myristoylation is required for post-translational palmitoylation to occur, in agreement with the hypothesis that a myristate moiety is required to bring the protein to a membrane-bound palmitoylacyltransferase (23.Resh M.D. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). According to the two-signal model (23.Resh M.D. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), such modifications would be sufficient to allow the stable association of HASPB with membranes previously observed (5.Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6.Pimenta P.F.P. Da Silva P.P. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Sacks D.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 468-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Many proteins have been shown to be targeted to the plasma membrane by dual acylation. The mechanism of targeting is unclear, although the identification of a Gα protein palmitoylacyltransferase activity in plasma membrane fractions (30.Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) supports a model in which an N-myristoylated protein could become “trapped” in a lipid bilayer when it associates with this putative enzyme and is palmitoylated (Refs. 31.van't Hof W. Resh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and 32.Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and references therein).The requirement of dual acylation for stable membrane association and targeting to the plasma membrane was tested using a series of fusion proteins expressed in L. major, in which the N-terminal HASPB 18 amino acids were fused to the N terminus of GFP. Cell fractionation demonstrated that both myristate and palmitate were necessary for efficient membrane binding; myristate alone led to only partial association. Epifluorescent microscopic analyses were consistent with these observations, as the fusion protein required both myristoylation and palmitoylation signals to facilitate localization to the plasma membrane.Trafficking of HASP through the CellThe route dually acylated proteins take to the plasma membrane has only recently been investigated. Trafficking of theN-myristoylated/palmitoylated Src tyrosine kinase, Fyn, to the plasma membrane in mammalian cells is thought to occur very rapidly via a novel pathway (31.van't Hof W. Resh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Another dually acylated Src protein, Lck, was found at the plasma membrane and in the Golgi by co-localization when expressed in certain mammalian cell lines (33.Bijlmakers M.-J. J.E. Isobe-Nakamura M. Ruddock L.J. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These observations implicate the Golgi apparatus in Lck trafficking. Immunoelectron microscopy of L. major expressing full-length GENE10-tagged HASPB or the parental GFP construct, HASPB18::GFP, revealed the protein localizing primarily to the plasma membrane but with some Golgi-associated staining (only detectable by this highly sensitive method). Such data support an hypothesis in which the Golgi and by extrapolation the exocytic pathway are involved in both Src and HASP trafficking. Another particularly striking observation is that mutation of the HASP palmitoylation site in this chimera leads to the protein concentrating in an organelle stained by a Golgi-specific lipid marker. This supports the suggestion that palmitoylation ofN-myristoylated proteins occurs at a membranous structure possibly belonging to the exocytic pathway (33.Bijlmakers M.-J. J.E. Isobe-Nakamura M. Ruddock L.J. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This situation is reminiscent of the trafficking of certain acylated Ras proteins that have recently been suggested to be targeted to the endomembrane network (including the Golgi) by virtue of prenylation. Further trafficking of these proteins to the plasma membrane is dependent upon subsequent palmitoylation (34.Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar).Therefore, this study implicates the exocytic structures in the transport of HASP, despite the lack of an ER secretory signal. In addition, like other dually acylated proteins (31.van't Hof W. Resh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the trafficking of HASPB in a mammalian system was unaffected by brefeldin A, a potent inhibitor of anterograde vesicular transport (data not shown). Our data, like that of Bijlmakers et al. (33.Bijlmakers M.-J. J.E. Isobe-Nakamura M. Ruddock L.J. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), imply that palmitoylation occurs in the region of the Golgi, with subsequent re-localization to the plasma membrane. This contrasts with the proposal that Fyn is targeted directly to and palmitoylated at the plasma membrane (31.van't Hof W. Resh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, van't Hof and Resh (31.van't Hof W. Resh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) detected a small quantity of Fyn in Golgi membrane fractions. This fraction could be analogous to the HASPB detected in the region of the Golgi apparatus and could explain the partial perinuclear localization of Fyn (31.van't Hof W. Resh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Recently, several studies have suggested that proteins modified by saturated acyl groups are targeted to detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) rafts in mammalian cells (35.Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). These DRMs are implicated in protein sorting in the secretory pathway (36.Simons K. Ikonian E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). In keeping with our trafficking model, it may be predicted thatN-myristoylated/palmitoylated proteins associate with DRMs on the cytoplasmic face of structures in the exocytic pathway and are subsequently transported to the plasma membrane. It is possible that any other machinery required for localization is brought to its protein target by association with these rafts. In the case of HASP, this machinery may include a palmitoylacyltransferase and some translocation channel, such as that discussed below, to allow the protein to reach the extracellular environment.HASP Appears to Be Localized to the Cell Surface by a Conserved, Novel PathwayDespite incomplete characterization of the mechanism, it is clear that N-myristoylation/palmitoylation is sufficient to traffic a large number of proteins to the plasma membrane (32.Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Unlike these other examples, HASPB is surface-localized in L. major (5.Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6.Pimenta P.F.P. Da Silva P.P. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Sacks D.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 468-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) despite lacking any identifiable signal that could lead to translocation by the exocytic pathway. Electron microscopic and biochemical analyses demonstrate that the N-terminal 18 amino acids of HASPB are sufficient to take a heterologous protein (GFP) to the cell surface. WhereasN-myristoylation/palmitoylation is presumably sufficient to transport HASP to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, some additional determinant within the 18-amino acid signal is presumed to facilitate translocation of a proportion of the protein across the membrane and into the extracellular environment. The N-terminal 10 amino acids of HASP, maintaining the acylation consensus, are sufficient only to take GFP as far as the flagellar pocket. The reasons for biochemically detecting only 20–30% of HASPB18::GFP at the cell surface are unclear and, as discussed above, could be due to either limited surface presentation of the protein or limits inherent within the assays developed.The mechanism that would take a lipid-anchored protein from one face of the plasma membrane to the other is unclear. However, one hypothesis that would fit our data is the “flippase” model (37.Higgins C.F. Gottesman M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) in which a membrane-bound transporter protein allows translocation of the hydrophobic anchor through the lipid phase and the relatively hydrophilic polypeptide through an aqueous channel. Recent structural evidence indicates that such a model holds true for the P-glycoprotein family of transport molecules (38.Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.F. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Currently knowledge of the involvement of these proteins in the secretion of eukaryotic polypeptides is restricted to export of the yeast a -mating factor (15.Kuchler K. Sterne R.E. Thorner J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3973-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). A genetic complementation strategy may identify molecules involved in the transport of HASP to the cell surface.Whatever the mechanisms involved, the targeting and translocation of the protozoan protein, HASP, onto the surface of the plasma membrane is of general interest as it is conserved in higher eukaryotic cells. This suggests that HASP may represent the first in a family of non-classically exported, lipid-anchored surface proteins. Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania cause a spectrum of tropical and sub-tropical diseases termed the leishmaniases. Leishmania live as either extracellular, flagellated promastigotes in the digestive tract of their sandfly vector or as aflagellated amastigotes within the phagolysosomes of mammalian macrophages (1.Molyneux D. Killick-Kendrick R. Peters W. Killick-Kendrick R. The Leishmaniases in Biology and Medicine. 1. Academic Press, London1987: 122-168Google Scholar). Much research has focused on the unusually high levels of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1-anchored surface molecules present in these organisms (2.Ferguson M.A. Brimacombe J.S. Cottaz S. Field R.A. Guther L.S. Homans S.W. McConville M.J. Mehlert A. Milne K.G. Ralton J.E. Roy Y.A. Schneider P. Zitzmann N. Parasitology. 1994; 108: S45-S54Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), particularly the unique glycoconjugate, lipophosphoglycan (LPG), abundant in promastigotes (3.McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), and the metalloprotease GP63 (or leishmanolysin) (4.Frommel T.O. Button L.L. Fujikura Y. McMaster W.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic acylated surface proteins (HASPs; originally named GBP and GA/CP inLeishmania major) are a family of related surface molecules expressed only in infective parasite stages (5.Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6.Pimenta P.F.P. Da Silva P.P. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Sacks D.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 468-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These proteins are unusual in that they lack a “classical” endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretory signal sequence, a GPI-anchor consensus, or membrane-spanning domains but are surface-localized (6.Pimenta P.F.P. Da Silva P.P. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Sacks D.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 468-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), partition into the hydrophobic phase on Triton X-114 separation, and fractionate with lipid species (5.Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mechanism of transport and attachment to the cell surface is unclear, although it has been suggested that this may occur by virtue of a close association with LPG via an HASP repeat region with homology to the peptidoglycan binding domain of Staphylococcus aureusprotein A (6.Pimenta P.F.P. Da Silva P.P. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Sacks D.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 468-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). More recent studies have not substantiated this hypothesis, as HASPs are still presented on the surface of infective metacyclic parasites in the absence of LPG (7.Rangarajan D. Gokool S. McCrossan M.V. Smith D.F. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3359-3366PubMed Google Scholar). Leishmania (and other trypanosomatids) possess a conventional eukaryotic secretory pathway (8.Clayton C. Hausler T. Blattner J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 325-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Al-Qahtani A. Teilhet M. Mensa-Wilmot K. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and require a signal sequence for translocation of secreted proteins into the ER (10.Tobin J.F. Wirth D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, a number of specialized features are apparent in the secretory systems of Leishmania and related organisms, particularly the necessity to traffic large quantities of lipid-anchored molecules to the cell surface. In addition, and uniquely to these parasites, all exo- and endocytosis at the cell surface occurs via the flagellar pocket, an invagination of the plasma membrane at the base of the single flagellum (11.Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12.Overath P. Stierhof Y.-D. Wiese M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Absence of ER secretory signals within the HASP family would preclude ER transport through the classical secretory pathway, i.e.via translocation through a sec61p complex into the ER lumen. This suggestion is supported by the observation that HASPB is not glycosylated, despite the presence of several consensusN-glycosylation sites. 2T. M. Alce and D. F. Smith, unpublished data. 2T. M. Alce and D. F. Smith, unpublished data. These properties place HASPB among a group of eukaryotic proteins that lack an ER-targeting secretory signal but are still exported out of the cell, by so called “non-classical” transport (13.Kuchler K. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 421-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14.Cleves A.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R318-R320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examples of proteins undergoing non-classical export include fibroblast growth factors-1 and -2, interleukin-1, yeast a-factor, and galectin. Export of Saccharomyces cerevisiae a-factor is the best understood; this short, 12-amino acid lipoprotein is exported via an ATP binding cassette transporter (15.Kuchler K. Sterne R.E. Thorner J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3973-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). By contrast, galectin appears to be released from the plasma membrane of mammalian cells through vesicular budding (16.Mehul B. Hughes R.C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly via a novel pathway involving a transporter (17.Cleves A.E. Cooper D.N.W. Barondes S.H. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 5: 1017-1026Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It is unclear at present whether the examples of “non-classically” exported proteins cited above use the same or different mechanisms, and it is highly possible that several auxiliary systems are present. Here we report that the 18-amino acid N-terminal region of HASPB is acylated in vivo and is sufficient to target a heterologous protein (Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein, GFP) to the cell surface of Leishmania. In addition, we demonstrate that HASPB is also exported by mammalian cells, suggesting that this pathway is also present in higher eukaryotes. DISCUSSIONIn the absence of a secretory signal sequence, a GPI-anchor consensus, or transmembrane domain, the pathway and mechanisms that facilitate localization of the HASP family proteins to theLeishmania cell surface have been unknown to date. Here, a deletion strategy has identified the extreme N terminus of HASPB as being essential for surface presentation of the protein. The presence of N-myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs within these residues indicates that dual acylation may mediate membrane association and also potentially act as the cell surface anchor for HASPB.Two Signals Are Required for Plasma Membrane TargetingMetabolic labeling indicated that glycine 2 and cysteine 5 in the HASPB N-terminal region are required for myristoylation and palmitoylation. Co-translational myristoylation is required for post-translational palmitoylation to occur, in agreement with the hypothesis that a myristate moiety is required to bring the protein to a membrane-bound palmitoylacyltransferase (23.Resh M.D. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). According to the two-signal model (23.Resh M.D. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), such modifications would be sufficient to allow the stable association of HASPB with membranes previously observed (5.Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6.Pimenta P.F.P. Da Silva P.P. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Sacks D.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 468-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Many proteins have been shown to be targeted to the plasma membrane by dual acylation. The mechanism of targeting is unclear, although the identification of a Gα protein palmitoylacyltransferase activity in plasma membrane fractions (30.Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) supports a model in which an N-myristoylated protein could become “trapped” in a lipid bilayer when it associates with this putative enzyme and is palmitoylated (Refs. 31.van't Hof W. Resh M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and 32.Morales J. Fishburn C.S. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol.

Most interactions of PDZ-LIM proteins with the cytoskeleton have been identified in striated muscle, where several PDZ-LIM proteins are predominantly expressed. By contrast, CLP-36 mRNA is expressed in several nonmuscle tissues, and here we demonstrate high expression of CLP-36 in epithelial cells by in situ hybridization analysis. Our subcellular localization studies indicate that in nonmuscle cells, CLP-36 protein localizes to actin stress fibers. This localization is mediated via the PDZ domain of CLP-36 that associates with the spectrin-like repeats of α-actinin. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis indicate that both nonmuscle α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 form complexes with CLP-36. The high expression of α-actinin-4 in the colon, together with these results, suggests a specific function for the α-actinin-4-CLP-36 complex in the colonic epithelium.

The LIM-kinase interaction has been demonstrated with three PDZ-LIM proteins, mostly using yeast two-hybrid screens. Enigma was identified by virtue of association of its third LIM domain to the cytoplasmic tail of the insulin receptor; this interaction is apparently important for endocytosis of the receptor (11.Wu R.Y. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25085-25090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The association of the second LIM domain of Enigma with Ret/ptc2 is required for the plasma membrane localization and mitogenic activity of Ret/ptc2 (15.Durick K. Wu R.Y. Gill G.N. Taylor S.S. J.

The association of the LIM domain of RIL with the second and fourth PDZ domains of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BL in a yeast two-hybrid screen (17.Cuppen E. Gerrits H. Pepers B. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) suggests that the LIM domain interactions of PDZ-LIM proteins may not be limited to kinases. The association of PDZ domains with the cytoskeleton in PDZ-LIM proteins has been mostly studied in muscle due to their high specific expression in this tissue (3.Guy P.M. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Mol.

This localization is mediated by the association of Enigma PDZ domain with β-tropomyosin (3.Guy P.M. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1973-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or by the association of ALP and ZASP/Cypher1 PDZ domains with α-actinin-2 (4.Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Formentin E. Comelli A.

Masaki T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2322-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cellular α-actinin exists as an antiparallel dimer with a globular head domain, spectrin-like repeats and EF-hands (reviewed in Ref. 19.Blanchard A. Ohanian V. Critchley D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Dimerization of α-actinin is mediated by the spectrin-like repeats of α-actinin (20.Imamura M. Endo T. Kuroda M. Tanaka T.

This rod domain mediates the association with the PDZ domain of ALP, whereas ZASP binds to a 155-amino acid C-terminal region of α-actinin-2 (5.Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J.

In addition to the muscle-specific α-actinins, two nonmuscle human α-actinin isoforms, α-actinin-1 (23.Youssoufian H. McAfee M. Kwiatkowski D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 47: 62-71PubMed Google Scholar) and α-actinin-4 (24.Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), have been identified and represent independent genes. α-Actinin-1 is localized along stress fibers and takes part in bundling actin filaments (25.Lazarides E. Burridge K. Cell. 1975; 6: 289-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). It also associates with several cytoskeletal and membrane associated proteins, such as integrins (26.Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), intercellular adhesion molecules (27.Carpen O. Pallai P. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (28.Wyszynski M. Lin J. Rao A. Nigh E. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), and vinculin (29.Wachsstock D.H. Wilkins J.A. Lin S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of nonmuscle α-actinin-4 differs from that of α-actinin-1 in that α-actinin-4 is less clearly concentrated to stress fibers and is not detected in focal adhesions or cell contacts (24.Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Moreover, localization is cell type-dependent, sometimes demonstrating nuclear staining (24.Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Unlike α-actinin-1, the expression of α-actinin-4 is induced in migrating cells (24.Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). During studies on proteins associated with a partially characterized novel kinase, 1T. Vallenius and T. P. Mäkelä, unpublished data. we became interested in the CLP-36 PDZ-LIM protein. CLP-36 (also called hCLIM1; Ref. 9.Kotaka M. Ngai S.M. Garcia-Barcelo M. Tsui S.K. Fung K.P. Lee C.Y. Waye M.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was initially identified as a rat gene down-regulated during hypoxia in hepatocytes (8.Wang H. Harrison-Shostak D.C. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. Gene. 1995; 165: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).CLP-36 mRNA is expressed in several nonmuscle tissues (8.Wang H. Harrison-Shostak D.C. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. Gene. 1995; 165: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9.Kotaka M. Ngai S.M. Garcia-Barcelo M. Tsui S.K. Fung K.P. Lee C.Y. Waye M.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and here we demonstrate high expression of CLP-36 in epithelial cells by in situ hybridization analysis. Moreover, CLP-36 was found to localize to actin stress fibers via its PDZ domain through its association with cellular α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4, suggesting that CLP-36 acts as an adapter between stress fibers and LIM-binding proteins in nonmuscle cells. Embryos of CBA × NMRI mice at stages E7, E9, E11, E15, and E17.5 were timed by both vaginal plugs of mothers and by morphological criteria. The experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki. Tissue preparation and in situ hybridization using a antisense or sense RNA probe generated from human CLP-36cDNA (nucleotides 87–1504 in GenBankTM accession number U90878) were performed as described (30.Luukko K. Moshnyakov M. Sainio K. Saarma M. Sariola H. Thesleff I. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Myc-tagged CLP-36 plasmid was generated by subcloning anEcoRI-XhoI fragment from 38/JG4–5 (nucleotides 87–1504 in GenBankTM accession number U90878) intoEcoRI-SalI sites of pAMC (31.Tiainen M. Ylikorkala A. Makela T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9248-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged CLPΔ1–24 was done similarly using 51/JG4–5 (nucleotides 212–1504 in GenBankTM accession number U90878). U2OS osteosarcoma or COS-7 cells were transfected by using the calcium phosphate transfection method as described (32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal (9E10) or rabbit polyclonal (PRB-150C) antibodies against Myc epitopes were from Babco Inc. (Berkeley, CA). The following α-actinin antibodies were used: A5044 mouse monoclonal antibody to detect α-actinin-1 (Sigma), NCC-Lu-632 mouse monoclonal antibody to detect α-actinin-4 (a kind gift of Dr. Hirohashi; Ref. 24.Honda K.

Cell Biol. 1978; 79: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Transfected cells on coverslips were fixed with 3.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, labeled with antibodies or Hoechst, and analyzed as described (31.Tiainen M. Ylikorkala A. Makela T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9248-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The 0.5% Triton X-100 extraction or the 1-h cytochalasin B treatment prior to fixation were performed as described (34.Sainio M. Zhao F. Heiska L. Turunen O. den Bakker M. Zwarthoff E. Lutchman M. Rouleau G.A. Jaaskelainen J. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2249-2260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (31.Tiainen M. Ylikorkala A. Makela T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9248-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) except that the cleared supernatants in ELB (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmβ-glycerol-phosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) were incubated with 1 μl of monoclonal anti-Myc antibody for 2 h at +4 °C prior to 1 h immunoprecipitation. Western blotting analysis was according to standard procedures (32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For expression of GST-CLP-36,2 aNotI fragment from 38/pAMC was subcloned into pAcGHLT-A (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) baculovirus transfer vector, which was introduced into Sf9 insect cells together with BaculoGold baculovirus DNA as recommended by the manufacturer. For protein expression, the baculovirus was propagated in Hi5 insect cells (Invitrogen) for 48 h. The GST-CLP-36 protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose and eluted with glutathione. The bacterially produced chicken GST-α-actinin proteins (a kind gift from Dr. Critchley; Ref. 35.Salmikangas P. Mykkanen O.M. Gronholm M. Heiska L. Kere J. Carpen O. Hum. Mol.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For detection of association between cellular proteins and GST-CLP-36, 200 μg of COS-7 cell extracts in ELB were incubated with the indicated amounts of GST-CLP-36 for 2 h at +4 °C prior to adding 7.5 μl (packed volume) of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Subsequently, the beads were washed four times with ELB and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (see Fig. 6). For mapping of the CLP-36-α-actinin association, 200 μg of transfected COS-7 cell lysate in ELB were incubated with 4 μg of GST-α-actinins for 2 h at +4 °C prior to anti-Myc immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting analysis (see Fig. 4 B).Figure 4α-Actinin associates with CLP-36 via its spectrin-like repeats. A, Coomassie stain of bacterial GST-actinin fragments indicated on the right and used as input for the experiment in B. GST-ABD/R1-R2 contains the actin-binding domain and spectrin-like repeats 1 and 2; GST-R1-R4 contains all four spectrin-like repeats; GST-R3-R4/EF contains spectrin-like repeats 3 and 4 and the EF-hand. B,to map the binding site of α-actinin to CLP-36, COS-7 cell extracts expressing Myc-CLP-36 were incubated with GST-α-actinin fragments. Subsequently, anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting analysis with anti-α-actinin (α-actinin) to detect associated GST-α-actinin proteins and cellular α-actinin or with anti-Myc (Myc) to control the levels of CLP-36.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed on a BiflexTM time-of-flight instrument equipped with a nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm. CLP-36 associated α-actinin band from either U2OS or COS7 cells was cut out from the Coomassie-stained gel, digested with trypsin, eluted, and analyzed in the linear positive ion delayed extraction mode. The output was analyzed using ProFound. Northern blot analyses of CLP-36 indicated expression in various tissues with some variability between rat (8.Wang H. Harrison-Shostak D.C. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. Gene. 1995; 165: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and human (9.Kotaka M. Ngai S.M. Garcia-Barcelo M. Tsui S.K. Fung K.P. Lee C.Y. Waye M.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) tissues. To determine the pattern of expression ofCLP-36 in adult tissues and during embryogenesis, in situ hybridization analysis with an antisense CLP-36probe was performed. Hybridization of a sagittal section of a E11 mouse embryo (Fig. 1 A) indicated expression in several tissues, including dorsal root ganglia, liver, and arteries. Prominent expression was also detected throughout the skin epithelium (Fig. 1 A, SE). Analysis of earlier stage embryos indicated that the skin epithelium had a strong hybridization signal even in E9 stage embryos, in which the skin is at the single layered ectodermal stage (not shown). At stage E17.5 expression in the skin and the oral cavity epithelium (Fig. 1, B andC, OC) localized predominantly to the basal cell layer, whereas expression in the outer dental epithelium was low (Fig.1, B and C, DE). CLP-36 expression was also noted in the mucosal epithelium of the developing gut from embryonal stage E15 onwards (data not shown) and in adult intestine, as demonstrated in strong epithelial expression in the small intestine (Fig. 1, D and E, IE), whereas CLP-36 expression was undetectable in the surrounding smooth muscle layers (SM). In adult mouse tissues, a prominent expression was also noted in the epithelium of esophagus and urinary bladder, whereas expression in skeletal muscle was undetectable. The expression of CLP-36 in epithelium and other nonmuscle tissues prompted us to study its subcellular localization in cell lines of nonmuscle origin. To this end, a plasmid expressing a Myc epitope-tagged CLP-36 (Myc-CLP-36) or vector control was transiently transfected into U2OS osteosarcoma (Fig.2) or COS-7 green monkey kidney epithelial cells (not shown). Double fluorescence analysis with anti-Myc and rhodamine-labeled phalloidin from vector transfected or Myc-CLP-36 transfected cells indicated partial colocalization of CLP-36 with filaments resembling actin stress fibers (Fig. 2 A). To verify this colocalization, similar coverslips were subjected to detergent extraction or treated with cytochalasin B prior to fixation. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 B (Triton X-100), detergent extraction revealed colocalization of CLP-36 and actin stress fibers. If microfilament formation was inhibited by cytochalasin B prior to fixation, CLP-36 was partially accumulated with the disrupted actin-containing filaments (Fig. 2 B, cytochalasin B). These experiments indicate that a significant fraction of CLP-36 is associated with actin stress fibers. During the immunoprecipitation studies, it was noted that whenever Myc-CLP-36 was purified from cell lysates, a prominent associated protein of approximately 100 kDa was detected when staining for total protein. The size of the polypeptide together with the immunofluorescence pattern of CLP-36 suggested that the band represented α-actinin. Moreover, based on interactions of the other PDZ-LIM proteins (3.Guy P.M. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1973-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4.Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5.Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), the association was further predicted to be mediated by the PDZ domain of CLP-36. To test this hypothesis, immunoprecipitates from cells expressing either Myc-CLP-36 or a mutant lacking part of the PDZ domain (Myc-CLPΔ1–24) were analyzed by Western blotting with an α-actinin antibody (33.Fujiwara K. Porter M.E. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 79: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). α-Actinin was only detected in the lane immunoprecipitated with the full-length CLP-36 (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the first 24 amino acids of CLP-36 are required for α-actinin binding and thus suggesting that an intact PDZ domain is required for binding. The inability of Myc-CLPΔ1–24 to associate with α-actinin was associated with loss of localization to stress fibers (Fig.3 B). This indicates that CLP-36 localization to stress fibers is mediated through its association with α-actinin. Previously PDZ-LIM proteins have been reported to associate with two distinct regions of α-actinin (4.Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5.Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction site of α-actinin with CLP-36 was mapped using three fragments of α-actinin-1 fused to GST. GST-ABD/R1-R2 contains the actin-binding domain and spectrin-like repeats 1 and 2; GST-R1-R4 contains all four spectrin-like repeats; GST-R3-R4/EF contains spectrin-like repeats 3 and 4 and the EF-hand. Bacterially produced proteins (Fig. 4 A) were incubated with Myc-CLP-36 expressing or control cell extracts. Following anti-Myc immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, the presence of Myc-CLP-36 (Fig. 4 B, Myc) and of copurified α-actinin fragments was analyzed (Fig. 4 B, α-actinin). The results indicated the presence of significant amounts of GST-R1-R4 in CLP-36 immunoprecipitates. Low levels GST-ABD/R1-R2 were also detected specifically in CLP-36 immunoprecipitates. The presence of GST-R3-R4/EF was due to unspecific binding, as it was also detected in the control lane. Association of the endogenous α-actinin with CLP-36 was also noted in all cases, as expected (Fig. 4 B, α-actinin). However, the level of associated α-actinin decreased in the presence of GST-R1-R4 indicating competitive binding of these with CLP-36. As endogenous α-actinin and GST-R1-R4 were detected using the same antibody, the results also demonstrated that the total amount of CLP-36-associated GST-R1-R4 was significantly higher than CLP-36-associated endogenous α-actinin. This indicates that association of GST-R1-R4 with CLP-36 is not mediated indirectly through dimerization with endogenous α-actinin. As the levels of CLP-36-associated GST-ABD/R1-R2 were lower than those of endogenous α-actinin, the same conclusion cannot be made for GST-ABD/R1-R2. Taken together, these results indicate that the efficient association of CLP-36 with α-actinin is mediated via the spectrin-like repeats. The expression of CLP-36 in nonmuscle cells suggested that it could associate with either α-actinin-1 or the closely related α-actinin-4. To investigate this, double fluorescence analysis of U2OS cells expressing Myc-CLP-36 was performed with anti-Myc and either A5044 to detect α-actinin-1 or NCC-Lu-632 to detect α-actinin-4. As shown in Fig. 5 A, Myc-CLP-36 was colocalized both with α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 specifically in stress fibers and was more clearly detected after Triton X-100 pretreatment. CLP-36 was not detected in areas of focal adhesions. In addition, anti-Myc immunoprecipitates from Myc-CLP-36 expressing cells contained both α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 (Fig.5 B). To estimate the stoichiometry of binding of α-actinin to CLP-36, varying amounts of the GST-CLP-36 protein were incubated with 200 μg of COS-7 cell lysate and subsequently purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads and analyzed with a Coomassie stain of SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). A prominent band of approximately 100 kDa representing α-actinin was the only protein detected in addition to GST-CLP-36. An approximate mass ratio of 2:3 for GST-CLP-36 and α-actinin was linear until α-actinin in the lysate became limiting. Considering the molecular masses of GST-CLP-36 (66 kDa) and α-actinin (103 kDa) this mass ratio indicates an equimolar complex, and together with the higher affinity of CLP-36 to actinin dimers, it suggests that two molecules of CLP-36 are associated with an α-actinin dimer. The efficient purification of soluble α-actinin from the cell extracts using GST-CLP-36 also enabled analysis of this protein by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis, which indicated the presence of both α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 in the 100-kDa band. The present study demonstrates that nonmuscle α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 associate with the PDZ domain of CLP-36 in actin stress fibers. This, together with the abundant expression ofCLP-36 in skin and intestinal epithelia and other nonmuscle tissues, implicates a role for it as an adapter between stress fibers and LIM-binding proteins in these tissues. The high expression of α-actinin-4 in the colon and in epithelial cells (24.Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J.

The expression pattern observed in the mouse in situhybridization analyses is in concordance with previous Northern blotting data from rat tissues (8.Wang H. Harrison-Shostak D.C. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. Gene. 1995; 165: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), both indicating thatCLP-36 is not expressed in skeletal muscle. However, a positive signal in Northern blotting analysis from human skeletal muscle (9.Kotaka M. Ngai S.M. Garcia-Barcelo M. Tsui S.K. Fung K.P. Lee C.Y. Waye M.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggests either species-specific expression differences or the presence of a closely related human gene. Analysis of expressed sequence tag data base content did not reveal closely related cDNAs, and 8 of 244 (3.3%) human CLP-36 expressed sequence tags were from skeletal muscle, supporting low relative expression of human CLP-36 in this tissue. Previous studies have implicated roles for PDZ-LIM proteins in skeletal muscle. This is based both on the muscle-oriented approaches used in prior studies (3.Guy P.M. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Mol. Biol.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 61-68PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Bashirova A.A. Markelov M.L. Shlykova T.V. Levshenkova E.V. Alibaeva R.A. Frolova E.I. Gene. 1998; 210: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), indicate that the PDZ-LIM family is similarly involved in mediating interactions of LIM-binding proteins with the cytoskeleton in other tissue types. In this regard, it is also interesting to note that the mRNA expression of RIL is concentrated in the epithelial cells (7.Kiess M. Scharm B. Aguzzi A. Hajnal A. Klemenz R. Schwarte-Waldhoff I. Schafer R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 61-68PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is a notable difference in tissue distribution between RIL and CLP-36. RIL is highly expressed in the epithelium of brain, testis, mid-size bronchii, uterine tubae and stomach, whereas CLP-36 mRNA expression in these tissues is low or undetectable. Although the subcellular localization and the PDZ domain associated protein of RIL have not been identified, it is interesting to speculate that these two close relatives might share a common function specific for a particular type of epithelium. An extension of this hypothesis includes ALP, the third close relative of CLP-36 and RIL, with a nonoverlapping expression pattern (5.Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). ALP could mediate a similar or related function in skeletal muscle. CLP-36 was predominantly localized to stress fibers in an apparently PDZ domain-dependent fashion. CLP-36 also directly associated with α-actinin in an apparently PDZ domain-dependent fashion, indicating that CLP-36 localization to stress fibers is mediated via α-actinin. Interaction of CLP-36 with α-actinin is not limited to stress fibers, as CLP-36 efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with cellular α-actinin from nonionic, low detergent cell lysates. Analysis of solubleversus insoluble fraction of such lysates indicated that roughly equal amounts of both α-actinin and CLP-36 are present in soluble and insoluble fractions (data not shown). Based on these results, it is interesting to speculate that the soluble α-actinin may represent a free pool to be used for rapid reorganization of actin stress fibers in nonmuscle cells and that the associated CLP-36 could be involved in this function. CLP-36 associated efficiently with an α-actinin fragment containing all four spectrin-like repeats. Previously, all four repeats were demonstrated to be required for a maximally stable α-actinin dimer (21.Flood G. Kahana E. Gilmore A.P. Rowe A.J. Gratzer W.B. Critchley D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22.Djinovic-Carugo K. Young P. Gautel M. Saraste M. Cell. 1999; 98: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that CLP-36 associates with α-actinin dimers. This fits well with the observed stoichiometry of the CLP-36-α-actinin complex, indicating that two molecules of CLP-36 are associated with an α-actinin dimer. The identification of PDZ domain interactions has revealed the association of several PDZ-LIM proteins with the microfilaments (3.Guy P.M. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1973-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4.Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that the primary function of these proteins is to act as adapters between the cytoskeleton and LIM-binding proteins (3.Guy P.M. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1973-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6.Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). So what are these LIM-binding proteins? The identified interactions of some LIM domains with serine/threonine kinases (6.Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol.

This is supported by our original identification of the LIM domain of CLP-36 in a yeast two-hybrid screen using a novel partially characterized serine/threonine kinase.2 This would point to a role for CLP-36 in recruiting kinase(s) to actin stress fibers via α-actinin binding.

From the identified metabolites a number of routes between isoleucine and active amyl alcohol seemed possible. All involved the initial decarboxylation of isoleucine to α-keto-β-methylvalerate. The first, via branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase to α-methylbutyryl-CoA, was eliminated because abolition of branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase in an lpd1disruption mutant did not prevent the formation of active amyl alcohol. However, the lpd1 mutant still produced large amounts of α-methylbutyrate which initially seemed contradictory because it had been assumed that α-methylbutyrate was derived from α-methylbutyryl-CoA via acyl-CoA hydrolase. Subsequently it was observed that α-methylbutyrate arises from the non-enzymic oxidation of α-methylbutyraldehyde (the immediate decarboxylation product of α-keto-β-methylvalerate). Mutant studies showed that one of the decarboxylases encoded by PDC1, PDC5, PDC6, YDL080c, or YDR380w must be present to allow yeast to utilize α-keto-β-methylvalerate. Apparently, any one of this family of decarboxylases is sufficient to allow the catabolism of isoleucine to active amyl alcohol. This is the first demonstration of a role for the gene product of YDR380w, and it also shows that the decarboxylation steps for each α-keto acid in the catabolic pathways of leucine, valine, and isoleucine are accomplished in subtly different ways. In leucine catabolism, the enzyme encoded by YDL080c is solely responsible for the decarboxylation of α-ketoisocaproate, whereas in valine catabolism any one of the isozymes of pyruvate decarboxylase will decarboxylate α-ketoisovalerate.

In most eukaryotes the carbon skeletons derived from these amino acids enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle, whereas in yeasts the end products are the so-called “fusel” alcohols. We have previously used a combination of 13C NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS),1 and selected mutants to examine the catabolism of leucine and valine inSaccharomyces cerevisiae to the end products isoamyl alcohol and isobutyl alcohol, respectively (1.Dickinson J.R.

Both amino acids are first deaminated yielding α-ketoisocaproate from leucine and α-ketoisovalerate from valine. Subsequently, the α-keto acids are decarboxylated by different enzymes as follows: α-ketoisocaproate is decarboxylated by α-ketoisocaproate decarboxylase (the product of the open reading frame YDL080c for which we suggested the gene name “KID1” (1.Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)), whereas any one of the isozymes of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC1, PDC5, or PDC6 gene products) will decarboxylate α-ketoisovalerate (2.Dickinson J.R. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25751-25756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Three major questions about the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids in yeast remain unanswered. First, there has been no systematic examination of the route(s) of isoleucine catabolism. Notions first proposed over 90 years ago (3.Ehrlich F. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1907; 40: 1027-1047Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and now known as the “Ehrlich pathway” are still assumed to be correct. Second, the enzyme(s) involved in the subsequent metabolism of the putative aldehydes to the fusel alcohol end products are also unknown. These are presumed to be alcohol dehydrogenases. It has been suggested that the ethanol dehydrogenases encoded by ADH1and ADH2 that are involved in central carbon metabolism are responsible (4.Webb A.D. Ingraham J.L. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1963; 5: 317-353Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but the evidence is not fully convincing. Furthermore, since that suggestion was made, two more ethanol dehydrogenases (encoded by ADH3 and ADH4) (5.Young E.T. Williamson V.M. Taguchi A.K.W. Smith M. Sledziewski A. Russel D. Osterman J. Denis C.L. Cox D. Beier D. Basic Life Sci. 1982; 19: 335-361PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Williamson V.M. Paquin C.E. Mol. Gen.

Oliver S.G. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1591-1600PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Delneri D. Gardner D.C.J. Bruschi C.V. Oliver S.G. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1681-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have been discovered. Third, despite the fact that branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase has been purified from S. cerevisiae and its kinetic properties characterized (9.Dickinson J.R. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2029-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10.Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. Dickinson J.R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 911-922PubMed Google Scholar), there is no known physiological role for this activity. In an attempt to solve the first of these questions we started to determine the metabolic pathway(s) used in the catabolism of isoleucine to active amyl alcohol (2-methylbutanol). The strains used are shown in Table I. Standard genetic techniques (11.Sherman F. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 11: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12.Mortimer R.K. Hawthorn D.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 11: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were used in all cases. Strain 53.1.4 was constructed by mating strain MML22 to JRD719 and sporulation of the resultant diploid. Since both parents in this cross carriedura3 mutations, haploid progeny segregating thelpd1::URA3 mutation were recognized by the ability to grow on glucose minimal medium lacking uracil and the inability to grow on any media in which glycerol was the carbon source (10.Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. Dickinson J.R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 911-922PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Lanterman M.M. Dickinson J.R. Danner D.J. Hum. Mol.

Enzyme assays showed that strain 53.1.4 lacked pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase as a consequence of the lpd1::URA3mutation. Strain 55.2.1 was constructed by mating Y14216 to JRD329 and sporulation of the resultant diploid. Segregation of theydr380w::KANMX4 allele was followed by the ability to grow in the presence of the antibiotic G418 (geneticin at 200 μg/ml). Strain 56.9.2 was constructed by crossing Y14216 with JRD815–6.1. In this cross the genotypes of the progeny were established by the following four criteria. First, strains that carried both the ydr380w::KANMX4 andydl080c::KANMX4 disruption alleles were identified in asci which segregated two G418-resistant and two G418-sensitive spore progeny. Second, those strains that were also pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 triple mutants were identified by their inability to grow on glucose-containing media. Third, strain 56.9.2 was backcrossed toY14216 and 50.2.4. A ydr380w::KANMX4 ydl080c::KANMX4 double mutant is expected to yield all G418-resistant progeny when backcrossed to a strain that carries either a ydr380w::KANMX4 mutation or aydl080c::KANMX4 mutation, whereas a single mutant (in either gene) will give 25% G418-sensitive spores when backcrossed to a mutant defective in the other gene. Strain 56.9.2 gave entirely G418-resistant progeny in both backcrosses. Finally, theydr380w::KANMX4 andydl080c::KANMX4 disruptions were verified by diagnostic polymerase chain reactions using specific primers that yielded products that were unique to each disruption allele. Strain 57.2.13 was constructed by crossing strains 55.2.1 and 51.1.3. Spore progeny that carried both the ydr380w::KANMX4 andydl080c::KANMX4 disruption alleles were identified as described above.Table IYeast strains usedStrainComplete genotypeSource or Ref.IWD72MATα9.Dickinson J.R.

Open table in a new tab Starter cultures were grown in a medium comprising 1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, and 2% carbon source. For studies of isoleucine catabolism, cells were grown in minimal medium containing (per liter) 1.67 g of Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco), 20 g of isoleucine, and either 20 ml of ethanol or 20 g of glucose for the carbon source. Experiments involving 13C labeling used [U-13C]isoleucine (99.9 atom %) from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). Auxotrophic requirements were supplied as required at 20 μg/ml. Liquid cultures were grown in conical flasks filled to 40% nominal capacity in a gyrorotatory shaker. Agar (2%) was used to solidify media. All cell cultures were at 30 °C. 13C NMR spectra were recorded and signals identified exactly as described previously (1.Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Chemical shifts (δ, ppm) are reported relative to external tetramethylsilane in C2HCl3; addition of sodium trimethylsilylpropanesulfonate gave a methyl signal at −2.6 ppm under the conditions used here. Active amyl alcohol and α-methylbutyrate levels were determined in culture filtrates by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on a 30-m (0.32 mm internal diameter) fused silica capillary column with a 0.25-μm film of Supelcowax 10 (Supelco) in a Voyager GC-MS (ThermoQuest Finnigan, Manchester, UK) The injector temperature was 250 °C, and the samples were chromatographed for 2 min at 60 °C followed by a temperature increase of 10 °C/min to 200 °C which was then maintained for the remaining 4 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 30 kPa and a constant flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Standard solutions of active amyl alcohol and α-methylbutyric acid gave linear calibrations over the range 0–1000 μg/ml. Fig.1 shows the 13C NMR spectrum of a culture supernatant of a wild-type strain that had been cultured for 24 h in a minimal medium in which glucose was the carbon source and [U-13C]isoleucine the sole nitrogen source. The use of uniformly labeled isoleucine helped in the assignment of the resonances in the NMR spectrum. This is because every resonance in the metabolites derived from isoleucine is a multiplet. Analysis of the multiplets and their couplings allows unambiguous identification. The isoleucine multiplets (not shown) all displayed an average of 4.4% singlet due to the presence of unlabeled (12C) isoleucine in the substrate from the supplier. Of the remaining 95.6%13C-labeled amino acids approximately 0.6% was [U-13C]leucine. Thus, only 95% of the material fed to yeast was actually [U-13C]isoleucine, and thus the leucine observed in the spectrum in Fig. 1 was due to this contaminant and not due to biosynthesis from isoleucine. The three compounds that were 13C-labeled at every position were α-keto-β-methylvalerate, α-methylbutyrate, and active amyl alcohol. Clearly, these were all derived from the [U-13C]isoleucine substrate. No natural abundance resonances of glucose were observed which indicates that all of the glucose had been consumed. However, resonances of ethanol and glycerol derived from the glucose were evident. From the metabolites identified a number of routes between isoleucine and active amyl alcohol seemed possible (Fig.2). All involve the initial decarboxylation of isoleucine to α-keto-β-methylvalerate. Route “A” envisages oxidative decarboxylation of α-keto-β-methylvalerate via branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase to yield α-methylbutyryl-CoA. Next, α-methylbutyryl-CoA could be converted by acyl-CoA hydrolase to α-methylbutyrate, which could then be reduced to active amyl alcohol. Alternatively, α-keto-β-methylvalerate could be decarboxylated by one or more of the isozymes of pyruvate decarboxylase (route “B”) or a pyruvate decarboxylase-like enzyme (route “C”). The final possibility was route “D” involving either the direct or indirect conversion of α-keto-β-methylvalerate to α-methylbutyrate. A variety of mutants was deployed to elucidate the pathway used for the catabolism of isoleucine to active amyl alcohol. Mutant strain 53.1.4 (lpd1::URA3) which lacks lipoamide dehydrogenase and, as a consequence, also lacks pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase, and glycine decarboxylase (13.Lanterman M.M.

Strain 53.1.4 grew to only one-quarter the density of the wild-type strain IWD72 (Fig.3 and Fig.4) which is not unexpected considering the metabolic disadvantages suffered by the lpd1 mutant relative to the wild type. However, two other facts were remarkable. First, the levels of active amyl alcohol on a per cell basis were similar in both strains (Table II) indicating that branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase cannot be required for the formation of active amyl alcohol. Second, large amounts of α-methylbutyrate were formed by both strains (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). These results were clearly contrary to the idea that α-methylbutyrate is formed from α-methylbutyryl-CoA because thelpd1 mutant cannot form α-methylbutyryl-CoA.Figure 4Growth and active amyl alcohol formation by mutant strain 53.1.4 in glucose minimal medium with isoleucine as sole nitrogen source. ●, A 600 nm; ▴, active amyl alcohol in the medium (μg/ml); ▪, α-methylbutyrate in the medium (μg/ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IIAmount of active amyl alcohol produced by various strains growing in minimal medium with isoleucine as sole source of nitrogenStrainRelevant genotypeCarbon sourceActive amyl alcoholActive amyl alcoholμg/mlμg/10 6 cellsIWD72Wild typeGlucose 958 9.68IWD72Wild typeEthanol 290 3.63YSH5.127.-17Cpdc1 pdc5 pdc6Ethanol 396 7.07JRD815–6.1pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c::KanMX4Ethanol 145 3.2653.1.4lpd1Glucose 213 5.8855.2.1ydr380w::KANMX4Glucose102411.3656.9.2pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c::KANMX4 ydr380w::KANMX4Ethanol 0 057.2.13ydl080c::KANMX4 ydr380w::KANMX4Glucose 526 7Active amyl alcohol content was determined in the deceleration phase when it was maximal.

Open table in a new tab Active amyl alcohol content was determined in the deceleration phase when it was maximal. Values are the means of duplicate determinations. Differences between samples were <4%. Since branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase had been excluded, it seemed likely that some sort of decarboxylase activity was involved instead. The non-oxidative decarboxylation of α-keto-β-methylvalerate would initially yield α-methylbutyraldehyde. A series of time-elapsed 13C NMR spectra revealed that this compound oxidized very rapidly to α-methylbutyrate in sterile glucose minimal medium containing 2% isoleucine when incubated at 30 °C with shaking (data not shown). The sterile growth medium contained no α-methylbutyrate initially, so the compound was not formed upon autoclaving, and none was formed when growth medium was incubated without the addition of α-methylbutyraldehyde. α-Methylbutyraldehyde oxidized more slowly at pH 6.0 in 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 15%2H2O in a stationary 5-mm NMR tube at 20 °C. Even so, after 4 days, approximately 75% had become converted to α-methylbutyrate. Hence, the formation of α-methylbutyrate seems to be due entirely to chemical, rather than biochemical processes. Strain YSH5.127.-17C (pdc1 pdc5 pdc6) which is totally devoid of pyruvate decarboxylase (17.Hohmann S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7963-7969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and strain JRD815–6.1 (pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c::KANMX4) which lacks pyruvate decarboxylase and α-ketoisocaproate decarboxylase (1.Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) grew on ethanol minimal medium in which isoleucine was the sole source of nitrogen and produced similar amounts of active amyl alcohol both to each other and also to the wild-type strain IWD72 (Table II). Apparently, some other decarboxylase must be involved in this pathway. A search of the Saccharomyces Genome Data base revealed the existence of the open reading frame YDR380w on chromosome IV which encodes a protein of unknown function with homology to the isozymes of pyruvate decarboxylase encoded by PDC1, PDC5, andPDC6 and the α-ketoisocaproate decarboxylase encoded by YDL080c which we have suggested should be called KID1 (1.Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that the homologies between all five proteins are significant and extend over virtually the whole length of all of the proteins. YDL080c and YDR380w encode proteins with slightly extended N termini, and YDL080c also encodes a longer C terminus than all of the others. Apart from this, the decarboxylase and thiamine diphosphate binding site motifs are conserved. The protein encoded by YDR380w is 35% identical to Pdc1p. Mutant strain 55.2.1 which has a deletion and disruption in YDR380w grew on isoleucine as sole nitrogen source and formed normal amounts of active amyl alcohol (Table II). Strain 56.9.2, which lacks all three isozymes of pyruvate decarboxylase as well as both of the decarboxylases encoded by YDL080c and YDR380w, also grew to high densities on ethanol minimal medium with isoleucine as sole source of nitrogen. However, this quintuple mutant did not produce active amyl alcohol (Table II). Strain 57.2.13 which is defective in both YDL080c and YDR380w grew well and produced normal amounts of active amyl alcohol (Table II). Taken together these results demonstrate that one of the decarboxylases encoded by PDC1, PDC5, PDC5,YDL080c, or YDR380w must be present to allow yeast to utilize α-keto-β-methylvalerate. Apparently, any one of the decarboxylases is sufficient to allow the catabolism of isoleucine to active amyl alcohol. This is a degree of complexity not previously entertained for the Ehrlich pathway. YDR380w has recently been shown to have Aro80p-dependent induction by tryptophan (18.Iraqui I. Vissers S. André B. Urrestarazu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3360-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). With its obvious appearance as a decarboxylase, and regulation by tryptophan, it has been suggested that YDR380w could encode indolepyruvate decarboxylase (the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of indole pyruvate to indole acetaldehyde in the tryptophan catabolic pathway) (18.Iraqui I. Vissers S. André B. Urrestarazu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3360-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). With this in mind, strains carrying the ydr380w::KANMX4 allele were examined for an inability to grow on minimal medium with 2% tryptophan as sole source of nitrogen. Although the original strain Y14216 from EUROSCARF did not grow on tryptophan as sole nitrogen source, crosses to other strains showed this to be merely due to the FY1679 genetic background and not an inherent property of the ydr380w mutation. Of course, this simple experiment does not prove that YDR380w does not encode an indolepyruvate decarboxylase activity because there may be several decarboxylases that can decarboxylate indole pyruvate. However, strain 56.9.2 was able to grow on ethanol minimal medium with tryptophan as sole source of nitrogen, so if there is degeneracy of indolepyruvate decarboxylase, it must be accomplished by an enzyme other than Pdc1p, Pdc5p, Pdc6p, and Kid1p. Analysis of the metabolism of [U-13C]isoleucine by the wild-type strain initially suggested four credible routes from α-keto-β-methylvalerate to active amyl alcohol (Fig. 2). Experiments using a range of different mutants led to the conclusion that any one of the decarboxylases encoded by PDC1, PDC5, PDC6, YDL080c, or YDR380w can catalyze the decarboxylation of α-keto-β-methylvalerate. Thus, the decarboxylation step for each α-keto acid in the catabolic pathways of leucine, valine, and isoleucine are accomplished in subtly different ways. In leucine catabolism, the enzyme encoded by YDL080c is solely responsible for the decarboxylation of α-ketoisocaproate (1.Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) while in valine catabolism; any one of the isozymes of pyruvate decarboxylase will decarboxylate α-ketoisovalerate (2.Dickinson J.R. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25751-25756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Presumably, this degree of degeneracy allows the yeast cell to perform essential processes under a wide range of differing physiological conditions. However, this is currently mere speculation until the full spectrum of expression and regulation of all of these decarboxylases has been established. Since YDR380w and YDL080c encode proteins capable of decarboxylating α-keto-β-methylvalerate, this means that the YDL080c gene product is involved in three biochemical pathways. In leucine catabolism it encodes α-ketoisocaproate decarboxylase activity which led us to suggest the gene name KID1 (1.Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It has also been identified as “THI3” with a rather mysterious role in thiamine biosynthesis (19.Nishimura H. Kawasaki Y. Kaneko Y. Nosaka K. Iwashima A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4701-4706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Hohmann S. Meacock P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 201-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Perhaps this gene has even more roles in metabolism that have not yet been discerned. Of course, if these roles are shared with other genes, they will only be discovered when YDL080c is deleted along with the other gene(s) involved. YDR380w is involved in isoleucine catabolism and possibly also tryptophan catabolism. There is another more distant relative of this family of proteins encoded by YEL020c which is 23% identical to Pdc1p. At present its function is completely unknown. The observation that substantial quantities of α-methylbutyrate were produced non-enzymically from α-methylbutyraldehyde may have significance in commercial yeast fermentations especially the brewing of beer. Active amyl alcohol and esters derived from it are important flavor compounds, whereas α-methylbutyrate has a most unpleasant odor. Thus, attempts to increase the concentration of the desirable active amyl alcohol could have the entirely opposite effect by causing the concomitant increase in the undesirable α-methylbutyrate. The present study and our previous studies (1.Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol.

At first sight this seems to make the physiological role of this enzyme more of a mystery. In fact, the contrary is true because it offers an explanation for one of Ehrlich's long standing conundrums. Ehrlich could not explain why in complex media there was no correlation between the kinetics of amino acid utilization and fusel alcohol formation (3.Ehrlich F. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1907; 40: 1027-1047Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 4.Webb A.D. Ingraham J.L. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1963; 5: 317-353Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is now known that the highest specific activity of branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase is observed in cells growing in complex media when glycerol is the carbon source (9.Dickinson J.R. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2029-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In minimal media where a branched-chain amino acid is the sole nitrogen source, branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase is not involved in fusel alcohol formation. Hence, in complex media catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids proceeds via branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase, and fusel alcohols are not formed."

Kiviat N.B. Bonadio J.F. Pediatr. Pathol. 1990; 10: 1-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The WT1 gene is predominantly expressed in the developing kidney, but WT1 expression is also detected in the fetal gonad, spleen, mesothelium, breast, and other tissues (reviewed in Ref. 2.Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). During early nephrogenesis, WT1 expression is first detected in the metanephric mesenchyme. At the onset of epithelial differentiation, WT1 expression increases as the mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric bud condenses to form primary vesicles. These cells further differentiate into comma- and S-shaped bodies, and subsequently mature into glomeruli and proximal tubules. This phenomenon and the finding that mice null for WT1 fail to develop kidneys (3.Kreidberg J.A. Sariola H. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar) suggest an essential role for WT1 in controlling the mesenchymal-epithelial transition of renal development. WT1 differs from other tumor suppressor genes such as Rb and p53 in that Rb and p53 are widely expressed in a variety of developing and adult tissues, while WT1 expression is restricted. The restricted pattern of WT1 expression suggests that its growth-suppressive properties may be linked to its role in organogenesis. WT1 gene encodes a Cys-His zinc finger transcription factor, which functions as both a transcriptional repressor and activator (2.Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Isoforms C and D include a 3-amino acid (KTS) segment between zinc fingers three and four of the protein, which alters the DNA binding specificity of the protein, while isoforms B and D include a 17-amino acid segment involved in transcriptional regulation.

A problem in the interpretation of many of these studies has been the lack of a model for the action of WT1 in inducing both differentiation and growth control. We found that expression of WT1 in mesenchymal fibroblasts both suppresses cell growth (13.Luo X.-N. Reddy J.C. Yeyati P.L. Idris A.H. Hosono S. Haber D.A. Licht J.D. Atweh G.F.

These WT1-expressing NIH 3T3 cells exhibit desmosome-like structures and increased expression of several epithelial marker genes such as E-cadherin, type IV collagen, and perlecan (heparin sulfate proteoglycan) along with reduced expression of α8 integrin and vimentin (26.Hosono S.

This lends support to our hypothesis that expression of WT1 in this heterologous system mimics some of the effects of WT1 in kidney differentiation. Similarly, work by Haber's group identified amphiregulin as a gene induced by WT1 in an osteosarcoma cell line but also expressed in the condensing, developing human kidney (24.Lee S.B. Huang K.

Both transient and stable expression of WT1 induced the endogenous E-cadherin gene. WT1 protein bound to a proximal GC-rich sequence in the E-cadherin gene promoter. This cis-acting element alone was sufficient for trans-activation of the E-cadherin promoter by WT1 in co-transfection experiments. A dominant negative mutant of WT1, WTAR inhibited the E-cadherin promoter in WT1 expressing NIH 3T3 cells. E-cadherin represents a downstream target gene that may link the functions of WT1 in epithelial differentiation and tumor suppression. The NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing WT1 (WR16 and WR35) and the Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing WT1 (VW9) that were used in this study have been described previously (13.Luo X.-N.

The promoter regions of the murine E-cadherin gene were amplified from murine genomic DNA by PCR2 using various forward primers containing a BglII adaptor sequence to generate deletions or point mutations. Mutated bases are indicated in bold type. A reverse primer containing a HindIII adaptor sequence at +113 of the murine E-cadherin promoter sequence was used (Sequences 1–17). The human E-cadherin promoter luciferase construct HECad (−368/+125) was described previously (44.Ji X. Woodard A.S. Rimm D.L. Fearon E.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 773-778PubMed Google Scholar). For the construction of HECad (−217/+125) and HECad (DEL), E-cadherin promoter sequences were amplified by PCR and subcloned into SacI andHindIII of pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). A bicistronic retroviral vector for WT1 was constructed by insertion of aSau3A fragment of WT1(A) into the BglII site of the MIGR1 retroviral vector (gift of W. Pear), which contains the murine stem cell leukemia virus long terminal repeat. A single reverse primer (R) containing a BglII adaptor was paired with each forward primer (F). The polymerase chain reaction was performed at a denaturing temperature of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing temperature of 60 °C for 30 s, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C for 40 cycles. After amplification, the PCR fragments were digested withBglII and HindIII and cloned into the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter construct (Promega), and subjected to automated DNA sequencing. For cotransfection assays involving the murine and human E-cadherin luciferase reporter and WT1 isoforms (A, B, C, D), NIH 3T3 cells and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. At 18 h prior to transfection, NIH 3T3 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 104 in 24-well dishes. Optimal quantities of effector (RSV-WT1(A, B, C, D), WTAR) and reporter (E-cadherin-Luc) used in transfection assays were empirically determined to be 0.5 μg of effector (RSV-WT1(A, B, C, D) or RSV alone), 0.1 μg of reporter, and 0.01 μg of a thymidine kinaseRenilla reporter gene, which serves as an internal control for transfection efficiency. WT1 modestly activated the thymidine kinase Renilla reporter, leading to an underestimate of activation by WT1 but did not alter the pattern of activation noted for E-cadherin promoter deletion constructs. The plasmids were transfected using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. The NIH 3T3 cells were harvested 60 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Reporter assay system (Promega). All results are shown as the average ± standard deviation of three to six independent experiments. For preparation of nuclear extracts, 293T cells were plated at the density of 5 × 106cells/10-cm dish 18 h prior to transfection and 5 μg of RSV-WT1(A) was used for transfection. The 293T cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and nuclear extract was prepared as described below. A bicistronic vector harboring the green fluorescent protein and WT1(A) cDNAs was transiently transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) into PHOENIX cells. At 48 h after transfection, expression of the vector was monitored by phase contrast fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and the supernatant of the packaging cells was collected, filtered, and layered in the presence of 5 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) on a fresh culture of 60% confluent NIH 3T3 cells. At 24, 48, and 72 h after infection, the cells were monitored for green fluorescence and lysed for the preparation of total RNA using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cytoplasmic RNAs were isolated from cell lines as described previously (13.Luo X.-N. Reddy J.C. Yeyati P.L. Idris A.H. Hosono S. Haber D.A. Licht J.D. Atweh G.F.

Cytoplasmic RNAs from each cell line (20 μg) were subjected to Northern blot analysis for E-cadherin expression (45.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar) and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The E-cadherin probe was a gift from S. Mazur (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). E-cadherin expression in retrovirus-infected NIH3T3 cells was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript II, (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA was then subjected to 35 rounds of PCR using E-cadherin-specific primers (E-cadherin forward PCR primer, 5′-TCA ACG ATC CTG ACC AGC AGT TCG-3′; reverse transcriptase primer, 5′-GGT GAA CCA TCA TCT GTG GCG ATG-3′; reverse nested PCR primer, 5′-ATC TTC TGA TCC ATG ACC GTG TCC G-3′). Polymerase chain reaction was performed at a denaturing temperature of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing temperature of 60 °C for 30 s, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles. An internal control for RNA integrity was simultaneously performed using mouse β-actin-specific primers (forward, GCC CAG AGC AAG AGA GGT AT; reverse, GGC CAT CTC TTG CTC GAA GT). The PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were created by annealing complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.). The oligonucleotide sequences used were as follows.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 743-750PubMed Google Scholar), WT1(A)-transfected 293T, and a NIH 3T3 control cell line were extracted using a two-step method as follows. 5–10 × 106 cells were grown to 80% confluence and resuspended in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT. The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min, vortexed, and briefly pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT and incubated on ice for 20 min. The nuclear extract was then centrifuged for 2 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC kit. To compare the binding activity of the alternative +KTS and −KTS forms of WT1 to the E-cadherin promoter WT1-response element, sequences encoding the zinc-finger domains of WT(A/−KTS), WT(C/+KTS), and WT(AR) (negative binding control) were cloned into the pGEX2TK GST-expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified on glutathione beads (1.Beckwith J.B. Kiviat N.B. Bonadio J.F. Pediatr. Pathol. 1990; 10: 1-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions using in vitro transcribed/translated WT1 were performed with 2.5 μl of lysate programmed with pSP64-WT1(A) or the pSP64 control as described previously (46.Pelletier J. Bruening W. Kashtan C.E. Mauer S.M. Manivel J.C. Striegel J.E. Houghton D.C. Junien C. Habib R. Fouser L. Fine R.N. Silverman B.L. Haber D.A. Housman D.

Binding reactions utilizing nuclear extracts were performed by preincubating 3 μg of extract in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 12% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm DTT with 2 μg of d(I-C) and 1 μg of DNase-free RNase A for 15 min at room temperature. Next, 0.2 ng (approximately 106 cpm/ng) of radiolabeled probe was added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. Binding reactions utilizing GST-WT1 protein were performed by preincubating 200 ng of protein in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 50 μm ZnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 20% glycerol, with 1 μg of d(I-C) for 10 min at room temperature. After this, 0.2 ng (approximately 106 cpm/ng) of radiolabeled probe was added and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The DNA-protein complexes were separated through a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel for 1.5 h at 300 V at room temperature. For Western blot analysis following the mobility shift assay, the assay was performed with an unlabeled oligonucleotide probe. The polyacrylamide gel was transferred to an Immobilon-P nylon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and immunoblotting analysis was performed as described below. The relative amount of DNA bound by WT1 protein was quantified utilizing a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cell lines were grown to 80% confluence in 10-cm plates, scraped into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and centrifuged at 1000 × g. The cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and solubilized in 200 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) for 1 h at 4 °C, The protein samples were then incubated at 100 °C for 10 min and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC kit. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to the samples to a final concentration of 0.5 m, and then heated at 85 °C for 10 min prior to loading on a gel. Protein samples (40 μg) were separated by electrophoresis through a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) nylon membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2138274682,"Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) binds to and promotes the activation of one of its receptors, KDR. Once activated, KDR induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic signaling proteins that are important to endothelial cell proliferation. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibits the phosphorylation and activation of KDR. The ability of TNF to diminish VEGF-stimulated KDR activity was impaired by sodium orthovanadate, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of TNF was mediated by a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. KDR-initiated responses specifically associated with endothelial cell proliferation, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and DNA synthesis, were also inhibited by TNF, and this was reversed by sodium orthovanadate. Stimulation of HUVECs with TNF induced association of the SHP-1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase with KDR, identifying this phosphatase as a candidate negative regulator of VEGF signal transduction. Heterologous receptor inactivation mediated by a protein-tyrosine phosphatase provides insight into how TNF may inhibit endothelial cell proliferative responses and modulate angiogenesis in pathological settings."
https://openalex.org/W2067673948,"The new member of the Ras superfamily of G-proteins, Rheb, has been identified in rat and human, but its function has not been defined. We report here the identification of Rheb homologues in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScRheb) as well as in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster, zebrafish, andCiona intestinalis. These proteins define a new class of G-proteins based on 1) their overall sequence similarity, 2) high conservation of their effector domain sequence, 3) presence of a unique arginine in their G1 box, and 4) presence of a conserved CAAX farnesylation motif. Characterization of an S. cerevisiae strain deficient in ScRheb showed that it is hypersensitive to growth inhibitory effects of canavanine and thialysine, which are analogues of arginine and lysine, respectively. Accordingly, the uptake of arginine and lysine was increased in the ScRheb-deficient strain. This increased arginine uptake requires the arginine-specific permease Can1p. The function of ScRheb is dependent on having an intact effector domain since mutations in the effector domain of ScRheb are incapable of complementing canavanine hypersensitivity of scrheb disruptant cells. Furthermore, the conserved arginine in the G1 box plays a role in the activity of ScRheb, as a mutation of this arginine to glycine significantly reduced the ability of ScRheb to complement canavanine hypersensitivity of ScRheb-deficient yeast. Finally, a mutation in the C-terminal CAAX farnesylation motif resulted in a loss of ScRheb function. This result, in combination with our finding that ScRheb is farnesylated, suggests that farnesylation plays a key role in ScRheb function. Our findings assign the regulation of arginine and lysine uptake as the first physiological function for this new farnesylated Ras superfamily G-protein.

Of these proteins, we identified homologues of Rheb in a number of organisms, including the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, and focused our attention on this unique Ras superfamily G-protein. Rheb was initially identified as a member of the Ras superfamily of G-proteins whose expression is increased in rat hippocampal granule cells in response to maximal electroconvulsive seizures andN-methyl-d-aspartic acid-dependent synaptic activity in the long-term potentiation paradigm (15.Yamagata K.

Growth factors (epidermal and fibroblast growth factors) are also able to induce expression of Rheb mRNA in PC12 cells (15.Yamagata K. Sanders L.K. Kaufmann W.E. Yee W. Barnes C.A. Nathans D. Worley P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16333-16339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the human homologue of Rheb was identified (16.Gromov P.S. Madsen P. Tomerup N. Celis J.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17.Mizuki N. Kimura M. Ohno S. Miyata S. Sato M. Ando H. Ishihara M. Goto K. Watanabe S. Yamazaki M. Ono A. Taguchi S. Okumura K. Nogami M. Taguchi T. Ando A. Inoko H. Genomics. 1996; 34: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rheb was also found to be overexpressed in several transformed human cell lines (16.Gromov P.S. Madsen P. Tomerup N. Celis J.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Yee and Worley (18.Yee W.M. Worley P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) suggested that Rheb and Ras function in concert to integrate various signals by interacting with Raf. In contrast, Clarket al. (19.Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Rogers-Graham K. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) reported that Rheb antagonizes the transforming activity of Ras. The exact function of Rheb, however, remains unknown. The overall sequence of Rheb does not identify it as a member of any of the known subfamilies of the Ras superfamily of G-proteins, although its closest relative is Ras (19.Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Rogers-Graham K. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Like Ras, Rheb ends with a C-terminal CAAX motif (C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is the C-terminal amino acid), which is known to be recognized by protein farnesyltransferase (FTase).1 Indeed, it has been reported that Rheb is farnesylated and that this farnesylation is blocked by FTase inhibitor treatment (19.Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Rogers-Graham K. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). One interesting feature of Rheb is that the third residue of its G1 box, which is the first of five conserved regions found in Ras superfamily G-proteins, is an arginine; this residue is usually a glycine in other Ras superfamily G-proteins (6.Bourne H. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Because of the similarity to Ras that Rheb displays, most of the previous functional studies for Rheb have focused on Ras functions (18.Yee W.M. Worley P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,19.Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Rogers-Graham K. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, an unbiased functional analysis using a more genetically amenable system has not been carried out. Therefore, to gain insight into the function of Rheb, we looked to identify sequence homologues of Rheb in other organisms. In this paper, we report the sequences for Rheb homologues in two yeasts, fruit fly, zebrafish, and sea squirt. From their sequence similarity overall as well as in their effector domain, CAAX motif, and G1 box, they define a new class of Ras superfamily G-proteins and likely share similar mechanisms of regulation. Of these homologues, we continued our analysis on the homologue found in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, which we named ScRheb. Through characterization of a strain of S. cerevisiaedeficient in ScRheb, we were able to assign the regulation of arginine and lysine uptake as the first physiological function for Rheb G-proteins. This regulation appears to be mediated by the arginine permease Can1p. In agreement with arginine uptake being a downstream effect of ScRheb, mutations in the effector domain resulted in the loss of proper regulation of arginine uptake. In addition, we found that an invariant arginine in the G1 box is important for full ScRheb function. We also demonstrate that ScRheb is farnesylated and that farnesylation is critical for ScRheb to down-regulate arginine uptake. [3H]Arginine was obtained from either Sigma (38.5 Ci/mmol) or American Radiolabeled Chemicals (40 Ci/mmol). [3H]Lysine (60 Ci/mmol), [3H]proline (20 Ci/mmol), [3H]histidine (43 Ci/mmol), [3H]tyrosine (52 Ci/mmol), [3H]valine (46.2 Ci/mmol), and [3H]leucine (72.5 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Sigma. [3H]Glutamate (60 Ci/mmol), [3H]tryptophan (20 Ci/mmol), [3H]methionine (72 Ci/mmol), and [3H]glutamine (60 Ci/mmol) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. [3H]Farnesyl pyrophosphate (22.3 Ci/mmol) and [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (19.3 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. The yeast media used were YPD (20.Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar), SC-Trp (21.Del Villar K. Mitsuzawa H. Yang W. Sattler I. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 680-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), SDHU (synthetic minimal medium (20.Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) supplemented with 20 mg/liter histidine and 20 mg/liter uracil), and SDHUW (SDHU medium + 20 mg/liter tryptophan). Yeast transformations were carried out using the lithium acetate method (22.Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). All yeast strains used are listed in TableI. The method by which each strain was created is also described in Table I. The ScRHEB andGAP1 genes were disrupted by the PCR method using the kanamycin resistance cassette kanMX (23.Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). ThekanMX cassette (23.Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) was amplified using primers containing ∼50 bases of genomic sequence flanking the gene to be disrupted. pUG6 (23.Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) was used as the template. The CAN1 gene was disrupted using a can1::kanMX disruption cassette in which the NdeI-ClaI region of CAN1 was replaced with the kanMX cassette (23.Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The DPR1gene was disrupted using a dpr1::kanMX disruption cassette in which the sequence from the start codon to the secondHincII site of DPR1 was replaced with thekanMX cassette (23.Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). All disruptions were confirmed by whole cell PCR (24.Wang H. Kohalmi S.E. Cutler A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using a primer directed at genomic sequence outside the disruption cassette and a primer directed at the kanMXsequence.

All S. cerevisiaesequences were obtained through the Yeast Protein Database web site (27.Hodges P.E. McKee A.H.Z. Davis B.P. Payne W.E. Garrels J.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The coding sequences for ScRHEB andsprheb + were cloned by PCR amplification.ScRHEB was amplified from genomic DNA prepared from TD1.sprheb + was amplified from a two-hybridS. pombe cDNA library (provided by Dr. M. Yamamoto, University of Tokyo). The primers were designed to introduce restriction sites (NdeI and BamHI forScRHEB and EcoRI and BamHI forsprheb +) just flanking the start and stop codons of the respective cDNA. The high fidelity Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.) was used for PCR. These PCR products were cloned into appropriate vectors (sprheb + into LITMUS29 (New England Biolabs Inc.) to produce pL29SpRheb and ScRHEBinto pWHA to produce pWHAScRheb), and the sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (28.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) using T7 Sequenase Version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pWHAScRheb contains a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope immediately upstream of and in frame with the ATG codon of theScRHEB sequence. pWHA is based on pAS1 (29.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), in which theADH1 promoter and GAL4 DNA-binding domain sequences were replaced with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter from pKT10 (30.Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Tamanoi F. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter of pWHAScRheb was replaced with ∼400 base pairs of sequence upstream of the ScRHEB coding sequence (containing the ScRHEB promoter), and the thus produced promoter-HA-ScRHEB fragment was then cloned into pRS314 (31.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pRSHAScRheb, was the plasmid into which mutations were introduced. Internal mutations were introduced by two-step PCR site-directed mutagenesis (32.Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar), and the sequences were confirmed. The CAAX mutation was included in the primer used for PCR, and the sequence was confirmed. p2WScRheb and p2WSpRheb were made by cloning the NdeI-BamHI fragment containing the ScRHEB sequence and theEcoRI-BamHI fragment containing thesprheb + sequence, respectively, into theEcoRI and BamHI sites of pWHA. The amino acid uptake assay was performed basically as described previously (33.Opekarova M. Caspari T. Pinson B. Brethes D. Tanner W. Yeast. 1998; 14: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown to mid-log phase (A 600 = 0.2–0.5) at 30 °C in YPD medium, collected, and washed twice with 5 ml of SDHUW medium. The cells were then resuspended in SDHUW medium toA 600 = 2.0, and 1.2 ml of this suspension was used. The uptake assay was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of3H-labeled amino acid and 100 μmnonradioactive amino acid. 200-μl aliquots were taken at the indicated time points, immediately diluted 25-fold, filtered, and washed twice on a vacuum manifold. Filtration was performed using glass microfiber filters (Fisherbrand G4 or Whatman GF/C). The filters were dried under a heat lamp, and the amount of radioactivity retained on the filters was counted in a Beckman LS-6500 scintillation counter using Ecoscint A scintillation solution (National Diagnostics, Inc.). In the case of proline, 15 μl of [3H]proline was used due to relatively low uptake rates. FTase assays were performed using purified S. cerevisiae FTase, [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate, and varying concentrations of substrate protein as described previously (21.Del Villar K. Mitsuzawa H. Yang W. Sattler I. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 680-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 34.Urano J. Tamanoi F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 116: 145-159PubMed Google Scholar). FTase activity was assessed as the level of [3H]farnesyl transferred to the substrate, which was then detected by liquid scintillation. Recombinant FTase was purified from Escherichia coli expressing GST-Dpr1 and Ram2 as described previously (34.Urano J. Tamanoi F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 116: 145-159PubMed Google Scholar). GST-Rho3, MBP-RhoA, and GST-ScRheb were used as substrate proteins. Purification of GST-Rho3 from E. coliusing affinity for glutathione beads (Sigma) has been previously described (35.Robinson N.G.G. Guo L. Imai J. Toh-e A. Matsui Y. Tamanoi F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MBP-RhoA is a fusion of RhoA with the maltose-binding protein and was purified from E. coli by its affinity for amylose beads (New England Biolabs Inc.) using methods previously described (34.Urano J. Tamanoi F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 116: 145-159PubMed Google Scholar). pMAL-RhoA was created by cloning the sequence coding for RhoA into pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs Inc.). GST-ScRheb was purified from E. coli transformed with pGEX-ScRheb using methods previously described (34.Urano J. Tamanoi F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 116: 145-159PubMed Google Scholar). pGEX-ScRheb was created by cloning the coding sequence of ScRHEB into pGEX5X-3ΔBam, which is a derivative of pGEX5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in which theBamHI site has been destroyed by filling in. Whole cell extracts were made essentially as described by Park et al. (36.Park H.O. Bi E. Pringle J.R. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to mid-log phase, collected, resuspended, and disrupted by glass beads. Large cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 × g. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay) (37.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (38.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in blocking buffer (5% skim milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1× phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4)). The membrane was then incubated with anti-HA.11 antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co.), washed, and incubated with the secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule); Sigma). Proteins with bound antibodies were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (39.Durrant I. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 31: 147-161PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins that share significant homology with mammalian Rheb were identified through BLAST searches of theSaccharomyces Genome Database (Stanford, CA) (26.Chervitz S.A. Hester E.T. Ball C.A. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Harris M.A. Juvik G. Malekian A. Roberts S. Roe T. Scafe C. Schroeder M. Sherlock G. Weng S. Zhu Y. Cherry J.M. Botstein D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the Sanger Center (Hinxton, United Kingdom), the BerkeleyDrosophila Genome Project (Berkeley, CA), and NCBI (Bethesda, MD). These searches identified homologues in the yeastsS. cerevisiae and S. pombe, which we refer to asScRHEB (S. cerevisiae, SGD open reading frameYCR027c) and sprheb + (S. pombe, GenBankTM/EBI accession number AL034382). In addition, expressed sequence tags that code for homologues were identified in fruit fly (D. melanogaster, GenBankTM/EBI accession number AI238559), zebrafish (Danio rerio, GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAI588708), and sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis, GenBankTM/EBI accession number AJ227689). These sequences are referred to as DmRheb, DrRheb, and CiRheb, respectively, in Fig.1. Fig. 1 A shows the sequence alignment of the proteins for which full sequences were available. The sequences of yeast, human, and fly Rheb proteins (aligned in Fig.1 A) share overall 26% sequence identity and 57% similarity. More important, they share three key sequence features. First, they have very similar effector domain sequences (seeEffector Domain in Fig. 1, A and B); 10 of the 17 residues are identical, and four of the remaining residues are similar. Two residues at the end of this domain are divergent, but tend to be hydrophobic. The sixth residue is a tyrosine in yeast, whereas it is an aspartate in higher eukaryotes. The consensus effector domain sequence is FV(E/D)SY(Y/D)PTIEN(E/T)F(T/S/N)(R/K)XX(Fig. 1 B). Second and most interestingly, these proteins contain an arginine in the third position of their G1 box (Fig. 1,A and B), which suggests that the mechanism for the regulation of all these proteins is similar but distinct from that of most other Ras superfamily G-proteins, which contain a glycine at this position (6.Bourne H. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Third, the yeast, human, and fly proteins all terminate in a CAAX motif, suggesting that they are farnesylated. Fig. 1 C shows a dendogram of yeast and human Ras superfamily G-proteins that are either known or predicted to be farnesylated. As shown, yeast and human Rheb proteins establish a distinct branch. The shared features of the Rheb proteins, along with their distinctiveness from other farnesylated G-proteins, suggest that the Rheb proteins are novel and unique members of the Ras superfamily of G-proteins. To characterize the function of ScRheb in yeast cells, we disrupted the ScRHEB gene using akanMX cassette in two different yeast strains, REE966 and TD1, to produce JU28-1 and JU29-2, respectively. The disruption of these strains was confirmed by PCR. The disruptants were viable and showed no obvious defects in growth, temperature sensitivity, or morphology. Bianchi et al. (40.Bianchi M.M. Sartori G. Vandenbol M. Kaniak A. Uccelletti D. Mazzoni C. Di Rago J.-P. Carignani G. Slonimski P.P. Frontali L. Yeast. 1999; 15: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) also reported that disruption of this gene is viable. However, we found that thescrheb disruptant strain exhibits marked hypersensitivity to the arginine and lysine analogues canavanine and thialysine (S-(2-aminoethyl)-l-cysteine), respectively (Fig. 2). In the experiment with canavanine (Fig. 2 A), wild-type (TD1) and scrhebdisruptant (JU29-2) cells were serially diluted by a factor of 3. 5 μl of the cells was spotted on the indicated plates and allowed to grow for 3 days at 30 °C. The sensitivity was assessed by comparing the growth of the two strains at various dilutions. On the plate with no drug, both strains showed similar growth at all dilutions. On the plate containing 0.5 mg/liter canavanine, JU29-2 showed minimal or no growth at all dilutions. Meanwhile, TD1 showed growth at all dilutions. Furthermore, analysis of canavanine sensitivity using various concentrations of the drug demonstrated that JU29-2 exhibited growth inhibition at 0.2 mg/liter, whereas a similar level of inhibition was not observed with TD1 until the concentration of canavanine was increased to >1 mg/liter. Therefore, JU29-2 shows a significant increase in sensitivity to canavanine compared with its wild-type parent strain, TD1. Fig. 2 B"
https://openalex.org/W2056383041,"RPTPμ is a prototypic receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) that mediates homotypic cell-cell interactions. Intracellularly, RPTPμ consists of a relatively large juxtamembrane region and two phosphatase domains, but little is still known about its substrate(s). Here we show that RPTPμ associates with the catenin p120 ctn, a tyrosine kinase substrate and an interacting partner of cadherins. No interaction is detectable between RPTPμ and β-catenin. Furthermore, we show that tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 ctn is dephosphorylated by RPTPμ both in vitro and in intact cells. Complex formation between RPTPμ and p120 ctn does not require tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 ctn. Mutational analysis reveals that both the juxtamembrane region and the second phosphatase domain of RPTPμ are involved in p120 ctn binding. The RPTPμ-interacting domain of p120 ctn maps to its unique N terminus, a region distinct from the cadherin-interacting domain. A mutant form of p120 ctn that fails to bind cadherins can still associate with RPTPμ. Our findings indicate that RPTPμ interacts with p120 ctn independently of cadherins, and they suggest that this interaction may serve to control the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p120 ctn at sites of cell-cell contact. RPTPμ is a prototypic receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) that mediates homotypic cell-cell interactions. Intracellularly, RPTPμ consists of a relatively large juxtamembrane region and two phosphatase domains, but little is still known about its substrate(s). Here we show that RPTPμ associates with the catenin p120 ctn, a tyrosine kinase substrate and an interacting partner of cadherins. No interaction is detectable between RPTPμ and β-catenin. Furthermore, we show that tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 ctn is dephosphorylated by RPTPμ both in vitro and in intact cells. Complex formation between RPTPμ and p120 ctn does not require tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 ctn. Mutational analysis reveals that both the juxtamembrane region and the second phosphatase domain of RPTPμ are involved in p120 ctn binding. The RPTPμ-interacting domain of p120 ctn maps to its unique N terminus, a region distinct from the cadherin-interacting domain. A mutant form of p120 ctn that fails to bind cadherins can still associate with RPTPμ. Our findings indicate that RPTPμ interacts with p120 ctn independently of cadherins, and they suggest that this interaction may serve to control the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p120 ctn at sites of cell-cell contact. protein-tyrosine kinase protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase epidermal growth factor glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline radioimmune precipitation buffer Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is controlled by the opposing actions of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)1 and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Like the PTKs, the PTPs occur as both receptor and non-receptor forms. The receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs) are characterized by one or two intracellular PTP domains and a variable, putative ligand-binding ectodomain; they are classified according to structural motifs in their ectodomains (for review, see Refs. 1.Brady-Kalnay S.M.

While many RPTP family members have been identified to date, little is still known about their intracellular substrates and signaling properties. We have identified RPTPμ and shown that it functions as a homotypic cell-cell adhesion receptor and, furthermore, that its expression is up-regulated with increasing cell density (4.Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I.

Its ectodomain consists of an N-terminal “MAM” domain followed by an Ig-like domain and four fibronectin type III-like repeats (4.Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R.

Schlessinger J. Sap J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PCP-2 (also called RPTPλ or RPTPπ) (9.Wang H. Lian Z. Lerch M.M. Chen Z. Xie W. Ullrich A.

Intracellularly, RPTPμ consists of a relatively large juxtamembrane region (about 150 amino acids) and two conserved PTP domains (4.Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R. Beijersbergen R.L. Geurts van Kessel A. Moolenaar W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As in most RPTPs, the first (membrane-proximal) PTP domain of RPTPμ is catalytically active, whereas its second (C-terminal) domain is inactive, at least in vitro (see Refs. 1.Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2.Streuli M. Curr. Opin.

Several RPTPs have recently been implicated in the regulation of cadherin/catenin complexes. For example, RPTPκ was reported to associate with both β- and γ-catenin (plakoglobin), but not with α-catenin or cadherins (13.Fuchs M. Muller T. Lerch M.M. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16712-16719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Another member of the MAM-containing subfamily, termed RPTPλ, was found in complex with β-catenin (10.Cheng J. Wu K. Armanini M. O'Rourke N. Dowbenko D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7264-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), while leukocyte common antigen-related RPTP was reported to interact with both β-catenin and plakoglobin, but not with α-catenin or E-cadherin (14.Aicher B. Lerch M.M. Muller T. Schilling J. Ullrich A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 138: 681-696Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 15.Kypta R.M. Su H. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As for RPTPμ, Brady-Kalnay et al. (16.Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 17.Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mourton T. Nixon J.P. Pietz G.E. Kinch M. Chen H. Brackenbury R. Rimm D.L. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) reported that it associates with more than 80% of the cellular cadherin pool. However, our own studies did not confirm the proposed RPTPμ-cadherin interaction (18.Zondag G.C.M. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F.B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1513-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the possible interaction between RPTPμ and the catenin p120 ctn (formerly termed p120 cas ; Refs. 19.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 20.Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), a protein originally identified as a substrate for the Src tyrosine kinase (21.Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol.

Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Like β-catenin and plakoglobin, p120 ctn belongs to the Armadillo family of proteins as it contains 11 Armadillo repeats flanked by unique N- and C-terminal sequences (23.Reynolds A.B. Herbert L. Cleveland J.L. Berg S.T. Gaut J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2439-2445PubMed Google Scholar). Through its Armadillo repeats, p120 ctn associates with cadherins, although on a different site and with lower affinity than the classical β-catenins and plakoglobin (19.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell.

Esch F.S. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). p120 ctn differs from β-/γ-catenin in that it does not interact with β-catenin (24.Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nor does p120 bind the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli protein as do β-catenin and plakoglobin (27.Shibata T. Gotoh M. Ochiai A. Hirohashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28.Hulsken J.W. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J.

Science. 1993; 262: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p120 ctn in 3T3 cells induces striking morphological changes characterized by the presence of long dendrite-like processes (30.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for p120 ctn in cytoskeletal organization. We report here that RPTPμ associates with p120 ctn, but not with β-catenin, and show that tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 ctn serves as a substrate for RPTPμ. We have mapped the RPTPμ-binding site on p120 ctn to its unique N terminus, a region distinct from the cadherin-interacting Armadillo repeats. Furthermore, we find that the interaction between RPTPμ and p120 ctn requires both the juxtamembrane region and the second PTP domain of RPTPμ. Our findings suggest that RPTPμ functions in a cell-cell signaling pathway that involves p120 ctn. Mink lung cells (Mv1Lu), human lung carcinoma cell-line A549, and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with antibiotics and 8% fetal calf serum. Culture and infection of Sf9 insect cells were done as described (12.Zondag G.C.M. Koningstein G.M. Jiang Y.P. Sap J. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F.B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14247-14250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Transfection of COS7 cells was performed using the DEAE-dextran procedure. Briefly, COS cells seeded 1 day before transfection were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and overlaid with a mixture of plasmid DNA and DEAE-dextran (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS. Following 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 80 μm chloroquine (Sigma), 8% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were shocked in 10% Me2SO and cultured in fresh medium for 2 days before analysis. Monoclonal antibodies 3G4 and 3D7 directed against the extracellular domain and polyclonal antibody Ab37 against the intracellular domain of RPTPμ have been described previously (4.Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R. Beijersbergen R.L. Geurts van Kessel A. Moolenaar W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Anti-HA tag and anti-Myc tag antibodies were obtained from culture supernatant of hybridoma cell lines 12CA5 and 9E10, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies against β-catenin, p120 ctn, and phosphotyrosine were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal anti-p120 ctn antiserum F1 has been described previously (30.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The pMT2 expression vector containing the full-length RPTPμ cDNA has been described previously (31.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Verheijen M.H.G. Zondag G.C.M. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13516-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). RPTPμ-CS represents a double point-mutated RPTPμ cDNA in which the cysteine residues in the active sites of both the catalytic domains are replaced by serine residues. RPTPμ-CS was obtained by standard cloning and polymerase chain reaction procedures using primers 5′-GGTGGTGCACTCGAGTGCTGGTGCAGGGAGG-3′ and 5′-GCACCAGCACTCGAGTGCACCACCAGTGGGC-3′ to mutate the first catalytic domain, and primers 5′-GTTGTGCATAGCTTGAACG-3′ and 5′-GTTCAAGCTATGCACAACG-3′ to mutate the second catalytic domain. The C-terminally truncated RPTPμ-Δ2 construct was generated by deletion of the second catalytic domain through EcoRI digestion. Generation of construct RPTPμ-ExJ, which lacks both phosphatase domains but still contains the complete juxtamembrane region, has been described (5.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Wubbolts R.W. Beijersbergen R.L. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16101-16104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the RPTPμ-ExT construct encodes the extracellular domain and the transmembrane region plus 12 additional amino acids to serve as membrane anchor. This construct was obtained by introducing a membrane-proximal stop codon using primers 5′-CTTTGCTGCAGAATTCCCCGCAGACAGCCTC-3′ and 5′-CGCCTCTAGACTAGGTCTCTTTCCGCTTCTTG-3′. Immunofluorescence and biochemical analysis showed that the RPTPμ-ExT protein was expressed and retained on the cell surface (data not shown). All sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction were verified by DNA sequencing. Myc-tagged β-catenin cDNA was generously provided by Dr. Jorg Hulsken (Max Delbrück Centrum, Berlin, Germany) and subcloned into the pMT2 expression vector. An expression vector containing an HA-tagged form of p120 ctn 1A has been described previously (19.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs encoding an N-terminally truncated mutant (p120 N2) and the p120ΔR3–11 mutant that lacks Armadillo repeats 3–11 are described by Reynolds et al. (30.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A pMT2 expression plasmid encoding a dominant form of p60 src (Y527F substitution) was constructed and provided by Dr. Dick Schaap (Organon Tecnika, Oss, The Netherlands). Cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed at 4 °C in either Nonidet P-40 lysis mix (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) or RIPA (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). Lysis buffers were supplemented with 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and with the phosphatase inhibitors sodium vanadate and molybdate (100 μm each). After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated for 4 h with Sepharose-protein A beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), precoupled to the appropriate antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose, blots were probed with specific antibodies using standard procedures and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) The N-terminal fusion of the catalytic phosphatase domains of RPTPμ to GST has been described (31.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Verheijen M.H.G. Zondag G.C.M. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13516-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression construct B5 encodes a GST fusion protein that contains part of the juxtamembrane region and both RPTPμ phosphatase domains. The B5M construct is identical to the B5 construct except for a single point mutation in the active site of the first catalytic domain. The resulting cysteine to serine substitution in the B5M construct was previously shown to abolish phosphatase activity in vitro(31.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Verheijen M.H.G. Zondag G.C.M. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13516-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inserts from the bacterial B5 and B5M expression constructs were subcloned into the baculo-transfer vector pVL1392 (PharMingen) resulting in pVL-C1C2 and pVL-M1C2, respectively. Recombinant baculoviruses were obtained using the BaculoGold transfection kit (PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after infection, Sf9 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis mix supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. GST fusion proteins were precipitated with Sepharose-glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed in lysis buffer, and eluted from the beads in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) plus 5 mm reduced glutathione. The amount of purified fusion-protein was estimated from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and aliquots were stored in 40% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at −20 °C. To obtain tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 ctn, COS cells were cotransfected with pRC/CMV-p120 ctn and pMT2-Src527F. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed in RIPA supplemented with protease inhibitors, 100 μmsodium vanadate, and 100 μm sodium molybdate. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody coupled to Sepharose-protein A beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer and two times in PTP buffer (40 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol) without phosphatase inhibitors. Immunocomplexes were then incubated in PTP buffer at 30 °C with approximately 200 ng of GST-C1C2 or GST-M1C2 fusion proteins per time point. At the times indicated, aliquots were collected, mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer, and boiled. Samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and analyzed using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. COS cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged p120 ctn and either wild-type RPTPμ or the catalytically inactive point mutant RPTPμ-CS. Two days after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 6 h and stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for the times indicated. Cells were lysed in RIPA containing phosphatase inhibitors, and p120 ctn was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA tag antibody 12CA5 as described above. Total cell lysates were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 or with antibody Ab37 directed against RPTPμ. Blots containing anti-p120 ctn immunocomplexes were first probed with PY20, stripped, and then reprobed with anti-HA tag antibody to control for equal expression and loading. Cells, grown overnight on coverslips, were washed once in PBS and then fixed in methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. Coverslips were blocked in 10% normal goat serum and incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Coverslips were then washed in PBS and incubated with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After washing in PBS, coverslips were mounted with VectaShield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (model MRC-600, Bio-Rad). Both RPTPμ and p120 ctn are known to localize to sites of cell-cell contact (6.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed colocalization of RPTPμ and p120 ctn in A549 human lung carcinoma cells and mink lung cells, in which both proteins are endogenously expressed. Immunofluorescence analysis reveals that the localization of RPTPμ and p120 ctn exactly overlaps in regions of cell-cell contact (Fig.1). Mink lung cells, at low confluence, form filopodial-like extensions that contact neighboring cells. Also in these specialized structures, RPTPμ and p120 ctn are seen to colocalize (Fig. 1,C and D). In addition, there is a correlation between RPTPμ and p120 ctn protein levels, as indicated by the open and closed arrows (Fig. 1, D and E), which point to regions of relatively low and high expression of RPTPμ and p120 ctn, respectively. These findings raise the possibility of an interaction between RPTPμ and p120 ctn and/or related catenins. We set out to examine the possible interaction between RPTPμ and p120 ctn and/or the related Armadillo member β-catenin through coprecipitation studies. Small amounts of endogenous p120 ctn, but not β-catenin, were detected in anti-RPTPμ immunoprecipitates from human A549 as well as mink lung cells (data not shown).To investigate RPTPμ-catenin interactions in better detail, we used the COS cell expression system. Expression vectors encoding full-length RPTPμ and an HA-tagged p120 ctn construct were cotransfected, and anti-RPTPμ precipitates were probed for the presence of p120 ctn. In parallel experiments, we cotransfected β-catenin. Fig. 2 shows that RPTPμ associates with p120 ctn and that coprecipitation of p120 ctn is strictly dependent on the presence of RPTPμ (lanes 5 and6). Similar association was found between p12 ctn and the RPTPμ-related RPTP (data not shown). We note that RPTPμ interacts with a relatively small amount of p120 ctn, similar to what has been reported for the interaction between cadherins and p120 ctn (32.Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Matsuyoshi N. Takeichi M. Ito F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This suggests that the RPTPμ-p120 ctn interaction occurs with relatively low affinity or, alternatively, with low stoichiometry. Probably because of this, reciprocal precipitations, in which we analyzed anti-p120 ctn immunoprecipitates for the presence of RPTPμ, were not successful. Specific association of RPTPμ with p120 ctn is indicated by the findings that (i) the precipitating antibody does not cross-react with p120 ctn, and (ii) no interaction is detected with β-catenin (Fig. 2, lane 8) even after prolonged exposure. We note that epitope-tagged p120 ctn protein appears as multiple bands in total cell lysates (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The upper band migrates at 120 kDa, while the lower triplet runs around 100 kDa. Since p120 ctn is C-terminally tagged, the 100-kDa bands must represent breakdown products that lack part of the N terminus. These 100-kDa products do not interact with RPTPμ, suggesting that the N terminus of p120 ctn is required for binding to RPTPμ (as will be confirmed below). Several studies have shown that p120 ctn interacts with cadherins (19.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell.

Reprobing of the RPTPμ-p120 ctn immunocomplexes with anti-cadherin antibodies did not reveal a detectable cadherin signal in the complexes (data not shown). This suggests that the p120 ctn -RPTPμ complexes are distinct from p120 ctn -cadherin complexes. Since p120 ctn is a substrate for protein-tyrosine kinases (21.Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22.Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 33.Downing J.R. Reynolds A.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 607-613PubMed Google Scholar), we tested how the RPTPμ-p120 ctn interaction depends on the phosphorylation state of p120 ctn. Cells cotransfected with RPTPμ and p120 ctn were treated with EGF or pervanadate, or cotransfected with activated p60 src (Src527F). Although p120 ctn was heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in all three cases (see below), its binding to RPTPμ was not affected (data not shown). We therefore conclude that complex formation between p120 ctn and RPTPμ is phosphotyrosine-independent. To map the regions of RPTPμ that interact with p120 ctn, we generated several mutant RPTPμ constructs and tested them for p120 ctn binding (Fig.3 A). Protein-protein interaction was analyzed by cotransfection and subsequent immunoprecipitation using an antibody against the RPTPμ ectodomain. Construct RPTPμ-CS is a catalytically inactive form of RPTPμ, in which critical cysteine residues in both PTP domains were mutated. Only the first, membrane-proximal PTP domain shows catalytic activity, with residue Cys1095 being essential for activity (31.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Verheijen M.H.G. Zondag G.C.M. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13516-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B (upper panel), p120 ctn coprecipitates equally well with wild-type RPTPμ and RPTPμ-CS, indicating that the catalytic activity of RPTPμ is dispensable for association with p120 ctn. In mutants RPTPμ-Δ2 and RPTPμ-ExJ, the second or both PTP domains were deleted, respectively. Deletion of the second PTP domain significantly, though not completely, reduces the interaction with p120 ctn (Fig. 3 B, lane 4, construct RPTPμ-Δ2). This suggests that the second PTP domain interacts with p120 ctn or, alternatively, that deletion of the second domain destabilizes p120 ctn binding to another binding site on RPTPμ. When both PTP domains are deleted (construct RPTPμ-ExJ), p120 ctn is still capable of interacting with similar efficacy to the RPTPμ-Δ2 mutant. This indicated that the first catalytic domain does not contribute to p120 ctn binding. However, the interaction with p120 ctn is completely abolished after deletion of the juxtamembrane region of RPTPμ (using construct RPTPμ-ExT, containing the ectodomain, the transmembrane domain and only 12 intracellular residues). Taken together, these results indicate that the juxtamembrane region of RPTPμ confers binding to p120 ctn, and that the second PTP domain may contain additional binding sites or else may serve to stabilize binding of p120 ctn to the juxtamembrane region. p120 ctn consists of an N-terminal region of about 280 amino acids, a central core of 11 Armadillo repeats, and a unique C terminus of about 100 amino acids (Fig.4 A). To map the RPTPμ binding region, we co-expressed RPTPμ with an N-terminally deleted form of p120 ctn (p120ΔN2). In addition, we used a deletion mutant that lacks the Armadillo repeats 3–11 but has intact N and C termini (p120ΔR3–11). As shown in Fig. 4, both full-length p120 ctn and the p120ΔR3–11 mutant are detected in anti-RPTPμ immunoprecipitates. This indicates that the Armadillo repeats 3–11 are dispensable for binding to RPTPμ. In contrast, when part of the N terminus of p120 ctn is deleted (amino acids 28–233), RPTPμ binding is abolished. Thus, the binding of p120 ctn to RPTPμ is mediated by its unique N terminus without an apparent role for the Armadillo repeats. Identical results were obtained using RPTPκ (data not shown), indicating that p120 ctn can bind to both RPTPμ and RPTPκ via its N-terminal part. Of note, the association of p120 ctn with cadherins is mediated by its Armadillo repeats and is not detected with the p120ΔR3–11 mutant (30.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The finding that p120ΔR3–11 fails to bind cadherins but still associates with RPTPμ supports the notion that complex formation between p120 ctn and RPTPμ occurs independently of cadherins. We tested whether tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 ctn can serve as a substrate for RPTPμ. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 ctn was purified from COS cells cotransfected with p120 ctn and Src527F. The immune complexes were incubated with GST fusion proteins containing the PTP domains of RPTPμ (Fig.5). Next, the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p120 ctn was monitored by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting. Fig. 5 A shows that p120 ctn is tyrosine-phosphorylated following EGF stimulation or Src expression. Incubation of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp120 ctn with the PTP domains of RPTPμ (GST-C1C2) results in a reduced phosphotyrosine signal over time, indicating that RPTPμ can dephosphorylate p120 ctn (Fig. 5 B). As anticipated, inactivation of the first PTP domain abolishes the phosphatase activity toward p120 ctn (GST-M1C2, Fig. 5 C). The role of the second PTP domain, which lacks activity in vitro (31.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Verheijen M.H.G. Zondag G.C.M. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13516-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), has remained elusive to date. Our results suggest that the second domain may serve a role in presenting substrates to the first catalytic domain. We next tested RPTPμ-induced dephosphorylation of p120 ctn in intact cells. To this end, p120 ctn and RPTPμ were co-expressed in COS cells. Phosphorylation of p120 ctn was induced by EGF and its dephosphorylation was followed over time by immunoprecipitation and anti-phosphotyrosine blotting. As shown in Fig.6, EGF stimulation of COS cells results in massive tyrosine phosphorylation of total cellular protein within minutes after stimulation. The high phosphorylation state is maintained for at least 3 h, without any significant reduction observed in cells expressing either active or inactive RPTPμ. However, differences became apparent when p120 ctn was precipitated from total cell lysates and analyzed for phosphotyrosine content. First, it is seen that cotransfection of catalytically inactive RPTPμ results in phosphorylation of p120 ctn even in the absence of EGF (Fig. 6, compare lanes 1 and9). Moreover, EGF-induced phosphorylation of p120 ctn is higher in cells transfected with inactive RPTPμ than in cells transfected with wild-type RPTPμ. This suggests that expression of inactive RPTPμ protects p120 ctn from dephosphorylation by endogenous PTPs. In addition, phosphorylation of p120 ctn decreases over time when active RPTPμ is co-expressed, a response not observed with inactive RPTPμ. Thus, tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 ctn serves as a substrate for RPTPμ bothin vitro and in intact cells. While many new members of the RPTP family have been identified in recent years, very little is still known about their intracellular binding partners and substrates. In the present study we demonstrate that RPTPμ, a prototypic RPTP that functions in homotypic cell-cell interactions (5.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Wubbolts R.W. Beijersbergen R.L. van Etten I.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), associates with the catenin p120 ctn. Since no cadherins can be detected in p120 ctn -RPTPμ complexes, we conclude that complex formation occurs independently of cadherins. Similar results were obtained with the related RPTPκ (data not shown). That the interaction is independent of cadherins is supported by the finding that a mutant form of p120 ctn, which lacks most of the Armadillo repeats (p120ΔR3–11), still interacts with RPTPμ but fails to bind cadherins (30.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since p120 ctn does not bind to α-catenin, β-catenin, γ-catenin, or APC (24.Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is unlikely that any of these proteins mediates the interaction between p120 ctn to RPTPμ. The tyrosine dephosphorylation of p120 ctn induced by RPTPμ, observed not only in vitro but also in intact cells, suggests that both proteins are in close proximity. However, we cannot exclude the formal possibility that p120 ctn binding to RPTPμ (or the closely related RPTPκ) involves other, as-yet-unidentified proteins. Whether the relatively low amounts of p120 ctn found in RPTPμ precipitates are indicative of a low affinity or a low stoichiometry interaction cannot be deduced from the present finding. The p120 ctn protein is known to exist in at least four different isoforms (through alternative splicing; Refs. 35.Mo Y.Y. Reynolds A.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2633-2640PubMed Google Scholarand 36.Keirsebilck A. Bonne S. Staes K. van Hengel J. Nollet F. Reynolds A. van Roy F. Genomics. 1998; 50: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), two of which lack significant part of the N terminus. Through mutational analysis, we found that the N terminus of p120 ctn is required for RPTPμ binding. This raises the possibility that p120 ctn isoforms selectively associate with RPTPμ, depending on the presence of an intact N terminus. Further experiments are required to test this possibility. Mutational analysis further indicates that binding of p120 ctn to RPTPμ requires both the juxtamembrane region and the second PTP domain of RPTPμ, but is independent of RPTPμ phosphatase activity and on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p120 ctn. We also showed that, in vitro, p120 ctn is dephosphorylated by a GST fusion protein containing both PTP domains of RPTPμ, and that only the first PTP domain is active toward p120 ctn. This suggests a model in which the second PTP domain may help to recruit p120 ctn, thereby bringing p120 in the correct orientation toward the first PTP domain. The second PTP domain may thus play a role in presenting substrates to the first PTP domain of RPTPμ and possibly other RPTPs. In this respect, it is of note that two proteins interacting with leukocyte common antigen-related RPTP were also shown to bind to the second PTP domain (37.Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 38.Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although these proteins themselves are unlikely to be direct substrates for leukocyte common antigen-related RPTP, they could be involved in binding and presenting substrates to the first catalytic domain. To date, the physiological function of p120 ctn remains unknown. This precludes meaningful assessment of the biological significance of the p120 ctn -RPTPμ interaction and RPTPμ-mediated dephosphorylation of p120 ctn. Currently, the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 ctn on cadherin-binding is controversial; increased affinity toward cadherins has been observed by some (39.Kinch M.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 40.Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Andriopoulou P. Esser S. Risau W. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2065-2077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while others have reported little or no change (19.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.J. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,32.Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Matsuyoshi N. Takeichi M. Ito F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation and molecular organization of cadherin/catenin complexes in endothelial cells is regulated by cell density. At low cell density, p120 ctn is phosphorylated, whereas its phosphorylation and binding to cadherins is reduced at confluence (40.Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Andriopoulou P. Esser S. Risau W. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2065-2077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the up-regulation of RPTPμ expression at high cell density (6.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to investigate whether RPTPμ (and RPTPκ) regulates the organization of cadherin/catenin complexes in a cell density-dependent manner. Overexpression of p120 ctn in NIH3T3 fibroblasts induces profound morphological changes characterized by the formation of dendrite-like extensions (30.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This phenotype is specific for p120 ctn in that overexpressed β-catenin causes only minor shape changes. Furthermore, our preliminary studies reveal that overexpression of p120 ctn in fibroblasts induces the disassembly of actin stress fibers. 2G. C. M. Zondag, unpublished observations. It thus seems likely that p120 ctn plays a role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, Yap et al. (41.Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) suggested that a function for p120 ctn in lateral clustering of cadherins, thereby regulating cell-cell adhesion. While the precise biological function of p120 ctn remains to be elucidated, our findings suggest that RPTPμ regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p120 ctn, and thereby may signal and help to maintain p120 ctn -mediated reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and/or clustering of membrane proteins at sites of cell-cell contact.

Two members of this subfamily have been fully cloned and characterized: PRK1 (also termed protein kinase N) and PRK2. They are activated by fatty acids and phospholipidsin vitro, although the in vivo significance of this potential is as yet uncharacterized (4.Morrice N.A. Fecondo J. Wettenhall R.E.H.

Indeed, the GTPase interaction has been shown to increase modestly the activity of the intact kinase (6.Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 7.Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K.

The observed proteolytic activation of these kinases would support the role of an allosteric amino-terminal GTPase interaction in the regulation of activity (13.Mukai H. Kitagawa M. Shibata H.

J. 1995; 309: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition to any allosteric component, Rho GTPases can also be responsible for the location of these kinases, with RhoB causing localization to an endosomal compartment in fibroblasts (15.Mellor H. Flynn P. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4811-4814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), a translocation event that is associated with the accumulation of a hyperphosphorylated form of the kinase. In addition to GTPases, other PRK interactions have been identified. The adapter protein NCK has been shown to interact with a proline-rich region just N-terminal of the kinase domain of PRK2 (16.Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K.

A similar region is absent in PRK1, suggesting a specificity in the upstream recruitment of these kinases. A potential role for PRKs in the regulation of the cytoskeleton has been proposed following the demonstrated disruption of fibroblast actin stress fibers by the expression of a catalytically inactive PRK2 (8.Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and the observed PRK1 interaction with the head domain of intermediate filament subunits, the subsequent phosphorylation of which results in an inhibition of polymerization (17.Matsuzawa K.

PRK1 has also been implicated in GTPγS and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via Glut4 mobilization in adipocytes (19.Standaert M. Bandyopadhyay G. Galloway L. Ono Y. Mukai H. Farese R. J. Biol.

However, the true cellular target(s) of PRK action in both this process and established Rho responses have remained elusive. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) was originally purified as an activity responsible for the activation loop phosphorylation of PKBα (20.Alessi D.R.

It was found to phosphorylate PKBα at threonine 308 in a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent manner, resulting in activation of the substrate kinase.

PKB phosphorylation and activation by PDK1 show a much greater lipid dependence when the PKB PH domain is intact, suggesting that the lipid interaction with the substrate causes the removal of an intramolecular interaction masking the activation loop from PDK1.

The equivalent PDK1 phosphorylation of a truncated p70S6K is also independent of lipid (22.Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Thein vivo mechanism for PDK1 dependence on the action of PI3K activity is less clear. The observations that PDK1 activity immunopurified from cultured cells is independent of mitogenic stimulation (20.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Cohen P.

Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) suggest that PDK1 is constitutively active and that substrate phosphorylation occurs only when both kinases are co-localized at the same cellular site. However, PDK1 is seen to have some in vivo dependence on PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 even when the substrate lacks a lipid-binding site, suggesting that lipid regulation operates at both the level of kinase and substrate (25.Le Good J.A.

The PRKs possess a putative activation loop phosphorylation site that fits the consensus of all characterized PDK1 substrates. In this study, we demonstrate that PDK1 does indeed phosphorylate the activation loop threonine of both human PRK isoforms and that this phosphorylation event is crucial for the activation of the PRKs. Furthermore, we show that a PRK·PDK1 complex can be formed in vivo and that this is dependent on Rho GTPases. These data provide a mechanism for the Rho-dependent activation of the PRKs and illustrate a novel specificity constraint on this PDK1 substrate. Anti-PRK1 and anti-PRK2 monoclonal antibodies for general Western blot analysis and endogenous PRK2 immunoprecipitation were from Transduction Laboratories. The activation loop phospho-specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated by immunization with a 7-residue phosphorylated peptide antigen (RTST(P)FCG). This was then affinity purified in the presence of excess dephosphorylated peptide by chromatography on an Acti-gel ALD column (Sterogene Bioseparations Inc.) coupled to the phosphopeptide. Rabbit anti-RhoB polyclonal antibody 119 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-EE epitope monoclonal antibody was described previously (31.Schaffhausen B. Benjamin T.L. Pike L. Casnellie J. Krebs E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12467-12470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. The PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin were from Calbiochem, as were the protein phosphatase 1A and 2A inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A. The lipids phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine were from Sigma, and thed-enantiomersn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was a gift from P. Gaffney. The GST-PDK1 protein has been described previously (28.Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M.

The truncated GST-PRK1kin protein was constructed by polymerase chain reaction (using VentTM polymerase, New England Biolabs Inc.) of the Myc-tagged construct incorporating an amino-terminal BamHI site and a carboxyl-terminalNotI site. Following restriction digestion, the fragment was subcloned into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for bacterial expression. EE-tagged PDK1 as well as Myc-PDK1 (full-length) and Myc-PDKΔPH (residues 51–404) were as described (28.Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B.

The GTPase-deficient Rho mutants have been described previously (15.Mellor H. Flynn P. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4811-4814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The PRK2 activation loop mutants T816A and T816E were generated in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using the QuickChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. All mutants were sequenced to confirm integrity. HEK 293 and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 293 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA by a Ca2PO4 procedure as described (32.Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 1 × 105 and incubated for 24 h prior to transfection, and the precipitate was washed off after a further 14–16 h. Cells were harvested 24 h later after treatments described below. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were plated on acid-washed coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, cells were transfected with various mammalian expression vector constructs using Transfast lipid (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After exposure to the lipid/DNA mixture for 7 h, the cells were washed into fresh medium and left for a further 12 h prior to experimentation. GST-PRK1kin was expressed inEscherichia coli GroES/EL cells (DuPont). Transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C to A 600 ∼ 0.6 prior to induction with 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 h of further growth at 30 °C, cells were pelleted, resuspended in 4 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 μm microcystin LR, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), lysed by sonication, and cleared by centrifugation. Proteins were purified by incubation with pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose for 30–40 min at 4 °C. The Sepharose was then washed four times (1× lysis buffer, 1× lysis buffer + 0.5 m NaCl, and 2× storage buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μmmicrocystin)). Purified proteins were eluted in 20 mmglutathione, snap-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Cells were transfected as described above. After the treatments below or in the figure legends, the cells were either lysed directly into 4× Laemmli SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis or washed twice in cold Tris-buffered saline prior to lysis in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmDTT, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 μm microcystin LR. Preclearance of cell lysates with insoluble protein A (Sigma) was followed by incubation with the relevant antibody (anti-PRK2 monoclonal antibody for both endogenous and exogenous PRK2 or anti-EE monoclonal antibody for PDK1). Proteins were immunoprecipitated on protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the Sepharose was washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer, followed by protein elution in 4× SDS sample buffer. Samples were then fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For samples to be used in subsequent kinase assays, the Sepharose was washed (1× lysis buffer, 1× lysis buffer + 0.5 m NaCl, and 2× storage buffer), followed by storage on ice in the final wash buffer. In a 40-μl reaction volume, 100 ng of purified GST-PRK1kin was incubated with or without 12 nm GST-PDK1 in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ and 100 μm ATP. Reactions took place at 30 °C and were terminated at the time points indicated by the addition of 20 μl of 4× Laemmli SDS sample buffer. GST-PRK1kin Thr-774 phosphorylation was assessed by Western analysis using the phospho-specific polyclonal antibody. Lipids were presented as mixed vesicles containing 100 μm phosphatidylserine, 100 μm phosphatidylcholine, and 10 μmPtdIns(3,4,5)P3. For the assessment of GST-PRK1kin activation, a two-stage assay was carried out, similar to that previously described (28.Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Briefly, stage 1 involved the GST-PRK1kin phosphorylation by GST-PDK1 as described above (40 min at 30 °C). In stage 2, 20 μl of storage buffer containing 4% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml MBP, 100 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/reaction was added to the reactions from stage 1, followed by a further 15-min incubation at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of sample buffer and heating to 95 °C prior to fractionation on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The acrylamide gel was Coomassie Blue-stained and dried, and the incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into MBP was assessed by Cerenkov counting. Immunoprecipitates of either endogenous PRK2 or the overexpressed mutants were prepared as described above. The washed protein G-Sepharose containing the purified kinases was resuspended in storage buffer containing 0.25% Triton X-100 as a 30% slurry and stored on ice. Using a positive displacement pipette, 10 μl of the slurry was added to a kinase reaction (storage buffer containing 2.5 mm Mg2+, 100 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.5 mg/ml MBP, and 0.25% Triton X-100) to a final volume of 40 μl. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min in a shaking incubator (MicrothermTM, Camlab) and terminated by the addition of 20 μl of sample buffer. Orthophosphate incorporation into MBP was assessed as described above. Cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (15.Mellor H. Flynn P. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4811-4814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min. Autofluorescence was quenched by incubation with 0.1% (w/v) sodium borohydride for 10 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h and with fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min. All incubations were performed in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were mounted under MOWIOL 4-88 (Calbiochem) containing 0.6% (w/v) 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane as an anti-photobleaching agent and were viewed using a Leica DM RBE confocal microscope equipped with a Plan APO ×63/1.4 oil immersion lens. Cy2 and Cy3 were excited using the 488 and 568 nm lines of a krypton-argon laser. Series of images were taken at 0.5-μm intervals through the Z-plane of the sample and were processed to form a projected image. Previous studies on the phosphorylation of the PRK family of kinases has provided evidence for an autophosphorylation event in the regulation of the mammalian proteins (33.Peng B. Morrice N.A. Groenen L.C. Wettenhall R.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32233-32240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that hyperphosphorylated species can accumulate in endosomal compartments in a RhoB-dependent manner (15.Mellor H. Flynn P. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4811-4814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To investigate both the mechanisms and possible modulators of this control in vitroand in vivo, we initially expressed the PRK1 kinase domain (amino acids 602–942) in E. coli as a GST fusion protein, GST-PRK1kin. This truncation mutant bypasses any requirement for Rho·GTP, which interacts with the inhibitory amino-terminal HR1 domain (11.Flynn P. Mellor H. Palmer R. Panayotou G. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2698-2705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12.Kitagawa M. Shibata H. Toshimori M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purified GST-PRK1kin was found to have very low intrinsic protein kinase activity in vitro (<0.2 units/mg) against the substrate MBP. This activity was not increased on preincubation of the kinase domain with MgATP (see below), suggesting that the bacterially expressed protein may require heterologous modification for full activity. The recent finding that the closely related PKC family members are subjected to phosphorylation by PDK1 in their activation loop sites (24.Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) led us to examine whether PRK1 was also phosphorylated by PDK1. As shown in Fig. 1 A, PDK1 phosphorylated GST-PRK1kin within its activation loop in a time-dependent manner. This was detected using a polyclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of threonine 774. No phosphorylation of this site was detectable under the same conditions in the absence of PDK1. The in vitro phosphorylation of PKBα by PDK1 has been shown to be dependent upon the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (28.Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation of Thr-774 on PRK1 by PDK1 was not affected by the addition of mixed lipid vesicles containing 10 μm PtdIns(3,4,5)P3(Fig. 1 B). Under the same conditions, the activity of GST-PDK1 against MBP was PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent (data not shown). Optimum phosphorylation of GST-PRK1kin by PDK1 was associated with a >60-fold activation of the kinase domain, resulting in a specific activity of 12.5 units/mg (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with the phosphorylation data, this activation/activity is not dependent upon the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. To assess the physiological potential of PDK1 as a PRK activation loop kinase, we monitored the phosphorylation state of endogenous PRK1 and PRK2 in HEK 293 cells transfected with PDK1 or with the GTPases RhoA and RhoB (as GTPase-deficient Q63L mutants). As shown in Fig. 2, although both PRK isoforms showed very low basal activation loop phosphorylation, expression of either Rho mutant or PDK1 led to a substantial increase in the specific phosphorylation of both kinases. Thus, both controls act to influence the phosphorylation of PRK1 and PRK2. The combination of transfected Rho protein plus PDK1 did not further increase phosphorylation of either PRK. This is not due to a high stoichiometry of phosphorylation since treatment of cells with the protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitor okadaic acid (or calyculin A) led to a more extensive activation loop phosphorylation of both kinases, coincident with other undefined modifications that caused a shift in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mobility (Fig. 2,upper and center panels). This implies that requirements additional to Rho and PDK1 are involved in the observed phosphorylation and mobility shift. The products of PI3K have been shown to play a key role in the phosphorylation of PKB and other AGC kinases by PDK1 (29.Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the effect of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on PRK activation loop phosphorylation. Although the basal Thr-774 occupation of endogenous PRK1 was only slightly altered by the inhibitor treatment (Fig. 3), the increased signals associated with the transient transfection of either GTPase-deficient Rho or PDK1 constructs were reduced to almost basal levels by a block of PI3K activity. This is consistent with a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent PDK1 localization/allosteric event being necessary for PRK phosphorylation. Interestingly, the PRK activation loop phosphorylation induced by PDK1ΔPH (residues 51–404) was also seen to be dependent upon PI3K products, being inhibited by LY294002. This suggests that a separate pathway exists between PI3K and PRK other than through PDK1, perhaps through endogenous GTPases. Immunopurified endogenous PRK2 displayed an increase in catalytic activity associated with increased activation loop phosphorylation. The comparatively modest effect of PDK1 expression on phosphorylation was insufficient to elicit a significant change in catalytic activity (Fig.4). However, the much greater activation loop phosphorylation associated with phosphatase inhibition, coupled with the modification resulting in the shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, produced a >3-fold increase in activity against MBP. Although the in vitro data generated with GST-PRK1kin suggested an absolute requirement for activation loop phosphorylation, the endogenous full-length PRK proteins seemed to require additional modifications. To assess the direct influence of activation loop phosphorylation on in vivo activity, activation loop mutants were employed. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with either wild-type PRK2 or the T816A or T816E mutant. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-PRK2 monoclonal antibody, which resulted in endogenous as well as exogenous protein being purified. The in vitro activity of immunoprecipitates was corrected to untransfected cells. As shown in Fig.5, the T816A mutant had an activity below the basal level, and the T816E mutant produced only 7% of the wild-type activity. This indicates that an intact activation loop threonine is required for activity and further that the acidic mutation is a poor surrogate for phosphorylation. To determine whether Thr-816 phosphorylation was required for the increased activity in response to phosphatase inhibition, we compared the two mutants with wild-type PRK2 following okadaic acid treatment of cells. As seen previously for endogenous PRK2, exogenous wild-type PRK2 showed a marked activation due to the phosphatase inhibitor. Neither mutant displayed any significant activity increase o"

This work, involving a wide variety of cytogenetic, genetic, and physical mapping studies, has provided a tremendously broad range of information. The next logical step of the genetic analysis (called “functional genomics”) is to collect detailed information about the biological roles of known and newly identified genes. A “biological fingerprint” can be obtained by determining expression profiles of genes in a tissue or process of interest as the result of physiological or pathological states. Collecting expression profiles on a genomic scale could thus provide the link between the structure of the genome and the biological function of the genes. Although modulation involves differential mRNA stability, post-translational modifications, regulation of transport, mechanisms, and protein degradation, etc., one of the key mechanisms in eukaryotic gene regulation takes place at the transcriptional level. Consequently, detection of even subtle gene expression modulations provides a comprehensive framework for studying events which affect cellular metabolism and regulation on a genomic scale (1.Schena M.

These technologies use a labeled “complex probe” prepared from total cell or tissue mRNA by reverse transcription and labeling. This complex probe contains thousands of different messenger RNA species, characterized by different expression levels, and is hybridized onto an array consisting of thousands of DNA targets, each representing a particular gene (10.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar). The targets can be bacterial colonies, PCR1 products from cDNA clones, or sets of oligonucleotides designed to assay a gene of interest. After hybridization, the signals can be quantitatively scored, and thus measure the relative abundance of each sequenced species present in the complex probe.

Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 16.Cossart P. Lecuit M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3797-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). L. monocytogenes is an intracellular Gram-positive bacteria capable of penetrating and growing in both professional phagocytes and non-phagocytic target cells. Macrophages respond to L. monocytogenes infection by transient activation of host cell signal transduction pathways, leading to modulation of gene expression. In this work, we documented large scale gene expression measurements in the human monocytic THP1 cell line infected by L. monocytogenes. The aim of this study was 2-fold. First, we intended to identify genes which are differentially expressed followingL. monocytogenes infection in the THP1 cell line in order to boost our knowledge on cross-talk between this microorganism and its host cell. Second, the accuracy of the results presented here was addressed by analyzing the reproducibility and sensitivity of data computed by different high-throughput measurement systems of hybridization signatures. Three commercially available systems were tested in parallel: oligonucleotide DNA chips from Affymetrix (2.Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar), that allow the study of expression levels of 6,800 human genes; AtlasTM cDNA array I high-density membranes fromCLONTECH containing spotted PCR products targeting 588 human genes; and high density Gene Discovery Array Human ITM cDNA colony filters from Genome Systems allowing screening of 18,376 human genes. Reproducibility of the DNA chip technology data was assessed at two different levels: at the hybridization pattern level and at gene expression measurement variation level. The results obtained after repeated measurement studies, independent preparations of complex probes, or independent infections of the THP1 cell line by L. monocytogenes are discussed. From a biological and physiological point of view, this study allowed the reproducible identification of 74 up-regulated genes and 23 down-regulated genes as a consequence of L. monocytogenes infection. The reliability of the presented data was reinforced by comparison of the hybridization signatures of two independent infections of the THP1 cell line. The expression profile of some of the identified genes was investigated by macroarrays and Northern blot, and showed a close correlation with the DNA chip results. Therefore, enriched by a critical analysis of the technologies available for transcriptome studies, this work details information on genes whose expression was modulated following L. monocytogenes infection and provides foundation to understand this infection process in order to identify new specific therapeutic targets. L. monocytogenes (strain EGD) from ATCC were grown in log-phase cultures and added to THP-1 cells at 10:1 multiplicity of infection. Human promyelocytic THP-1 cells (ATCC) were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2, RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 mmglutamine (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy, France) and 10% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma Chimie, Saint-Quentin, France). Monocytes were derived from THP-1 cells by treatment with 0.3 mm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Sigma) and 0.3 mm retinoic acid (Sigma) in RPMI medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum for 48 h (increases of CD14 and CD11b on treated THP-1 cells were confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis). THP-1 derived monocytes were then infected withL. monocytogenes at 10:1 multiplicity of infection for 2 h and lysed in guanidine isothiocyanate lysis buffer. Total RNA was extracted by CsCl2 ultracentrifugation (17.Bouaboula M. Bourrie B. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Shire D. Le Fur G. Casellas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13973-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The mRNA was prepared using the FastTrack 2.0 Kit (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands). No mRNA degradation was noted by visualization of residual ribosomal 28 S and 18 S mRNAs on a denaturing agarose gel. AtlasTMcDNA array I (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) is a positively charged nylon 8 × 12-cm membrane that includes 588 human cDNAs spotted in duplicates as 200–500 base pairs PCR-amplified products. The cDNA complex probe preparation and hybridization were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (AtlasTM Human cDNA Expression Array Kit,CLONTECH). Briefly, cDNA complex probes were prepared by simultaneous reverse transcription and radioactive labeling of 1 μg of denatured mRNA in the presence of 1× CDS primer mixture, 30 μCi of [32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.5 mm dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP, 0.05 mmdATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in a 10-μl final volume. Unincorporated [32P]dATP were removed by gel-filtration onto a Sephadex S200 column (Amersham Pharmacia biotech). Typical activity was estimated as 107 cpm/μg of mRNA. RNA was removed by denaturation with 0.1 m NaOH, 1 mmEDTA at 68 °C for 20 min, followed by a neutralization step with 0.5m NaH2PO4 (pH 7) at 68 °C for 10 min. The AtlasTM cDNA arrays were prehybridized with the ExpressHyb hybridization buffer (CLONTECH) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml of single-stranded DNA for 1 h at 68 °C; hybridization was then performed with 4 106 cpm of cDNA complex probe in 5 ml of hybridization buffer at 68 °C for 16 h. The membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC and 1% SDS at 68 °C for 30 min, then twice again with 0.1× SCC and 0.5% SDS at 68 °C for 30 min. The AtlasTM arrays were exposed to x-ray film at −20 °C for varying lengths of time and intensity of each spot was analyzed as described below. High density Gene Discovery Array Human ITM cDNA colony filters (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) is a 22 × 22-cm nylon filter spotted in duplicate with 18,376 human cDNA clones. The cDNA complex probes and hybridizations were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cDNA complex probes were prepared by simultaneous reverse transcription and labeling of denatured 1 μg of mRNA in the presence of 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)MN (Genome Systems), 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP, 0.5 mm of dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) in a 10-μl final volume. Unincorporated [32P]dCTP were removed by gel filtration onto a Sephadex S200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Typical activity was estimated as 40 × 106 cpm/μg of mRNA. RNA was removed by treatment with 0.25 n NaOH at 37 °C for 10 min followed by neutralization with 0.16 mTris-HCl and 0.12 n HCl. The complex probe was purified onto a new Sephadex S200 column before hybridization. 107cpm of heat-denatured purified complex probes were then incubated with prehybridized filters in 10 ml of hybridization buffer (6× SSC, 5× Denhart, 2% SDS, 50% formamide, 100 μg of single-stranded DNA) (18.Soares M.B. Bonaldo M.F. Jelene P. Su L. Lawton L. Efstratiadis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9228-9232Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) at 42 °C for 16 h. After hybridization, filters were washed twice with 2× SSC and 1% SDS for 30 min at 68 °C, then washed twice more with 0.6× SSC and 1% SDS at 68 °C for 30 min. Autoradiography and signal analysis were carried out as described below. Oligonucleotide arrays Hu6800 SetTM (subA, subB, subC, and subD chips) and Hu6800 ArrayTM (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) are 1.28 × 1.28-cm oligonucleotide microarrays which allow the characterization of genome-wide expression levels of approximately 6,800 human genes. The 25-mer oligonucleotides targeting the 6,800 human genes were distributed between four chips in the Hu6800 SetTM version, whereas they were assembled over a single chip in the Hu6800 ArrayTM version. Each human gene was screened by 20 complementary oligonucleotides on average. To increase the detection specificity, each complementary oligonucleotide (perfect match) was synthesized by the manufacturers with a closely related mismatch partner in a physically adjacent position (2.Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar). Complex probe was prepared by converting 4 μg of mRNA into double-stranded cDNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Life technologies) with an oligo(dT) primer incorporating a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site. After second-strand synthesis, labeled RNAs were made directly from the cDNA pool in an in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction by incorporating labeled ribonucleotides (Ambion, Austin, TX). Biotin-labeled UTP and CTP (1:3 labeled to unlabeled) plus unlabeled ATP and GTP were used for the reaction with 2500 units of T7 RNA polymerase. Following the reaction, unincorporated nucleotide triphosphates were removed using a Sephadex S200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The total molar concentration of labeled RNAs was determined from the absorbence at 260 nm. The typical yield was 60–80 μg of labeled RNA from 4 μg of mRNA. Labeled RNA was then fragmented randomly to an average length of 50–200 bases by heating at 94 °C in 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.1), 100 mmKOAc, and 30 mm MgOAc. The sample to be hybridized onto one chip (200 μl) contained 10 μg of labeled RNA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 0.1 mg/ml unlabeled degraded herring sperm DNA (Sigma), as well as internal standard RNAs. These latter were bacterial and phage-labeled RNAs prepared as above from clones containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter site, and introduced into each sample at a known amount. The hybridization solutions were 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.005% Triton X-100 for the Hu6800 SetTM chips, and 100 mm MES, 1 mNaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20 for the Hu6800 ArrayTM chip, as recommended by the manufacturers. Prior to hybridization, labeled RNA samples (200 μl) were heated to 99 °C in the hybridization solution for 5 min, then allowed to equilibrate at 40 °C (Hu6800 SetTM) or at 45 °C (Hu6800 ArrayTM) for 5 min. Samples to be hybridized were then injected into the chip and placed in a rotisserie overnight at 40 °C (Hu6800 SetTM) or 45 °C (Hu6800 ArrayTM). Following hybridization, the Hu6800 SetTM arrays were washed with 6× SSPE-T (0.9 m NaCl, 60 mmNaH2PO4, 0.005% Triton X-100) at 50 °C for 1 h, then with 0.5× SSPE-T at 50 °C for 15 min, and finally stained with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (10 μg/ml in 6× SSPE-T buffer, 10 min at 40 °C). After several washes (6× SSPE-T), the array was read using a scanning confocal microscope (Hewlett Packard), where the emission of fluorescence was detected using a 560-nm long-pass filter. Following hybridization, the Hu6800 ArrayTM chips were washed with 6× SSPE, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.005% Antifoam (Sigma) at 25 °C, and then with 100 mm MES, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20 at 50 °C. Staining was performed for 10 min at 25 °C with a 10 μg/ml streptavidin-phycoerythrin solution in a 100 mm MES, 1 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.005% antifoam buffer. A subsequent post-stained step using an anti-streptavidin goat biotinylated antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at a 3 μg/ml concentration, in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml normal goat IgG (Sigma) was performed at 25 °C for 10 min. The probe array was then restained as described above with the streptavidin-phycoerythrin solution before scanning. This antibody staining used with the Hu6800 ArrayTM chips is necessary to amplify the hybridization signals of the size-reduced hybridization features of these arrays (24 × 24 μm compared with 50 × 50 μm for the Hu6800 SetTM chips). Data analyses were performed using the Genechip SoftwareTM package. Comparative analysis with the AffymetrixTM oligonucleotide chip data. Autoradiographs generated after exposition of the hybridized membranes were scanned with an Agfa II apparatus. The digital pictures obtained with theCLONTECH membranes where analyzed using the BioImage 2-D Analyzer software™ package (version 6.1), while the Genome Systems membranes were analyzed with the AIS software™ package (Imaging Research Inc). The volume of the automatically detected spots were measured and the mean values corresponding to each duplicate were exported in a relational data base constructed and managed by Superbase under Windows NT. To calculate the fold change of expression values, intensity values between two experiments were adjusted by normalization (based on the sum of all intensities detected in both experiments). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out as described by Ref. 19.Bouaboula M. Legoux P. Pességué B. Delpech B. Dumont X. Piechaczyk M. Casellas P. Shire D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21830-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Northern blot was performed following standard procedures (20.Church M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). MIP1α, MIP1β, TNFα, and HHCPA probes were prepared from purified radiolabeled PCR product obtained using primers specific to MIP1α (sense, GTCATCTTCCTAACCAAGCG; antisense, TGTGGCTGTTTGGCAACAAC), TNFα (sense, ACAAGCCTGTAGCCCATGTT; antisense, AAAGTAGACCTGCCCAGACT), MCP1(sense, TGGAGCATGAAAGTCTCTGC; antisense, TGGAATCCTGAACCCACTTC), andHHCPA (sense, AATGGCCTCCTGGCGTAAGCT; antisense, CAGGGAAAGCTCTCTCCATTG). Gene expression measurements using AffymetrixTMoligonucleotide arrays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with complex probes produced by an IVT. This approach enables amplification of the complex poly(A) population (typically 15-fold amplification), and was found not to introduce significant measurement bias (2.Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of RNAs in the complex probe was deduced from the hybridization patterns, and the abundance levels were determined from a quantitative assessment of hybridization intensities. Total RNA was isolated from THP1 cells and used to prepare labeled complex probes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After the hybridization reaction and analysis of the intensity signals of the 6,800 genes assayed on the arrays, an average of 2,366 were scored as unambiguously present. In 10 μg of total RNA and a volume of 200 μl, a frequency of 1:300,000 corresponds to a concentration of 0.5 pm and 0.1 fmol (approximately 6.107 molecules or about 30 pg) of specific RNA (2.Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar). The intensity signals of the genes detected as present within the THP1 complex probe were compared with the intensity values of the internal standards RNAs spiked into each sample at a known concentration (1.5, 5, 25, and 100 pm) in order to estimate the distribution of RNA amounts in the complex probe. Approximately 27% of all RNAs were present at a concentration below 1:100,000, 48% between 1:100,000 and 1:10,000, 20% of all RNAs were detected between 1:10,000 and 1:1,000, and only a few RNAs (5%) were present at above 1:1,000 concentration. These results were in agreement with typical distribution patterns of mRNA populations in mammalian cells. To determine the reproducibility of the measurements, we hybridized the same THP1 complex probe to two different sets of arrays (Fig.1 A). Repeated hybridizations were possible because only a small fraction (estimated as below 1% (21.Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.H. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar)) of the labeled RNAs remained bound to the array following each hybridization reaction. The intensity distribution patterns demonstrated a very close correlation between the two experiments (r = 0.99), whereas a higher distribution discrepancy was observed for genes with a low intensity value. These non-reproducible values were mostly located below an intensity level of 60 (corresponding to 5-fold the noise value calculated by the GenechipTM software package). When limiting the analysis to signals 5-fold above the noise value, only 1% of all the RNAs showed a 2–3-fold difference between repeat measurements, and only 0.4% showed a difference above 3-fold. To assess the variation due to the source rather than the hybridization and reading steps, we then sought to determine the influence of independent preparations, particularly the amplification step introduced by the IVT reaction within each complex probe. To investigate this, we hybridized samples independently prepared from the same mRNA preparation. The intensity distribution patterns (Fig. 1 B) showed a correlation of r= 0.96 between the two experiments, and as in Fig. 1 A, the best correlation was obtained for genes whose intensity value was above 60 (4-fold the noise value in these experiments). For intensities above 60, 5.8% of the total RNAs showed an intensity difference of 2–3-fold, and 0.7% showed a difference of at least 3-fold. Taken together, these data suggested that independent handlings and IVT reactions introduced slight variation in the measured signals, mostly observed at a 2–3-fold variation level. We next used the oligonucleotide microarrays to monitor mRNA levels in a human pro-myelocytic cell line after infection by the pathogenic microorganism L. monocytogenes. Cells from the human THP1 cell line were treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and retinoic acid to induce cellular differentiation toward a macrophage-like state prior to bacterial infection. Total RNA was isolated 2 h after infection and used to prepare the complex probes as described above. Non-infected THP1 cells were used as control. Hybridization signatures obtained with both samples were analyzed and compared after normalization by the GenechipTMsoftware package, giving rise to different parameters for each targeted human gene: the intensity signal, the call (expression level increased or decreased compared with the baseline control), and the quantification of expression variations between the two samples (called fold change or FC). As expected, levels of the internal standard RNAs and housekeeping genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin) did not change significantly after normalization (data not shown). By contrast, the bacterial infection event induced a marked physiological change in the host cell gene expression. One hundred and sixty-six genes and 248 genes were found to be up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. Fig. 2 A illustrates the correlation between the hybridization signatures of the control and theL. monocytogenes-infected complex probes (r= 0.77). The up-regulation or down-regulation of gene expression is clearly illustrated by these points located outside the 3-fold lines. The qualitative distribution of the FC obtained in independent experiments is illustrated in Fig. 2 B. Interestingly, most (80%) of the down-regulated genes after L. monocytogenesinfection displayed a low FC (between 1.8 and 3). On the contrary, the FC distribution pattern of up-regulated genes was wider, and only 27% of the FC were between 1.8- and 3-fold induction. To assess the reliability of the genes whose expression was found to be increased or decreased in L. monocytogenes-infected THP1 cells, we sought to determine the reproducibility of the observed expression differences. FC reproducibility was first investigated in repeated experiments using the same probe, then in experiments using independently prepared complex probes, and finally the closest comparison was made with complex probes issued from two independent bacterial infections of the THP1 cell line. Based on Fig. 1, we only considered in the analysis the genes displaying an intensity signal above 60 (4–5-fold the noise signal). Moreover, further selection was tested by considering FC >1.7 (reasons for this choice will be detailed under “Discussion”). The results are presented in TableI. When we hybridized the same two complex probes to different sets of arrays, 85% of the genes found to be increased were reproduced in both experiments. With independently prepared complex probes, the reproducibility dropped slightly to 68.5% (probably due to variations introduced by the IVT reaction). And finally, when complex probes produced from two independent infections of the THP1 cell line were tested, 57% of the up-regulated genes were still reproduced. This reflected additional biological variations in the assay. Considering the down-regulated genes, 52.5% of them were reproduced between independent hybridizations. This value dropped to 33% with independent preparations of complex probes, and to 21% when independent bacterial infections were tested.Table IRe"

The initiation step is complex and is carried out by a large family of homologous UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (1.Clausen H. Bennett E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The polypeptide GalNAc-transferase isoforms have distinct enzymatic properties and are differentially expressed, thus presumably allowing for a high level of control in determining sites of O-glycan attachments in proteins. The processing step involves elongation, branching, and terminal modification of the O-glycans (2.Brockhausen I. Schachter H. Gabius H.-J. Gabius S. Glycosciences. Chapman and Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 79-113Google Scholar). It is apparent that essential steps in O-glycan elongation and branching are catalyzed by multiple glycosyltransferase isoforms from families of homologous glycosyltransferases.

In the case of β4-galactosyltransferases one isoform, β4Gal-T4, appears to have superior kinetic properties for catalysis of the core 2 O-glycan poly-N-acetyllactosamine elongation (9.Ujita M.

Two β3GlcNAc-Ts elongate core 2 O-glycans, although comparative analyses have not been performed (10.Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl.

Although the catalytic functions of these glycosyltransferase isoforms are not completely understood, the available data support the hypothesis that individual enzyme isoforms display unique kinetic properties and specific catalytic activities with regard to glycan structure and types of glycoconjugate. This is further supported by the finding that glycosyltransferase isoforms have different tissue expression patterns.Core 2 O-glycan branching is a key step in mucin-typeO-glycosylation (2.Brockhausen I. Schachter H. Gabius H.-J. Gabius S. Glycosciences. Chapman and Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 79-113Google Scholar). Core 2 O-glycans such as sialyl-Lex and associated structures serve as ligands for selectin- and galectin-mediated cell-cell adhesion events that play important roles in T-cell development (13.Baum L.G.

Some evidence indicates that a major control point for synthesis of these ligands is the core 2 branching event catalyzed by β6GlcNAc-T activities (15.McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin.

Marked changes in core 2 branching and β6GlcNAc-T activities are associated with T-cell maturation and malignant transformation (18.Yousefi S. Higgins E. Daoling Z. Pollex-Kruger A. Hindsgaul O.

Multiple core 2 β6GlcNAc-T isoforms exist; hence, it is important to identify and characterize these to understand the molecular genetic basis for their differential regulation and activity. The first core 2 β6GlcNAc-T identified by transfection cloning, C2GnT1, is widely expressed, functions only in core 2 synthesis (3.Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 5.Yeh J.-C. Ong E. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11247-11252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second core 2 β6GlcNAc-T, C2GnT2, was cloned by an EST cloning strategy and has a broader acceptor specificity (4.Schwientek T. Nomoto M. Levery S.B. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Bennett E.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). C2GnT1 was predicted to control synthesis of core 2 selectin ligands in leukocytes and lymphoid tissues; however, mice deficient in C2GnT1 exhibited partial reduction in selectin ligand production, and there were no significant changes in lymphocyte homing properties (17.Ellies L.G. Tsuboi S. Petryniak B. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these results would be the existence of additional core 2 β6GlcNAc-Ts. C2GnT2 does not appear to be a candidate for this gene as its expression pattern is restricted and mainly associated with mucous epithelia (4.Schwientek T. Nomoto M. Levery S.B.

C2GnT3 exhibits exclusive core 2 acceptor specificity, and it shows a unique tissue distribution with high expression found only in thymus. C2GnT3 is predicted to play an important role in T-cell development and lymphocyte homing.DISCUSSIONAt least three human β6GlcNAc-Ts are involved inO-glycan branching. The C2GnT3 presented in this report is similar to C2GnT1 in that it functions solely in core 2O-glycan branching (3.Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In contrast, C2GnT2 has more diverse functionality in core 2 and core 4 O-glycan branching as well as in synthesis of I poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures (4.Schwientek T. Nomoto M. Levery S.B. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Bennett E.P. Hollingsworth M.A. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4504-4512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5.Yeh J.-C. Ong E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The catalytic activities of all three enzymes have been studied in vitro with saccharide and glycoprotein substrates and in vivo in CHO cells using immunoprobing for product identification. Nevertheless, further studies are required to evaluate the fine detail of the apparent redundancy in core 2 and I branching activities. Differences may be envisioned that are related to type of glycoconjugate, peptide sequence around glycosylation sites, and final glycan structures. C2GnT3 uniquely exhibits a restricted expression pattern in normal human organs with high expression found only in thymus (Fig. 6). Core 2 O-glycans are important for T-cell development and lymphocyte trafficking (13.Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C.H. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 14.Kumar R. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Cumming D.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3872-3879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 485-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and given the present data showing that C2GnT3 is the dominant core 2O-glycan synthase in thymus, C2GnT3 is likely to play a significant role for these processes. It is not possible to delineate fully individual roles of each member of the β6GlcNAc-T gene family from available data of mRNA expression or β6GlcNAc-T activities, mainly because the available information is from studies of whole organs. We postulate that there is an important role for C2GnT3 in T-cell biology, based on the finding that mice deficient in C2GnT1 only showed partial reduction in selectin ligands, and lymphocyte homing was essentially unaffected (17.Ellies L.G. Tsuboi S. Petryniak B. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mice deficient in C2GnT1 had no measurable core 2 GlcNAc-T activity in kidney (17.Ellies L.G. Tsuboi S. Petryniak B. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This is in partial agreement with the finding that Northern analyses indicate low expression levels of C2GnT2 (4.Schwientek T. Nomoto M. Levery S.B. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Bennett E.P. Hollingsworth M.A. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4504-4512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5.Yeh J.-C. Ong E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and C2GnT3 (Fig. 7) in kidney. Availability of C2GnT3 is a significant step toward understanding the complex regulation of O-glycosylation and synthesis of selectin ligands in different organs.C2GnT3 was identified by analysis of genome survey sequences. These sequences are short single reads similar to ESTs, but the origin is genomic DNA and may represent random sequences or sequences derived from ends of genomic clones. Genome survey sequence information is preliminary to the full genomic sequence. It is estimated that the EST sequence information available so far covers over 50% of all human genes, and genomic sequencing information is required to identify remaining genes. There may be a number of reasons why transcribed genes are not represented by ESTs. Rare messages or messages with highly restricted expression patterns may not be included, but also technical problems with the EST strategy may account for this. One major problem is that EST cDNA clones are size selected for average transcript sizes to ensure 5′ sequence information from coding regions, and this may be in conflict with genes having long 3′-UTRs. Furthermore, the 3′-UTR may have secondary structures preventing cDNA synthesis. Several expressed glycosyltransferase genes, e.g. the histo-blood group ABO gene, have not been identified in the EST data bases, 3E. P. Bennett, T. Schwientek, and H. Clausen, unpublished observations. but the specific reason for this is not clarified. The C2GnT3 gene identified here was shown to produce an mRNA transcript of approximately 5.5 kilobases, mainly in the thymus (Fig. 6). The available 3′-UTR sequence information did not contain a consensus polyadenylation signal, and BLAST searches against the EST data base did not provide ESTs derived from this sequence. It is conceivable that further 3′ sequence contains the polyadenylation signal.The in vitro kinetic properties of C2GnT3 resembled those of C2GnT1 (4.Schwientek T. Nomoto M. Levery S.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and infer its exclusive function in core 2O-glycan synthesis. C2GnT3 efficiently utilized glycoproteins carrying unsubstituted core 1 structures including asialo-glycophorin A and asialo-fetuin. Asialo-bovine submaxillary mucin, with only 6% fucosylated or unsubstituted core 1, was a poor substrate (36.Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5704-5717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Martensson S. Levery S.B. Fang T.T. Bendiak B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 603-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A similar pattern of activity toward glycoproteins was recently obtained with recombinant mouse C2GnT1 (38.Zeng S. Dinter A. Eisenkratzer D. Biselli M. Wandrey C. Berger E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Both C2GnT1 and C2GnT3 exhibited core 2 synthase activity in vivo with CD43, suggesting that both enzymes function with the same glycoprotein acceptor (33.Fox R.I. Hueniken M. Fong S. Behar S. Royston I. Singhal S.K. Thompson L. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 762-767PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Saitoh O. Piller F. Fox R.I. Fukuda M. Blood. 1991; 77: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosphingolipid substrates have not been tested with any of the human β6GlcNAc-Ts, mainly because of a lack of availability of these complex glycolipids. However, a kidney-associated form of murine C2GnT1 was shown to regulate expression of hybrid-type lacto-globoseries glycolipids (Galβ1–3[GlcNAcβ1–6]GalNAcβ1–3Galα1–4Galβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer) (39.Sekine M. Hashimoto Y. Suzuki M. Inagaki F. Takio K. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31143-31148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge β6GlcNAc branching has only been found in (neo)-lactoseries glycolipids in man.Several previous studies described developmentally regulated core 2 GlcNAc-T activities during various cellular events (18.Yousefi S.

Changes in C2GnT1 expression in the developing mouse embryo were shown by in situ hybridization (43.Granovsky M. Fode C. Warren C.E. Campbell R.M. Marth J.D. Pierce M. Fregien N. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A recent study found a 100-fold difference in enzyme activity but unchanged levels of murine C2GnT1 mRNA upon induced retrodifferentiation of the embryonal cell lines PSA-5E and PYS-2 (44.VanderElst I.E. Datti A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, the specific contribution of individual β6GlcNAc-T isoforms to core 2 and I branching activities in cells and tissues are still unclear.Northern analysis indicated highly restricted expression of C2GnT3 mainly to the thymus (Fig. 6). C2GnT1 is variably expressed in most organs tested, and the highest levels are found in thyroid, spleen, and mucosal tissues (5.Yeh J.-C. Ong E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Expression of C2GnT1 in mucosal tissues resembles the expression pattern of C2GnT2 (4.Schwientek T. Nomoto M. Levery S.B. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Bennett E.P. Hollingsworth M.A. Clausen H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). C2GnT3 is also weakly expressed in small intestine and stomach. C2GnT1 was found by Northern analysis to be weakly expressed in thymus (5.Yeh J.-C. Ong E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and in situhybridization localized C2GnT1 expression to thymocytes (13.Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C.H. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, among the known core 2 O-glycan synthase genes, C2GnT3 appears to be the dominant core 2 synthase in thymus. One possibility is that C2GnT3 has important functions in synthesis of core 2O-glycans on cortical thymocytes (13.Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C.H. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Core 2 structures on thymocyte surface proteins are ligands for galectin-1, which participates in interactions between thymocytes and thymic epithelium (13.Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C.H. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Both C2GnT1 and C2GnT3 are weakly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and lymph nodes; however, further studies are required to define specific cell types. C2GnT1 is highly expressed in spleen indicating strong expression in B-cells, which is in agreement with the finding that C2GnT1 expression correlates with O-glycan branch formation and sialyl-Lex expression in the human pre-B lymphocytic leukemia cell line KM3 (42.Nakamura M. Kudo T. Narimatsu H. Furukawa Y. Kikuchi J. Asakura S. Yang W. Iwase S. Hatake K. Miura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26779-26789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, strong expression of C2GnT3 in thymus indicates association with T-cells.In situ hybridization and/or immunohistology with appropriate probes are required for further clarification.The β6GlcNAc-T gene family consists of at least four glycosyltransferases with acceptor substrate specificity for galactose and/or N-acetylgalactosamine and one pseudogene (45.Bierhuizen M.F. Maemura K. Fukuda M. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The genomic organizations of the three C2GnT genes are similar with the coding regions contained in a single exon. Introns in the 5′-UTR of C2GnT1 and C2GnT2 have been found (25.Bierhuizen M.F. Maemura K. Kudo S. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 4T. Schwientek and H. Clausen, unpublished observations. In contrast, the coding region of IGnT is contained in three exons (25.Bierhuizen M.F. Maemura K. Kudo S. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The genes are located at different chromosomal loci as follows:IGnT is at 6p24; C2GnT1 is at 9q21;C2GnT2 is at 15q22; and C2GnT3 is at 5q12 (4.Schwientek T. Nomoto M. Levery S.B.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The relatively high sequence similarity among the coding regions of the core 2 synthase genes and their similar genomic organizations indicate that these arose through gene duplication followed by sequence divergence. The more complex genomic organization of IGnTcombined with lower sequence similarity to C2GnTs suggests thatIGnT represents a distinct member of the β6GlcNAc-T family that diverged early in evolution. Surprisingly, a total of six homologues of the C2GnT gene family have been identified in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, but functional characterizations of these genes have not been reported (46.Warren C.E. Krizus A. Partridge E. Lau J.Y.T. Roy P.J. Zhang L. Culotti J.G. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 1999; 9 (abstr.): 1111Google Scholar). The characteristics of the β6GlcNAc-T gene family resemble those of other homologous glycosyltransferase gene families in terms of genes and primary structures of the proteins. Moreover, there are differences in kinetic properties and expression patterns of individual isoforms of each family. Thus, it appears likely that gene duplication and divergence was influenced by functional requirements for synthesis of different glycoconjugates. Another possible influence was the need to obtain differential regulation of glycoconjugate synthesis in different cell types during various biological and developmental processes.The biological roles of core 2 O-glycans are among the most extensively studied in the carbohydrate field. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of core 2 O-glycosylation is of high interest. Identification and characterization of the core 2 synthase genes is a first step. The finding that C2GnT3 is a thymus-associated core 2 s"
https://openalex.org/W1998485425,"Stimulation of serum-starved human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with either the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or insulin resulted in increases in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase, eIF4F assembly, and protein synthesis. All these effects were blocked by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B were activated by insulin but not by TPA. Therefore TPA can induce eIF4F assembly, protein synthesis, and the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 independently of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B. Using two structurally unrelated inhibitors of MEK (PD098059 and U0126), we provide evidence that Erk activation is important in TPA stimulation of eIF4F assembly and the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 and that basal MEK activity is important for basal, insulin, and TPA-stimulated protein synthesis. Transient transfection of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinase 1 (the eIF4E kinase) indicated that inhibition of protein synthesis and eIF4F assembly by PD098059 is not through inhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation but of other signals emanating from MEK. This report also provides evidence that increased eIF4E phosphorylation alone does not affect the assembly of the eIF4F complex or general protein synthesis. Stimulation of serum-starved human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with either the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or insulin resulted in increases in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase, eIF4F assembly, and protein synthesis. All these effects were blocked by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B were activated by insulin but not by TPA. Therefore TPA can induce eIF4F assembly, protein synthesis, and the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 independently of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B.

A key step in the regulation of protein synthesis is the assembly of the initiation complex eIF4F,1 containing the initiation factors eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein, eIF4E, the protein which binds to the 5′ cap structure (7-methylguanosine triphosphate) and eIF4A, a bidirectional RNA helicase (reviewed by Sonenberg (7.Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar)). The formation of the eIF4F complex (usually defined operationally as the association of eIF4G with eIF4E) is regulated by a variety of stimuli through multiple phosphorylation events. Two principal mechanisms have been suggested to play an important role in regulating eIF4F assembly. First, it has been proposed that the phosphorylation of eIF4E may be important in the formation of the eIF4F complex, as eIF4E associated with eIF4G is more highly phosphorylated than free eIF4E (8.Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5333-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Rau M. Ohlmann T. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8983-8990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and since increased phosphorylation of eIF4E often parallels increases in total protein synthesis (reviewed by Kleijn et al. (10.Kleijn M. Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)). Recent data have provided evidence that eIF4E is phosphorylated by MAP kinase interacting kinase 1 (Mnk1), which is itself phosphorylated by both p38-MAPK and Erk (11.Fukunaga R. Hunter T.

The second mechanism regulating eIF4F assembly involves a family of eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs, archetype 4E-BP1) whose affinity for eIF4E is regulated through their phosphorylation (16.Pause A.

Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 binds to a site on eIF4E which overlaps the binding site for eIF4G (18.Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 21.Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Mol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 thus competes with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E and can therefore inhibit eIF4F complex formation. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 leads to a reduction in its affinity for eIF4E and its dissociation, making eIF4E available to bind eIF4G, potentially leading to an increase in mRNA translation (18.Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 19.Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N.

Most studies on the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of protein synthesis have focused on insulin (reviewed by Proud and Denton (1.Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)). It has been demonstrated that insulin can lead to increased eIF4F assembly, activation of protein synthesis, and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Insulin also induces the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase which phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 and is linked to an increase in the translation of a specific subset of mRNAs which contain polypyrimidine tracts within their 5′-untranslated regions (5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract mRNAs) (23.Morris D.R.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that phorbol esters can also lead to increases in protein synthesis and the phosphorylation status of a number of initiation factors, including members of the eIF4F complex (2.Brostrom M.A. Chin K.V. Cade C. Gmitter D. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16515-16523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

However, the roles of these phosphorylation events in the activation of protein synthesis by phorbol ester and the nature of the signaling pathways which lead to these increases are unknown. Phorbol esters offer a paradigm for stimuli acting via phospholipase C which generate diacylglycerol (37.Rasmussen H. Isales C.M. Calle R. Throckmorton D. Anderson M. Gasalla-Herraiz J. McCarthy R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 649-681PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore use a proximal signaling pathway which may be different to that utilized by insulin. In this report we characterize in parallel the signaling pathways by which both insulin and phorbol esters increase eIF4F assembly and total protein synthesis in HEK 293 cells. We demonstrate that the phorbol ester, TPA, and insulin stimulate eIF4F assembly and protein synthesis. The stimulation of eIF4F assembly and protein synthesis by insulin and TPA is inhibited by rapamycin. However, TPA stimulates eIF4F assembly and protein synthesis through a mechanism that is independent of PI 3-kinase and PKB but dependent on Erk, whereas insulin stimulates the eIF4F assembly and protein synthesis through a mechanism that requires PI 3-kinase and may involve PKB. We also demonstrate that increased eIF4E phosphorylation is not required for stimulation of eIF4F assembly. The signaling pathways and the roles of individual initiation factors in eIF4F assembly and protein synthesis are discussed. [35S]Methionine and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Microcystin, wortmannin, rapamycin, PD098059 and CHAPS were from Calbiochem. Materials for tissue culture were from Life Technologies, Inc. m7GTP-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. U0126 was obtained from Promega. All other chemicals (unless stated) were obtained from Sigma. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to treatment, cells were grown to 80% confluence before being serum starved for 16 h. Details of treatments are provided in the figure legends. After treatment, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in extraction buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, antipain, and leupeptin). The lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatants were removed and used for further analysis. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (38.Vries R.G.J. Flynn A. Patel J.C. Wang X. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. J. Biol.

The anti-4E-BP1 antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 101–113 of human 4E-BP1. Anti-eIF4G1 and -eIF4A were generous gifts from Drs S. Morley (University of Sussex) and H. Trachsel (Bern University), respectively. Anti-phospho-PKB Ser473 and anti-phospho-Erk antibodies were supplied by New England Biolabs. Isoelectric focusing of eIF4E was performed as described previously (6.Flynn A. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using Ampholines (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the pH range 3.5–10. m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography was performed as described previously (6.Flynn A. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 25 μl of a 50/50 slurry of m7GTP-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to 0.2–0.5 mg of protein. The lysates were then rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. The m7GTP-Sepharose was pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min. The beads were then washed three times in extraction buffer. For SDS-PAGE, proteins were removed from the m7GTP matrix by boiling it in SDS loading buffer. PKB assays were performed as described by Cross et al. (40.Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against PKB α, β, and γ (a generous gift from Dr. D. Alessi, Dundee University). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 μm protein kinase A inhibitor, 100 μm EGTA, 10 mmMg(Ac)2, 1 μm microcystin, 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and 30 μm of the peptide substrate “Crosstide,” (GRPRTSSFAEG) at 30 °C for 15 min. The kinase reactions were then spotted onto DE81 paper, washed with 1% phosphoric acid, and radioactivity was determined by the Cerenkov method. For in vitro PI 3-kinase assays, cell lysates (∼0.5 mg of protein) were mixed with anti-phosphotyrosine (clone PY20, generously given by Drs. A. N. Carter, J. Miesenhelder and S. Simon, The MBVL, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Immunoprecipitates were collected by brief centrifugation and washed twice with 1 ml each of: (i) 25 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1%(v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.6; (ii) as i without Triton X-100 to remove detergent; (iii) 100 mm Tris, 500 mmLiCl, pH 8.0; (iv) 25 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, to remove high salt, each wash was supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 0.02 mm leupeptin. The detergent and high salt washes were to remove possible contaminants. The washed beads were re-suspended in 0.04 ml of the final buffer additionally supplemented with 0.01 mm[γ-32P]ATP (10–25 Ci/mmol) and phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylserine vesicles to give final concentrations of 0.1 mm with respect to each lipid. Vesicles were prepared as a 4-fold concentrate by sonicating dried phospholipid films in 25 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.6, using 3 × 20-s bursts at approximately 50% maximum power from a probe tip equipped with a micro-cup horn. Kinase reactions were stopped by addition of 0.6 ml of methanol, chloroform, 12 m HCl (80:40:1, v:v) followed by 0.2 ml of chloroform and 0.12 ml of 0.1 m HCl. Samples were mixed and briefly spun and the lower phases removed to fresh tubes and washed with 0.78 ml of synthetic upper phase. The washed lower phases were dried in vacuum, re-suspended in 0.02 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and [32P]PtdIns(3)P present separated from contaminating materials by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel 60 plates, pre-dipped in 1% (w/v) potassium oxalate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5 (in methanol:water, 1:1 v/v), and dried prior to use, developed in methanol, chloroform, water, 35% ammonia solution (20:15:5:3, v/v). Bands corresponding to [32P]phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate were located by autoradiography. 15 min after stimulation with either insulin or TPA the cells were incubated with [35S]methionine at 10 μCi/ml for 30 min. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in extraction buffer. 20 μg of protein was spotted onto 3MM paper (Whatman). The filters were then washed by boiling them for 1 min in 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.1 g/liter methionine. This was repeated three times. The filters were then dried and immersed in scintillant before determining radioactivity by scintillation counting. Cells were serum starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus phosphate medium for 16 h prior to addition of 50 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were then treated with inhibitors or agonists as indicated in the text. Transient transfections were performed as described by Alessi et al. (41.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P.

Plasmid pEBG-T332D expressing constitutively active Mnk1 (Mnk1 T332D) were kindly provided by Dr. A. J. Waskiewicz (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA) (12.Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Serum-starved HEK 293 cells were treated with either TPA or insulin and samples were taken over a 40-min time course. eIF4F assembly and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase were monitored over this time period. TPA and insulin each increased the assembly of the eIF4F complex, as characterized by an increase in the association of eIF4G and eIF4A with eIF4E (Fig.1 a) concomitantly with the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E. These effects occurred in parallel with the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase as indicated by shifts in their migrations on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, b andc). However, differences were observed in the time taken to reach maximal p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, and eIF4F assembly for the two stimuli, with insulin treatment resulting in a maximal effect within 15–20 min as compared with 30–40 min in response to TPA (the response to TPA does not significantly increase from 40 to 60 min (data not shown)). Stimulation with either insulin or TPA does not always result in the complete dissociation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1 a) indicating maximal stimulation has not been reached. However, the response to TPA levels out by approximately 40 min as little additional stimulation was observed by 60 min (results not shown). The apparent association of eIF4A with eIF4E in the absence of eIF4G seen in Fig. 1 a is due to the greater sensitivity of the anti-eIF4A antibody as compared with that of the anti-eIF4G1 antibody, and reflects a low basal level of eIF4F complexes in untreated cells. Measurements of the incorporation of [35S]methionine into protein revealed that insulin or TPA treatment of the cells each induced a substantial increase in protein synthesis of approximately 40–50% over untreated cells (see Figs.2 d and 3 e). Taken together, these data show that treatment of HEK 293 cells with TPA or insulin leads to the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 in parallel with increases in eIF4F assembly and the rate of total protein synthesis.Figure 3TPA does not activate PI 3-kinase. a, in vitro PI 3-kinase assay of lysates from HEK 293 cells.

We therefore investigated the role of mTOR in TPA- or insulin- stimulated eIF4F assembly, protein synthesis, and 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation using a specific inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin. Cells were incubated with rapamycin for 45 min prior to treatment with insulin or TPA. Rapamycin blocked the stimulation of eIF4F assembly by either insulin or TPA and also inhibited the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 2, a-c). The stimulation of protein synthesis by insulin or TPA was also partially inhibited by rapamycin when compared with rapamycin-treated control cells (Fig.2 d). The data show that mTOR plays a central role in the stimulation of eIF4F assembly and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase in response to TPA or insulin. It has previously been shown, in several cell types, that the activation of both p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 by insulin occurs by a mechanism involving PI 3-kinase (see e.g. Refs. 36.Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar and 42.Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to determine whether TPA and insulin activated PI 3-kinase in HEK 293 cells. Antibodies directed against phosphotyrosine were used to pull-down phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase from insulin or TPA-treated cell lysates. The activity of PI 3-kinase was then determined by an in vitro assay (Fig. 3 a). Insulin treatment led to a large increase in PI 3-kinase activity as indicated by the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (Fig.3 a). TPA did not activate PI 3-kinase at any of the time points tested (Fig. 3 a). However, TPA might activate PI 3-kinase via a phosphotyrosine independent mechanism. Therefore, in order to investigate further the possible role of PI 3-kinase in insulin and TPA-stimulated eIF4F assembly, protein synthesis and the phosphorylation of both p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, serum-starved cells were pretreated with wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, before addition of either insulin or TPA. As shown in Fig. 1, TPA and insulin increased eIF4F assembly (Fig. 3 b) and the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 3, c and d), as well as protein synthesis (Fig. 3 e). In the presence of wortmannin, insulin was unable to stimulate eIF4F assembly, the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 or protein synthesis (Fig.3, b-e). However, the stimulation by TPA of eIF4F assembly, the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, and 4E-BP1 and increases in protein synthesis were unaffected by wortmannin (Fig. 3,b-e). These data show that the stimulation of eIF4F assembly and protein synthesis by TPA occurs through a pathway which is independent of PI 3-kinase, whereas PI 3-kinase activity is required for insulin-stimulated eIF4F assembly and protein synthesis. Several lines of evidence suggest that PKB plays an important role in the regulation of both p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 and that activation of PKB through phosphorylation by PDK1 and -2 is dependent upon PI 3-kinase (35.Alessi D.R.

A full-length cDNA encoding the neutral ceramidase was cloned from a cDNA library of mouse liver using the partial amino acid sequences of the purified mouse liver ceramidase. The open reading frame of 2,268 nucleotides encoded a polypeptide of 756 amino acids having nine putative N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis revealed that the mRNA of the ceramidase was expressed widely in mouse tissues, with especially strong signals found in the liver and kidney. The ceramidase activity of lysates of CHOP cells increased more than 900-fold when the cells were transformed with a plasmid containing the cDNA encoding ceramidase. We also cloned the ceramidase homologue from the cDNA library of mouse brain and found that the sequence of the open reading frame, but not the 5′-noncoding region, was identical to that of the liver. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis of various ceramidases clearly indicated that neutral/alkaline ceramidases form a novel but highly conserved gene family that is evolutionarily different from lysosomal acid ceramidases.

Some LQT mutations exert a dominant negative effect on wild-type current expression. To investigate mechanisms of dominant-negative behavior, we co-expressed wild-type HERG with the A561V mutant in mammalian cells. Transfection with various cDNA ratios produced HERG K+ current densities that approached a predicted binomial distribution where mutant and wild-type subunits co-assemble in a tetramer with nearly complete dominance. Using C terminus myc-tagged wild-type HERG we specifically followed the mutant's effect on full-length wild-type HERG protein expression. Co-expression with A561V reduced the abundance of full-length wild-type HERG protein comparable to the current reduction. Reduction of wild-type protein was due to decreased synthesis and increased turnover. Conditions facilitating protein folding (growth at 30 °C, or in 10% glycerol) resulted in partial rescue from the dominant effect, as did the 26 S proteosome inhibitor ALLN. Thus, for A561V, dominant negative effects result from assembly of wild-type subunits with mutant very early in production leading to rapid recognition of mutant channels and targeting for proteolysis. These results establish protein misfolding, cellular proofreading, and bystander involvement as contributing mechanisms for dominant effects in LQT2.

Most of these are missense mutations and are located in membrane spanning regions or the pore domain. Other mutations include an intragenic deletion, a frameshift deletion resulting in a truncated protein, and a splice-acceptor site mutation. Electrophysiological analysis of several of these mutants has shown defects ranging from undetectable current to current with altered gating or ion permeation. In addition, several mutant alleles ofHERG dominantly suppress wild-type current (11.Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study we have investigated mechanisms responsible for the dominant negative behavior of the HERG A561V LQT mutant allele using electrophysiological, biochemical, and pharmacological methods. We find that A561V reduces wild-type current density as predicted for a tetrameric assembly where one mutant subunit is sufficient to reduce functional activity nearly completely. Moreover, the mutant allele reduces the abundance of co-expressed wild-type HERG in cultured mammalian cells, both by decreasing synthesis of full-length protein and by increasing turnover. The effects exerted by the mutant protein are due, at least in part, to misfolding of assembling tetramers and targeting for early degradation, since conditions that facilitate proper folding or inhibitors of the proteosome partially reverse the effect. Finally, we show that several other LQT2 mutations also reduce co-expression of wild-type HERG, suggesting that phenotypes seen with other HERG mutants may also be due to altered expression of wild-type HERG. CHO, baby hamster kidney, COS, and HEK293 cells lines (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro, baby hamster kidney and HEK293) or Ham's F12 (Cellgro, CHO) withl-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Intergen) and penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro). Cultured cells were maintained in 5% CO2, humidified air at 37 or 30 °C as indicated. For biochemical analyses, transient transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). In preliminary experiments we found that optimal expression, determined as percent of cell transformed and overall level of protein expression, was achieved when a total of 2 μg of DNA were combined with 12 μl of LipofectAMINE for transient transfection of a 35-mm dish (data not shown). Wild-type HERG epitope tagged with c-myc(EQKLISEEDL) at the C terminus (pCI-Neo-HERG-myc) (16.McDonald T.V., Yu, Z. Ming Z. Palma E. Meyers M.B. Goldstein S.A.N. Fishman G.I. Nature. 1997; 388: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) was combined with plasmid encoding untagged wild-type HERG or untagged mutant HERG for a total amount of 2 μg of DNA. Cells were harvested for Immunoblot analyses at 24–36 h after transfection and for metabolic labeling at 16–20 h. A green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid (Green Lantern, Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to monitor transfection efficiency. For electrophysiology studies, cells were transfected by electroporation with wild-type HERG cDNA (5 μg) and GFP cDNA (1 μg). Varying amounts of A561VHERG cDNA were added for a final mutant HERGmolar ratios of 0, 0.2, 0.33, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8 of totalHERG cDNA. Cells were studied with voltage clamp at 20–36 h after transfection. Cells were plated and grown on sterile glass coverslips within 35-mm tissue culture dishes. The coverslips were taken directly from the cell culture incubator and placed in an acrylic/polystyrene perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments) for immediate electrophysiological measurements. Extracellular solution was 150 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature. Intracellular pipette solution was 126 mmKCl, 4 mm Mg-ATP, 2 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, at room temperature. Osmolarity was adjusted to maintain the internal solution 20–30 mmless than the external solution. The whole cell patch clamp configuration was used to study HERG channels (17.Hammill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were pulled and polished to obtain a tip resistance of 2–3 megaohm in the above solutions. An Axonpatch-1D patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments) was used for voltage clamp measurements and voltage protocols controlled via PC using pClamp6 acquisition and analysis software. To elicit HERG K+ currents depolarizing voltage pulses were applied to various levels from a holding potential of −75 mV for 3.5–4.0 s followed by partial repolarization to −40 mV and then to −120 mV briefly to measure outward and inward tail currents. Current densities were calculated as current (pA) divided by cell capacitance (pF). To control for transfection efficiency, current densities were normalized to the control group daily based on average current density of cells transfected with 100% wild type. Cells were harvested for analysis 36–48 h after transient transfection by detaching cells with RPMI supplemented with 10 mm EDTA at 37 °C. Resuspended cells were subsequently pelletted by centrifugation at 300 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. For whole cell lysate analysis, cell pellets were incubated in 50 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.4% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 35-mm dish for 5 min. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatants were assayed for total protein content (Pierce, Coomassie Plus Protein Assay), and equal amounts subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein samples were combined with 4 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (4% (w/v) SDS, 40% glycerol, 20% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 125 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.8) incubated for 5 min at room temperature, separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked in 10% non-fat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS for 2 h at room temperature, and incubated with anti-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 at 1:250–1:1000 dilution of ascites fluid in 5% dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS for 4 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed 5 times for 5 min each with 0.05% Tween 20 TBS and incubated in 1:20,000–1:50,000 goat anti-mouse horesradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. After 5 washes as above, horesradish peroxidase-bound protein was detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce, SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate). For proteosome inhibitor studies, 12 h after transient transfection growth media (RPMI or Ham's F-12, with fetal calf serum) was supplemented with 5–50 μm acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN, Calbiochem) for 12–18 h prior to cell lysis for Western analysis. Dimethyl sulfoxide, the vehicle for ALLN, was kept between 0.1 and 1% (v/v), a concentration that did not effect HERG abundance or stability. After additional incubation for 12 h at 37 °C, cells were collected and subjected to immunoblot analysis as above. Experiments using ALLN were repeated three times with similar results. In experiments analyzing plasma membrane protein expression, cells were resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted in a pre-chilled Dounce homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co). Trypan Blue staining assayed the number of Dounce strokes needed to achieve maximal cell disruption without nuclear destruction. The homogenate was supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm NaCl, and layered on top of 45% sucrose in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Samples were centrifuged at 7,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C in a swinging-bucket rotor (Sorvall Instruments, HB-4). The top layer (microsomes and cytosol) and the interface (plasma membrane sheets) were separated from each other by pipetting. Membrane fractions from the interface were washed with 5 volumes of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and pelletted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Membranes were dissolved in 50 μl of lysis buffer and analyzed as above. 16 h after transfection, cells were subjected to short (5 min) or long (30 min) 35S labeling pulses. Cells were starved of cysteine and methionine in a serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, withoutl-glutamine, l-methionine, orl-cysteine) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were suspended in above media supplemented with 10 mm EDTA and pelletted at 1,200 rpm for 5 min. Labeling pulses were carried out by resuspending cells in above media containing 230 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine (ICN, Trans-label) and incubating for indicated intervals (5 min for short, and 30 min for long) at 37 °C. Pulses were terminated by replacing labeling medium with chase medium (10 mm each of unlabeled cysteine and methionine, 10% fetal calf serum RPMI), and incubating at 37 °C for various times. At the end of the chase interval, cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, homogenized with 250 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.4% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation from the cleared lysates was performed by pre-clearing with 30 μl of protein G-agarose (Pierce, UltraLink) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with monoclonal 9E10 anti-myc ascites for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein-antibody complexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 3 min. For quantitative immunoprecipitation serial incubations with additional antibody and protein G-agarose were performed. When normalizing the total amount of HERG protein a limiting amount of antibody (10 μl) was used. After washing the pellet 3 times with 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer precipitated complexes were eluted with 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min at 50 °C, and separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue overnight, destained (5% MeOH, 10% acetic acid) for 30 min, and soaked in 0.5m sodium salicylate 30% MeOH for 2 h. The gel was then vacuum-dried and subjected to fluorography. Each gel figure is a representative of at least three experiments with similar results. To evaluate the functional effects of the A561V allele on wild-type HERG in a mammalian expression system, both cDNAs were co-transfected into CHO cells and analyzed by whole cell current measurement. Wild-type HERG was kept constant (5 μg of plasmid) while varying the amount of A561V. Examples of patch clamp recording from transfected cells are seen in Fig.1 a, demonstrating voltage activated K+ currents typical of HERG. Cells co-transfected with A561V also have HERG K+ currents, albeit of smaller amplitude. The mutant-dependent reduction of current is graphically demonstrated in Fig. 1 b, where current-voltage and voltage-dependent activation curves show a graded reduction in current at all voltages as the fraction of A561V increases. The mean current reduction measured during repolarization tails when the wild-type and A561V mutant were expressed in equimolar amounts was 85 ± 5% (n = 33). When the data were normalized to unity (Fig. 1 b, insets) a 10–15 mV hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependent activation was seen in cells expressing wild-type and A561V HERG (V 12 HERG = 0.7 ± 0.3 mV,V 12 HERG:A561V = −10.9 ± 0.26 mV). The summary current density data of different ratios of wild-type and mutant co-transfections is re-plotted in Fig. 1 c. A curve for a mutant that freely and randomly associates with wild-type subunits in a tetramer and is completely dominant is superimposed over the data points for comparison. The ideal predicted curve plotted was derived from the binomial function: I=(fwt) nZ0Iwt+n(fwt) (n−1)fmutZxIwt+…+(fmut) nZnIwtEquation 1 where I is the whole cell current, n is the subunit stoichiometry, f wt is the fraction of wild-type subunits, f mut is the fraction of mutant subunits, and Z x is the fraction of wild-type current passed by channels with x mutant subunits. Ifn is four and the mutant is completely dominant over wild type then Zx = 0 for x ⩾ 1. Assuming completely random association of mutant and wild-type subunits the equation reduces to: I = I wt× (f wt)4. The experimental data, however, was best fit to a model where 16 the amount of current remained if one subunit was mutant and negligible current arose from tetramers with more than one mutant subunit (Z 1= 0.166, Z 2 = 0.0267, andZ 3 = 0.0046). Taken together, these findings suggest that the small amount of residual current in cells expressing both wild-type and mutant subunits is produced by a combination of wild-type homotetramers and mutant/wild-type heterotetramers. To investigate whether A561V HERG mutant expression affects wild-type HERG protein accumulation we developed a co-expression system for use in mammalian cell lines. In this system (Fig. 2 a) mammalian cells are co-transfected with equimolar amounts of myc-tagged wild-type HERG (HERG-myc) and either untagged wild-type or untagged mutant HERG. The biochemical and electrophysiological behavior of HERG-myc was indistinguishable from HERG (Fig. 2 b) and has been previously reported (16.McDonald T.V., Yu, Z. Ming Z. Palma E. Meyers M.B. Goldstein S.A.N. Fishman G.I. Nature. 1997; 388: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Because wild-type HERG is epitope-tagged at its C terminus with c-myc, the α-myc antibody detects only the full-length HERG-myc rather than the co-transfected mutant protein. Thus any changes in HERG-mycwill come from interactions with co-transfected untagged cDNAs. In substituting untagged mutant for untagged wild-type HERGcDNAs we control for plasmid competition for transcriptional machinery. HERG channels are presumed to function as tetrameric complexes as do other voltage-gated K+ channels (18.MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Assuming that HERG subunits do not exist as monomers once fully formed, measurements of full-length wild-type HERG-myc in co-transfection experiments will reflect assembled channel tetramer interactions. When CHO cells were co-transfected with A561V HERG and wild-type HERG-myc, we observed a marked reduction in HERG-myc expression levels in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 2 c). When transfections were carried out with equimolar amounts of wild-type HERG-myc and the A561V mutant, the abundance of wild-type protein was reduced 92 ± 5%, a value in agreement with our electrophysiology studies. The observed effect of A561V HERG on wild-type HERG-myc was not cell-line specific, since full-length HERG-myc expression levels were comparably reduced when identical studies were carried out in CHO, baby hamster kidney, and HEK 293 cells. When membrane fractions from co-transfected cells were examined, neither full-length HERG-myc nor proteolytic fragments were detected in the cytosolic/microsomal fraction (Fig. 2 d). The A561V-dependent reduction of wild-type HERG-myc protein could be due either to decreased synthesis or increased degradation. To determine the mechanism(s) by which A561V influenced the accumulation of wild-type HERG protein, we next performed pulse-chase experiments. Synthesis and stability of wild-type HERG-myc was determined by anti-mycimmunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled protein. Previous experiments had shown that we could quantitatively precipitate all HERG-myc by serial antibody incubations or by using an excess of α-myc antibody and protein G (16.McDonald T.V., Yu, Z. Ming Z. Palma E. Meyers M.B. Goldstein S.A.N. Fishman G.I. Nature. 1997; 388: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Compared with cells expressing only wild-type HERG, less labeled full-length HERG-myc was recovered from cell co-transfected with the A561V mutant after a 20-min pulse (Fig.3 a). To better analyze the relative stability of labeled full-length HERG-myc protein during the chase, immunoprecipitations were repeated using non-quantitative amounts of α-myc antibody (Fig. 3 b). This ensured that the amount of total HERG-myc in each lane was a fixed and equal amount.35S-Labeled wild-type HERG-myc co-transfected with untagged wild-type HERG disappeared with a half-life of 8.4 ± 0.4 h (n = 3). In contrast, during co-expression with A561V, HERG-myc degradation could not be fit to a single time constant. The majority of tagged protein was degraded rapidly, with a half-life of 4.0 ± 1.5 h (n = 3). In addition, a small fraction of HERG-myc that remained after the initial rapid degradation had comparable stability to HERG-myc co-transfected with untagged wild-type HERG. Such a population of HERG pools could arise from different combinations of mutant and wild-type subunits with correspondingly different degradation rates Because we observed less labeled HERG-myc when co-transfected with A561V, we performed metabolic labeling with 5-min pulses and shorter chase intervals. As seen in Fig. 3 c, the production of 35S-labeled full-length HERG-myc, in cells co-transfected with A561V, was markedly reduced at even the earliest time points. When co-transfected with untagged wild-type HERG,35S labeling of full-length HERG-myc occurred rapidly and remained stable during the 30–45-min chase period. These data suggest that HERG-myc, in the presence of A561V, is either not synthesized as efficiently or is rapidly, possibly in a co-translational manner, targeted for degradation. The above findings indicate that A561V co-expression exerts its effect on wild-type HERG through early interactions resulting in both decreased biogenesis of full-length protein and increased turnover. To examine whether misfolding of the mutant protein is responsible for the observed effects of on wild-type HERG expression, we modified the cell culture conditions to enhance protein folding. Glycerol is a known chemical chaperone that rapidly enters cells and facilitates folding of proteins (19.Sawano H. Kuomoto Y. Ohta K. Sasaki Y. Segawa S. Tachibana H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20.Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Decreasing the culture temperatures is another method that has been shown to augment the correct folding of proteins, particularly some proteins in which mutations cause misfolding (21.Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 521-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22.Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Fig.4 a shows partial rescue of HERG-myc from dominant negative effect of A561V HERG when cells were grown in medium supplemented with 10% glycerol. Similarly, when co-transfected cells were cultured at 30 °C the accumulation of wild-type HERG was greater than that observed under standard culture conditions. The actions of 10% glycerol and reduced growth temperature were not additive, suggesting that they affect the same process. The partial rescue of HERG protein expression by reduced temperature translated into an equivalent increase in HERG current density as seen in Fig. 4 b. If misfolding is responsible for the dominant negative effect of A561V on HERG-myc, misfolded tetrameric assembly may be recognized by cellular proofreading mechanisms and targeted toward early degradation. The 26 S proteosome complex is known to participate in a variety of early protein editing and degradation pathways (23.Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 24.Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). To investigate whether proteasomal activity might contribute to the enhanced degradation of wild-type HERG, we studied the effects of ALLN, a potent, cell-permeable, low molecular weight, peptide inhibitor of the 26 S proteosome (25.Vinitsky A. Michaud C. Powers J.C. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9421-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26.Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 c shows that ALLN inhibition of the proteosome complex partially rescued the reduction of HERG-myc caused by co-expression with A561V. Dimethyl sulfoxide itself, at the concentrations used in this study (<1% v/v), had no effect on HERG stability. We have investigated the mechanism of dominant negative inhibition of I Kr by the HERG A561V LQT2 mutant. We found that the A561V mutant polypeptide interacts with wild-type HERG subunits and that this interaction causes a reduction in the total amount of HERG channel protein. This reduction in protein expression is comparable to the suppression of current caused by co-expression with the mutant. The degree to which the A561V mutant depresses current from wild-type HERG closely approximates what would be predicted for randomly associating subunits forming tetramers wherein any amount of mutant protein completely abolishes channel function. Our results further show that the mutant-dependent reduction in current is paralleled by a corresponding diminution of wild-type HERG abundance. The means by which the mutant depresses normal HERG expression include both decreased biogenesis of full-length channel protein and accelerated degradation of newly synthesized protein. Furthermore, we show that maneuvers known to enhance correct protein folding partially reversed the mutant effect over normal HERG protein. This suggests that misfolded mutant subunits within tetramers that include normal subunits are recognized by cellular editing/proofreading systems, leading to aborted synthesis and early degradation of those tetramers that are completed. That ALLN also partially rescues the mutant effect on wild-type HERG indicates that the 26 S proteosome is involved to some extent in this quality control system. Several of the LQT2 mutations have been shown to be functionally dominant when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes (11.Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), however, the mechanism(s) involved have not been directly demonstrated. Zhou and co-workers (13.Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L.

Furthermore, they demonstrated that expression of a current-producing, non-dominant mutant, N470D, could be increased by small molecule chaperones and lowered culture temperature, implicating misfolding as a mechanism of channel defect (15.Zhou Z.

https://openalex.org/W2120023703,"We have defined regions in the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) molecule that are important for Patched (Ptc) receptor binding by targeting selected surface amino acid residues with probes of diverse sizes and shapes and assessing the effects of these modifications on function. Eleven amino acid residues that surround the surface of the protein were chosen for these studies and mutated to cysteine residues. These cysteines were then selectively modified with thiol-specific probes, and the modified proteins were tested for hedgehog receptor binding activity and their ability to induce differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells into osteoblasts. Based on these analyses, approximately one-third of the Shh surface can be modified without effect on function regardless of the size of the attachment. These sites are located near to where the C terminus protrudes from the surface of the protein. All other sites were sensitive to modification, indicating that the interaction of Shh with its primary receptor Ptc is mediated over a large surface of the Shh protein. For sites Asn-50 and Ser-156, function was lost with the smallest of the probes tested, indicating that these residues are in close proximity to the Ptc-binding site. The epitope for the neutralizing mAb 5E1 mapped to a close but distinct region of the structure. The structure-activity data provide a unique view of the interactions between Shh and Ptc that is not readily attainable by conventional mapping strategies.

For sites Asn-50 and Ser-156, function was lost with the smallest of the probes tested, indicating that these residues are in close proximity to the Ptc-binding site. The epitope for the neutralizing mAb 5E1 mapped to a close but distinct region of the structure. The structure-activity data provide a unique view of the interactions between Shh and Ptc that is not readily attainable by conventional mapping strategies.

In mammals, three homologs have been identified that are referred to as Sonic, Indian, and Desert hedgehog. Of these forms, Sonic hedgehog (Shh)1 has been the most extensively characterized. Shh is involved in diverse embryonic events, including the induction of floor plate, the establishment of ventral polarity within the central nervous system, and proper anterior-posterior patterning of the developing limbs (5.Riddle R.D.

In mediating these effects, Shh is believed to act both as a short range, contact-dependent inducer and as a long range morphogen (2.Johnson R.L. Tabin C.

Development. 1997; 124: 4393-4404PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the same forms of the protein contribute to both modes of action. The importance of Shh for correct embryonic development is highlighted by the severity of malformations associated with human mutations in the Shh gene (12.Roessler E. Muenke M. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and by the developmental defects observed in the Shh knockout mouse leading ultimately to its embryonic lethal phenotype (13.Chiang C. Litingtung Y. Lee E. Young K. Corden J.L. Westphal H. Beachy P.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Shh is synthesized as a 45-kDa precursor protein that is cleaved autocatalytically to yield a 20-kDa N-terminal fragment (residues 24–197 in the human gene sequence) that is responsible for all known hedgehog biological activity and a 25-kDa C-terminal fragment that contains the auto-processing machinery (14.Lee J.J.

The N-terminal fragment remains membrane-associated through the addition of two lipid tethers, a palmitic acid at its N terminus (17.Pepinsky R.B. Zeng C. Wen D. Rayhorn P. Baker D.P. Williams K.P. Bixler S.A. Ambrose C.M. Garber E.A. Miatkowski K. Taylor F.R. Wang E.A. Galdes A. J. Biol.

In vivo, the lipid tethers restrict the tissue localization of the Hedgehog signal and presumably have evolved as part of the mechanism for regulating short range-long range signaling. Whereas both modifications are likely to be important for tethering Shh to the plasma membrane, lipid modifications on the N terminus result in about a 30-fold increase in potency (17.Pepinsky R.B. Zeng C. Wen D. Rayhorn P. Baker D.P. Williams K.P. Bixler S.A. Ambrose C.M. Garber E.A. Miatkowski K. Taylor F.R. Wang E.A. Galdes A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14037-14045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). How the N-terminal modification regulates potency is unknown. The three-dimensional crystal structure of a fragment of murine Shh (residues 39–195) has been solved (20.Tanaka Hall T.M. Porter J.A. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This information has proved to be invaluable for probing structure-function relationships of the protein. Although the mechanism of action of hedgehog proteins is not fully understood, biochemical and genetic data suggest that the receptor for Shh is the product of the tumor suppressor gene patched(ptc) (21.Marigo V.

Homology between the ptc sequence and other gene products suggests that it is a member of the 12 transmembrane family of proteins. Although Ptc is the receptor for Shh, it also acts as a negative modulator of the Shh signal. In the absence of Shh, Ptc represses signaling through Smo. Shh binding to Ptc causes derepression of Smo, allowing signaling to occur. Subsequent induction of Ptc may act to turn off hedgehog (Hh) signaling. From the analysis ofsmo null mutants in Drosophila, Ptc appears to bind Hh without the participation of Smo (28.Chen Y. Struhl G. Development. 1998; 125: 4943-4948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other Hh-binding proteins, including a ptc homolog, ptc-2 (23.Moytoyama J. Takabatake T. Takeshima K. Hui C.-C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and hedgehog-interacting protein (29.Chuang P.T. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1999; 397: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) have been identified, raising the potential for additional levels of regulation. In order to study the interactions of Shh with Ptc, we developed a mapping strategy where selected amino acid residues on the surface of Shh were mutated into cysteine residues, and after modification of these cysteines with probes of different size and shape, we determined which of the modifications disrupted function. The structure-activity data provide a unique view of Shh-Ptc interactions. This approach has significant advantages over most conventional mapping strategies and should be widely applicable to most other proteins, particularly those for which a structure is available. Shh (residues 24–197 in the human sequence) and Shh mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tagged fusion proteins as described previously (17.Pepinsky R.B. Zeng C. Wen D. Rayhorn P. Baker D.P. Williams K.P. Bixler S.A. Ambrose C.M. Garber E.A. Miatkowski K. Taylor F.R. Wang E.A. Galdes A. J. Biol.

Point mutations were incorporated into the Shh DNA by unique site elimination mutagenesis using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed so that the incorporation of each mutation also resulted in the addition or removal of a specific restriction enzyme site. The following mutagenic primers were used, and the resulting restriction sites that were added as a result of the mutagenesis steps are listed below: 1) A192C, 5′ GAG TCA TCA GCC TCC CGA TTT TGC GCA CAC CGA GTT CTC TGC TTT CAC C 3′, which introduces a new FspI site; 2) N50C, 5′ GGC GCC TAG GGT CTT CTC AGC CAC ACA GGG GAT AAA CTG CTT GTA GGC 3′, which introduces a newDdeI site; 3) N69C, 5′ GAGTTC CTT AAA TCG CTC GGA GCA CCT GGA GAT CTT CCC TTC 3′, which introduces a new Bsp1286I site; 4) Y80C, 5′ CAT CCT TAA ATA TGA TGT CCG GGT TGC AAT TGG GGG TGA GTT CCT TAA ATC G 3′, which introduces a new NciI site; 5) N91C, 5′ CAT CAG CCT GTC CGC TCC GGT ACA TTC TTC ATC CTT AAA TAT GAT GTC 3′, which introduces a new RsaI site; 6) K105C, 5′ GAG ATG GCC AAA GCG TTT AAG CAG TCC TTA CAC CTC TGA GTC 3′, which introduces a new MseI site; 7) N115C, 5′ GTT TCA CTC CTG GCC ACT GAC ACA TCA CCG AGA TGG CCA AAG 3′, which removes a BsrI site; 8) S135C, 5′ GTA GTG CAG AGA CTC CTC GCA GTG GTG GCC ATC TTC G 3′, which removes a DdeI site; 9) S156C, 5′ CCA GCA TGC CGT ACT TGC AGC GAT CGC GGT CAG ACG TGG 3′, which introduces a newPvuI site; 10) S177C, 5′ CAG TGG ATA TGT GCC TTG CAC TCG TAG TAC ACC CAG TC 3′, which removes a HinfI site; and 11) G169C, 5′ GTA CAC CCA GTC GAA GCA GGC CTC CAC CGC CAG GC 3′, which removes an MspI site. The fidelity of the resulting constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Expression vectors were generated by subcloning the DNA inserts into phosphatase-treated, 5.64-kilobase pair XhoI-NcoI pET11d vector backbone of p6H-Shh (30.Williams K.P. Rayhorn P. Chi-Rosso G.

The presence of the introduced restriction site change was reconfirmed in the expression vector. The expression vectors were transformed into competent E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS, colonies were selected, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and screened for Shh expression as described previously (17.Pepinsky R.B.

The C24II framework, in which cysteine 24 was replaced with two isoleucine residues, was selected for these studies since we had determined that modifications on Cys-24 would otherwise compromise the mapping analysis. The C24II substitution not only prevented the formation of undesired modification products but generated a form of the protein that was 10 times as active as wild type Shh in the C3H10T1/2 differentiation assay. 2F. R. Taylor and E. A. Garber, unpublished data. The mutant Shh proteins were purified following the strategy previously described for the purification of wild type Shh (30.Williams K.P. Rayhorn P.

Bacteria expressing the mutants were lysed in a French press, and particulates were removed by centrifugation. The clarified lysates were subjected to sequential chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting proteins were treated with enterokinase to remove the His tag and repurified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and SP-Sepharose columns. The purified proteins were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. The following thiol reactive reagents were used for structure-activity studies: N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and β-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylmaleimide were from Pierce;N-(1-naphthyl)maleimide was from Aldrich;N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide was from Sigma; benzophenone-4-maleimide (BzM) was from Molecular Probes; PEG 5000 maleimide was from Fluka; and PEG 20,000 maleimide was from Shearwater Polymers, Inc. Working stock solutions of NEM and PEG were dissolved in water, BzM in dimethylformamide, and the other reagents in dimethyl sulfoxide. For modification with thiol reactive probes, Shh proteins at 2.3 mg of Shh/ml in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 230 mmNaCl, 0.06 mm DTT were treated for 2 h at room temperature with a 1.1–2-fold molar excess of each thiol-reactive compound over the total concentration of free thiol groups in the reaction mixtures. Samples were then treated with 0.5 mmDTT for 1 h at room temperature to quench excess modification reagent and analyzed for activity in the C3H10T1/2 and Ptc binding assays. For cross-linking studies with BzM, samples of Shh at 1.1 mg/ml in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 230 mm NaCl, 0.13 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 80 were treated with a stoichiometric amount of cross-linker (0.5 mm diluted from a 25 mm stock solution).

Cells were washed, fixed, and read on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Binding constants were calculated from single determinations for each sample. For assessing activity, C3H10T1/2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were incubated for 5 days with serial dilutions of each Shh preparation. The cells were lysed and assayed for alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity using the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate and read at 405 nm. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate, and EC50 values were measured from the mean data values. We have used the x-ray structure of Shh to identify potential surface residues that could serve as targets for modification. Eleven sites were selected for these studies. Most of these sites lie on loops where minimal contacts occur between the side chains of the selected residues and other parts of the molecule, and together they cover the entire surface of the molecule. The positions of the sites with respect to the Shh structure are summarized in Fig. 1. These amino acids were mutated to cysteine residues by unique site elimination mutagenesis, and the mutagenized genes were expressed inE. coli. The proteins were purified and tested for their ability to bind to Ptc. All 11 of the mutants exhibited wild type Ptc binding activity with IC50 values ranging from 20 to 80 ng/ml (1–4 nm) (see TableI). The binding data indicated that the mutagenesis had little functional impact on the resulting proteins and that none of the selected residues were critical for Ptc binding.Table IAnalysis of Shh Cys mutants for Ptc binding and activity on C3H10T1/2 cellsProtein, Shh variantEC50 in C3H10T1/2 assay in μg/mlK d for Ptc binding in ng/ml (× 10−1)UnmodifiedPEG 5000NEMUnmodifiedPEG 5000NEMWild type2>2014842C24II/A192C0.30.30.2221 +N50C0.440.32641 +N69C0.40.30.2444 +Y80C0.20.20.2662 +N91C0.30.20.2664 +K105CaModification chemistries failed.0.2——6—— +N115C1.5>2028701 +S135C0.40.60.28161 +S156C0.420.28661 +G169C0.30.50.34604 +S177C152817016Hedgehog proteins that had been treated with PEG 5000 maleimide, NEM, or left unmodified were evaluated for Ptc binding activity on EBNA 293 cells transfected with a truncated form of the gene for Ptc and for their ability to induce the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells.a Modification chemistries failed.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have observed that C3H10T1/2 cells are Shh-responsive and that hedgehog activity on this line can be readily assessed by measuring the induction of AP, a marker of mature differentiated osteoblasts. AP induction on C3H10T1/2 cells provides a simple, quantitative measure of the in vitro potency of Shh without the complication of having to work with primary cell cultures or organ explants. All of the mutants were functional in the C3H10T1/2 assay (Table I). Nine of the eleven mutants exhibited activity equivalent to the C24II Shh parent molecule, with EC50 values ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 μg/ml. The two other mutants, N115C and S177C, showed about a 3–5-fold loss of potency. To test the accessibility of the engineered cysteines to modification, the protein preparations were treated with PEG 5000 maleimide, and the reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). Because of hydration of the PEG in aqueous buffer, addition of a PEG 5000 moiety should produce a shift in mass of about 10–15 kDa, and thus a singly pegylated Shh product should have an apparent molecular mass of 30–35 kDa and a doubly modified product, a molecular mass of about 45 kDa. All but mutant K105C showed the predicted pegylation products. The 20–25-kDa shift in the masses after pegylation of mutants N50C, N69C, Y80C, N91C, N115C, S135C, S156C, and S177C is consistent with the presence of two potential sites for modification (see Fig. 2 B). The slight variations in their electrophoretic mobilities are probably due to differences in shape that result from PEG attachment at the different positions in the Shh sequence. Previously we reported (33.Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11229-11235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) an analogous effect for protein-protein complexes that had been cross-linked at different positions along their sequences. The 12-kDa shift in mass after pegylation of the C24II/A192C variant, the parent that was used as a template for mutagenesis, is consistent with the presence of a single site for modification. As further verification that the pegylated products contained the expected number of PEGs, selected products were subjected to mass spectrometry on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer. Masses consistent with the predicted number of modifications were observed (data not shown). In addition to the engineered cysteines, the C24II Shh sequence contains two other free cysteines at residues 102 and 187 that are not accessible for modification. Based on the Shh crystal structure, neither of the sites is surface-exposed, and therefore they were not expected to react with the modification agents. Peptide mapping (17.Pepinsky R.B. Zeng C. Wen D. Rayhorn P. Baker D.P. Williams K.P. Bixler S.A. Ambrose C.M. Garber E.A. Miatkowski K. Taylor F.R. Wang E.A. Galdes A. J. Biol.

Even with NEM, the smallest of the modification reagents tested in this study, the modification reactions were highly specific for the free thiols on the engineered cysteines. Typically we observe that modification reactions with maleimides go to about 95% completion. As shown in Fig. 2 B, no unreacted Shh remained after treatment of the mutants with the PEG 5000 maleimide, but about 5% of the product contained a single modification as evidenced by the presence of the minor band at 32–35 kDa. Throughout the studies described below, assays were performed on products that were treated with the maleimide probes and quenched to prevent further reaction but that had not been further purified. Consequently, a complete blockage of function after modification would be expected to decrease binding or potency by about 20-fold. Our inability to modify cysteine 105 in the K105C mutant was probably due to inadequate exposure of the thiol group on the engineered cysteine. After denaturation and subsequent reaction with PEG, we observed a shift in mass consistent with modification at this site (data not shown). The pegylated mutants were tested for function in the Ptc binding and C3H10T1/2 assays. Mutants N69C, Y80C, and N91C were fully active in both assays; mutants S135C and G169C were slightly reduced in their activity in the C3H10T1/2 assay but then exhibited a more significant loss of potency for Ptc binding; and mutants N50C, N115C, S156C, and S177C were greatly reduced in activity both in their ability to bind Ptc and to induce AP expression (Table I). Modification of wild type Shh through the N-terminal cysteine with PEG 5000 maleimide also resulted in a large reduction in the activity of the protein in both assays (Table I). To control for possible effects of the maleimide chemistry on function, samples were also treated with N-ethylmaleimide (125 Da) and assayed for Ptc binding and the induction of AP on C3H10T1/2 cells (Table I). NEM treatment either had no effect or in most instances resulted in a slight increase in activity. Because NEM treatment was highly selective for the engineered cysteines and had no deleterious effect on activity, we selected the maleimide chemistry as the basis for all subsequent modification work. When the activity data for the pegylated compounds were analyzed with respect to the position of the mutations in the crystal structure of Shh, the data revealed regions in the protein that were required for function. The engineered cysteines from mutants N69C, Y80C, and N91C for which pegylation had no effect on function all resided on the same surface of the protein from which the C terminus of the protein protrudes. Since a cholesterol is attached at or near the C terminus of Shh in its natural form (18.Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 19.Porter J.A. Ekker S.C. Park W.-J. von Kessler D.P. Young K.E. Chen C-H. Ma Y. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Koonin E.V.

Since pegylation of all other mutants affected function, albeit to varying degrees, little additional information could be extracted from the data.

Habitats of permanently cold temperature have been successfully colonized by a wide variety of organisms, termed psychrophiles, which have the ability to grow efficiently at temperatures close to the freezing point of cellular water (1.Low P.S.

When compared with their mesophilic counterparts these enzymes display a higher specific activity and a strongly reduced thermostability. This is probably due to an increased conformational flexibility which is now regarded as the main adaptive feature to low temperatures (3.Privalov P.L. Tiktopulo E.I. Tischenko V.M. J. Mol.

The enzyme is monomeric, except in the extremophilic archaea Pyrococcus woesei and Sulfolobus solfataricus, in which PGK have been identified as a dimer and tetramer, respectively (6.Hess D.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4633-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and structural investigations comparing mesophilic and thermophilic PGK have been undertaken during the last years, attempting to point out the properties leading to thermostability. In the present work we have isolated a cold-active and heat-labile PGK from the Antarctic psychrophile Pseudomonas sp. TACII18. The corresponding gene has been cloned and overexpressed inEscherichia coli. The psychrophilic character of the enzyme has been analyzed by kinetic and thermodynamic characterization and the structural parameters possibly involved in its cold adaptation have been determined by protein modeling.DISCUSSIONThis work has been undertaken in order to compare the psychrophilic PGK with the well characterized PGK from mesophilic and thermophilic strains and to analyze the strategy evolved by the cold-active PGK to reach psychrophily.The gapDH and fda genes have been identified in 5′ and 3′ from the pgk gene, instead of the usual promoter region and terminator sequence, suggesting that these three glycolytic genes are clustered in an operon and are under the control of an upstream promoter. A similar operon organization for the same enzymes has been reported for E. coli (36.Alefounder P.R. Perham R.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), Lactobacillus bulgaricus (37.Branny P. de la Torre F. Garel J.R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and Borelia burgdorferi (38.Gebbia J.A. Backenson P.B. Coleman J.L. Anda P. Benach J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 188: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). But in the case of the two latter microorganisms a tim gene is found instead of the fda gene, indicating a closer relationship of the Antarctic Pseudomonas with E. coli.Life at low temperatures requires that psychrophilic organisms maintain sufficiently high metabolic fluxes despite thermal inhibition of enzyme reaction rates. In the case of intracellular enzymes, adaptation to cold can be achieved either by increasing k cat,or reducing K m, or both (39.Feller G. Gerday C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This assumption is confirmed in the case of the psychrophilic PGK which adjusts bothk cat and K m parameters, leading to a 2-fold improved catalytic efficiency with respect to the mesophilic PGK at 25 °C. Among the limited number of cold-adapted intracellular enzymes studied so far, heat-lability is a common feature (40.Gerday C. Aittaleb M. Arpigny J.L. Baise E. Chessa J.P. François J.M. Petrescu I. Feller G. Margessi R. Schinner F. Cold Adapted Organisms: Ecology, Physiology, Enzymology and Molecular Biology. Springer, Berlin1999: 257-275Google Scholar) but Pseudomonas PGK is the first intracellular enzyme found to display the two main characteristics of psychrophilic enzymes: a reduced thermostability and a higher catalytic efficiency. The higher specific activity of psychrophilic enzymes has been commonly related to their increased flexibility, also responsible for their low stability (41.Hochachka P.W. Somero G.N. Biochemical Adaptation. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1984Crossref Google Scholar, 42.Somero G.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 43-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Unexpected support for this hypothesis is provided by the His-tagged psychrophilic PGK. Indeed, whereas the enzyme is stabilized by the His-tag peptide, its turnover number is drastically reduced. This is the first psychrophilic enzyme mutant showing the inverse relationship between stability and reaction rate. This peptide is linked to the solvent exposed N terminus which protrudes from the bottom of the N domain in Fig. 3, on the opposite side and far from the active site cleft. The poly-His peptide possibly interacts with oppositely charged residues on the protein surface, providing the extra stability. This mutant also demonstrates that the His-tag can markedly alter the enzyme properties, contrary to what is commonly assumed.The progressive increase in the salt bridge content (Table III) and the surface charge (Fig. 3) from psychrophilic to thermophilic PGK strongly suggest their involvement in temperature adaptation by modulation of the external shell compactness. In addition, it is known that the extremities of a protein are preferential sites for denaturation (20.Zaiss K. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4633-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar,39.Feller G. Gerday C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In T. maritima and B. stearothermophilus PGK the N and C termini are linked by two salt bridges (D2-K397 and K3-E387, T. maritima PGK numbering) whereas only one connects the extremities of the mesophilic enzymes (K5-E413 in yeast). On the other hand, the psychrophilic PGK is devoid of linkage between its N and C extremities as a result of substitutions of the involved residues (Lys to Val and Glu to Ser). The presence of such salt bridges in mesophilic and thermophilic PGK can significantly increase the overall protein thermostability and their lack in the psychrophilic enzyme would therefore weaken its stability. Moreover, the lack of these interactions correlates well with the occurrence of two independent unfolding domains in the psychrophilic PGK as revealed by DSC. PGK achieves its closed conformation only when both substrates are bound. This catalytically competent conformation is stabilized by a newly formed ion pair, between residues Arg62 and Asp200, upon closure of the catalytic interface. Whereas these two residues have been found to be totally conserved in mesophilic and thermophilic PGK, the aspartic residue is substituted in the psychrophilic PGK sequence by a threonine. This suggests therefore that the psychrophilic PGK adopts a less stable structure in the closed conformation: this is indeed demonstrated by DSC experiments performed in the presence of 3-PGA and ADP (Table IV).Thermal unfolding recorded by differential scanning calorimetry reveals an unusual denaturation pattern for the psychrophilic enzyme as it is composed of a heat-labile and a heat-stable domain. However, one has to recall here that the overall stability and function of a macromolecule are governed by its least stable unit (34.Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Such an organization of the psychrophilic enzyme into thermodynamic units of different stability has profound implications for our current view of protein adaptation to cold. From the limited number of cold-adapted enzymes studied so far, it was concluded that they are characterized by a low conformational stability, that even multidomain proteins display a reduced stability of all calorimetric units and that they have evolved toward the lowest available stability of the native state (40.Gerday C. Aittaleb M. Arpigny J.L. Baise E. Chessa J.P. François J.M. Petrescu I. Feller G. Margessi R. Schinner F. Cold Adapted Organisms: Ecology, Physiology, Enzymology and Molecular Biology. Springer, Berlin1999: 257-275Google Scholar, 43.Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The results obtained here for the Antarctic PGK demonstrate that this evolution can affect only one particular domain of the molecule. In this respect, two possible explanations are worth mentioning. On one hand, the concept of stabilizing domains has emerged from studies of proteins such as xylanases (44.Fontes C.M. Hall J. Hirst B.H. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 43: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), in which the increased stability of one domain promotes the stability of the whole molecule. It is therefore tempting to consider the heat-labile unit of PGK as a destabilizing domain, providing the required flexibility around the active site in order to increase the catalytic rate at low temperature. On the other hand, a high flexibility of the entire enzyme molecule should be accompanied by a broader distribution of conformational states, leading to poor ligand binding and high K m values (4.Fields P.A. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, the psychrophilic PGK displays high k cat associated with lower K m resulting in an optimizedk cat/K m ratio, which is the operational parameter for intracellular enzymes working at low substrate concentrations. Therefore, maintaining a stable and rigid domain could improve substrate binding while the labile and flexible unit could favor the reaction rate. By this way, the contradictory optimization of both kinetic parameters can possibly be realized. Finally, the finding that the sulfate activator strongly influences the structural stability of both psychrophilic and mesophilic PGK can be analyzed in the context of cold adaptation. Indeed, our results suggest that at a given step in the reaction pathway, simulated by sulfate binding, the psychrophilic PGK is able to reach a conformation close to that of its mesophilic homologues, as far as stability is concerned (Table IV). These perspectives should stimulate further kinetic and structural studies of enzymes adapted to extreme temperatures. Temperature is by far the most important environmental factor governing the distribution of life on Earth. Habitats of permanently cold temperature have been successfully colonized by a wide variety of organisms, termed psychrophiles, which have the ability to grow efficiently at temperatures close to the freezing point of cellular water (1.Low P.S.

A similar operon organization for the same enzymes has been reported for E. coli (36.Alefounder P.R. Perham R.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), Lactobacillus bulgaricus (37.Branny P. de la Torre F. Garel J.R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and Borelia burgdorferi (38.Gebbia J.A. Backenson P.B. Coleman J.L. Anda P. Benach J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 188: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). But in the case of the two latter microorganisms a tim gene is found instead of the fda gene, indicating a closer relationship of the Antarctic Pseudomonas with E. coli.Life at low temperatures requires that psychrophilic organisms maintain sufficiently high metabolic fluxes despite thermal inhibition of enzyme reaction rates. In the case of intracellular enzymes, adaptation to cold can be achieved either by increasing k cat,or reducing K m, or both (39.Feller G. Gerday C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This assumption is confirmed in the case of the psychrophilic PGK which adjusts bothk cat and K m parameters, leading to a 2-fold improved catalytic efficiency with respect to the mesophilic PGK at 25 °C. Among the limited number of cold-adapted intracellular enzymes studied so far, heat-lability is a common feature (40.Gerday C. Aittaleb M. Arpigny J.L. Baise E. Chessa J.P. François J.M. Petrescu I. Feller G. Margessi R. Schinner F. Cold Adapted Organisms: Ecology, Physiology, Enzymology and Molecular Biology. Springer, Berlin1999: 257-275Google Scholar) but Pseudomonas PGK is the first intracellular enzyme found to display the two main characteristics of psychrophilic enzymes: a reduced thermostability and a higher catalytic efficiency. The higher specific activity of psychrophilic enzymes has been commonly related to their increased flexibility, also responsible for their low stability (41.Hochachka P.W. Somero G.N. Biochemical Adaptation. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1984Crossref Google Scholar, 42.Somero G.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 43-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Unexpected support for this hypothesis is provided by the His-tagged psychrophilic PGK. Indeed, whereas the enzyme is stabilized by the His-tag peptide, its turnover number is drastically reduced. This is the first psychrophilic enzyme mutant showing the inverse relationship between stability and reaction rate. This peptide is linked to the solvent exposed N terminus which protrudes from the bottom of the N domain in Fig. 3, on the opposite side and far from the active site cleft. The poly-His peptide possibly interacts with oppositely charged residues on the protein surface, providing the extra stability. This mutant also demonstrates that the His-tag can markedly alter the enzyme properties, contrary to what is commonly assumed.The progressive increase in the salt bridge content (Table III) and the surface charge (Fig. 3) from psychrophilic to thermophilic PGK strongly suggest their involvement in temperature adaptation by modulation of the external shell compactness. In addition, it is known that the extremities of a protein are preferential sites for denaturation (20.Zaiss K. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4633-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar,39.Feller G. Gerday C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In T. maritima and B. stearothermophilus PGK the N and C termini are linked by two salt bridges (D2-K397 and K3-E387, T. maritima PGK numbering) whereas only one connects the extremities of the mesophilic enzymes (K5-E413 in yeast). On the other hand, the psychrophilic PGK is devoid of linkage between its N and C extremities as a result of substitutions of the involved residues (Lys to Val and Glu to Ser). The presence of such salt bridges in mesophilic and thermophilic PGK can significantly increase the overall protein thermostability and their lack in the psychrophilic enzyme would therefore weaken its stability. Moreover, the lack of these interactions correlates well with the occurrence of two independent unfolding domains in the psychrophilic PGK as revealed by DSC. PGK achieves its closed conformation only when both substrates are bound. This catalytically competent conformation is stabilized by a newly formed ion pair, between residues Arg62 and Asp200, upon closure of the catalytic interface. Whereas these two residues have been found to be totally conserved in mesophilic and thermophilic PGK, the aspartic residue is substituted in the psychrophilic PGK sequence by a threonine. This suggests therefore that the psychrophilic PGK adopts a less stable structure in the closed conformation: this is indeed demonstrated by DSC experiments performed in the presence of 3-PGA and ADP (Table IV).Thermal unfolding recorded by differential scanning calorimetry reveals an unusual denaturation pattern for the psychrophilic enzyme as it is composed of a heat-labile and a heat-stable domain. However, one has to recall here that the overall stability and function of a macromolecule are governed by its least stable unit (34.Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Such an organization of the psychrophilic enzyme into thermodynamic units of different stability has profound implications for our current view of protein adaptation to cold. From the limited number of cold-adapted enzymes studied so far, it was concluded that they are characterized by a low conformational stability, that even multidomain proteins display a reduced stability of all calorimetric units and that they have evolved toward the lowest available stability of the native state (40.Gerday C. Aittaleb M. Arpigny J.L. Baise E. Chessa J.P. François J.M. Petrescu I. Feller G. Margessi R. Schinner F. Cold Adapted Organisms: Ecology, Physiology, Enzymology and Molecular Biology. Springer, Berlin1999: 257-275Google Scholar, 43.Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The results obtained here for the Antarctic PGK demonstrate that this evolution can affect only one particular domain of the molecule. In this respect, two possible explanations are worth mentioning. On one hand, the concept of stabilizing domains has emerged from studies of proteins such as xylanases (44.Fontes C.M. Hall J. Hirst B.H. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 43: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), in which the increased stability of one domain promotes the stability of the whole molecule. It is therefore tempting to consider the heat-labile unit of PGK as a destabilizing domain, providing the required flexibility around the active site in order to increase the catalytic rate at low temperature. On the other hand, a high flexibility of the entire enzyme molecule should be accompanied by a broader distribution of conformational states, leading to poor ligand binding and high K m values (4.Fields P.A. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, the psychrophilic PGK displays high k cat associated with lower K m resulting in an optimizedk cat/K m ratio, which is the operational parameter for intracellular enzymes working at low substrate concentrations. Therefore, maintaining a stable and rigid domain could improve substrate binding while the labile and flexible unit could favor the reaction rate. By this way, the contradictory optimization of both kinetic parameters can possibly be realized. Finally, the finding that the sulfate activator strongly influences the structural stability of both psychrophilic and mesophilic PGK can be analyzed in the context of cold adaptation. Indeed, our results suggest that at a given step in the reaction pathway, simulated by sulfate binding, the psychrophilic PGK is able to reach a conformation close to that of its mesophilic homologues, as far as stability is concerned (Table IV). These perspectives should stimulate further kinetic and structural studies of enzymes adapted to extreme temperatures. This work has been undertaken in order to compare the psychrophilic PGK with the well characterized PGK from mesophilic and thermophilic strains and to analyze the strategy evolved by the cold-active PGK to reach psychrophily.

The presence of appropriate nuclear drug resistance markers in the two cell lines allowed measurements of the frequency of cell fusion in glucose-containing medium, non-selective for respiratory capacity, whereas the frequency of transcomplementation of the two mtDNA mutations was determined by growing the same cell fusion mixture in galactose-containing medium, selective for respiratory competence. Transcomplementation of the two mutations was revealed by the re-establishment of normal mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiratory activity and by the relative rates synthesis of two isoforms of the ND3 subunit of NADH dehydrogenase. The results of several experiments showed a cell fusion frequency between 1.4 and 3.4% and an absolute transcomplementation frequency that varied between 1.2 × 10−5 and 5.5 × 10−4. Thus, only 0.3–1.6% of the fusion products exhibited transcomplementation of the two mutations. These rare transcomplementing clones were very sluggish in developing, grew very slowly thereafter, and showed a substantial rate of cell death (22–28%). The present results strongly support the conclusion that the capacity of mitochondria to fuse and mix their contents is not a general intrinsic property of these organelles in mammalian cells, although it may become activated in some developmental or physiological situations.

However, mitochondria of mammalian spermatids have been reported not to fuse but to form structurally distinct contacts (15.Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. Mol. Reprod.

Cardiol. 1983; 15: 413-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A developmentally regulated formation of a reticulum of tightly joined mitochondria has been reported for rat diaphragm muscle (17.Bakeeva L.E. Chentsov Y.S. Skulachev V.P. Eur. J.

In investigations carried out in this laboratory (18.Yoneda M. Miyatake T. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2699-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), two mtDNAs, each carrying a recessive mutation in a different mitochondrial tRNA gene,i.e. the tRNALys gene mutation associated with the myclonic epilepsy and ragged red fiber (MERRF) encephalomyopathy (19.Shoffner J.M.

Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). After growing the fusion products under conditions non-selective for respiratory competence, no evidence of transcomplementation of the mutations was found in five clones carrying both types of parental mtDNA, even 3 months after cell fusion. Other investigators, analyzing by fluorescence microscopy the fusion products of enucleated wild-type human cells and human ρ0 cells, obtained results that were interpreted to indicate the occurrence of a rapid and extensive fusion of host and exogenous mitochondria and subsequent rapid diffusion of mtDNA and its transcripts throughout the organelles (23.Hayashi J.I. Takemitsu M. Goto Y. Nonaka I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). More recently, the same investigators (24.Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y.-I. Nonaka I.

In the present work, in order to obtain a more conclusive answer to the question of the genetic autonomy of mitochondria in cultured human cells, large scale fusion experiments were carried out between cells and cytoplasts (or cells) carrying different recessive mtDNA mutations, in particular either the tRNALys MERRF mutation (26.Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3043-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The determination of both the efficiency of cell fusion and the frequency of transcomplementation between the two mutations showed unambiguously that events of intergenomic complementation did occur, but only very rarely and sluggishly in cells carrying both parental mtDNAs, with evidence of slow growth and significant cell death of the cell fusion products.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and, respectively, from a mutant of the VA2B human cell line (27.Hofhaus G. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3043-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) by cytoplast × cell fusion. They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 μg of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) per ml. The parental line of ρ0206, 143B.TK− (22.King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar) was grown in DMEM with 5% FCS and 100 μg of BrdUrd per ml. The ρ013.1 cell line, a mtDNA-less derivative of an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRTase)-less mutant of 143B.TK− (26.Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) was grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and containing 50 μg of uridine, 100 μg of BrdUrd, and 50 μg of 8-azadenine per ml. Transformants of the ρ013.1 cell line, obtained by cytoplast × cell fusion-mediated transfer of mitochondria from C4T cells (hereafter designated C4.13-E, -I, or -J), were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FCS, 100 μg of BrdUrd, and 50 μg of 8-azadenine per ml (26.Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The population doubling times of the various cell lines were determined as described previously (29.Yoneda M. Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Hurko A. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11164-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Unless other conditions are indicated, 1–5 × 105 cells of the chosen mitochondrial donor cell line were enucleated by centrifugation in the presence of cytochalasin B, and the predominantly enucleated cells were then fused, using polyethylene glycol 1500 (PEG), with 1–5 × 105 cells of the chosen recipient cell line, as described previously (30.King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 313-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 1–6 days of incubation, as specified below, in non-selective medium, double transformants carrying both the MERRF tRNALys gene 8344 mutation and the ND4frameshift mutation were selected and thereafter grown in “special DMEM/galactose” medium. This medium contained 0.9 mg/ml galactose instead of glucose and 0.50 mg/ml pyruvate (28.Hayashi J.I. Ihta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y.I. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and was supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS, 100 μg of BrdUrd per ml, and, when C4.13-E, or -I, or -J were used as recipient cells, also with 50 μg of 8-azaadenine per ml. Colonies were recognized between 3 and 4 weeks after plating, and those that appeared healthy were picked up for analysis. Karyotype determination was done, as described previously (31.Mitchell C.H. Attardi G. Somatic Cell Genet. 1978; 4: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), in cells arrested in metaphase by treatment with 0.5 μg of colchicine per ml for 3 h. Total DNA was isolated from cells as described previously (32.Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 146-152Google Scholar). Quantification of mtDNA mutations was carried out in most cases by allele-specific termination of primer extension (33.Hofhaus G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 964-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Enriquez J.A. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 183-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, a 346-base pair mtDNA segment between positions 10,762 and 11,108, containing the ND4 mutation, and a 173-base pair segment between positions 8191 and 8364 of mtDNA, containing the MERRF tRNALys mutation, were amplified withTaq polymerase. The two amplified fragments were separated from free nucleotides on a Tris borate/EDTA, 1.5% agarose gel, and eluted from the gel by the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Then each amplified product was used for allele-specific primer extension termination, using Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the corresponding 32P-5′-end-labeled primer (33.Hofhaus G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 964-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Enriquez J.A. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 183-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide concentrations were 33 μm dGTP and 500 μm ddTTP for the quantification of the C insertion in theND4 gene, and 33 μm TTP, 33 μmdGTP, and 500 μm ddCTP for the quantification of the mutation in the tRNALys gene. The mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 3 min and annealed at 50 °C for 10 min. After addition of Sequenase, they were incubated for 6 min at 45 °C. Electrophoretic analysis of the products and quantification of the intensity of the bands were carried out as described previously (33.Hofhaus G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 964-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,34.Enriquez J.A. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 183-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, quantification of the MERRF mutation was carried out by NaeI restriction enzyme digestion of a mtDNA segment that had been amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using a mismatched primer generating a new NaeI site (18.Yoneda M. Miyatake T. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2699-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The cultures were labeled with [35S]methionine (>800 Ci/mmol, 25 μCi/ml) for 2 h in the presence of 100 μg of emetine per ml, and translation products were electrophoresed as described previously (26.Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). O2consumption measurements were made as detailed earlier (22.King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). To verify the homoplasmic nature of the tRNALys gene mutation in the pT1 human cell line and of the ND4 gene mutation in the C4T cell line (see “Experimental Procedures”), allele-specific primer extension experiments were carried out, using a previously described protocol for ND4 (33.Hofhaus G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 964-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a protocol illustrated schematically in Fig. 1 a for the tRNALys gene (34.Enriquez J.A. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 183-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 b, the two mutations appear to be homoplasmic. The MERRF mutation in pT1 has been shown to produce a defect in the aminoacylation of the mitochondrial tRNALys, which causes a severe impairment of protein synthesis due to premature termination of translation (35.Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This results in an almost complete loss of synthesis of the largest polypeptides (ND5, ND4, and CYTb) (Fig. 1 c) and the accumulation of premature translation termination products, prominent among which are pMERRF, a truncated COI product, and a truncated ND2 product (indicated by small arrowsin Fig. 1 c). The frameshift mutation in C4T causes a complete loss of synthesis of ND4, with resulting lack of assembly of the membrane arm of the NADH dehydrogenase and loss of enzyme activity (27.Hofhaus G. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3043-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, in both the pT1 and C4T cell lines, as a result of their mtDNA mutations, O2 consumption is dramatically decreased to a level close to that previously observed in 143B.ρ0206 cells (22.King M.P. Attardi G.

As shown in Table I, cells carrying wild-type mtDNA (143B.TK− (22.King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar)) and the mutant C4T and pT1 cell lines grew well in regular DMEM containing glucose and supplemented with 5% FCS. When glucose was substituted by galactose, the cells carrying wild-type mtDNA (143B.TK−) continued to grow, although at a reduced rate, whereas both types of mutant cell lines not only stopped growing but showed extensive cell death. This death was indicated by the progressive cell detachment from the plates. To confirm that the normal expression of mtDNA was absolutely required for the survival and growth of the 143B.TK− cells in special DMEM/galactose medium, as suggested by the results described above, mitochondrial protein synthesis was specifically inhibited by adding 40 μg/ml chloramphenicol (CAP) to the incubation medium; furthermore, the medium was supplemented with 50 μg/ml uridine, since it is known that cells without full mitochondrial gene expression become auxotrophic for pyrimidines (22.King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 36.Ditta G. Soderberg K. Landy F. Scheffler I.E. Somatic Cell Genet. 1976; 2: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41.Desjardins P. Frost E. Morais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1163-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). 143B.TK− cells grew well in the presence of CAP in glucose-containing medium supplemented with uridine but stopped growing and became detached from the plate in special DMEM/galactose supplemented with CAP and uridine (data not shown). Advantage was taken of the selective pressure provided by growth in special DMEM/galactose medium in order to isolate clones exhibiting transcomplementation of the tRNALys and ND4 gene mutations. For this purpose, 105 pT1 cells were subjected to enucleation (22.King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), and the predominantly enucleated cells were then fused with 5 × 105 C4T cells. After a 2-day incubation in non-selective medium, a portion of the fusion mixture, corresponding to 2.5 × 105 recipient cells, was transferred to special DMEM/galactose medium in a Petri dish. After 3–4 weeks, eight clones were detected. Two of them subsequently died, and the other six were picked up. However, of them, only three (T3, T6, and T7) kept growing and were utilized for further analysis (Table I and Fig. 1). An equivalent portion of the fusion mixture was transferred to special DMEM/galactose medium after a 6-day incubation in non-selective medium and yielded initially six clones which, however, were not picked up for further growth. Primer extension experiments revealed that all three clones contained both the mtDNA carrying the A8344G MERRF mutation and the mtDNA carrying the ND4 mutation (Fig. 1 b), with the former one being strongly predominant. A quantification by PhosphorImage analysis showed that the proportion of the tRNALys mutation-carrying mtDNA varied between 71 and ∼88% and that of the ND4 mutation-carrying mtDNA between 10.5 and ∼22% of the total mtDNA, and that the two mutant types of mtDNA accounted for all mtDNA, within experimental error (Table I). The latter observation indicated that these clones did not contain any significant amount of residual wild-type mtDNA from either parental cell line. Furthermore, the proportion of wild-type tRNALysgenes present in ND4 gene mutation-carrying mtDNA exceeded the minimum previously shown to be able to complement the MERRF mutation (∼10%) (18.Yoneda M. Miyatake T. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2699-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, one expected that, if there was complete mixing of the gene products in the three clones, there would be full complementation of the MERRF mutation. There are no data on the quantitative effects of a null mutation in the ND4 genes on their expression. However, if the same pattern of control applies to these genes as recently observed for the human ND5 genes (42.Bai Y. Shakeley R.M. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), one would expect in the three clones between 70 and 90% of the normal rate of synthesis of the ND4 protein. The analysis of mitochondrial protein synthesis in the three isolated clones fully confirmed the predictions mentioned above. In fact, as shown in Fig. 1 c, the three clones exhibited a near to normal rate of ND5, ND4, and CYTb polypeptide synthesis. Furthermore, there was no clear evidence of premature translation termination, with the exception of a small amount of the main premature translation termination product, pMERRF (35.Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), migrating just ahead of ND4 in T6. The occurrence in C4T mtDNA, as in the VA2B parental cell mtDNA, of an ND3 polymorphism previously described in HeLa cells, which causes a faster migration of this subunit in a polyacrylamide gel (43.Oliver N.A. Greenberg B.D. Wallace D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5834-5839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), offered an additional useful marker of transcomplementation. Thus, in the protein synthesis patterns of Fig. 1 c, the relative labeling of the ND3 and ND3′ bands, characteristic of pT1 and C4T mtDNA, respectively, showed a strong prevalence of ND3 in clones T3 and T6 and nearly equal labeling of the two bands in T7. Considering the large excess of MERRF mutation-carrying mtDNA in the three transformants and the expected low rate of ND3 synthesis in homoplasmic MERRF mutant cells relative to the wild-type cells (∼35% (35.Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)), the observed high ratio of ND3 to ND3′ labeling in T3 and T6 is consistent with a substantial level of transcomplementation in these clones of the tRNALys mutation by ND4 mutation-carrying mtDNA. Chromosome count in the three clones showed that T7 had an average chromosome number very similar to those of the parental cell lines, as expected for cybrids, whereas T3 and T6 had a chromosome number nearly double, strongly suggesting that these two clones rep"

Recent experiments have demonstrated that many hereditary forms of dilated cardiomyopathy are caused by defects of the extrasarcomeric myocyte cytoskeleton (3.Chen J. Chien K.R. J. Clin.

Whereas the importance of genetic dystrophin defects in hereditary cardiomyopathy is well established, the role of dystrophin in acquired cardiomyopathy has just begun to be unraveled. As much as 30% of human acquired dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with an enteroviral infection of the heart, specifically Coxsackie B viruses (14.Baboonian C. Davies M.J. Booth J.C. McKenna W.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 223: 31-52PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Sole M.J. Liu P. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1993; 22: 99A-105ACrossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In mice, transgenic expression of Coxsackie-B3-viral proteins in the heart is sufficient to induce dilated cardiomyopathy (16.Wessely R. Klingel K. Santana L.F. Dalton N. Hongo M. Lederer J.W. Kandolf R. Knowlton K.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1444-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Among the Coxsackieviral proteins are two proteases, protease 2A and protease 3C, both of which are essential for the viral life cycle (17.Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Raven Press, New York1996: 477-522Google Scholar). However, the molecular pathogenic mechanism(s) through which enteroviruses can induce dilated cardiomyopathy have long remained elusive. Based on a bioinformatic approach (18.Blom N. Hansen J. Blaas D. Brunak S.C. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2203-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we have recently identified dystrophin as a novel myocyte substrate for the enteroviral protease 2A. Dystrophin is proteolytically cleaved by the Coxsackieviral protease 2A, functionally impaired, and morphologically disrupted in cultured cardiomyocytes as well as in the intact mouse heart infected with Coxsackievirus B3. Based on these findings, we proposed that the cleavage of dystrophin during Coxsackievirus B3 infection initiates a cascade of events that contributes to the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy (19.Badorff C. Lee G.-H. Lamphear B.J. Martone M.E. Campbell K.P. Rhoads R.E. Knowlton K.U. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Whereas it is clear that dystrophin cleavage occurs both in vitro and in vivo, its mechanism and the exact cleavage site are yet unknown. In the case of eIF4GI, another known protease 2A substrate, some experiments suggest direct cleavage (20.Lamphear B.J. Yan R. Yang F. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Klump H. Kuechler E. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19200-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others have proposed that the cleavage in living cells during polioviral infection occurs indirectly though activation of a cellular protease (21.Bovee M.L. Marissen W.E. Zamora M. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1998; 245: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additionally, the cleavage sites of the other known cellular substrates of the enteroviral protease 2A (eIF4GI (20.Lamphear B.J. Yan R. Yang F. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Klump H. Kuechler E. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19200-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), eIF4GII (22.Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Sonnberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11089-11094Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and PABP (23.Kerekatte V. Keiper B.D. Badorff C. Cai A. Knowlton K.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) have not been mapped in vivo. We therefore set out to address these questions in relation to protease 2A-mediated cleavage of dystrophin and to determine whether the sequence of the protease 2A cleavage site in dystrophin could be used to generate a protease 2A inhibitor. Here, we report the molecular mapping of the enteroviral protease 2A cleavage site in mouse and human dystrophin. The computer-predicted site in the hinge 3 region of dystrophin is directly cleaved in vitro by purified Coxsackieviral protease 2A. In Coxsackievirus B3-infected cells, cleavage occurs at the in vitro cleavage site, thus suggesting direct cleavage in vivo as well. Based on the dystrophin sequence that was found to directly interact with the enteroviral protease 2A, we designed a potent substrate analogue inhibitor for this protease. HeLa cells (a kind gift from Sally A. Huber, University of Vermont) were cultured as described and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Coxsackievirus B3 was derived from the infectious cDNA of the cardiotropic H3 strain of Coxsackievirus B3 and was titered by plaque forming assay (19.Badorff C. Lee G.-H. Lamphear B.J. Martone M.E. Campbell K.P. Rhoads R.E. Knowlton K.U. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antiserum against the Coxsackieviral protease 2A was generated by immunization of rabbits with recombinant, purified protease 2A from Coxsackievirus B4. Coxsackievirus B4 protease 2A is highly homologous to protease 2A from Coxsackievirus B3 (96% amino acid similarity). Monoclonal dystrophin antibodies recognized the mid-rod domain (Dy4/6D3, Novocastra) or the C terminus of dystrophin (MANDRA-1 (24.Morris G.E. Sedgwick S.G. Ellis J.M. Pereboev A. Chamberlain J.S. Nguyen T.-M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), kindly provided by G.E. Morris). A rabbit polyclonal antibody (rabbit 2) against the dystrophin N terminus was obtained from J. M. Ervasti (University of Wisconsin). Anti-Myc and anti-GFP antibodies were from Invitrogen andCLONTECH, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Cytosolic HeLa cell extracts were prepared by hypotonic lysis (25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Membrane fractions from normal mice (C57/BL6) and a human patient undergoing cardiac transplantation were prepared as reported (19.Badorff C. Lee G.-H. Lamphear B.J. Martone M.E. Campbell K.P. Rhoads R.E. Knowlton K.U. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE,1 transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted as described (19.Badorff C. Lee G.-H. Lamphear B.J. Martone M.E. Campbell K.P. Rhoads R.E. Knowlton K.U. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Plasmid BTFL-1 contains the full-length human dystrophin cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. L. M. Kunkel). Total mouse heart RNA was isolated with RNAzol B reagent (Tel-Test) and reverse transcribed using the Superscript II pre-amplification system. PCR was performed using the elongase amplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). A human dystrophin miniprotein (amino acids 2091–2603) containing the hinge 3 region was amplified from plasmid BTFL-1 using a sense primer with an added XhoI site (5′-CCCCCTCGAGAATGTACAAGGACCGACAAGG-3′) and an antisense primer creating a XbaI site (5′-CATGACTCTAGATTGGCTCTG-3′). The corresponding mouse dystrophin sequence (amino acids 2092–2596) was similarly amplified with reverse transcription-PCR (sense, 5′-CCCCCTCGAGAATGTACAAGGAACGACAAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CATGAGTCTAGATTGCCTCTG-3′). The PCR products were cloned into the XhoI/XbaI sites of pTrcHis2B (Invitrogen) and verified by nucleotide sequencing. After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the bacterially expressed His-tagged proteins were purified using nickel-nitriolotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions. Prior to cleavage reactions, proteins were renatured by dialysis against protease 2A cleavage buffer (100 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Overlapping mouse dystrophin fragments consisting of complete spectrin-like repeats were amplified with sense primers containing an appropriate restriction site and a consensus eukaryotic translation initiation sequence. The antisense primers had a stop codon and a restriction site downstream of the annealing portion. All constructs were cloned into pBluescript SKII (Stratagene). The mouse hinge 3 region was mutated (G → E) by overlap extension PCR (Mouse GE-sense, 5′-ACTACTGAAGCCTCTGCCA-3′; Mouse GE-antisense, 5′-TGGCAGAGGCTTCAGTAGT-3′). In vitro transcription/translation was performed with [35S]l-methionine and the TnT T7 kit (Promega). Prior to digestion by protease 2A, translation products were dialyzed as above. The 798-base pair XhoI/XbaI fragment of pEYFP-N1 was cloned into the corresponding sites of pECFP-C1 (bothCLONTECH) yielding pFRET. The complete hinge 3 region (26.Koenig M. Kunkel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4560-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of human dystrophin (amino acids 2423–2470) was amplified from plasmid BTFL-1 with a sense primer containing an EcoRI site (5′-ACCGGAATTCTAAGCAGCCTGACCTAGCTC-3′) and an antisense primer downstream of the endogenous KpnI site (5′-GTTGAAATCTGCCAGAGCAG-3′). The mouse dystrophin hinge 3 region (amino acids 2415–2463) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse heart (sense, 5′-ACCGGAATTCTACAAAGCAGCCTGACCGTG-3′; antisense, 5′-GTTGAAGTCTGCCAGTGC-3′). The complete spectrin-like repeats 3 of human (amino acids 549–672) and mouse (amino acids 540–674) dystrophin were amplified using the same primer pair (sense, 5′-ACCGGAATTCTGACCGCTGGGTTGTTTTACAAG-3′; antisense, 5′-TTAAGGTACCGTGGTGGTGGTGACAGCCTGTG-3′). The human and mouse hinge 3 regions were mutated (G → E) as for the in vitro translation constructs (Human GE-sense, 5′-CCACTATTGAGGCCTCTCCT-3′; HumanGE-antisense: 5′-AGGAGAGGCCTCAATAGTGG-3′). PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI/KpnI sites of pFRET. The constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells using calcium phosphate. Cells were virally infected for 8 h at 36 h after transfection. Recombinant protease 2A from Coxsackievirus B4 was purified as described (20.Lamphear B.J. Yan R. Yang F. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Klump H. Kuechler E. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19200-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 15 μl, 10 μg of LV membranes were incubated at 30 °C with 1 μg of protease 2A in cleavage buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Purified bacterial fusion proteins (2 μg) were incubated at 30 °C with 1 μg of protease 2A using the same conditions. N-terminal peptide sequencing (Edman degradation) was performed as reported (23.Kerekatte V. Keiper B.D. Badorff C. Cai A. Knowlton K.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two tandem-fused GFP variants was assayed in a FluoroMax-2 fluorimeter (Jobin Yvon-Spex) with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and a slit width of 2 nm. The emission spectrum from 450 to 600 nm was acquired at 1-nm intervals. An octapeptide (RAPGLSTT) encompassing P1–P8 of the mouse dystrophin cleavage motif was custom synthesized (Research Genetics). The tetrapeptide derivatives z-LSTL-fmk and z-LSTT-fmk were obtained in collaboration with Enzyme System Products. Based on the predictions from a neural network algorithm (18.Blom N. Hansen J. Blaas D. Brunak S.C. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2203-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), human and mouse dystrophin both have two putative cleavage sites for the enteroviral protease 2A, located in the spectrin-like repeat 3 and the hinge 3 region (Fig.1 A). Using antibody Dy4/6D3 directed against the mid-rod domain of dystrophin, we previously demonstrated that Coxsackieviral protease 2A cleaves rat dystrophin, yielding a predominant fragment compatible with cleavage in the hinge 3 region. Additionally, a weaker second fragment suggested cleavage at the other putative site (19.Badorff C. Lee G.-H. Lamphear B.J. Martone M.E. Campbell K.P. Rhoads R.E. Knowlton K.U. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). For more detailed analysis, we analyzed human and mouse dystrophin because of their known protein sequence and the experimental models of enteroviral myocarditis/cardiomyopathy (16.Wessely R. Klingel K. Santana L.F. Dalton N. Hongo M. Lederer J.W. Kandolf R. Knowlton K.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1444-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27.Chow L.H. Beisel K.W. McManus B.M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 24-31PubMed Google Scholar). When mouse (Fig.1 B) or human (Fig. 1 C) cardiac membrane fractions are incubated with recombinant Coxsackieviral protease 2A followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, the major rod domain fragment (∼280 kDa,arrow) consistently observed with antibody Dy4/6D3 is compatible with cleavage in the hinge 3 region. This indicates that this dystrophin cleavage site is conserved in mouse and human. Significantly lesser in signal intensity and reproducibility, a second fragment (asterisk) was detected with mouse dystrophin. When the immunoblotting is performed with antibody MANDRA1 (directed against the dystrophin C terminus), the presence of a single cleavage fragment of around 150 kDa is consistent with cleavage in the hinge 3 region. Upon immunoprobing with a rabbit antiserum recognizing the dystrophin N terminus, a large fragment of ∼280 kDa and similar in size to the rod domain fragment was detectable but not a second fragment of ∼65 kDa. These results demonstrate that Coxsackievirus protease 2A cleaves endogenous rat, mouse, and human dystrophin, yielding fragments consistent with cleavage in the hinge 3 region. In mouse dystrophin, a second rod domain fragment indicated potential cleavage in the spectrin-like repeat 3, although this was not substantiated by the detection of the corresponding N-terminal fragment. We sought to map the predominant Coxsackieviral protease 2A cleavage site using recombinant dystrophin. Because full-length dystrophin is difficult to purify given its large size (data not shown), we elected to use miniproteins. The miniproteins contained the hinge 3 region in the context of adjacent complete spectrin-like repeats, the minimal folding unit of dystrophin (28.Kahana E. Gratzer W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8110-8114Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). To assess whether Coxsackieviral protease 2A can cleave dystrophin directly, a bacterially expressed and affinity-purified mouse and human dystrophin miniprotein was incubated with Coxsackieviral protease 2A. As shown in Fig. 2 B, purified protease 2A is sufficient to cleave both the purified mouse and human dystrophin miniprotein yielding fragments compatible with cleavage in the hinge 3 region. The smaller cleavage product (arrow) was verified as the C-terminal fragment by immunoblotting for the C-terminal Myc epitope tag of the dystrophin miniproteins (data not shown). Purified protease 2A migrates at approximately 16 kDa when present. The free N terminus of the smaller cleavage fragment was sequenced by Edman degradation demonstrating NH2-GASPTQ and NH2-GASASQ for human and mouse dystrophin, respectively. Therefore, the cleavagein vitro occurs exactly at the computer-predicted residue in the hinge 3 region and is conserved between mouse (amino acid 2427) and human (amino acid 2434) dystrophin. To examine whether the cleavage activity in Coxsackievirus B3-infected cells is identical to that of purified protease 2A, we cloned and expressed similar miniproteins by in vitro transcription and translation. The radiolabeled mouse wild type construct is cleaved both by purified protease 2A and extracts from virally infected HeLa cells with the same fragments (Fig. 2 C). We next mutated the glycine residue at the C-terminal side of the mapped scissile bond to glutamate. Glycine at this position is essential for enteroviral protease 2A cleavage (18.Blom N. Hansen J. Blaas D. Brunak S.C. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2203-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Replacing the glycine with glutamate inhibits the susceptibility of eIF4GI to protease 2A cleavage (29.Lamphear B.J. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15726-15733Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When introduced into the mouse (G2428E) dystrophin hinge 3 region, this mutation completely abolishes cleavage by both purified protease 2A as well as extracts from virally infected cells (Fig. 2 C). To test directly whether the hinge 3 region was also cleaved within Coxsackievirus B3-infected cells, green fluorescent protein variants were used as “carrier” molecules, and the human and mouse dystrophin hinge 3 regions were fused in frame between cyan fluorescent (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (Fig.3 A). This strategy allows quantitation of cleavage using FRET. FRET can occur between CFP and YFP when they are in close proximity, and the emission wavelength from CFP is transferred to YFP resulting in a shifted emission spectrum (30.Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar). Upon cleavage in the hinge 3 “linker,” YFP dissociates from CFP, and the FRET is lost (31.Xu X. Gerard A.L.V. Huang B.C.B. Anderson D.C. Payan D.G. Luo Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2034-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 32.Sagot I. Bonneu M. Balguerie A. Aigle M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using this design, the dystrophin hinge 3 regions can be expressed in HeLa cells, and the constructs are cleaved near the middle following infection with Coxsackievirus B3 (Fig. 3 B). The mutant mouse (G2428E) and human (G2435E) dystrophin hinge 3 regions are completely cleavage-resistant in vivo during viral infection, even though protease ZA was present in these samples at equal levels (Fig. 3 B). Cleavage can also be demonstrated by analysis of the emission spectrum of these FRET constructs in cell extracts. Transfection of CFP only results in a peak emission at 474 nm upon excitation at 400 nm. Transfected YFP only is barely excitable at 400 nm (Fig. 3 C). Fusing the mouse wild type hinge 3 region in frame between CFP and YFP results in strong energy transfer between the two and a shifted emission spectrum because of YFP emission at 525 nm. This FRET is partially lost during infection. In contrast, the cleavage-resistant mouse G2428E hinge 3 region completely retains the FRET during viral infection (Fig.3 C). These data demonstrate that the Coxsackieviral protease 2A directly cleaves dystrophin in the hinge 3 region and that the dystrophin cleavage activity in Coxsackievirus B3-infected cells is identical to that of the purified protease 2A because the cleavage occurs at exactly the same residue. This suggests that protease 2A cleaves dystrophin directly during Coxsackievirus B3 infection. To investigate whether any other site in mouse dystrophin could be cleaved, a set of overlapping miniproteins spanning from the N terminus to the end of the rod domain was constructed and expressed using in vitro transcription and translation. In contrast with the miniprotein containing the hinge 3 region, neither the miniprotein containing the third spectrin-like repeat nor any other miniprotein was cleaved by the addition of purified Coxsackieviral protease 2A or extracts from virally infected cells (Fig.4). Additionally, FRET constructs with the complete human or mouse third spectrin-like repeat were generated that contained the putative cleavage site at amino acid 588 of the human or 590 of the mouse dystrophin sequence. Following transfection into HeLa cells and infection with Coxsackievirus B3, both constructs remained intact without evidence of proteolytic degradation during Coxsackievirus B3 infection (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the hinge 3 region appears to be the primary site in dystrophin that is cleaved by Coxsackieviral protease 2A or by extracts from virally infected cells. The enteroviral protease 2A possesses a catalytic cysteine residue, and its substrate recognition is dependent on the 4–6 amino acids upstream of the scissile bond (33.Wang Q.M. Johnson R.B. Sommergruber W. Shepherd T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because direct cleavage of the mouse dystrophin hinge 3 region was very efficient (Fig. 2 B), we first utilized an octapeptide (RAPGLSTT) based on the mouse dystrophin recognition sequence that was found to directly interact with the Coxsackieviral protease 2A. However, this unmodified peptide did not inhibit the Coxsackieviral protease 2A (data not shown). Therefore, we synthesized a modified tetrapeptide containing a fluoromethyl ketone group at the C terminus (z-LSTT-fmk). The fluoromethyl ketone can form a covalent bond with the catalytic cysteine leading to protease inactivation. Peptide-fmk inhibitors, such as z-VAD-fmk, have been previously described for caspases (34.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). A second substrate analogue (z-LSTL-fmk) based on a binding peptide of the related poliovirus protease 2A was also tested (35.Ventoso I. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 814-818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting components z-LSTT-fmk and z-LSTL-fmk inhibited the Coxsackieviral protease 2A (1 μm) in vitro in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal inhibition at 550 nm and 1050 nm, respectively (Fig.5). The main finding of this manuscript is that the computer-predicted cleavage site in the hinge 3 region of human and mouse dystrophin directly interacts with and is cleaved by the Coxsackieviral protease 2A. The same residue is cleaved within cells infected with Coxsackievirus B3, indicating that the protease 2A also directly cleaves dystrophin in vivo. Based on the protease 2A cleavage sequence found in dystrophin, a potent substrate analogue protease inhibitor was generated and tested in vitro. Our results are the first prospective validation of a cleavage prediction made by the neural network (NetPicoRNA V1.0) (18.Blom N. Hansen J. Blaas D. Brunak S.C. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2203-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) that was originally used to identify dystrophin as a potential cellular substrate of the enteroviral protease 2A (19.Badorff C. Lee G.-H. Lamphear B.J. Martone M.E. Campbell K.P. Rhoads R.E. Knowlton K.U. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Mapping of the dystrophin cleavage site to the hinge 3 region explains why the cleavage functionally impairs dystrophin with dissociation of the rod domain from the sarcolemmal fraction. Cleavage in the hinge 3 region disconnects the N-terminal two-thirds of dystrophin with the actin-binding sites (4.Straub V. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 36.Amann K.J. Renley B.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28419-28423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) from the distally localized β-dystroglycan anchoring site (37.Jung D. Yang B. Meyer J. Chamberlain J.S Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27305-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) that links dystrophin to the transmembrane glycoprotein complex (4.Straub V. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The high proline content of the hinge 3 region was suggested by others to lead to an open flexible conformation (26.Koenig M. Kunkel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4560-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accessibility of a substrate to a given protease is important for cleavage to occur (38.Chou K.-C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and thus explains why dystrophin can be cleaved in the hinge 3 region by the protease 2A. The results from epitope mapping of native dystrophin digested with Coxsackieviral protease 2A as well as the data obtained with recombinant dystrophin miniproteins suggest that the hinge 3 region is the primary site in mouse and human dystrophin that is directly cleaved by the viral protease 2A. Other than the dystrophin segment that spanned the hinge 3 region, miniproteins that spanned the N-terminal and rod domain of dystrophin were not cleaved by protease 2A. In contrast with the hinge 3 region, the other putative site in dystrophin may not be surface accessible. This cleavage motif is located within in a turn between two α-helices of the triple-helical repeat (26.Koenig M. Kunkel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4560-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that cleavage in the hinge 3 region leads to a change in the structural conformation of the cleaved fragment. This could allow secondary cleavage elsewhere, accounting for the low abundance second rod domain fragment detected by immunoblotting. The cleavage fragments from full-length dystrophin that were detected did not demonstrate a cleavage in the cysteine rich or C-terminal region of dystrophin; however, we cannot rule out the possibility of an undetectable cleavage in that region. Because in Coxsackievirus B3-infected cells the cleavage occurs at the same residue as following incubation with purified protease 2A in vitro, our data indicate that protease 2A directly cleaves dystrophin during Coxsackieviral infection. In contrast, it has been suggested by others that the cleavage of eIF4GI, a well recognized protease 2A substrate, can occur indirectly through activation of a host cell protease during infection with the closely related poliovirus (21.Bovee M.L. Marissen W.E. Zamora M. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1998; 245: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results, the first to identify an enteroviral protease 2A cleavage site in a host protein within virally infected cells, highlight the importance of mapping proteolytic cleavage sites in vivo. Although it is clear that dystrophin cleavage occurs in vitro and in vivo during infection with Coxsackievirus B3, its relevance for the pathogenesis of enterovirus-induced cardiomyopathy is yet unknown. With the knowledge of the cleavage site, the importance of the dystrophin cleavage can be elegantly tested in a mouse model that carries a cleavage-resistant dystrophin mutant. The enteroviral protease 2A is, in analogy to the HIV protease, an attractive target for antiviral drug development because both proteases are essential for viral life cycles (17.Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Raven Press, New York1996: 477-522Google Scholar, 38.Chou K.-C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Previously described inhibitors of the picornaviral protease 2A were either originally designed against host enzymes such as neutrophil elastase (elastatinal, MPCMK) (40.Molla A. Hellen C.U.T. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4688-4695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or originally identified as inhibitors of rhinoviral protease 3C (homophthalimides) (41.Wang Q.M. Johnson R.B. Jungheim L.N. Cohen J.D. Villareal E.C. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 1998; 42: 916-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the potent z-LSTT-fmk was specifically designed for Coxsackieviral protease 2A. A closely related compound, z-LSTL-fmk, inhibited protease 2A less efficiently and demonstrates a degree of specificity for the tetrapeptide recognition sequence. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based protein substrates of the enteroviral protease 2A will allow rapid kinetic assays ideal for further inhibitor screening. In summary, the enteroviral protease 2A cleavage site in human and mouse dystrophin was molecularly mapped to the hinge 3 region in vitro and in vivo. The identified cleavage motif was used to generate a potent peptidomimetic protease 2A inhibitor potentially useful for anti-enteroviral therapy. We appreciate the input of Markus Meyer and Aileen Boyd for the design of FRET constructs and help with the fluorometric assays, respectively, and of Aili Cai for production of recombinant protease 2A."
https://openalex.org/W2091470808,"We previously reported a 120-kDa phosphoprotein that translocated from cytosol to the apical membrane of gastric parietal cells in association with stimulation of HCl secretion. To determine the molecular identity of the protein, we performed molecular cloning and expression of the protein. Immunoblot analysis showed that this protein was highly enriched in tissues that secrete water, such as parietal cell, choroid plexus, salivary duct, lacrimal gland, kidney, airway epithelia, and chorioretinal epithelia. We named this protein based on its highest enrichment in parietal cells and choroid plexus. We obtained cDNA for parchorin from rabbit choroid plexus coding a protein consisting of 637 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 65 kDa. The discrepancy in size on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is considered to be due to its highly acidic nature (pI = 4.18), because COS-7 cells transfected with parchorin cDNA produced a protein with apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Parchorin is a novel protein that has significant homology to the family of chloride intracellular channels (CLIC), especially the chloride channel from bovine kidney, p64, in the C-terminal 235 amino acids. When expressed as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the LLC-PK1 kidney cell line, GFP-parchorin, unlike other CLIC family members, existed mainly in the cytosol. Furthermore, when Cl(-) efflux from the cell was elicited, GFP-parchorin translocated to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that parchorin generally plays a critical role in water-secreting cells, possibly through the regulation of chloride ion transport."

We initially observed that this arachidonic acid-mediated adhesion was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Therefore, we examined the role of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated pathways in arachidonic acid-stimulated cell adhesion. Arachidonic acid stimulated the phosphorylation of p38, the activation of MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2, a downstream substrate of p38), and the phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 (a downstream substrate of MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2). Treatment with the p38 inhibitor PD169316 completely and specifically inhibited arachidonic acid-mediated cell adhesion to collagen type IV. p38 activity was specifically associated with arachidonic acid-stimulated adhesion; this was demonstrated by the observation that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-activated cell adhesion was not blocked by inhibiting p38 activity. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 were also activated by arachidonic acid; however, cell adhesion to collagen type IV was not highly sensitive to PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) that blocks activation of the ERKs. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase was not activated by arachidonic acid treatment of these cells. Together, these data suggest a novel role for p38 MAP kinase in regulating adhesion of breast cancer cells to collagen type IV. Adhesion of metastatic human mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-435 cells to the basement membrane protein collagen type IV can be activated by treatment with arachidonic acid.

Among these processes is tumor cell metastasis, during which neoplastic cells interact with other tumor cells, normal endothelial cells, and the extracellular matrix. These interactions are sensitive to regulation by the local microenvironment and are dependent upon cell surface adhesion molecules (11.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev.

We are interested in identifying factors that influence the adhesive properties of human tumor cells and that in doing so alter the metastatic potential of these cells. There are several families of adhesion molecules, the function of which can affect metastasis, including cadherins, selectins, the CD44 group, the immunoglobulin superfamily, and integrins (16.Price J.T. Bonovich M.T. Kohn E.C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 175-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 17.Albelda S.M. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 4-17PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins are heterodimeric, transmembrane cell surface glycoproteins that mediate adhesion to the extracellular matrix in a highly regulated manner and are linked to signal transduction pathways within the cell (18.Schlaepfer D.D.

Because of the profound effect that integrins and their interactions with the extracellular matrix have on the biology of the cell, the proteins and second messengers that regulate these signal transduction pathways play critical roles in the behavior of both normal and transformed cells (6.Howe A.

The MAP kinase family consists of three different subfamilies: ERK1 and ERK2, the JNK kinases, and the p38 MAP kinases. The MAP kinase family proteins are activated by dual phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues within recognized motifs. These motifs are different for each of the different subfamilies (24.Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 25.Cano E.

Direct addition of arachidonic acid or some of its metabolites can modulate cell-matrix interactions. Studies by Grossi et al. (42.Grossi I.M. Fitzgerald L.A. Umbarger L.A. Nelson K.K. Diglio C.A.

Other researchers have demonstrated a role for arachidonic acid in HeLa cell spreading on collagen type IV (44.Chun J.S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We, and others, have demonstrated that arachidonic acid (45.Palmantier R. Roberts J.D. Glasgow W.C. Eling T. Olden K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2206-2212PubMed Google Scholar) and its metabolic precursor, linoleic acid (46.Johanning G.L. Lin T.Y. Nutr. Cancer. 1995; 24: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), activate the adhesion of metastatic human breast carcinoma cells to type IV collagen. Our previous studies using the PKC inhibitor calphostin C demonstrated PKC signaling involvement in arachidonic acid-mediated cell adhesion to collagen type IV (45.Palmantier R. Roberts J.D. Glasgow W.C. Eling T. Olden K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2206-2212PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which arachidonic acid stimulates cell adhesion to collagen type IV has not been completely described. Thus, the goal of this study was to define additional signaling pathways that are involved in arachidonic acid-stimulated cell adhesion of MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells to collagen type IV. Specifically, we were interested in the role that MAP kinase proteins may play in arachidonic acid-stimulated adhesion. We demonstrated that p38, its downstream substrate MAPKAPK2, and HSP27 (a downstream substrate of MAPKAPK2), were all activated by arachidonic acid and that activation of p38 was necessary for arachidonic acid-mediated cell adhesion. ERK1 and ERK2 were also activated by arachidonic acid, but these proteins do not appear to play a role in mediating adhesion. Finally, JNK was not activated by arachidonic acid treatment of these cells; thus, p38 is the only MAP kinase of which the activation appears to be necessary for arachidonic acid-mediated cell adhesion. The human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-435 was obtained from Dr. Janet Price (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) and was cultured as described (47.Price J.E. Polyzos A. Zhang R.D. Daniels L.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 717-721PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma. Arachidonic acid (Cayman Chemical Co.) was purchased as a 328 mm stock in ethanol. The p38 inhibitor (PD169316) and a nonfunctional analogue of PD169316 (SB202474) were from Calbiochem. TPA and CHAPS (electrophoresis grade) were from Sigma. The MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059) was from New England Biolabs. Protease inhibitors were from Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Collagen type IV and poly-d-lysine were from Becton Dickinson. BSA (fraction V) was from Life Technologies, Inc. (for adhesion studies) or ICN (for immunoblots). Primary antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (R2 and anti-p38), New England Biolabs (9101S, 9211S, and 9251S), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-474), and Promega (anti-ACTIVETM p38). MAPKAPK2 polyclonal antibody and recombinant HSP27 protein were from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Control 293 cell lysates for the JNK blots were from New England Biolabs. Ampholines were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.32P-Labeled orthophosphate was from ICN. Subconfluent cells were harvested with 5 mm EDTA, washed twice with serum-free medium preequilibrated at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2, resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml, and allowed to recover at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2 for 20 min before being treated with arachidonic acid. Inhibitors and their analogues were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the cells 30 min (PD169316 and SB202474) or 2 h (PD98059) prior to treatment with arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid was prepared immediately prior to its addition to the cells by adding an equal volume of 328 mm KOH to the arachidonic acid stock and diluting the mixture to 6 mmarachidonic acid in 0.9% NaCl. An appropriate volume was added to the cells to yield a final concentration of 30 μm arachidonic acid. The maximum final concentration of ethanol was 0.009%. Cells were harvested and treated as described above and were collected by centrifugation at 190 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaFl, 30 mm NaH2PO4, and 2 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was then passed through a 23 gauge needle 10 times and centrifuged at 16,000 × gat 4 °C. Supernatants were saved and the protein concentrations determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). Whole cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (48.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) in Tris-glycine buffer containing 20% methanol and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate (49.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with antibodies that recognized either ERK1 and ERK2 (R2, 1:5000); active, phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 (9101S, 1:2000); phosphorylated JNK (9251S, 1:1000); the 46-kDa isoforms of JNK1 and JNK3 (sc-474, 1:100); p38 (1 μg/ml); or active, phosphorylated p38 (anti-ACTIVETM p38 (1:1000) or 9211S (1:1000)). Immunoblots were performed as follows except where noted. Blots were blocked for a minimum of 1 h, incubated with primary antibody for 1–2 h, and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:2000 or 1:3000) for 45 min. After incubations with primary or secondary antibody, blots were washed three times, 15 min each. TBST (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) with 5% dry milk was used in all steps except during the washes, when the dry milk was omitted. All proteins were visualized using Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). BSA was used in place of milk for the anti-ACTIVETM p38 blot. Incubations with antibodies R2, 9101S, 9251S, and 9211S were done overnight at 4 °C, and washes for the 9101S, 9251S, and 9211S blots were 5 min in duration. Cells were treated with arachidonic acid and inhibitors as described above, and MAPKAPK2 assays were performed as described previously (50.Dean J.L. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 264-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Protein A-agarose was used in place of protein G-Sepharose. The protein lysate used for each assay (0.5 mg of total protein per sample) was precleared for 1 h with protein A-agarose prior to immunoprecipitation. Leupeptin was added to the lysis buffer. E-64 and Brij were omitted from the procedure, and the proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on a 14% polyacrylamide gel. The specific activity of the [γ-32P]ATP used was 6000 Ci/mmol. Cells were harvested as described above and were labeled with 32P-phosphate (0.5 mCi/ml of cells) during a 30-min recovery period prior to arachidonic acid treatment and for an additional 30 min of arachidonic acid treatment. Cells were collected as described above and lysed in 9.5 murea, 2% CHAPS, 2% ampholines (75% pH 5–7, 25% pH 3.5–10), 0.7m β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NaFl, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm EDTA (51.Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 794-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were passed through a 23 gauge needle 10 times, incubated for 40 min at 4 °C with 10 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-agarose, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 40 min at 4°. Supernatants were then analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (52.O'Farrell P.H. J. Bio.. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021PubMed Google Scholar) except that CHAPS was used in place of Nonidet P-40. The first dimension was run using 75% pH 5–7 and 25% pH 3.5–10 ampholines. Proteins on the second dimension 12% Laemmli gel were transferred to PVDF membrane prior to exposure to audoradiographic film. In order to determine the pH gradient of first-dimension tube gels, two extra gels were run that were cut into 1-cm sections. The ampholytes in these sections were extracted in 2 ml of degassed H2O for at least 2 h, and the pH of the solutions measured with a standard pH electrode. Cell attachment was assayed using a modification of the procedure described by Mould et al.(53.Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Craig S.E. Garratt A.N. Clements J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27224-27230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wells of 96-well culture dishes (Costar) were coated with 100 μl/well of either 6.4 μg/ml collagen type IV, 32 μg/ml poly-d-lysine, or 20 mg/ml BSA for either 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then washed with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and blocked at room temperature for 2 h with 20 mg/ml heat-denatured BSA (Life Technologies, Inc., fraction V) (54.Yamada K.M. Kennedy D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cells were prepared and treated with TPA, arachidonic acid, or inhibitors as described above. Immediately after addition of arachidonic acid or TPA, 5 × 104 cells in 100 μl were added to each well. After a 45-min incubation at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were washed from the wells using serum-free medium and aspiration. Poly-d-lysine coated wells were not washed. The remaining cells were fixed with gluteraldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol. The stain was then resolubilized with 1% SDS, and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm using a SpectraMax 250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Values are presented as the percentage of total cells assuming that the cells fixed to poly-d-lysine without washing represent 100%. In these adhesion assays, we typically see increases in adhesion in response to arachidonic acid of 1.5–3-fold; however, increases as high as 10-fold have been observed. Pairwise comparisons were made by Fisher's least significant difference test carried out at the p< 0.01 level of significance (55.Miller Jr., R.G. Simultaneous Statistical Inference. McGraw Hill, New York1966: 90-94Google Scholar). Standard error for adhesion assays was calculated as the square root of the variance of the ratio of two means (56.Finney D.J. Statistical Methods in Biological Assay. Hafner Publishing Co., New York1964: 125Google Scholar). In order to determine whether a tyrosine kinase-regulated signaling pathway was involved in arachidonic acid-activated adhesion of human breast carcinoma cells to collagen type IV, adhesion assays were performed in the presence of the phosphotyrosine inhibitor genistein or its nonfunctional analogue, genistin. Genistein was an effective inhibitor of arachidonic acid-activated cell adhesion, with half-maximal and maximal inhibition at concentrations of approximately 15 and 30 μm genistein, respectively. In contrast, 30 μm of the nonfunctional analogue, genistin, had no apparent inhibitory effect (data not shown). Inasmuch as tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of all three MAP kinase pathways, we examined whole cell extracts from arachidonic acid-treated human breast carcinoma cells for specific MAP kinase activity. Treatment of MDA-MB-435 cells with 30 μmarachidonic acid-activated p38 MAP kinase as detected by an antibody that specifically recognizes the active, dually phosphorylated form of the protein (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). The increase in activated, phosphorylated p38 was not a result of an increase in total p38 protein (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2). That the protein being recognized is the active, dually phosphorylated form of p38 was further established by the observation that when cells were stimulated with arachidonic acid in the presence of the p38 inhibitor PD169316, active p38 was no longer detected (Fig. 1 A, lane 2 versus lane 8). The total amount of p38 protein in these cells was unchanged as a result of treatment with PD169316 (Fig. 1 B, lane 2 versus lane 8). Kinase assays to measure MAPKAPK2 activity were performed to verify p38 activation and to determine whether downstream substrates of p38 were activated by arachidonic acid (50.Dean J.L. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 264-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). MAPKAPK2 is a downstream substrate of p38 and phosphorylates HSP27 (27.Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 57.Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar); thus, MAPKAPK2 activation, as detected by in vitro phosphorylation of HSP27, is a frequent outcome of p38 activation. As demonstrated in Fig.2, arachidonic acid treatment induced a significant increase in MAPKAPK2 activity (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 4), which was inhibited by the p38 inhibitor PD169316 (Fig. 2, lane 5) but not by the nonfunctional analogue of this inhibitor, SB202474 (Fig. 2, lane 7). The specificity of this activity was demonstrated by the fact that when HSP27 was omitted from the reaction (Fig. 2, lane 2) or when the immunoprecipitation was performed with normal rabbit serum (Fig. 2,lane 3), phosphorylation of HSP27 was not detected. The ERK1 and ERK2 activator, MEK1, has also been observed to activate MAPKAPK2 (58.Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, as indicated by the inability of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 to inhibit arachidonic acid activation of MAPKAPK2 (Fig. 2,lane 9), arachidonic acid activation of MAPKAPK2 occurred through p38 and not through a pathway involving MEK1. The observation that arachidonic acid activation of ERK1 and ERK2 does not occur until 15 min after arachidonic acid treatment of these cells (data not shown) also supports the conclusion that MAPKAPK2 activation, which occurs within 5 min of arachidonic acid treatment, does not occur through MEK1. These results demonstrate that the both p38 and its downstream substrate MAPKAPK2 are activated by arachidonic acid. We next investigated whether arachidonic acid treatment induces thein vivo phosphorylation of HSP27. Human HSP27 can be phosphorylated at three different sites: serine 15, serine 78, and serine 82 (51.Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Anderson C.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 15359-15369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 62.Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3058-3062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with arachidonic acid led to an increase in the amount of the dually phosphorylated c form of HSP27 (Fig. 3), demonstrating that HSP27 is activated in these cells in response to arachidonic acid. Immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to HSP27 verified the identity of the indicated spots as HSP27 (data not shown). Arachidonic acid activated p38 at concentrations as low as 5 μm (Fig. 4, lane 3). Our previously published results demonstrated that the increase in arachidonic acid-mediated adhesion becomes apparent with 10 μm arachidonic acid treatment (45.Palmantier R. Roberts J.D. Glasgow W.C. Eling T. Olden K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2206-2212PubMed Google Scholar). We performed kinetic studies of p38 activation to determine whether the time of arachidonic acid activation of p38 is consistent with its playing a role in arachidonic acid-stimulated cell adhesion. Arachidonic acid activation of p38 occurred rapidly, within 5 min of treatment (Fig. 5, lane 2), and was sustained for at least 60 min (Fig. 5, lane 5). These kinetics are consistent with the kinetics of activation of adhesion by arachidonic acid (data not shown). To determine whether activation of p38 is necessary for arachidonic acid-activated cell adhesion to collagen type IV, adhesion assays were performed using cells treated with the p38 inhibitor PD169316. As shown in Fig. 6 A,5 μm PD169316 was sufficient to completely block the activation of p38, as judged by immunoblotting with antibody to the active, phosphorylated form of p38 (Fig. 6 A, lane 5). An equal molar concentration of the nonfunctional analogue SB202474 had no effect on the detection of active p38 (Fig.6 A, lane 6). Both 5 and 10 μm p38 inhibitor were tested for their ability to inhibit a"

IL-5 enhances eosinophil responsiveness to a variety of chemotactic factors via a process called priming, although the molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we report that, following IL-5 priming of eosinophils, chemotactic agents including fMet-Leu-Phe, IL-8, and RANTES, promote vigorous transient activation of ERK1 and ERK2. In contrast, these chemotactic factors stimulate weak or indiscernible ERK activation in unprimed eosinophils. Furthermore, this intracellular marker of priming is selective for IL-5-related cytokines, in that it is observed following exposure to IL-5 and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor but not to interferon-γ, stem cell factor, tumor necrosis factor α, or IL-4. Interestingly, priming of chemoattractant-induced ERK activation is accompanied by an increase in association of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with the adapter protein Grb2. The biological relevance of ERK activation to IL-5 priming is supported by the observation that inhibition of ERK activity by treatment with the MEK inhibitors PD98059 or U0126 inhibited the release of leukotriene C4 stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe in IL-5-primed eosinophils. These data provide evidence for a previously undescribed fundamental mechanism by which stimulation of IL-5 family receptors induces a rapid phenotypic alteration in the signal transduction pathways of chemotactic receptors, enabling their activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 pathway and contributing to the capacity of these cells to synthesize LTC4.

Followingin vitro incubation with IL-5, several eosinophil responses to chemotactic factors are augmented via a process called priming. For example, IL-5 priming enhances the capacity of blood eosinophils to undergo fMLP-induced chemotaxis, cytotoxicity, respiratory burst, and release of proinflammatory lipid mediators (4.Sehmi R.

Mediators Inflammation. 1994; 3: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which eosinophils may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma is through their ability to synthesize and release a specific class of proinflammatory lipid mediators, the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes. These products, arachadonic acid metabolites of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, are potent bronchoconstrictive agents and promote mucus secretion as well as increased vascular permeability (9.Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Among the chemotactic factors to which eosinophils respond are IL-8, RANTES (an acronym for regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted), and formyl peptides such asn-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP) (10.Morita E.

Sci. 1996; 17: 209-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The synthetic agent, fMLP, is an analogue ofN-formyl peptides that are released by bacteria and from mitochondria of dead eukaryotic cells (14.Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). All three of these chemotactic stimuli have been reported to initiate responses in cells by binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) that are characterized by seven-membrane spanning domains coupled with heterotrimeric G-proteins. Subsequent intracellular signaling processes, including stimulation of calcium mobilization and phospholipase C activity, are sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin, suggesting involvement of Gi or Go family G proteins (15.Kita H.

The intracellular mechanisms by which IL-5 enhances the ability of eosinophils to respond to chemotactic factors are unknown and are the subject of this study. The human IL-5 receptor is a member of the cytokine family of transmembrane proteins and is composed of two receptor subunits, an α subunit which is specific for IL-5 and a β-subunit which is identical to the β-subunits of the human IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors (19.Tavernier J.

Signal transduction through these receptors in eosinophils is believed to occur via activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases including Jak1 (20.Ogata N. Kouro T. Yamada A. Koike M. Hanai N.

In a variety of inflammatory conditions, both IL-5 and chemotactic factors exist simultaneously in the microenvironment (32.Humbert M. Ying S. Corrigan C. Menz G. Barkans J. Pfister R. Meng Q. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Durham S.R. Kay A.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This observation, when considered with the divergent roles played by the chemotactic factors and the hematopoietic cytokines in the regulation of eosinophil biology, suggests that intracellular mechanisms exist to integrate the activities of these two different receptor classes. In this report, we show that ERK1 and ERK2 are activated in response to three chemotactic factors in IL-5-primed and GM-CSF-primed blood eosinophils, whereas the level of activity in unprimed eosinophils is weak or undetectable. This characteristic is specific to IL-5 family cytokines since other eosinophil-active cytokines including IL-4, interferon (IFN) γ, stem cell factor, and tumor necrosis factor (tumor necrosis factor) α, do not prime eosinophils for subsequent fMLP-stimulated ERK1 and ERK2 activation. Inhibition of eosinophil ERK activity by treatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitors PD98059 or U0126, resulted in inhibition of the ability of the IL-5-primed cells to synthesize LTC4 in response to fMLP. This study suggests that cytokine receptor systems are critical regulators in terms of potentiating the ability of GPCR to activate ERK1 and ERK2 in human eosinophils and support a key role for IL-5 as a regulator of multiple intracellular processes that contribute to the inflammatory capacity of the eosinophil in asthma. Reagents for eosinophil preparation included Percoll, which was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and anti-CD16-conjugated microbeads which were purchased from Miltenyi Biotechnology (Auburn, CA). IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, RANTES, IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and stem cell factor were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Sigma was the source for phosphatase inhibitors, PMA and fMLP. Protease inhibitor tablets (CompleteTM) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). We purchased the MEK inhibitor PD98059 from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and U0126 from Promega (Madison, WI). Immunoblotting reagents came from a variety of suppliers including Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, agarose-conjugated Protein A and anti-Grb2); Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD (LumogloTM chemiluminescence substrate reagents); Promega Life Sciences, Madison, WI (anti-ActiveTM MAPK antisera raised against the dual phosphorylated activation motif of ERK1 and ERK2), and Upstate Biotechnology Co., Lake Placid, NY (anti-phosphotyrosine antibody clone 4G10 and anti-ERK1-CT antisera). This latter immunochemical was raised against a C-terminal amino acid fragment of rat ERK1 and recognizes human ERK1 with greater affinity than ERK2). Blood donors included individuals who were both atopic and non-atopic with eosinophils comprising between 3 and 12% of their peripheral blood leukocytes. Eosinophils were purified from the heparinized peripheral blood of volunteer donors as described previously (29.Bates M.E. Busse W.W. Bertics P.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, a granulocyte mixture was obtained from the leukocyte buffy coat after centrifugation through a Percoll solution (density 1.090 g/ml) and, after lysis of erythrocytes by hypotonic shocks, the suspension was depleted of neutrophils by incubation with anti-CD16-conjugated microbeads and exposure to a magnetic field. The recovered eosinophils were resuspended, at a concentration of 107 cells/ml, in Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with 1% human serum albumin. These cell preparations were between 94 and 99% eosinophils as determined by microscopic examination of Wright's Stained cytofuge preparations. Eosinophils were preincubated at 37 °C with cytokine or control buffer as indicated by each experiment. Following this incubation, the cells were stimulated for various times with chemotactic agents at 37 °C and diluted with ice-cold Buffer A (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate and protease inhibitors, pH 7.4). Cells were pelleted, the supernatants discarded, and the cell pellets resuspended in Buffer B (1% Trition X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in Buffer A). Following incubation on ice for 10 min, the eosinophil lysates were centrifuged to remove the insoluble material and the supernatants were prepared for immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. Eosinophil lysates were precleared for 2 h at 4 °C with agarose-Protein A and incubated with 2 μg of anti-Grb2 antiserum or rabbit IgG for 2 h. The immune complexes were captured with agarose-Protein A and the agarose was washed with six changes of Buffer B. The agarose beads were resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer prior to electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Eosinophil lysates or immunoprecipitates were diluted with electrophoresis sample buffer and the proteins were resolved on polyacrylamide slab gels. The lanes were loaded with samples that represented equal numbers of cells. Transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotting were conducted using standard methods. The consistency of protein loading in all lanes was evaluated by staining of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with Amido Black following autoradiography. In addition, samples were immunoblotted with control antisera (anti-ERK1-CT or anti-Grb2) to confirm that comparable mass of protein was present in all samples. Images were converted to a digital format by scanning with Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software or transilluminated digital photography. Relevant area of the images were analyzed by determination of image density with NIH Image software. Eosinophils (125 μl of a suspension containing 3.25 × 106/ml) were incubated in triplicate with or without MEK inhibitors for 1 h at 37 °C and incubated for an additional hour following dilution with and equal volume of IL-5 (primed eosinophils) or buffer alone (unprimed eosinophils). Cell suspensions were subsequently stimulated for 20 min by an additional volume of control buffer, fMLP (0.1 μmfinal concentration) or the calcium ionophore A23187 (0.1 μm final concentration) and the supernatants were collected by centrifugation (320 × g for 5 min). The LTC4 content of the supernatants was determined as an assay of immunoreactive LTC4 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI). All supernatants were assayed in duplicate. Results of the LTC4 assays on each individual patient were expressed in picogram/ml, and summarized as the mean ± S.D. for triplicate aliquots of cells. To summarize results of LTC4 analysis on multiple patients, the data for each patient were first normalized by expressing LTC4(picogram/ml) of each cell treatment as a percent of LTC4generated by control treatment of that patient's eosinophils in the absence of priming or inhibitors. The resulting values (% of control) for multiple patients were summarized as the mean ± S.E. for graphic presentation. For statistical analysis, un-normalized data (picogram/ml) were logarithmically transformed and analyzed as a 3-way factorial design with individual patients considered as a random effect by S-Plus statistical software. Statistical significance was measured by 95% simultaneous confidence intervals. As previously reported by our laboratory and others (24.Pazdrak K. Schreiber D. Forsythe P. Justement L. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27.Hiraguri M. Miike S. Sano H. Kurasawa K. Saito Y. Iwamoto I. J. Allergy Clin.

University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI1998Google Scholar), IL-5 stimulates the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in human eosinophils isolated from peripheral blood. The kinetics of this activation is shown in Fig.1 utilizing, as a measure of ERK1 and ERK2 activation, immunoblotting with anti-Active MAPK antisera. Labeling by this antibody has been demonstrated to closely correlate with kinase activity (34.Xu S. Khoo S. Dang A. Witt S. Do V. Zhen E. Schaefer E.M. Cobb M.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1618-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Immunodetectable levels of active ERK1 and ERK2 reached maximum within 5 to 10 min of stimulation with IL-5. The apparent levels of active ERK1 and -2 in IL-5-stimulated cells was always less than that seen with 50 nm PMA indicating that IL-5 does not maximally stimulate ERK activation in eosinophils. We observed a degree of patient-to-patient variability in the duration of ERK activity following IL-5 stimulation (data not shown), with some patients displaying more prolonged ERK1 and ERK2 activation, but with most subjects, it had returned to near pre-stimulation levels by 60 min after addition of IL-5. Following priming with IL-5, eosinophil responsiveness to fMLP is enhanced with respect to chemotaxis, superoxide anion production, and LTC4 release (4.Sehmi R. Wardlaw A.J. Cromwell O. Kurihara K. Waltmann P. Kay A.B. Blood. 1992; 79: 2952-2959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Fabian I. Kletter Y. Mor S. Geller-Bernstein C. Ben-Yaakov M. Volovitz B. Golde D.W. Br. J.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 3855-3861PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the potential molecular mechanisms associated with priming, we determined if ERK activation is a feature of fMLP-induced signaling in eosinophils and if IL-5 priming affects the ability of eosinophils to stimulate ERK1 and ERK2 activity following fMLP exposure. In these experiments, eosinophils were primed with control buffer or 1 nm IL-5 for 1 h and then stimulated with 100 nm fMLP for various times. In the absence of IL-5 priming, immunoblotting with anti-Active MAPK antisera did not detect dually phosphorylated ERK1 or ERK2 in eosinophil lysates, either in the presence or absence of fMLP stimulation (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–4). However, stimulation by PMA induced a very strong response in these unprimed cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 5) indicating that the MAP kinase pathway was intact and responsive to other factors. Interestingly, priming of the eosinophils with IL-5 now allowed for fMLP treatment to cause a rapid increase in ERK1 and ERK2 activity (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8). This activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in IL-5-primed eosinophils was transient in that the signal had returned to basal levels within 15 min of fMLP addition (Fig. 2 A, lane 9). Immunoblotting of the same samples with anti-ERK1 and ERK2 antisera confirmed equivalent protein loading in the samples (Fig.2 B). Enhancement of fMLP-stimulated ERK1 and ERK2 activity by IL-5 priming was observed in the eosinophils of at least 15 different blood donors. These data suggest that activation of upstream elements of the MAP kinase pathway is one of the mechanisms by which IL-5 modulates fMLP-induced responses in eosinophils. To further characterize these priming responses, the time course (Table I) and dose response (Table II) of ERK1 and ERK2 activation following priming and fMLP stimulation were determined. Stimulation of IL-5-primed eosinophils with fMLP for 2 min resulted in a further increase of ERK1 and ERK2 activity for priming times tested (Table I). Enhancement of ERK activation following fMLP stimulation was evident following 2 min of priming by IL-5, increased during the course of the incubation and was still clearly evident following 60 min of priming. These data (Table I) demonstrate that the intracellular processes mediating IL-5 priming of this fMLP response is initiated rapidly and therefore, in all probability, not wholly dependent on IL-5-mediated regulation of transcriptional processes.Table ITime course of IL-5 priming of ERK activation induced by fMLPTime of priming incubation with 1 nmIL-5Increase in fMLP-stimulated ERK1 and ERK2 activation following IL-5 primingExperiment 1Experiment 2% of maximumUnprimed002 min24245 min532415 min1004030 min5910060 min3792Eosinophils were primed with 0 or 1 nm IL-5 for the indicated times followed by stimulation with 100 nm fMLP for 2 min.

The priming of ERK1 and ERK2 activation by fMLP was dependent on the concentration of IL-5 (Table II). Increased ERK1 and ERK2 activation was evident following priming with 1 to 1000 pm IL-5. This range of IL-5 concentrations mirrors those reported to promote the priming of fMLP-stimulated eosinophil activation including LTC4 generation, superoxide release, and chemotaxis (4.Sehmi R.

To confirm that the increase in ERK1 and ERK2 activity in IL-5 primed eosinophils was not simply due to an additive effect of two stimuli, a reverse priming and stimulation protocol was employed. Eosinophils were primed for 1 h with control buffer, 1 nm IL-5 or 100 nm fMLP and subsequently stimulated with control, IL-5, fMLP, or PMA (as a positive control). As shown in Fig. 3, unprimed (Cont.) eosinophils did not respond to fMLP with vigorous ERK activation whereas, in IL-5-primed eosinophils, ERK activation was evident (compare Fig. 3, lane 2 versus lane 6). However, treating eosinophils with fMLP first did not enhance responsiveness to IL-5. The modest increase in ERK1 and ERK2 activation seen following a 5-min stimulation with IL-5 in fMLP-primed eosinophils (Fig. 3, lane 11) was similar to that observed in unprimed cells (Fig. 3,lane 3). These data are consistent with a model in which selected signaling processes must first be activated by IL-5 to enable chemotactic factors to stimulate ERK1 and ERK2. To determine if IL-5 and fMLP need to be present simultaneously to promote optimal ERK1 and ERK2 activation, eosinophils were primed for 1 h with control buffer or IL-5. An additional aliquot of the same cell suspension was incubated with IL-5 for 45 min and then quickly pelletted and washed before resuspendin"

We show for the first time that an organism, which is phylogenetically ancient on the basis of its 16 S rRNA and that exists at extreme conditions, may contain lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The LPS was extracted from dried bacteria using a modified phenol/water method. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver stain displayed a ladder-like pattern, which is typical for smooth-form LPS (possessing an O-specific polysaccharide). The molecular masses of the LPS populations were determined by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Lipid A was precipitated after mild acid hydrolysis of LPS. Its complete structure was determined by chemical analyses, combined gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass spectrometry, and one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The lipid A consists of a β-(1→6)-linked 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucopyranose (DAG) disaccharide carrying two residues each of (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid and (R)-3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid in amide linkage and one residue of octadecanoic acid in ester linkage. Each DAG moiety carries one residue of each 3-hydroxytetradecanoic and 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid. In the nonreducing DAG, the octadecanoic acid is attached to the 3-hydroxy group of 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid.

It does not belong to any of the known phyla and represents the deepest branching species of the kingdomBacteria in the 16 S rRNA-based universal phylogenetic tree (2.Burggraf S. Olsen G.J.

Hyperthermophiles are represented among the deepest and shortest lineages of this tree and are discussed to be still rather primitive (4.Stetter K.O. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 149-158Crossref Google Scholar). A. pyrophilus was isolated from hot marine sediments (depth: 106 m) at the Kolbeinsey Ridge, Iceland and is growing microaerophilically under oxygen reduction at temperatures in the range of 67 to 95 °C. Cells are Gram-negative highly motile rods exhibiting a complex envelope consisting of murein, an outer membrane, and a surface protein layer (1.Huber R. Wilharm T. Huber D. Trincone A. Burggraf S. König H. Rachel R. Rockinger I. Fricke H. Stetter K.O. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 340-351Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, it was not investigated whether A. pyrophilus contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 or LPS analogous structures. LPS (5.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar) are characteristic components of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria where they are located in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. They contribute to the highly effective permeation barrier function of the outer membrane and, furthermore, participate in various physiological membrane functions essential for growth and survival of Gram-negative bacteria. LPS play also an important role in the interaction of the bacteria with suitable hosts. They are the endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria and are responsible for a broad spectrum of biological activities. Chemically, LPS are composed of three regions, namely (a) the O-specific polysaccharide (6.Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 59: 1325-1383Google Scholar,7.Jansson P.-E. Brade H.

Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar), and (c) the lipid A (9.Zähringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E.T. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem.

Endotoxic active lipid A, e.g. enterobacterial lipid A, is known to possess a rather conserved structure, which is characterized by a β-(1→6)-linked 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose (d-GlcpN) disaccharide backbone with phosphate groups attached to O-1 and O-4′ that carries(R)-3-hydroxy fatty acids and (R)-3-acyloxyacyl residues at positions 2 and 3, and 2′ and 3′, respectively. LPS isolated from other bacterial species showed a greater variability of their lipid A including 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucopyranose (DAG) instead of GlcpN and variations in the fatty acid and phosphate substitution pattern (9.Zähringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E.T. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1994; 50: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). LPS are discussed to be valuable (chemo-)taxonomic and also phylogenetic markers because of the compositions of their lipid A and inner core regions. This might also be true for the taxonomy of A. pyrophilus and related species. In this work we describe the isolation of the LPS fromA. pyrophilus and the characterization of the structure of its lipid A moiety which is different from all previously known lipid A. Batch cultures ofA. pyrophilus were grown in 300-liter fermentors in modified SME medium under microaerophilic conditions at 85 °C as described (1.Huber R. Wilharm T. Huber D. Trincone A. Burggraf S. König H. Rachel R. Rockinger I. Fricke H. Stetter K.O. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 340-351Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the sedimented bacteria (yield: 166 g) were washed successively with ethanol, acetone (twice), and ether and dried (27 g). For the extraction of LPS, the phenol/chloroform/light petroleum (2:5:8 (v:v:v)) method (12.Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) was tried. For better yields and purity, it was necessary to extract the dried bacteria using hot phenol/water supplemented with 2% sodiumN-laurosylsarcosine (w/v) (13.Rund S. Lindner B. Brade H. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16819-16824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (yield: 450 mg LPS, 1.7% dry bacterial mass). Free lipid A was obtained by treatment of LPS (100 mg) with HCl (0.1 N, 100 °C, 90 min) and ultracentrifugation for 4 h at 100,000 × g(yield: 27 mg, 27% LPS) (14.Kulshin V.A. Zähringer U. Lindner B. Jäger K.E. Dmitriev B.A. Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Lipid A was de-O-acylated by mild hydrazinolysis as described (15.Haishima Y. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Analysis for neutral sugars, total GlcN, reducing GlcN, 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Kdo), and phosphate were performed as described (16.Kaca W. de Jongh-Leuvenink J. Zähringer U. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Verhoef J. Sinnwell V. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 179: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The method for the analysis of neutral sugars was equally employed for the detection of uronic acids and amino sugars with the following variations: for the determination of uronic acids, samples were methanolysed (0.5m methanolic HCl, 85 °C, 45 min) and then carboxyl-reduced (NaB2H4, in H2O/CH3OH (1:1, v:v)) before continuing the protocol for neutral sugar determination. For the determination of amino sugars, samples were hydrolyzed (4 m HCl, 100 °C, 4 h), neutralized, then N-acetylated (17.Holst O. Broer W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mamat U. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and reduced (NaB2H4), followed by acetylation as described for neutral sugar analysis. The absolute configuration of sugars was determined by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis of the acetylated (R)- and (S)-2-hydroxybutyl glycosides (18.Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). For the colorimetric detection of uronic acids, the method of Blumenkrantz and Asboe-Hansen (19.Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (5776) Google Scholar) was employed. Protein was quantified according to Bradford (20.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211821) Google Scholar). Impurities of DNA, RNA, and proteins were determined by UV photometric measurements at 190–400 nm of sample concentrations of 0.1 mg ml−1 using an Uvikon 931 spectrometer. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of lipid A was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 plates (Merck) with CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O + acetic acid (10:10:3 (v:v:v) + 0.01% (w:v)) as solvent system. Spots were visualized by charring with 10% (v:v) ethanolic H2SO4, and compounds corresponding to each detected band were scraped out of the plate and extracted from silica gel with CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O + acetic acid (10:10:3 (v:v:v) + 0.01% (w:v)). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described (21.Vinogradov E.V. Pantophlet R. Dijkshoorn L. Brade L. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 602-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and gels were either stained with silver nitrate for the detection of LPS (22.Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar) or with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for the detection of proteins. Fatty acid analyses were performed according to Wollenweber and Rietschel (23.Wollenweber H.W. Rietschel E.T. J. Microbiol. Meth. 1990; 11: 195-211Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and for ester bound fatty acids according to Rietschel (24.Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The absolute configuration of the hydroxy fatty acids was determined by GLC of the phenylethylamide derivatives (24.Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To characterize amide-linked acyloxyacyl groups, it was necessary to acetylate (first acetic anhydride, 37 °C, 16 h, then pyridine/acetic anhydride (2:1, v:v), 37 °C, 6 h) the lipid A to obtain better solubility. After reaction with trimethyloxonium-tetrafluoroborate and 2,6-t-butyl-4-methyl-pyridin (5 mg ml−1 in dioxan) (2:1, v:v) at 20–22 °C for 16 h and evaporation, the sample was treated with 100 μl of 8 m NaOH. The chloroform phase of a chloroform extraction was evaporated and hydrolyzed with 1 m HCl (20–22 °C, 1 h). The chloroform extract of this sample was methylated with diazomethane and then analysis was performed using combined GLC-mass spectrometry (MS). Methylation of de-O-acetylated lipid A was performed according to Hakomori (25.Hakomori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1964; 55: 205-208PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-reduced (NaB2H4, in H2O/methanol (1:1, v:v)) and remethylated sample was hydrolyzed (2 m trifluoroacetic acid, 120 °C, 2 h), and the products were carbonyl-reduced (NaB2H4, 4 °C, 16 h) and then converted into alditol acetates and analyzed by GLC-MS (17.Holst O. Broer W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mamat U. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GLC and GLC-MS were carried out as described (17.Holst O. Broer W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mamat U. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26.Süsskind M. Brade L. Brade H. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7006-7017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The temperature programs in GLC and GLC-MS (in parentheses) for sugars were 150 °C for 3 min and then 3 °C min−1(5 C min−1) to 300 °C (320 °C). The temperature programs in GLC and GLC-MS (in parentheses) for fatty acids were 120 °C for 3 min and then 5 °C min−1 to 300 °C (320 °C). MALDI-TOF-MS including post source decay analysis of LPS, lipid A, and isolated lipid A fractions, and de-O-acylated lipid A was performed with a Bruker-Reflex III (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in linear and/or reflector TOF configuration at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV and delayed ion extraction. In general, the compounds were dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 10 μg/μl and treated with ion exchanger (Amberlite IR-120, Merck) to remove disturbing cations. 1 μl of the sample was then mixed with 1 μl of 0.5 m matrix solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (gentisic acid, DHB, Aldrich) in methanol and aliquots of 0.5 μl were deposited on a metallic sample. The mass spectra shown are the average of at least 50 single analyses. Mass scale calibration was performed internally with similar compounds of known chemical structure. Details of the applied methods, especially of the preparation of TLC-separated spots and on laser-induced fragmentation, are given in Refs. 13.Rund S. Lindner B. Brade H. Holst O. J. Biol.

NMR spectra were recorded of a solution of 5 mg in 0.5 ml Me2SO-d6 with a Bruker DRX 600 (operating frequencies 600 MHz for 1H, 150.9 MHz for13C, and 243 MHz for 31P) or DRX 360 (operating frequency 90.6 MHz for 13C) spectrometers at 47 °C using Bruker standard software. The 1H resonances were measured relative to the methyl group signal of Me2SO (2.5 ppm). The assignment of the proton chemical shifts was achieved by correlation spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, and double-quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy experiments. The assignment of carbon chemical shifts was achieved by1H,13C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence experiments and, for galactopyranuronic acid (GalpA), by comparison to published 13C NMR data (28.Bock K. Pedersen C. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 27-65Crossref Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). 13C resonances were determined relative to the methyl group signal of Me2SO (40.0 ppm). Nuclear Overhauser effect contacts were identified using nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments. Extraction of dried bacterial cells using the phenol/chloroform/light petroleum method gave LPS in low yield together with a coextracted phospholipid. Therefore, the modified hot phenol/water method was applied. The LPS was isolated from the water phase after ultracentrifugation (450 mg, 1.7% of dry bacterial mass) and was found to be free of other lipids, proteins, DNA, and RNA. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the LPS preparation, a ladder-like pattern indicating the presence of S-form LPS with different sizes of the O-specific polysaccharide moieties was identified (Fig. 1). The negative ion MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the native LPS revealed the molecular masses of the LPS populations (Fig. 2, M1, M2, . . . . . ). Each repeating unit was found to possess an average mass of 708 Da, which indicated that it is composed of two heptose and two hexose residues. Furthermore, the spectrum comprises prominent peaks originating from laser-induced cleavage of the labile linkage between lipid A and Kdo I of the core oligosaccharide (29.Fukuoka S. Knirel Y.A.

Thus, the fragment ion peak atm/z 1916 could be identified as the main free lipid A component (see below).Figure 2Negative ion MALDI mass spectrum of LPS fromA. pyrophilus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Quantitative sugar analysis of the isolated LPS revealed that it consists of GlcN, DAG, Kdo, galacturonic acid (GalA), Man, Glc, andl-glycero-d-manno-heptose (Table I).

GLC analyses of the acetylated (R)- and(S)-butyl glycosides proved that DAG and GalA ared-configured. Fatty acid analysis of lipid A identified 14:0(3-OH) and 16:0(3-OH) in amide linkage as well as 18:0 in ester linkage in a molar ratio of ∼2:2:1, respectively. As revealed by MALDI-MS (see below, Fig. 4), each DAG residue possesses one 14:0(3-OH) and 16:0(3-OH) in amide linkage. The absolute configurations of 14:0(3-OH) and 16:0(3-OH) were determined to beR. The ester-bound octadecanoic acid is exclusively linked to 14:0(3-OH) resulting in 14:0(3-O(18:0)). The negative ion MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the isolated lipid A fraction (Fig. 3) indicated a heterogeneous preparation comprising four quasimolecular ions, (M - H)− at m/z 1916.5, 1741.4, 1651.2, and 1474.9. The first ion corresponds to a species consisting of two DAG, two 14:0(3-OH), two 16:0(3-OH), one 18:0, and two GalA (calculated mass, 1917.6 Da). The ions at m/z 1741.4 and m/z1651.2 correspond to species lacking one uronic acid (Δm/z 176) or lacking the octadecanoic acid (Δm/z 266) and or lacking both (Δm/z 442), respectively. No masses representing phosphate containing oligosaccharides were detected. Minor fractions with Δm/z 28 originate from species containing one shorter acyl residue. To unequivocally analyze the distribution of the fatty acids, the lipid A was separated using TLC, and the fraction containing pentaacyl lipid A was eluted and analyzed using MALDI-TOF-MS. In Fig.4 A, the negative MALDI-TOF mass spectrum is shown, which reveals that only minor amounts of tetraacylated lipid A are present in this fraction. The positive ion MALDI mass spectrum (Fig. 4 B) reveals two abundant oxonium ions at m/z 1084.8 and 908.9, which are generated after laser-induced cleavage of the nonreducing DAG I (31.Qureshi N. Takayama K. Heller D. Fenselau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12947-12951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Takayama K. Qureshi N. Hyer K. Honovich J. Cotter R.J. Mascagni P. Schneider H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10624-10631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They correspond to (DAG II + GalA + 14:0(3-OH) + 16:0(3-OH) + 18:0)+ and (DAG II + 14:0(3-OH) + 16:0(3-OH) + 18:0)+, respectively. The loss of GalA in the second product is thought to originate from fragmentation. The presence of the oxonium ion at m/z 1084.8 (possessing the octadecanoic acid) indicates that the 18:0 is located on the nonreducing DAG II. The identified small amounts of an oxonium ion at m/z 818.8 for (DAG II + GalA + 14:0(3-OH) + 16:0(3-OH))+ (without the 18:0) originate from the tetraacyl lipid A fraction. Lipid A was treated with hydrazine under mild conditions, and the product was analyzed by MALDI-MS, which identified an ion atm/z 1650.9 that represents a homogeneous compound completely missing the ester-bound fatty acid. Methylation analysis of de-O-acylated lipid A employed the carboxyl and carbonyl reduction using NaBD4, converting GalA to galactose. Analysis using GLC-MS revealed only 1,5-di-O-acetyl-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-[1-2H6,6′-2H2]-galactitol proving that both GalA residues are pyranoses and exclusively present as terminal sugars. De-O-acylated lipid A was well soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), thus, it was possible to analyze it in Me2SO-d6 by NMR spectroscopy. The1H and 13C chemical shift assignments (TableIII) are based on one-dimensional1H and 13C NMR-spectra and two-dimensional double quantum filter correlated spectroscopy (Fig.5), total correlation spectroscopy (not shown), and heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence experiments (Fig.6).

For labeling of residues see Fig. 8. In the 1H NMR spectrum, four signals between 7.4 and 7.9 ppm were attributed to the four NH protons. Four other signals were identified in the anomeric region, of which three were attributed to H-1 of α-linked hexoses (residues A, B, andD; for labeling see Fig. 8) and one to H-1 of a β-linked (C) hexoses, as characterized by the chemical shifts andJH-1,H-2 coupling constants (A, 4.91 ppm (2.6 Hz); B, 4.80 ppm (3.5 Hz); D, 5.07 ppm (2.2 Hz); C, 4.39 ppm (8.4 Hz)). At 4.34 ppm and 4.10 ppm, the chemical shifts of H-5 of the two uronic acids were identified. The signals of the remaining ring protons are in the region 3.29–4.05 ppm. The chemical shifts of the fatty acids are between 0.6 and 2.3 ppm. The signals of their α-CH2 are between 2 and 2.2 ppm, and those of the other CH2-groups between 1 and 1.5 ppm. The signals of the CH3 protons are between 0.7 and 0.9 ppm. In agreement with the results of other experiments the substance was found to be composed of four sugars, substituted with fatty acids. The 13C NMR spectrum was assigned by an heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence experiment (Fig. 6, Table III). Six carboxyl resonances (of the two uronic acids and the four amide-bound 3-hydroxy fatty acids) are present between 170 and 173 ppm (spectrum not shown). In the anomeric region, four signals were identified between 92 and 103 ppm. Of the ring sugar signals in the region 50–78 ppm, those four between 50 and 55 ppm are assigned to the C-2 and C-3 atoms of the two DAG residues. The intensive signals of the fatty acids are in the region 13–33 ppm, with that of the CH3 groups at 13 ppm. The results confirm the presence of two DAG and two uronic acid residues. The complete assignment of chemical shifts and the determination of vicinal 1H,1H-coupling constants confirmed that both uronic acids are4C1 α-d-galacturonic acid residues. The coupling constants for GalpA A and GalpA D are JH-1,H-2 ∼2.6 and 2.2 Hz, JH-2,H-3 ∼10 and 9.3 Hz,JH-3,H-4 ∼3 and 5.4 Hz, and J H-4, H-5 ∼3 and 4.0 Hz, respectively. The sequence of the monosaccharides was established by nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments (Fig.7). Interresidual Nuclear Overhauser effect contacts were identified between protons C1 andB6a, b. Together with the downfield shift of the carbonB6 (68.4 ppm) it proved the (1→6)-linkage between DAG residues B and C. The (1→1)-linkage between GalA A and DAG B was identified by a Nuclear Overhauser effect contact between protons A1 andB1, and the (1→4)-linkage between GalA D and DAG C by a Nuclear Overhauser effect contact between protonD1 and C4, together with the downfield shift of carbon C4 (74.0 ppm). Thus, the monosaccharide sequenceD → C → B → A (Fig. 8) is unambiguously proven. A 31P NMR spectrum gave no phosphate signals, which is in agreement with all other analyses. Taken together, our data establish the structure of the lipid A moiety of LPS fromA. pyrophilus as shown in Fig. 8. For the first time, LPS was isolated from a hyperthermophilic bacterium, namely from A. pyrophilus. The LPS was shown to be of the S-form, as indicated by varying numbers of repeating units in the O-specific polysaccharide resulting in a ladder-like banding pattern in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular masses of LPS populations were identified by MALDI-MS. The average mass of one repeating unit (708 Da) suggested the presence of two hexose and two heptose residues. Other detected sugars in the LPS are Glc, Man, GalA, GlcN, and DAG, and the common constituents of the core region,l-glycero-d-manno-heptose and Kdo (8.Holst O. Brade H. Morrison D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). The detailed part of our investigation deals with the structure of the lipid A moiety. The isolated lipid A was found to represent a mixture of compounds. Thus, for the final structural elucidation of the carbohydrate backbone, methylation analysis, MALDI-MS, and NMR spectroscopy of the de-O-acylated lipid A were employed, because this derivative was found to be a homogeneous compound. The complete structure of the carbohydrate backbone was characterized as α-d-GalpA-(1→4)-β-d-DAG-(1→6)-α-d-DAG-(1→1)-α-d-GalpA. This is the first lipid A backbone that comprises two GalA residues. The complete structure, as revealed by MALDI-MS, is composed of this carbohydrate backbone, which is substituted by four (R)-3-hydroxy fatty acids in amide linkage and possesses a 14:0(3-O(18:0)) acyloxyacyl group at the nonreducing end. Each DAG residue carries one 14:0(3-OH) and one 16:0(3-OH); however, it was not possible to determine the exact position (N-2 or N-3) of each fatty acid. Smaller lipid A moieties were also present in the preparation, which lack either 18:0 or one GalA acid residue or both. Because only one lipid A fragmentation peak atm/z 1916 was found in the native LPS (see Fig.3), it must be concluded that the observed heterogeneity in the free lipid A preparation does not originate from intrinsic biological heterogeneity but from cleavages during the chemical isolation procedure (33.Caroff M. Deprun C. Richards J.C. Karibian D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5156-5159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DAG disaccharide is not substituted by phosphate but carries twod-GalA residues instead. DAG has been identified in lipid A from different LPS (9.Zähringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E.T. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1994; 50: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10.Zähringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Morrison D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 93-115Google Scholar). A mixed β-(1→6)-linked GlcpN-DAG disaccharide was found in lipid A fromCampylobacter jejuni and Rhodospirillum salinarum, and the homogenous β-(1→6)-linked disaccharide DAG-DAG is present in the lipid A from LPS of Bordetella pertussis and Legionella pneumophila, and, as a minor component, in lipid A from C. jejuni. In the case of lipid A from B. pertussis and L. pneumophila, both positions O-1 and O-4′ are substituted by monophosphate groups. In the few cases of phosphateless lipid A, no DAG has been identified. The structure of lipid A of R. leguminosarum is unique. Its carbohydrate backbone comprises β-d-GlcpN-(1→6)-2-amino-2-deoxy-gluconic acid that is substituted at O-4′ by d-GalpA, replacing phosphate. It was demonstrated that, as in Escherichia coli, the same seven enzymes are used in the beginning of LPS biosynthesis to furnish as precursor a 1,4′-bisphosphorylated β-(1→6)-linked GlcpN-GlcpN disaccharide that is acylated at N-2, O-3, N-2′, and O-3′ by four 14:0(3-OH) and carries the α-(2→4)-linked Kdo disaccharide at O-6′ (34.Raetz C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5745-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This precursor is then processed differently than in E. coli (35.Price N.P. Jeyaretnam B. Carlson R.W. Kadrmas J.L.

During that process, the phosphate residues at O-1 and O-4′ are removed by 1- and 4′-phosphatases followed in later steps by the transfer of d-GalpA to O-4′ and the oxidation of O-1. From these and other data, it is discussed that this precursor represents a conserved structure in LPS biosynthesis of different bacteria. This could also be true for A. pyrophilus, as the gene for the lipid A 4′-kinase that inserts phosphate at O-4′ of the lipid A backbone is present, despite the complete lack of phosphate in the final molecule (39.Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number AE000657). A screening of the total genome sequence of Aquifex aeolicus (39.Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), a close relative of A. pyrophilus, shows that all the enzymes required for the synthesis of the precursor as well as those required for the synthesis and transfer of heptose are present. However, no significant similarities to the genes lpxL (encodes the lauroyl transferase), lpxM (encodes the myristoyl transferase), and lpxP (encodes the palmitoleoyl transferase), that are involved in biosynthesis of acyloxyacyl groups in LPS of E. coli (40.Carty S.M. Sreekumar K.R. Raetz C.H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9677-9685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), were identified in the genome ofA. aeolicus. Because each of these transferases exhibits a strong substrate specificity, the presence of a specific stearic acid transferase (transfers the 18:0 to one 14:0(3-OH) residue, compare Fig.8) may be expected in Aquifex. It is possible that the gene encoding this transferase possesses no or only some sequence similarity to lpxL and lpxM, because lpxMdisplays already distant sequence similarities to lpxL (40.Carty S.M. Sreekumar K.R. Raetz C.H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9677-9685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This may be the reason why at present no “lpxS” gene has been identified in Aquifex. Despite this, we hypothesize that in LPS biosynthesis of A. pyrophilus the same precursor as in E. coli is first furnished and then processed by specific enzymes to a structure comprising the unique lipid A. Notably, this process includes the replacement of phosphate groups byd-GalpA residues at O-1 and O-4′ of the lipid A backbone. Lipid A is considered a valuable chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic marker. From comparative analyses of presently known lipid A structures, the lipid A of A. pyrophilus is unique and, thus, reflects the separated position of this species in the phylogenetic tree, which is based on 16 S rRNA homology studies (2.Burggraf S. Olsen G.J. Stetter K.O. Woese C.R. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, amino acid sequence alignments of KdsA (Kdo transferase) and WaaC and WaaF (heptosyl transferases) result in trees possessing Aquifex as a separate branch. Interestingly,Thermotoga maritima (41.Huber R. Langworthy T.A. König H. Thomm M. Woese C.R. Sleytr U.B. Stetter K.O. Arch.

https://openalex.org/W2114379972,"To elucidate the function of Bcl10, recently cloned as an apoptosis-associated gene mutated in MALT lymphoma, we identified its binding partner TRAF2, which mediates signaling via tumor necrosis factor receptors. In mammalian cells, low levels of Bcl10 expression promoted the binding of TRAF2 and c-IAPs. Conversely, excessive expression inhibited complex formation. Overexpressed Bcl10 reduced c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation and induced nuclear factor κB activation downstream of TRAF2. To determine whether overexpression of Bcl10 could perturb the regulation of apoptosisin vivo, we generated Bcl10 transgenic mice. In these transgenic mice, atrophy of the thymus and spleen was observed at postnatal stages. The morphological changes in these tissues were caused by acceleration of apoptosis in T cells and B cells. The phenotype of Bcl10 transgenic mice was similar to that of TRAF2-deficient mice reported previously, indicating that excessive expression of Bcl10 might deplete the TRAF2 function. In contrast, in the other organs such as the brain, where Bcl10 was expressed at high levels, no apoptosis was detected. The altered sensitivities to overexpressed Bcl10 may have been due to differences in signal responses to Bcl10 among cell types. Thus, Bcl10 was suggested to play crucial roles in the modulation of apoptosis associated with TRAF2."
https://openalex.org/W2025184994,"We investigated the impact of GLUT2 gene inactivation on the regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism during the fed to fast transition. In control and GLUT2-null mice, fasting was accompanied by a ∼10-fold increase in plasma glucagon to insulin ratio, a similar activation of liver glycogen phosphorylase and inhibition of glycogen synthase and the same elevation in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase mRNAs. In GLUT2-null mice, mobilization of glycogen stores was, however, strongly impaired. This was correlated with glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) levels, which remained at the fed values, indicating an important allosteric stimulation of glycogen synthase by G6P. These G6P levels were also accompanied by a paradoxical elevation of the mRNAs forl-pyruvate kinase. Re-expression of GLUT2 in liver corrected the abnormal regulation of glycogen andl-pyruvate kinase gene expression. Interestingly, GLUT2-null livers were hyperplasic, as revealed by a 40% increase in liver mass and 30% increase in liver DNA content. Together, these data indicate that in the absence of GLUT2, the G6P levels cannot decrease during a fasting period. This may be due to neosynthesized glucose entering the cytosol, being unable to diffuse into the extracellular space, and being phosphorylated back to G6P. Because hepatic glucose production is nevertheless quantitatively normal, glucose produced in the endoplasmic reticulum may also be exported out of the cell through an alternative, membrane traffic-based pathway, as previously reported (Guillam, M.-T., Burcelin, R., and Thorens, B. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 12317–12321). Therefore, in fasting, GLUT2 is not required for quantitative normal glucose output but is necessary to equilibrate cytosolic glucose with the extracellular space. In the absence of this equilibration, the control of hepatic glucose metabolism by G6P is dominant over that by plasma hormone concentrations. We investigated the impact of GLUT2 gene inactivation on the regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism during the fed to fast transition. In control and GLUT2-null mice, fasting was accompanied by a ∼10-fold increase in plasma glucagon to insulin ratio, a similar activation of liver glycogen phosphorylase and inhibition of glycogen synthase and the same elevation in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase mRNAs.

Therefore, in fasting, GLUT2 is not required for quantitative normal glucose output but is necessary to equilibrate cytosolic glucose with the extracellular space. In the absence of this equilibration, the control of hepatic glucose metabolism by G6P is dominant over that by plasma hormone concentrations. glucose-6-phosphate rat insulin promoter kilobase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid l-pyruvate kinase Hepatic glucose production is an essential physiological function required to prevent hypoglycemia in the postprandial or fasted states. The last two steps in hepatic glucose release consist of the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)1into glucose and release of glucose from the cells. Hydrolysis of G6P is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase, an enzyme located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (1.Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endo. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Classically, the pathway for glucose release has been viewed as involving glucose diffusion back into the cytosol through an as yet uncharacterized glucose carrier and release in the extracellular space by transport through the plasma membrane glucose transporter GLUT2 (2.Thorens B. Cheng Z.-Q. Brown D. Lodish H.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259 (C258): C279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, however, we described the existence of an alternative pathway for glucose release, which coexists in normal hepatocytes with the GLUT2-dependent pathway (3.Guillam M.-T. Burcelin R. Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12317-12321Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We showed that in the absence of GLUT2, although facilitated diffusion of glucose across the hepatocyte plasma membrane was decreased by greater than 95%, the rate of hepatic glucose production was normal and at least 10-fold higher than the remaining plasma membrane glucose transport capacity. These data therefore suggested the existence of an alternate route for glucose release. Our further observations suggested that this alternative pathway relied on membrane traffic originating from the endoplasmic reticulum and reaching the plasma membrane without transiting through the Golgi complex. Even though this pathway does not seem to be limiting for glucose release, our data showed that a fraction of the glucose produced in the endoplasmic reticulum remained inside the cells. This glucose has probably returned to the cytosol where it cannot diffuse directly into the extracellular space. It may, however, enter a futile cycle by being phosphorylated to G6P and re-entering the endoplasmic reticulum for hydrolysis to glucose. Therefore, in fasted GLUT2-null liver, when the gluconeogenic flux is maximal, a paradoxical accumulation of glucose and G6P in the cytosol may occur. Glucose and G6P are regulators of glycogen synthesis and breakdown and may therefore profoundly influence glycogen metabolism. Glucose by binding to glycogen phosphorylase increases its susceptibility to glycogen phosphorylase phosphatase and, thereby, its rate of inactivation (4.Carabaza A. Ciudad C.J. Baque S. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the other hand, G6P is an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase (5.Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Therefore, the combined effect of high cytosolic glucose and G6P should have a positive effect on glycogen accumulation. On the other hand, a paradoxical regulation of glucose sensitive genes such as those for l-PK, fatty acid synthase and Spot 14 could also be expected because G6P, or a downstream metabolite, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of their expression (6.Vaulont S.

It was the aim of this study to evaluate hepatic glucose metabolism in GLUT2 knockout mice and draw conclusions on the role of this transporter. We were interested, in particular, in the transition from the fed to fasted state when increased plasma glucagon to insulin ratio normally stimulates glycogen breakdown and decreases expression of glucose-sensitive genes. We report here that in absence of GLUT2, fasting was associated with a normal up-regulation of PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase mRNAs, which are strongly controlled by plasma glucagon and insulin levels (12.Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 13.Chatelain F. Pégorier J.-P. Minassian C. Bruni N. Tarpin S. Girard J. Mithieux G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) but with an abnormal degradation of glycogen stores and paradoxical stimulation of glucose-sensitive genes. This was correlated with persistent elevated intracellular G6P levels. These data indicate that the major role of GLUT2 in the fasted state is to equilibrate de novosynthesized, cytosolic glucose with the extracellular milieu. This is required to prevent accumulation of intracellular metabolites that have a dominant effect over the signals induced by the extracellular concentrations of glucagon and insulin. These abnormal regulations of metabolism and gene expression may also cause the observed liver hyperplasia. GLUT2-null mice die between 2 and 3 weeks of age (14.Guillam M.-T. Hümmler E. Schaerer E.

Transgenic re-expression of either GLUT2 or GLUT1 specifically in pancreatic β cells under the control of the rat insulin promoter (RIP) allows the mice to survive and breed (3.Guillam M.-T. Burcelin R. Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12317-12321Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The present studies were therefore performed with RIPGLUT1×GLUT2−/−(referred to in the text as GLUT2−/−) mice at the age of 10–14 weeks. Control mice were of the RIPGLUT1, GLUT2+/?genotype. Mice were housed with an inverted light cycle with light on from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. They were utilized either in the fed state (2:00 p.m.) or fasted for 6 or 24 h by removing food at 8:00 a.m. Total RNA was extracted from mouse liver by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (15.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). Separation by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formamide, transfer to Nylon membranes, and hybridization were performed as described previously (16.Gremlich S. Bonny C. Waeber G. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30261-30269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Probes were a 1.4-kb fragment of the PEPCK cDNA (gift of Dr. R.W. Hanson), a 1.3-kb fragment of G-6-Pase cDNA (gift of Dr. R. Taub), a 1.1-kb fragment of glucokinase cDNA (gift of Dr. C. B. Newgard), a 1.1-kb fragment of cyclophilin cDNA (gift of Dr. E. Nishimura), a 1.4-kb fragment of the glucagon receptor cDNA (gift of Dr. M. J. Charron), and a 0.7-kb fragment forl-pyruvate kinase that we cloned by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction. Liver glycogen phosphorylase activity was measured as described previously (17.Gilboe D.P. Larson K.L. Nuttall F.Q. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This assay is based upon the measurement of [14C]glucose-1-phosphate incorporation into glycogen. The total glycogen phosphorylase activity was determined in the presence of 5 mm AMP. Briefly, 200 mg of the left side of the main liver lobe was homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 250 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 10 mm sodium fluoride, 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The extract was centrifuged 20 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. 100 μl of the supernatant was then assayed with 200 μl of a mixture containing 33 mm Mes, 15 mmglucose-1-phosphate, 150 mm sodium fluoride, 3.4 mg/ml rat liver glycogen type III, and 50 μCi/mmol [14C]glucose-1-phosphate ± 5 mm AMP. After 10 min at 30 °C, the 14C-labeled glycogen formed into 75 μl of the assay reaction was precipitated onto a Whatman paper #31, which was immediately dipped into a 66% ice-cold ethanol solution twice for 20 min under gentle stirring. The radioactivity remaining on the Whatman paper was then counted. One unit of phosphorylase is defined as the amount of enzyme that incorporates 1 nmol of glucose from glucose-1-phosphate into glycogen per minute. Liver glycogen synthase activity was measured as described previously (18.Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). This assay is based upon the measurement of the incorporation of [14C]UDP-glucose into glycogen. The total and active glycogen synthase activities are determined in the presence of 6.6 or 0.11 mm G6P, respectively. Briefly, the liver extracts were prepared as for the measurements of glycogen phosphorylase. The extracts were incubated in the presence of the assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm UDP-glucose, 0.5% of rabbit liver glycogen type III, and 0.06 μCi/μmol of [14C]UDP-glucose. The synthesized [14C]glycogen was then precipitated and quantified as for the phosphorylase activity. The liver glucokinase and hexokinase activities were assessed as described previously (19.O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The glucokinase (HKIV) and hexokinase (I, II, and III) enzymes transform an excess of glucose and ATP into G6P and ADP. This assay is based upon the evaluation of the transformation of G6P into 6-phosphogluconate and NADPH by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the presence of an excess of NADP+. The hexokinase activity is the rate-limiting step, and the amount of NADPH produced is proportional to the activity of the enzyme. Quantification were performed by determining the variations of the absorbance at 340 nm. The hexokinase (I, II, and III) activities were determined in the presence of 0.5 mm glucose. The total hexokinase activities including glucokinase were determined in the presence of 100 mm glucose. The difference between the measurements corresponds to the glucokinase activity alone. Briefly, the livers were homogenized in an ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm triethylammonium, pH 7.3, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 mm each EDTA and EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each pepstatin and leupeptin, 0.02% sodium azide, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and 1 ml of the supernatant was precipitated with 200 μl of a 25% polyethylene glycol 6000 solution. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the hexokinase activities were assayed from the supernatant in the presence of 150 mm triethylammonium, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm ATP, 1 mm NADP, and 1.5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). One unit of hexokinase transforms 1 nmol of glucose into G6P per minute at 37 °C. For intrahepatic glucose-6-phosphate measurements, livers were clamp frozen. After homogenization glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were determined as described previously (20.Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). DNA was measured using bisbenzimidazol as described previously (21.Hopcroft D.W. Mason D.R. Scott R.S. Horm. Metab. Res. 1985; 17: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Radioimmunoassays for blood detection of insulin and glucagon were performed using commercial kits (Linco, St. Louis, MO). Liver and muscle glycogen content was determined as described previously (22.Burcelin R. Eddouks M. Maury J. Kande J. Assan R. Girard J. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 mg of livers or muscle were dissolved in 6 volumes of 1 m NaOH for 1 h at 55 °C and neutralized with 1 n HCl. The extract was spun down, and aliquots of the supernatant were incubated in the presence of amyloglucosidase for 2 h at 37 °C under vigorous shaking in an 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer. The glucose was then assayed by a glucose oxidase method (Trinder kit, Sigma). Table I shows the characteristics of the mice analyzed. In the absence of GLUT2, the mice were slightly hyperglycemic in the fed state. Their glycemia decreased progressively with fasting to reach a slightly hypoglycemic level after 24 h, resulting probably from the glycosuria caused by impaired tubular glucose reabsorption. Lactate levels were not modified by fasting, in contrast to control mice where these levels progressively decreased. Free fatty acids increased with fasting both in control and mutant mice. Insulin levels were lower both in fed and fasted states in the GLUT2-null mice, whereas glucagon levels were greater in both states as compared with control. Importantly, the glucagon to insulin ratio was much higher at all times in the GLUT2-null animals. These mice had a normal glucose-induced insulin secretion as assessed in islet perifusion studies and hyperglycemic clamp (not shown).Table IBody weight and blood glucose parameters of fed and fasted control (RIPGLUT1 × GLUT2 +/?) and GLUT2 −/− (RIPGLUT1 × GLUT2 −/−) miceMiceBody weightGlucoseLactateFFAInsulinGlucagongmmmg/mlμmmicrounits/mlpg/mlControlsFed30.1 ± 0.88.1 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.1534 ± 69108 ± 1968 ± 5Fast 6 h29.6 ± 0.36.4 ± 0.51.1 ± 0.11328 ± 18211 ± 360 ± 2Fast 24 h28.2 ± 0.56.3 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.1897 ± 15910 ± 355 ± 3GLUT2−Fed32.4 ± 0.79.2 ± 0.3aDifferent from corresponding control value withp < 0.05.1.3 ± 0.1aDifferent from corresponding control value withp < 0.05.364 ± 52aDifferent from corresponding control value withp < 0.05.39 ± 6aDifferent from corresponding control value withp < 0.05.132 ± 15aDifferent from corresponding control value withp < 0.05.Fast 6 h29.1 ± 0.76.7 ± 0.61.3 ± 0.21363 ± 502.5 ± 0.7aDifferent from corresponding control value withp < 0.05.68 ± 2Fast 24 h29.4 ± 0.74.7 ± 0.4aDifferent from corresponding control value withp < 0.05.1.3 ± 0.2aDifferent from corresponding control value withp < 0.05.1226 ± 129aDifferent from corresponding control value withp < 0.05.1.9 ± 0.8aDifferent from corresponding control value withp < 0.05.63 ± 2Data are the means ± S.E. of n = 5–6.a Different from corresponding control value withp < 0.05.

To determine whether glycogen synthase or phosphorylase activities were normally regulated in GLUT2-null liver, these activities were measured in the fed state and after 24 h of fasting (Table II). The total and active glycogen synthase activities were 65% higher in fed and 75% higher in fasted GLUT2-null liver as compared with control livers. The total phosphorylase activity was 45% lower in fed mutant livers as compared with control but not significantly different in the fasted state. The phosphorylase to synthase ratio, which represents an index for the glycogen degradative activity, was increased by fasting in GLUT2-null livers even more than in control livers.Table IIGlycogen phosphorylase, glycogen phosphatase, and glucokinase activities (units/mg of protein) in the liver of fed or 24-h fasted RIPGLUT1 × GLUT2 +/?

Fig. 1shows that they were not decreased after 6 h of fasting in GLUT2-null livers and were still elevated after a 24-h fast, whereas they were almost completely mobilized within 6 h of fasting in control livers. In muscles, glycogen mobilization was, however, similarly efficient in both types of mice (Fig. 1). To assess whether the elevation in plasma glucagon levels observed in fasting normally stimulated the expression of gluconeogenic genes, we measured the accumulation of the mRNAs for PEPCK and G6Pase. The Northern blots of Fig. 2(A and B) show that the expression of these mRNAs was similarly increased by fasting in both control and mutant livers. Expression of the glucagon receptor mRNA was then assessed. This gene is induced by increased glycolytic and gluconeogenic fluxes (23.Burcelin R. Mrejen C. Decaux J.F. Hauguel De Mouzon S. Girard J. Charron M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8088-8093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 C shows that its expression in GLUT2-null liver was lower in the fed state but, upon fasting, higher than in control livers. We next evaluated glucokinase mRNA and activity levels. These were similar in fasted control and GLUT2-null livers (Fig.3 and Table II). Feeding induced the expected up-regulation of glucokinase mRNA and activity in control livers. However, in GLUT2-null liver no up-regulation of glucokinase mRNA and activity was induced by feeding. We then measured expression of the l-PK mRNA. This glucose-responsive gene is induced in the feeding period and suppressed by fasting, as observed in control livers (Fig. 4). However, in GLUT2-null liver the opposite regulation was observed. Indeed, even though the basal levels of expression in the fed state were similar in control and mutant livers, fasting induced a paradoxical increase in l-PK mRNA accumulation.Figure 4Paradoxical regulation of thel-PK mRNA in the liver of fasted GLUT2-null mice.Expression of the l-PK mRNA detected by Northern blot analysis (upper panel) is increased severalfold in the livers of fasted GLUT2-null. This is in contrast to the normal down expression of this mRNA in the livers of fasted control mice. Quantification of the Northern blot analysis is presented in thelower panel. These data are the means ± S.E., withn = 5. *, p < 0.05 versusfed state; #, p < 0.05 versus corresponding control value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To explain the observed lack of glycogen mobilization and paradoxical regulation of thel-PK genes in fasted GLUT2-null livers, we hypothesized that an abnormal regulation of G6P may cause these two dysregulations. Indeed, G6P is an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase and an obligatory intermediate in the stimulation ofl-PK gene transcription. Thus, even though neosynthesized glucose can be released quantitatively normally from hepatocytes by a membrane traffic-based pathway (3.Guillam M.-T. Burcelin R. Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12317-12321Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it is still possible that a fraction of glucose returns from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol. Because glucose cannot diffuse out of the cytosol into the external milieu, it may be converted back to G6P by glucokinase. Fig.5 shows that comparable levels of G6P were found in the fed state in both types of mice. However, whereas in control livers G6P levels progressively decreased, in the mutant livers these levels remained at the fed level even after 24 h of fasting. To confirm that the persistent accumulation of glycogen and the paradoxical regulation of l-PK mRNA were due to the absence of GLUT2 from hepatocytes, we re-expressed GLUT2 specifically in the liver of the GLUT2−/− mice. This was achieved by crossing the RIPGLUT1×GLUT2−/− mice (referred to as GLUT2−/− in this study) with transgenic mice expressing GLUT2 under the control of the liver-specific α-1-antitrypsin (AAT) promoter. Following appropriate breeding we obtained RIPGLUT1×AATGLUT2×GLUT2−/− mice. These are devoid of endogenous GLUT2 but express transgenic GLUT2 in liver (Fig.6 A). After fasting, glycogen levels were degraded to the same extent as in control livers (0.06 ± 0.01 versus 1.51 ± 0.54 μg/mg protein for fasted mutant and control livers, respectively; see Fig. 1 for other conditions). Expression of the l-PK mRNA was also normally suppressed by fasting (Fig. 6 B), and PEPCK mRNA normally up-regulated. These data indicate the key role of GLUT2 absence in all these metabolic dysregulations. Microscopic examination of histological sections of GLUT2-null liver revealed a normal structure. Livers were, however, hyperplasic. Indeed, as presented in TableIII, the weight of GLUT2-null livers were >40% greater than the control livers. This was correlated with a ∼30% increase in total DNA content.Table IIILiver hyperplasia in RIPGLUT1 × GLUT2 −/− mice (GLUT2 −/−)MiceBody weightLiver weightProtein/liverDNA/liverDNA/proteinDNA/liverggmg/mgμg/mgμg/mgμg/mgControl35.2 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.030.164 ± 0.0054.67 ± 0.121.43 ± 0.067054 ± 154GLUT2−/−35.8 ± 0.92.16 ± 0.12aDifferent from control with p < 0.05.0.161 ± 0.0024.22 ± 0.091.31 ± 0.049086 ± 335aDifferent from control with p < 0.05.Data are the means ± S.E., n = 5.a Different from control with p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Data are the means ± S.E., n = 5. The present analysis was initiated following our study of glucose uptake and release from hepatocytes of GLUT2-negative mice (3.Guillam M.-T. Burcelin R. Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12317-12321Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These previous results indicated that in the absence of GLUT2, glucose uptake was almost completely suppressed but glucose release was quantitatively normal and proceeded by a membrane traffic mechanism originating from the endoplasmic reticulum. A fraction of glucose nevertheless remained inside the cells and probably returned to the cytosol. Because of its inability to diffuse into the extracellular space, this glucose may enter a futile cycle initiated by its phosphorylation and followed by re-entry of G6P in the endoplasmic reticulum for hydrolysis back to glucose and phosphate. The data that we present here support and extend these observations. They are summarized in Fig. 7. First, in fasting, the glucagon to insulin ratio increased similarly in both the GLUT2-null and control mice, although the absolute values of these ratios were much higher in the mutant mice. The reason for this higher ratio is presently not known. However, it may not be due to a defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion because the mice used in these study re-express a glucose transporter in their β cells, which allows a normal insulin secretion in response to elevation in glucose concentrations. Furthermore, the glucagon-secreting pancreatic α cells do not normally express GLUT2, and their function may thus not be directly altered by the genetic ablation of this transporter. Surprisingly, however, the high glucagon to insulin ratio present in fed mice could still be increased ∼10-fold by fasting, a magnitude similar to that observed in fasted control mice. Importantly, this elevated hormone ratio was sensed by the hepatocytes as revealed by the increase in active glycogen phosphorylase and decrease in glycogen synthase activities and by the induction of the mRNAs for PEPCK and G6Pase. Surprisingly, however, glycogen store mobilization in GLUT2-null livers was strongly impaired. This could not simply be explained by an impaired activation of glycogen phosphorylase or inactivation of glycogen synthase because these were normally regulated during the fed to fast transition. Actually, the ratio of glycogen phosphorylase to glycogen synthase, which can be taken as a measure of the glycogen degradative activity of the cells, is increased to a greater extent in the GLUT2-null liver. This indicates that solely based on these activity ratio, one would expect a faster degradation of glycogen in the mutant than in the control livers. We believe that this apparent contradiction can be resolved when we take into the account the intracellular levels of G6P. These are indeed not decreased by fasting in the absence of GLUT2 but remain at the fed levels. Because G6P is a strong allosteric stimulator of glycogen synthase (5.Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), we favor the hypothesis that the prevailing G6P levels stimulates glycogen synthase so that the equilibrium between glycogen degradation and synthesis prevents degradation. Another striking observation that can in part be explained by the persistent G6P levels was the paradoxical stimulation ofl-PK mRNA accumulation. Indeed, the l-PK gene is a paradigm for glucose-sensitive genes (6.Vaulont S. Kahn A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24.Marie S. Diaz-Guerra M.-J. Miquerol L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and its transcription is stimulated by a mechanism that requires glucose metabolism at least to the glucokinase step, and G6P appears to be a critical signaling molecule. It should, however, be noted that the observed increase in l-PK mRNA occurred in the presence of G6P levels, which remained constant during the fed to fast transition. Therefore G6P cannot be the only regulator of this gene expression. Other metabolites of G6P and/or other transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms controlled by hormones and/or glucose may participate in this regulation. This abnormal regulation was also observed for expression of the glucose-sensitive Spot14 gene (not shown). These data on l-PK gene expression are in agreement with those of Antoine et al. (27.Antoine B. Lefrançois-Martinez A.-M. Le Guillou G. Leturque A. Vandewall A. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17937-17943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), who reported that the transcriptional control of the l-PK gene by glucose was dependent on the level of GLUT2 expression in a panel of hepatoma cell lines. They suggested that GLUT2 was required forl-PK gene extinction rather than for its stimulation. They proposed that GLUT2 normally allowed a fast exit of glucose from the cytosol in the extracellular medium. In the absence of this glucose exit, glucose could be phosphorylated into G6P, which maintains an elevated level of l-PK gene expression. Our data agree with their proposal, except that we showed that hepatic glucose production proceeded quantitatively normally in the absence of GLUT2. Why do G6P levels remain elevated in fasted GLUT2-null livers? Formally, this G6P can originate from gluconeogenesis and/or glycogen degradation and accumulate in the cytosol because of a limited capacity to enter the endoplasmic reticulum or to be hydrolyzed (Fig. 7). Our Northern blot analysis indicated that G6Pase was increased in fasting to the same extent in GLUT2-null and control livers and hepatic glucose production in 6-h fasted GLUT2-null or control mice was identical (∼25 mg/kg/min) (3.Guillam M.-T. Burcelin R. Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12317-12321Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 2R. Burcelin and B. Thorens, unpublished data. Therefore, the flux of glucose from cytosolic G6P to the endoplasmic reticulum and the extracellular space via the membrane traffic pathway does not appear to be limited. Cytosolic G6P may thus come in large part from glucose diffusing back into the cytosol after its production in the endoplasmic reticulum. Because glucokinase activity was measurable in both the fed and fasted states, the production of G6P from glucose was therefore possible at all times. Analysis of mice re-expressing GLUT2 in liver indicated that restoration of glucose facilitative diffusion across the plasma membrane allowed normal degradation of glycogen stores and regulation of l-PK mRNA. Therefore, this is in support of the hypothesis shown in Fig. 7 that in the absence of GLUT2 (i) de novo synthesized glucose returns into the cytosol but cannot equilibrate with the extracellular space and is thus phosphorylated into G6P and (ii) the primary cause of dysregulated glycogen metabolism and l-PK gene expression is the relative increase in intracellular G6P levels. One unexpected finding was that the liver of the GLUT2-null mice was larger than that of control mice. The 40% increase in liver weight was correlated with a 30% higher total DNA content. Increased liver mass is thus due in great part to an increase in cell number. This hyperplasia may be caused by up-regulation of autocrine growth/proliferation factors, which are regulated similarly to the glucose-sensitive l-PK gene. Differential display analysis of mRNA from the livers of control and GLUT2-null mice may allow identification of these genes. Together, our studies showed that in the absence of GLUT2, although glucose production was quantitatively normal, there was important dysregulations in hepatic glucose metabolism. As summarized in Fig. 7, these appear to result from a lack of equilibration of cytosolic glucose with the extracellular milieu. The major role of GLUT2 in periods of stimulated glucose output is thus to allow equilibration of cytosolic glucose with the external space. In the absence of this equilibration, G6P levels cannot decrease normally during fasting. This leads to abnormal regulation of glycogen metabolism and expression of glucose-sensitive genes. This suggests, therefore, that the control of hepatic glucose metabolism by intracellular glucose metabolites is dominant over that by circulating hormone concentrations. Also, because glucose can still be released efficiently in the absence of GLUT2 and therefore in the absence of facilitated diffusion of glucose across the plasma membrane, these data further support our previous observations suggesting that this glucose release was by a membrane traffic-based pathway. Based on these observations, one can further speculate that, in normal hepatocytes, the membrane pathway for glucose release is essential for compartmentalization of glucose away from the cytosol. High cytosolic glucose, which could diffuse into the nucleus, may activate glucokinase by displacing it from its regulatory protein (28.Agius L. Peak M. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Brown K.S. Kalinowski S.S. Megill J.R. Durham S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and a subsequent increase in G6P could stimulate glycogen accumulation andl-PK expression. These effects are obviously opposite to those desired in fasting.

Recombinant S100A4 (p9Ka) has been reported to interact in vitro with cytoskeletal components and to form oligomers, particularly homodimers in vitro. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a strong interaction between S100A4 (p9Ka) and another S100 protein, S100A1, was detected. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acid residues involved in the dimerization of S100 proteins abolished the interactions. The interaction between S100A4 and S100A1 was also observed in vitro using affinity column chromatography and gel overlay techniques. Both S100A1 and S100A4 can occur in the same cultured mammary cells, suggesting that in cells containing both proteins, S100A1 might modulate the metastasis-inducing capability of S100A4.

Elevated levels of one S100 protein, S100A4, are closely associated with the process of metastasis in breast and other cancer cells in rodent animal models and in human cancer specimens. S100A4 or its mRNA is found at an elevated level in metastatic relative to non-metastatic rat (2.Dunnington D.J.

The conditions employed for these interactions in vitro cannot match the conditions inside the cell, where functional interactions are likely to take place. Thus, the yeast two-hybrid system has been utilized to find interactions in vivo for the metastasis-inducing protein S100A4. For screening a human breast tumor two-hybrid library constructed with pYESTrp2 vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands), a bait vector was constructed by excising the LexA cassette from the pHybLex/Zeo vector (Invitrogen), and inserting it into the pAD-GAL4-2.1 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to produce the LexA vector with the LEU2 selectable marker. A 303-base pair cDNA corresponding to the coding region of human S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA was obtained by PCR1 of an expression vector pET-p9Ka 2B. Lloyd and R. Barraclough, unpublished data. and was subcloned into the LexA vector to produce the LexA-S100A4 bait construct. Nucleotide sequencing ensured the integrity of the cloning and sequences. Selection for this bait plasmid in yeast cells was on leucine-free plates or medium. For the screening of the breast cancer two-hybrid library, yeast strain L40 (genotype: MATa his3Δ200trp1–901 leu2–3112 ade2 LYS2::(4lexAop-HIS3)URA3:: (8lexAop-lacZ)GAL4) cells were transformed with LexA-S100A4 to produce a stable L40-LexA-S100A4 strain. A culture was transformed with the human breast cancer pYESTrp2 library DNA according to the lithium yeast transformation protocol (Invitrogen). Yeast transformants were selected by their growth on leucine-, tryptophan-, and histidine-free plates and media. Lift assays (according to Stratagene's protocol) were carried out 7 days after transformation, and colonies that gave a blue color within 16 h were isolated. For each individual clone, both the bait plasmid, LexA-S100A4, and the target plasmid from the YESTrp2 library were isolated from the cells. The recovered YESTrp2 target plasmids were cotransformed into L40 yeast cells along with the original bait plasmid, LexA-S100A4, and lift assays were carried out to reconfirm the interaction in the yeast cells. The activity of β-galactosidase of each positive transformant was determined using a liquid β-galactosidase assay (24.Becker D. Fikes J. Hames B. Higgins S. Gene Transcription : A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 295-319Google Scholar). The number of Miller units of β-galactosidase activity was calculated using the formula: Miller units = (1,000 × optical density of the reaction)/(volume of cell assayed in ml × time in min × optical density of the culture at 600 nm). Amino acid residues phenylalanine 72 and tyrosine 75 of the human S100A4 protein sequence (25.Engelkamp D. Schäfer B.W. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10258-10264Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were both altered to glutamine by changing the triplets from TTC and TAC to CAG using the PCR extension method of site-directed mutagenesis (26.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The two external primers used were: 5′-XhoI primer, TCTCTCGAGCTGCTGTCATGGCGTGC and 3′-PstI primer, TGCGCCTGCAGTGGAGTTTTCATTTCTTC. The inner primers for the F72Q mutation were: 5′-GACCAGCAAGAGTACTGTGTCTTCC and 3′-CTCTTGCTGGTCCACCTCGTTGTCCC. The inner primers for the Y75Q mutation were: 5′-GAGCAGTGTGTCTTCCTGTCCTGC and 3′-GACACACTGCTCTTGGAAGTCCACC. The cDNAs with the point mutations were digested with XhoI and PstI and inserted into the LexA vector. DNA sequencing confirmed the nucleotide changes and the coding frames for fusion protein expression. Rat recombinant S100A4 (rat rS100A4) was produced and purified as described previously (12.Gibbs F.E.M. Wilkinson M.C. Rudland P.S. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18992-18999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recombinant human S100A1 cDNA was obtained using PCR from a clone selected in the two-hybrid screen. The cDNA open reading frame, which encoded the 93 amino acids of human S100A1 protein, was subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-2T, and rS100A1 was produced as a fusion protein with 26 kDa of glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein at the NH2 terminus (GST-S100A1). The fusion protein was purified to near homogeneity using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Histidine-tagged-rS100A1 (His-S100A1) was expressed in pET16b(+) vector and purified with histidine-binding resin (Novagen). For the detection of binding of S100A1 and S100A4 proteins in vitro, the GST-S100A1 fusion protein or GST alone was attached to glutathioneS-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) slurries at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml of slurry. 100 μl of a solution of 0.1 mg/ml rS100A4 protein in KTT buffer (140 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, with 1 mm CaCl2, or 1 mm EGTA) was incubated with 100-μl aliquots of the GST or GST-S100A1 slurries for 3 h at 4 °C. The mixtures were applied to spin columns and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 800 rpm for 1 min. The columns were spun-washed with the KTT buffer at least 10 times. Unbound proteins were eluted with at least 50 bed volumes of KTT until no further protein was eluted. Bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Eluted S100A4 was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) followed by transfer onto PVDF filters (Immobilon, Millipore, France), and incubation with a 1:500 dilution of an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to rat rS100A4, produced as described previously (28.Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P. Wilkinson M. Parry E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For gel overlay, the recombinant GST-S100A1, His-S100A1, GST, and S100A4 proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12.5% (w/v)) and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated with overlay buffer (0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.25% (w/v) gelatin, 0.5% (w/v) detergent Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 3 μg/ml rat rS100A4 plus either 0.5 mm calcium ions or 1 mm EGTA) for 4 h and washed four times for 5 min each in the same buffer without the bovine serum albumin, gelatin, or S100A4. Membranes were incubated with blocking buffer (3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, 2% (w/v) Marvel in Tris-buffered saline). The membranes were washed three times for 5 min each in wash buffer (0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, 2% (w/v) Marvel in Tris-buffered saline). The membranes were incubated with 2.5 ml of the wash buffer containing a 500-fold dilution of the rabbit anti-rat S100A4 serum for 1.5 h. After being washed in buffer six times for 5 min each, the filters were incubated in a 2,500-fold dilution of a secondary antibody for 1 h. After a final wash with Tris-buffered saline for 30 min, bound antibody was detected using the ECL system with exposure against Kodak XAR-5 film. The human malignant breast tumor cell lines MCF-7, SK-Br-3 and MDA-MB-231 (29.Engel L.W. Young N.A. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 4327-4339PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously (30.Bennett D.C. Peachy L.A. Durbin H. Rudland P.S. Cell. 1978; 15: 283-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate/CsCl method as described previously (31.Barraclough R. Kimbell R. Rudland P.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. Macdonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar, 33.Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA or 0.5 μg of poly(A)-containing RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript according to the supplier's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland), and the resulting cDNA was amplified by 35 cycles of PCR usingTaq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the following human S100A1-specific primers: 5′-primer, ACAGGTCTCCACACACAGCTCC; 3′-primer, AGGCTCGAGAGGAAGGGCGCTGC. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.4% (w/v) agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Control amplifications omitted the reverse transcriptase. About 500 cells were plated per well of chambered slides and cultured for 24 h. The cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformadehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. After a 30-min incubation in blocking buffer (2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline), the cells were incubated with primary antibody, either rabbit anti-S100A4 (1:50 dilution) or mouse anti-S100A1 (1:20 dilution) in blocking buffer. After being washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for anti-S100A1 staining and tetramethylrhodamine β-isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for S100A4 staining were used. After washing, the slides were dried and mounted. Photographs were taken using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. To identify heterologous interactions in vivo between S100A4 and components of malignant/metastatic cells, more than 2 × 106 yeast cell transformants from a two-hybrid cDNA library, constructed from mRNA isolated from a human breast cancer specimen, were transfected with the S100A4 (p9Ka) cDNA bait vector. Target plasmids were recovered from 14 independent blue colonies, and purified plasmid DNAs were cotransformed individually into L40 yeast cells along with the S100A4 (p9Ka) bait plasmid. Reisolation of plasmid DNA and cotransformation were repeated serially three times, after which only four colonies showed the blue color in lift assay on each occasion. Plasmid DNA was isolated from these four transformants, and the nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs in the target vectors were determined. The sequence of each of the four target plasmids was precisely that of human S100A1. The four colonies containing both the S100A4 bait and S100A1 prey plasmids exhibited β-galactosidase activities that were 20–70-fold higher than colonies containing only bait plasmid or only a prey plasmid (Fig.1 a). However, the prey constructs in the library (Invitrogen) contained an additional 19 amino acids of protein sequence inserted between the B42 activating domain and the NH2 terminus of the target protein. To rule out the possibility that this extra sequence might be interacting directly with the S100A4 protein, the extra sequence was deleted from one of the isolated target clones. L40 strain yeast transformants containing both the pYESTrp2ExS100A1 prey construct, bearing the deletion, and the S100A4 bait construct LexA-S100A4, yielded a blue color within 3 h in the lift assay, and the β-galactosidase activity of the deleted clone was greater than that of the original clone containing the additional 19 amino acids insert (Fig. 1 b). Thus, the β-galactosidase activity was not caused by the presence of these additional amino acids at the NH2 terminus of the cloned S100A1 protein in the yeast cells from the breast cancer library. The above experiments suggest that, at least in yeast cells, S100A4 can interact in a heterologous manner with S100A1. Two single nucleotide point mutations of the S100A4 cDNA were generated which yielded amino acid substitutions in residues involved in the dimer interface reported previously for S100A6 (34.Potts B. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D. Chazin W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These changes, which resulted in conversion of phenylalanine 72 and tyrosine 75 of the S100A4 protein sequence to glutamine, individually fully (Phe-72), or partially (Tyr-75), disrupted S100A4 dimer formation in the yeast two-hybrid system (not shown). Bait plasmids containing cDNAs bearing either of these mutations completely failed to yield blue colonies when cotransfected with S100A1 prey plasmids under the same conditions that yielded blue colonies in 6 h when unmutated S100A4 was used. These specific mutations individually abolished the interaction between S100A4 and S100A1 in the yeast cells as determined by β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1 c). Antibodies directed against recombinant S100A4 or S100A1 were tested for their specificity toward their target recombinant proteins (Fig.2). Using Western blotting, anti-S100A4 did not cross-react against NH2-terminal polyhistidine-tagged S100A1, recombinant GST, nor against a GST-S100A1 fusion recombinant protein, but did recognize S100A4 protein at the same loading. Anti-S100A1 recognized the His-tagged S100A1 and the GST-S100A1 fusion protein but did not cross-react onto S100A4 protein at the same loading (Fig. 2). To find out whether it is possible to detect interaction between S100A4 and S100A1 in vitro, the GST-S100A1 fusion protein and the control GST were immobilized on Sepharose-glutathione columns. The interaction in vitro with recombinant S100A4 was detected by the retention of the S100A4 on the Sepharose-glutathione-GST-S100A1 column. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted from the columns with excess glutathione, and the proteins in the resulting fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with anti-S100A4 antibody. When a sample of recombinant S100A4 was passed through a column containing bound recombinant GST, no reduced glutathione-elutable S100A4 was retained on the column beyond the wash fraction (Fig. 3 c). However, when the S100A4 was passed through a similar column but containing immobilized GST-S100A1 fusion protein, rS100A4 was retained on the column, even after extensive washing with buffer, and was eluted, along with the GST-S100A1 fusion protein, with reduced glutathione. This result suggests strongly that S100A4 can bind to GST-S100A1 fusion protein but not to the GST control in vitro. Exactly the same result was obtained when the experiment was carried out with a cell lysate of Escherichia coli BL-21 cells which had been induced to produce S100A4 with IPTG (Fig. 3 b). The interaction in vitro of purified recombinant GST-S100A1 with S100A4 (purified or nonpurified) was detected in the presence of calcium ions and could be reversed in the presence of 1.0 mm EGTA (Fig. 3 b). To investigate in more detail the influence of calcium ions on the interaction between S100A4 and S100A1, the GST-S100A1 columns above were utilized, with buffers containing between 0 and 1.0 mmcalcium ions or 0.5 or 1.0 mm EGTA. Interaction between S100A1 and S100A4 could be detected using the buffer with no added calcium; however, the amount of S100A4 retained on the GST-S100A1 column increased as the concentration of calcium in the buffer was increased (Fig. 4). 0.5 mmEGTA reduced the amount of S100A4 retained, and no detectable S100A4 was retained with 1.0 mm EGTA. These results suggest that the interaction of S100A4 with S100A1 is not markedly calcium ion-dependent over the normal range of calcium concentrations. However, removing all of the calcium with a high concentration of EGTA created conditions that reduced the retained S100A4 to an undetectable level. Interaction between S100A1 and S100A4 was also demonstrated using a gel overlay technique with purified rS100A1 and rS100A4 proteins (Fig.5). Recombinant S100A4 protein binding to both His-S100A1 and GST-S100A1, but not to GST protein, was detected by the antibody to S100A4. To find out whether S100A1 and S100A4 coexist in the same cells naturally, the presence of S100A1 mRNA was sought in clonal breast tumor cell lines of known S100A4 status using a PCR-based assay. A correctly sized ethidium bromide-stained band of DNA on agarose gels was obtained following RT-PCR using human S100A1-specific primers on RNA from human mammary cell lines, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SK-Br-3. The latter two cell lines have been shown previously to contain high levels of S100A4 mRNA (4.Nikitenko L. Lloyd B. Rudland P. Fear S. Barraclough R. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed that they corresponded to the human S100A1 mRNA. No bands were obtained with any of the RNAs when RT-PCRs were carried out in the absence of the Superscript reverse transcriptase. Thus, the mRNAs for both S100A1 and S100A4 were present in these clonal cell lines. The presence of both S100A1 and S100A4 protein in the same cells has been shown by Western blotting (Fig.7) and by dual labeling immunofluorescence on MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.8). In the immunofluorescent experiments, both S100A1 and S100A4 were localized to the perinuclear region and to the cytoskeleton, and the fluorescence of each could be removed by preincubating each antibody separately with its cognate, but not the other recombinant protein (Fig. 8). Superimposition of the staining shows their partial colocalization on stress fibers and in the perinuclear region.Figure 7Western blot of S100A1 and S100A4 proteins in cell lines.

Although it has been reported previously that S100A4 forms homodimeric forms (23.Pedrocchi M. Schäfer B. Durussel I. Cox J. Heizmann C.

Based upon the time taken for the blue dye arising from β-galactosidase activity to become visible, the interaction between S100A4 and S100A1 in vivo was more effective at stimulating reporter gene activity than the homodimeric interaction of S100A4 in the same system. S100A4 molecules that had been specifically mutated in conserved amino acid residues, reported previously to be associated with the dimer interface of S100A6 (calcyclin) (34.Potts B. Smith J. Akke M.

The heterodimerization of S100A1 and S100A4 reported here might be expected to have biological significance if these S100 proteins occur in the same cells. These proteins have been shown to coexist in the same cultured human breast cancer cells and in rat mammary cells, Rama 29 (not shown) (30.Bennett D.C. Peachy L.A. Durbin H. Rudland P.S.

These observations suggest that S100A1 and S100A4 might also be interacting inside the cell at these same locations. Because S100A1 and S100A4 are capable of dimerizing, it is possible that they have a common intracellular target. Both S100A1 and S100A4 individually have been shown to interact with a range of non-S100 protein targets. S100A1 has been shown to interact with brain-specific C and muscle-specific A isoforms of aldolase (40.Zimmer D.B. Van Eldik L.J. J. Biol.

S100A4, in contrast, has been reported to interact in vitro with a more limited range of intracellular target proteins, in particular cytoskeletal actin (15.Watanabe Y. Usada N. Minami H. Morita T.

However, the interaction with actin might arise from a tendency of S100A4 to aggregate (14.Mandinova A. Atar D. Schäfer B. Speiss M. Aebi U. Heizmann C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of S100A4 with myosin occurs at a site on the non-muscle myosin heavy chains which has been reported to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vivo andin vitro (20.Kriajevska M.

All of these interactions have been determined with single purified S100A4 protein, and it will be important to find out whether these interactions in vitrocan be modulated by the presence of S100A1. It is possible that the interactions of S100A4 with myosin, which might be associated with the protein's metastasis-inducing capabilities, could be modulated by interaction with cytoskeleton-associated S100A1 (14.Mandinova A. Atar D. Schäfer B. Speiss M. Aebi U. Heizmann C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard it might be interesting to note that S100A1 and S100A4 are colocalized in the high S100A4-expressing cultured Rama 29 cells (30.Bennett D.C. Peachy L.A. Durbin H. Rudland P.S. Cell. 1978; 15: 283-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which do not express a metastatic phenotype. The distribution of S100A1 and S100A4 proteins in normal cells is much more diverse. Although S100A1 was originally found in brain, where it interacts with S100B, it is also found in heart, slow twitch skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and kidney (45.Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). In contrast, S100A4 is not found in significant quantities in brain, but it is distributed widely and specifically elsewhere in the body, including kidneys, lungs, thymus, and muscle tissues, at least in the rat (28.Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P. Wilkinson M. Parry E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The observation that S100A1 interacts with S100A4 as well as with S100B, but that S100B (46.Moore B. McGregor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1647-1653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not S100A4 (28.Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P. Wilkinson M. Parry E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), is found widely in brain tissue, raises the possibility that S100A1 has different S100 partners depending upon the S100 proteins that are expressed in the particular cells concerned.

CD, catalytic domain Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 comprise a large family of extracellular calcium- and zinc-dependent, neutral endopeptidases. Substrate specificity among the individual members varies, but, as a group, they are capable of degrading all of the major macromolecules of the extracellular matrix. Consequently, controlled and coordinated MMP activities are essential during physiological events that require tissue remodeling or cellular migration. Proteolytic activity is modulated through a combination of regulated expression, activation, and autodegradation processes, as well as extracellular inhibition by specific natural inhibitors of MMPs, the TIMPs. If any of these interactions becomes even slightly dysregulated, MMP activity can contribute to the pathologies of cancer invasion and metastasis, arthritis, autoimmune disease, tissue ulceration, or cardiovascular disease (1.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1345-1350PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Cawston T.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 70: 163-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 3.Yong V.W. Krekoski C.A. Forsyth P.A. Bell R.

Because modulation of MMP activity could affect the progression of these diseases, MMP inhibitor development has been the target of considerable effort within the pharmaceutical industry (6.Beckett R.P. Whittaker M. Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents. 1998; 8: 259-282Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7.Johnson L.L. Dyer R. Hupe D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).One of the hallmarks of the MMP family is the functionally distinct and structurally independent domain structure of these enzymes. The active site zinc is contained within a catalytic domain, which, when expressed independently, generally exhibits the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of the intact parent molecule (8.Ye Q.-Z. Johnson L.L. Hupe D.J. Baragi V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11231-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9.Ye Q.-Z. Johnson L.L., Yu, A.E. Hupe D.

This truncated catalytic domain has been used successfully for both x-ray crystal and NMR solution studies, yielding structures that agree well with the two full-length MMP structures (reviewed in Refs. 11.Borkakoti N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1998; 70: 73-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar and 12.Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The MMPs share significant primary sequence homology (30–99% identity, 49–99% similarity) (13.Sang Q.A. Douglas D.A. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 137-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the structures describe a common protein fold (14.Blundell T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) consisting of three α-helices packed against a twisted 5-stranded β-sheet. The second helix (αB) and contiguous loop of this domain contain the zinc-binding active site followed by a series of turns that define the S1′ binding site. The substrate cleft is quite shallow, and much of the binding energy and enzyme specificity for substrates and inhibitors seems to derive from interactions within the hydrophobic S1′ pocket (15.Browner M. Prospect. Drug Discovery Design. 1994; 2: 343-351Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar).MMPs (or matrixins), along with astacins, adamalysins, and serralysins belong to the metzincin superfamily of zinc peptidases (16.Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). This classification is based on two conserved sequence motifs. The first, an extended active site consensus sequence, HEXXHXXGXXH, provides three histidine ligands for the catalytic zinc. The second, an adjacent 1–4 β-tight turn (the “Met-turn”), positions an invariant methionine beneath the zinc to support the active site configuration. This substructure is critically important to the catalytic function of these enzymes and is maintained by an elaborate hydrogen bonding network (17.Bode W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Kleine T. Schnierer S. Tschesche H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 18.Reinemer P. Grams F. Huber R. Kleine T. Schnierer S. Piper M. Tschesche H. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The metzincins are distantly related to the thermolysin family of metalloproteinases, sharing some structural features and a limited active site motif (HEXXH), and it has been proposed that these enzymes share a similar mechanism of catalysis (19.Cha J. Pedersen M.V. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15831-15838Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11.Borkakoti N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1998; 70: 73-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Both families demonstrate broad bell-shaped curves (pH 4.5–9.5) for the dependence of catalysis on pH, indicating the involvement of two ionizable groups in the proteolytic process (19.Cha J. Pedersen M.V. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15831-15838Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20.Kunugi S. Hirohara H. Ise N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21.Stack M.S. Gray R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, these groups have not been unequivocally identified for either enzyme family, and the specific mechanism of catalysis remains controversial (22.Mock W.L. Stanford D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7369-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23.Cha J. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16019-16024Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The current availability of a large body of crystal structures of metalloproteinases complexed with substrate analog inhibitors has allowed an extended comparison of structure-function relationships. The correlation of biochemical characteristics with the conserved features of this broader group of enzymes could identify the common mechanistic details of zinc-catalyzed proteolysis.Several models have been advanced to describe metalloproteinase catalysis. One of the earliest schemes, proposed for thermolysin (20.Kunugi S. Hirohara H. Ise N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,24.Matthews B. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and often applied to MMPs (11.Borkakoti N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1998; 70: 73-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25.Browner M.F. Smith W.W. Castelhano A.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6602-6610Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), describes a mechanism ofgeneral base catalysis. In this model, the invariant active site glutamic acid (HE XXH, Glu143 in thermolysin, Glu198 in matrilysin, and Glu202in stromelysin) acts on the scissile peptide bond through a zinc-bound water molecule and is required for catalysis. The water molecule is polarized, but not ionized in the active configuration of the enzyme, resulting in the delocalization of one of the protons between the zinc-bound water and the negatively charged glutamate. The acidic pK a of 5 was believed to be too low for the zinc·water complex and was attributed, at least in early models, to the combined system of Glu143 and the zinc-bound water (20.Kunugi S. Hirohara H. Ise N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).A recent study of Glu198 mutations in matrilysin suggested that MMP catalysis proceeds through a specific base mechanism (23.Cha J. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16019-16024Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The acidic pK a of matrilysin was not attributed to the active site glutamic acid because the mutants retained the characteristic bell-shaped curves for the pH dependence of catalysis, describing the same pK a values as the wild-type parent. Mutant catalytic efficiency was significantly reduced compared with wild-type matrilysin (Gluwt>Asp≫Cys>Gln>Ala), but it was still detectable, suggesting an auxiliary role for this residue after the initial rate-determining step. In this model, the zinc-hydroxide nucleophile attacks the peptide bond directly, and the acidic pK a of 4.3 is assigned to the zinc·H2O complex. It was proposed that Glu198 (proposed pK a > 9) is protonated in the enzyme ground state and acts either to stabilize the transition state or as a general acid to protonate the leaving amino group (23.Cha J. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16019-16024Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These pK avalues are quite unusual for the assigned groups, but this was attributed to the exceptionally hydrophobic character of the MMP active site.The pH activity profile of human stromelysin-1 is somewhat more complicated than that observed for other MMPs due to the presence of a third pK a at about 6 (26.Wilhelm S.M. Shao Z.H. Housley T.J. Seperack P.K. Baumann A.P. Gunja-Smith Z. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21906-21913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Holman C.M. Kan C.-C. Gehring M.R. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This produces an unusually sharp catalytic optimum at pH 5.9, followed by a broad shoulder of more limited catalysis through pH 9. Catalytic efficiency at neutral pH is about one-third that measured at the pH optimum. This distinctive pH profile has been observed for both the full-length and truncated enzymes, using either natural macromolecular or synthetic peptidic substrates (26.Wilhelm S.M. Shao Z.H.

The unique pH-dependent activity of stromelysin-1 may provide physiologically important posttranslational regulation because at acidic pH, the latent enzyme undergoes autoactivation more readily (30.Gunja-Smith Z. Woessner J.F. Agents Actions. 1993; 40: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), binds TIMP-1 less avidly (31.Woessner J.F. Gunja-Smith Z. J.

Kan C.-C. Gehring M.R. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This residue is unique to human stromelysin-1 and resides in the flexible outer loop of the S1′ pocket. In its protonated state, His224 forms a hydrogen bond across the pocket lumen with the backbone carbonyl of Ala217, a residue immediately preceding the Met-turn (33.Dhanaraj V. Ye Q.Z. Johnson L.L.

This interaction appears to be critical to substrate binding because above the pK aof His224 (pK a 6.2), stromelysin catalytic efficiency decreases dramatically as a result of increasingK m. The mutation of His224 to glutamine (27.Holman C.M. Kan C.-C. Gehring M.R. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or asparagine (35.Johnson L.L.

The maximum catalytic efficiency of the H224Q mutant is expressed over a broad pH range (pH 5.8 to 9.5) and was more than twice the value determined for stromelysin at the wild-type acidic optimum. These data indicate that an intact S1′ substructure is essential for enzyme function and that its loss could be responsible for the attenuated activity of the native enzyme at neutral pH. However, the specific substructure has not been identified.In the studies described here, we use the catalytic domain of human stromelysin-1 (MMP-3 CD) to relate to the pH dependence of inhibition to specific atomic interactions described by x-ray crystal structures of the enzyme·inhibitor complexes. Using a cognate pair of inhibitors bearing either a carboxylic or hydroxamic acid as the zinc-binding functional group, we demonstrate a strong pH dependence of inhibitor potency for human stromelysin-1. Because these inhibitors share the same P1′ group, differences in potency were predicted to be due to interactions with one or more ionizable residues close to the active site zinc. The pH dependence of inhibition was also determined for a hydroxamic acid-containing peptidic inhibitor. This compound has a fairly small P1′ group, which does not displace the His224hydrogen bond in the S1′ pocket. Comparison of the relationship ofK i to pH for these three compounds allowed us to isolate the specific contributions to inhibitor binding from the ionization of key active site residues. The ionization constants determined from the inhibitor studies could be correlated to pK a values describing the catalytic efficiency of stromelysin-1 over this same pH range, contributing to the characterization of interactions that define the mechanism of catalysis for the broader family of zinc metalloproteinases. This information is useful in the rational design of potent and selective inhibitors for human stromelysin-1.DISCUSSIONUsing the results from the inhibitor studies described here, it is possible to assign a pK a1 of 5.6 to the Glu202·H2O·zinc complex because all three inhibitors displace the zinc-bound water during binding to the catalytically active MMP-3 CD. This identification of pK a1 is consistent with our parallel characterization of the pH dependence ofk cat /K m. These data indicate that the active site glutamic acid of stromelysin is ionized in the active EH2 and EH forms of the enzyme (Figs. 1 and 4), as required for a role as the general base in zinc-catalyzed hydrolysis. This proposed mechanism has a significant implication for the design of synthetic inhibitors of metalloproteinases. It is apparent from the pH dependence of inhibitor potency for Compound I that carboxylic acid-containing inhibitors can bind efficiently only to the protonated (inactive) form of the enzyme, EH3. In general, inhibitors containing negatively charged zinc-binding functional groups would be expected to have limited potential for in vivo efficacy because the active site glutamic acid is predominantly ionized under natural conditions at neutral pH. However, human stromelysin-1 is distinct among MMPs in that it exhibits a sharp acidic optimum for catalytic activity. Over the narrow pH range of optimal activity, there is a significant amount of Glu202 in the nonionized state, and carboxylic acid inhibitors could be potent and extremely selective for this enzyme under natural conditions.Analyses of the proposed reaction intermediates indicate that considerable flexibility is required of the active site glutamic acid, and this limitation sheds light on the catalytic effects that would arise from its mutation (see Ref. 23.Cha J. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16019-16024Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As a general base, the glutamic acid is complexed with the zinc-bound catalytic water and must be able to move freely between the tetrahedral and the trigonal bipyramidal ligand positions as substrate binds and product is formed and released. In addition, this residue apparently rotates to shuttle protons to the leaving group, during and after amide (or ester) bond cleavage. If the initial general base coordination of Glu202 with the catalytic water is indeed bidentate, as we have suggested (Fig.4 E), it is clear why this residue is so strictly conserved. The α-carbon of the conserved glutamic acid is locked solidly in place in the active site helix immediately adjacent to the first of the zinc ligands, fixing its relative distance from the catalytic zinc. Consistent with the reported activities of the Glu198matrilysin mutants, only aspartic acid can substitute effectively in this role, and it does so with decreased efficiency because the shorter aspartate side chain places the carboxylate further away from the zinc. The residual activity of the Cys, Gln, and Ala matrilysin mutants may be due to a default mechanism in which the zinc-bound water directly attacks the peptide bond (Ref. 44.Woolley P. Nature. 1975; 258: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and see Ref. 22.Mock W.L. Stanford D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7369-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The residual acidic pK a detected for these mutants could represent the ionization of another important carboxylate, possibly the conserved Asp238 (stromelysin numbering) residue, which forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone amino groups of the Met-turn to maintain and position that critical portion of the enzyme.The pK a2 value of 6.3 for human stromelysin-1 has been attributed to an unidentified His224-dependent substructure (27.Holman C.M. Kan C.-C. Gehring M.R. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the studies described here, the potencies of all three inhibitors demonstrate first order dependence on the protonation state of His224, indicating that they bind poorly to stromelysin in the absence of this substructure (the EH and E forms in Fig. 1). In contrast, productive substrate binding is possible with either EH2 or EH. It is especially notable that U24522, despite the extensive substrate-like interactions both along the substrate cleft and within the S1′ pocket, differs significantly from substrate in its strict dependence on the presence of the His224-sensitive substructure. All three inhibitors bind only on the primed side of the substrate cleft, whereas the substrate spans the cleft on both sides of the active site. Above the pK a of His224, it appears that substrate binding on the unprimed side is sufficient to allow the subsequent, although somewhat limited, stabilization of this critical substructure, which permits productive substrate interaction with the active site. However, the significant increase in K m under these conditions is an indication of the inefficiency of this process, and the resulting catalysis of the EH·S complex is represented by the broad shoulder of reduced catalytic efficiency above pH 7 in the pH profile of catalysis.The importance of the S1′ substructure may derive from the requirements imposed on matrixins by the natural substrates they digest. The complex matrix macromolecules are bulky and highly structured, requiring a shallow and solvent-exposed substrate-binding cleft on the surface of the enzyme. Because these substrates are extraordinarily resistant to proteolytic degradation, the matrixins have adapted by inducing a localized β-strand configuration in the substrate near the active site that exposes the scissile bond to proteolytic attack (see Ref.17.Bode W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Kleine T. Schnierer S. Tschesche H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This substrate interaction is held tightly in place through extensive antiparallel contacts to the enzyme β4-strand (see Fig.6 for primed side interactions). The β-strand conformational change is probably facilitated to varying degrees by interactions with other domains, depending on the particular enzyme and substrate (10.Murphy G. Knauper V. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 12.Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 45.Gomis-Ruth F.X. Gohlke U. Betz M. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez Otin C. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). At least in the case of collagen cleavage, productive substrate binding requires coordinate interactions with the collagenase C-terminal domain. It is possible that the critical S1′ substructure attributed to His224 in stromelysin-1 contributes to this induced β-strand substrate conformation and is maintained in other MMPs by nonionizing S1′ interactions.During catalysis, the planar peptide bond passes through a tetrahedral intermediate that requires a significant spatial displacement of the residues on either side of the scissile bond. To accommodate this movement of bound substrate, the matrixins provide open and somewhat indistinct pockets on the unprimed side of the active site, whereas primed side interactions remain tight and relatively inflexible to preserve critical catalytic contacts with the zinc in the transition state. In crystal structures of MMP-3 CD with peptidic inhibitors, it is evident that primed side binding is maintained by important substrate interactions within the S1′ pocket, but it is enhanced by additional β-strand interactions with the tripeptide Pro221-Leu222-Tyr223(“β-anchor”). In the model described in Fig. 6, the formation of the substrate·enzyme complex extends the five stranded β-sheet of the active enzyme by two strands on the primed side: (i) the induced β-strand of the substrate, and (ii) the β-anchor that forms the bottom wall of the substrate cleft. This structure locks the substrate in place and increases the hydrophobicity of the active site to enhance the Lewis acid potential of the catalytic zinc.The proline and tyrosine residues in the β-anchor are absolutely conserved in the MMP family, and both are required to position and maintain this strand as part of the substrate cleft. Pro221is locked in place by the preceding Met-turn and the rigid constraints of its cyclic structure. The firmly anchored Pro221carbonyl may also form indirect hydrogen bonds with the scissile carbonyl and amino groups through a tightly bound water molecule (15.Browner M. Prospect. Drug Discovery Design. 1994; 2: 343-351Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), an interaction that would lend additional stabilization to the β-anchor and the tetrahedral intermediate. Tyr223 lies in a hydrophobic pocket near the beginning of the active site helix (αB), surrounded by the side chains of three highly conserved residues (Leu164, Trp186, and Val198). A fairly weak hydrogen bond between Tyr223 and a backbone amide (Asn194) augments this binding interaction. Leu222 apparently acts as a spacer with the side chain extending into the bulk solvent and makes little contact with the main chain atoms of the substrate. Not surprisingly, there is little conservation of this residue among the matrixins.In human stromelysin-1, the His224 hydrogen bond provides an additional and apparently essential stabilization of this β-strand substructure. A recent MMP-3·thiadiazole inhibitor crystal structure illustrates what happens to the β-anchor when the S1′ hydrogen bond is disrupted (46.Finzel B.C. Baldwin E.T. Bryant Jr., G.L. Hess G.F. Wilks J.W. Trepod C.M. Mott J.E. Marshall V.P. Petzold G.L. Poorman R.A. O'Sullivan T.J. Schostarez H.J. Mitchell M.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2118-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This inhibitor binds on the unprimed side of the active site and demonstrates amazing selectivity for human stromelysin-1 over collagenase and gelatinase. The enzyme·inhibitor complex was formed at pH 7.5, where the His224 hydrogen bond is disfavored, and was subsequently crystallized at pH 7.0. Without the stabilizing S1′ hydrogen bond, His224 has rotated into the substrate cleft, and Tyr223 has moved 7 Å toward the active site to bind firmly within the S1′ pocket. This conformation would interfere with the proposed β-strand substrate interactions and may be largely responsible for the reported stromelysin-1 selectivity of this class of inhibitors. In addition, the presence of the intramolecular Tyr223 in the S1′ pocket would effectively block the primed side binding of inhibitor or substrate. Apparently, at pH > 6.3, substrate binding that initiates on the unprimed side of the stromelysin-1 active site is sufficient to allow a reorientation of the β-anchor with the ensuing (but much reduced) catalytic activity characteristic of this enzyme.The studies described here illustrate the value of relating empirically determined biochemical properties of enzymes with the corresponding atomic relationships deduced from crystal structures. The pH dependence of inhibition and catalysis of human stromelysin-1 support a model of general base catalysis for zinc-dependent metalloproteinases, where the invariant active site glutamic acid acts through a zinc-bound water molecule to attack the scissile peptide bond. It is also clear from these studies that structural elements such as the proposed β-anchor play a ke"

However, the structural basis for its function remains unclear. Molecular modeling showed that BFL-1 could have a similar core structure as BCL-xL, consisting of seven α helices, although both proteins share only the conserved BCL-2 homology domains (BH1 and BH2 domains), but otherwise have very limited sequence homology, particularly in the N-terminal region. We demonstrated in the yeast two-hybrid system that BFL-1 interacts strongly with human BAX but is not able to form homodimers nor to interact with human BCL-2 or BCL-xL. Overexpression experiments in REF52 rat fibroblasts showed that BFL-1 conferred increased resistance to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. BFL-1 had also the ability to neutralize BAX lethality in yeast. BAX requires the BH3 domain for interaction with BFL-1. However, the minimal region of BFL-1 for the interaction with BAX in coimmunoprecipitation experiments was not sufficient to protect cells from apoptosis. Further examination of BFL-1 and several other anti-apoptotic proteins suggests a more general type of structure based on structural motifs,i.e. a hydrophobic pocket for the binding of proapoptotic proteins, rather than extended sequence homologies.

Nunomura A. Science. 1998; 282: 1268-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins of the BCL-2 family are important regulators of apoptotic cell death (2.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, apoptosis can be inhibited by overexpression of anti-apoptotic members of the family, including BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1, BCL-w and A1. In contrast, proapoptotic members of the family, such as BAX, BAK, and BCL-xS, promote apoptosis and can antagonize the protective effects of BCL-2 and BCL-xL. Interestingly, some functional aspects of the BCL-2 family proteins are conserved in yeast. Expression of BAX and BAK in the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae and in the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe can prevent cell growth and depending on growth conditions be lethal (3.Greenhalf W.

Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 173-182PubMed Google Scholar), analogous to findings in mammalian cells. Despite intensive research the molecular mechanisms by which the BCL-2 proteins regulate apoptosis are not yet fully understood. Several domains of the BCL-2 family proteins are evolutionarily conserved. These regions are described as BCL-2 homology (BH)1 domains. BH1 and BH2 domains are common throughout the family for anti-apoptotic members (7.Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5864) Google Scholar,8.Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The most thoroughly studied anti-apoptotic members, BCL-2 and BCL-xL, share the BH3 and BH4 domains (9.Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T.

The proapoptotic members of the family, such as BAX and BAK, also share the BH3 domain, which, however, has distinguished features as compared with that of the anti-apoptotic members (9.Boyd J.M.

Numerous studies indicate that the members of the family are able to interact with each other via regions including the homology domains, and it is generally accepted that protein-protein interactions of the BCL-2 family members may be one of the most important mechanisms in the regulation of apoptosis (13.Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). A1 is a BCL-2-related protein. It was originally identified as a murine hematopoietic-specific, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-inducible gene product (14.Choi S.S. Park I.C. Yun J.W. Sung Y.C. Hong S.I. Shin H.S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1693-1698PubMed Google Scholar). Human BFL-1 can be considered as a homologue of mouse A1, because these two proteins share about 72% amino acid identity (14.Choi S.S. Park I.C. Yun J.W. Sung Y.C. Hong S.I. Shin H.S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1693-1698PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol.

BFL-1 appears to be induced by the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 (15.Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to be a direct transcriptional target of nuclear factor-κB (16.Zong W.X.

Like BCL-2, BFL-1 can prolong cell survival; it retards tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis in the human dermal microvascular cell line, HMEC-1 (15.Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol.

Chinnadurai G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3879-3882PubMed Google Scholar). However, the function of BFL-1 seems to be distinct from that of BCL-2, because BFL-1 permits cell proliferation (19.D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3879-3882PubMed Google Scholar, 20.D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of BFL-1 revealed that mutations within the BH1 and BH2 domains abolished the anti-apoptotic activity, whereas the N-terminal domain contributed to the proliferative activity of BFL-1 (20.D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The proposed BH3 domain, however, did not promote anti-apoptotic activity (20.D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because the structure-function relationship of the BFL-1 protein is still unclear, we have used molecular modeling to investigate the possible structure of BFL-1 and further dissected the structure and function of BFL-1 on the basis of structural similarities with other members of the BCL-2 family. After manual optimization to obtain different alignments of the sequences within Insight II (Molecular Simulations, Inc.), models of human BFL-1 were built using the program Modeller (21.Sali A. Blundell T.L. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref Scopus (10561) Google Scholar, 22.Sali A. Overington J.P. Protein Sci. 1994; 31: 1582-1596Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and examined. Further optimization was done manually using the graphics program O (23.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). Verification of the quality of the models was done using stereochemistry values calculated in Modeller and profile analysis of the protein sequence threaded onto its own three-dimensional template (24.Lüthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Further analysis with Procheck (25.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 282-291Crossref Google Scholar) and tools within the program O helped to confirm these results. Several cDNA sequences encoding BFL-1 (14.Choi S.S. Park I.C. Yun J.W. Sung Y.C. Hong S.I. Shin H.S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1693-1698PubMed Google Scholar) were identified in the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base of GenBankTM using a Blast (NCBI) search. EST cDNA clone N28416 was purchased from Research Genetics, Inc. and sequenced. The cDNA was subcloned in-frame into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen), yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen), and the yeast two-hybrid plasmids pLex-a and pVP16 (26.Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz E. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). To construct the deletion mutants M1 to M7 of BFL-1, EST clone N28416was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction. Forward and reverse primers are listed in Table I. All fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction were cloned in-frame into the EcoRI/NotI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing. For yeast two-hybrid studies, BAX constructs were as described earlier (3.Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27.Simonen M.

Expression of the Bcl-2 family members in yeast was confirmed by Western blotting using antibodies against LexA (CLONTECH) (27.Simonen M. Keller H. Heim J. Eur. J.

Keller H. Heim J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For transfection, REF52 cells were seeded at 10–30% confluency (∼5 × 104 cells) in 12-well cell culture plates and grown for 24 h. Cells were then transfected with a total of 2 μg of plasmids. Transfections were performed successfully with either LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) or Superfect (Qiagen). Mouse pro-B cell line FL5.12 was obtained from IDUN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, CA. The culture and transfection of FL5.12 were as described (7.Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5864) Google Scholar). For analysis of the expression and stability of the BFL-1 deletion protein M5, REF52 cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1/His construct and selected with G418. 107cells were collected before and after serum deprivation, and cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis. The expression level of the M5 mutant protein was examined by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-His antibody (Milan Analytica AG). REF52 cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmids encoding the green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-N1,CLONTECH) together with 1 μg of pcDNA3 carrying genes to be tested. The pcDNA3 plasmid served as control. Apoptotic cells were round up after 3 h of serum deprivation (29.Yao R. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 343-345PubMed Google Scholar). Green fluorescent cells were monitored, and normal flat and round apoptotic cells were counted by microscopic examination. For interleukin-3 deprivation experiments, transfected FL5.12 cells were washed three times in serum-free medium to remove interleukin-3 and cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml in triplicate. At various time points at least 100 cells from each individual culture were analyzed by trypan blue exclusion staining. Cell survival is expressed as percentage of surviving cells/total number of cells, given with the standard deviation of the assay (49.$$$$$$$ data missing in sourceGoogle Scholar). Purified 6His-BAX protein, produced in Escherichia coli, was kindly provided by Dr. G. Fendrich (Novartis). BFL-1 and its deletion mutants were expressedin vitro by the TNT system (Promega); appropriate cDNAs were sub-cloned into pcDNA3.1/His as described above. For in vitro transcription/translation, 2 μg of plasmid DNA were linearized (creating 5′-overhangs) and used with TNT wheat germ lysates (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. 6His-BAX fusion protein (10 μg) was mixed with 20 μl of in vitrotranslated 35S-labeled proteins for 1 h on a rotator in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The mixtures were then diluted to 200 μl with Tris-buffered saline/0.5% Nonidet P-40. A complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) was added. The solution was precleared with 2.5% (v/v) Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 45 min. After removal of the gel by centrifugation at 1000 rpm, the supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of a polyclonal anti-human BAX antibody (Pharmingen) for 1 h. Subsequently, 25 μl of a 50/50 slurry of protein G-fast flow-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and the incubation was continued for another hour. The protein G-fast flow-Sepharose was collected by low speed centrifugation (3000 rpm), washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/1% Nonidet P-40 and once with Tris-buffered saline, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. After low speed centrifugation, the resulting supernatants were applied to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and exposed to a phosphorimage screen (Molecular Dynamics). All experiments were performed at 4 °C. The yeast S. cerevisiae L40 strain (26.Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz E. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) was grown and transformed as described previously (26.Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz E. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown on SC plates (28.Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) lacking tryptophan, leucine, uracil, and histidine at 30 °C. Cells expressing interacting genes or gene fragments formed colonies within 2–3 days. The β-galactosidase plate assay was performed on nitrocellulose membranes (NEF-987, NEN® Research Products) using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Roche Diagnostics) as a substrate (27.Simonen M. Keller H. Heim J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Clones coding for interacting proteins become blue on the membranes. The β-galactosidase liquid assay was performed as described using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as substrate (27.Simonen M. Keller H. Heim J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interaction can be detected by the intensity of the yellow color formed. All samples were analyzed in triplicates. The yeast strain Bi (3.Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was used in BAX lethality experiments. Cells were suspended in water, and then 5 μl of aliquots were dropped onto the appropriate agar plates. The growth media used were mainly as described by Sherman (28.Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). YEP being a rich medium and SD a defined medium with NH4SO4 as a nitrogen source (3.Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For simplicity all defined media have been described simply as SD and do not have the supplements added specified; the supplements being all those required for growth of the specific strain. Where strains carry a plasmid, an appropriate selection was used (i.e. minus uracil with all episomal plasmids and minus leucine with the integrant). The carbon sources were 2% (w/v) glucose, which prevents BAX expression, or 2% galactose, which induces BAX expression. Supplements were added from 5 mg/ml stock solutions to give the final concentrations of: 20 mg/liter of lysine and histidine-HCl, and 30 mg/liter of leucine and uracil (where needed). Agar was added to a final concentration of 2%. BFL-1 is one of the smallest anti-apoptotic members identified so far in the BCL-2 family (14.Choi S.S. Park I.C. Yun J.W. Sung Y.C. Hong S.I. Shin H.S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1693-1698PubMed Google Scholar), comprising 175 amino acids with a putative transmembrane domain. Preliminary sequence alignment of BFL-1 with the well characterized apoptosis-suppressing family members, BCL-2 and BCL-xL, shows that BFL-1 contains the conserved BH1 and BH2 domains but has only very limited homology with the other domains. Therefore, we wanted to explore the structural basis for the cell death suppressor activity of BFL-1. Models of BFL-1 were built based on the three-dimensional structure of BCL-xL (30.Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 31.Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Inohara N. Ishibashi Y. Ohta S. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27886-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The homology between both proteins in the region of the BH1 and BH2 domains (helices 4–7) is high and therefore allowed to build this part of the model with confidence (Fig.1 A). The core structure shows hydrophobic patches on the surface, which would be covered by the structure of the remaining nonhomologous parts of the sequence. Several models for the N-terminal part of the sequence were built to test different alignments of the sequences obtained by manual optimization because of the low homology. The most reasonable models required a sequence alignment similar to that depicted in Fig. 1 A, where three helices were built to resemble the N-terminal structure of BCL-xL (Fig. 1 B). If helices were built for BFL-1 based on the sequence alignment, which suggests that helix 3 does not exist (20.D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), there was no stereochemically reasonable way to connect helices 2 and 4 as there are only 7 residues to cover more than 20 Å. Therefore, it was reasonable to model the BFL-1 sequence on the BCL-xL fold, which includes all 7 helices. Accordingly, residues aligned at positions 1, 5, and 6 of the core BH3 domain (8.Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), which are highly conserved in BH3 domains of the BCL-2 family members, are not conserved in BFL-1. We therefore divide the N-terminal sequence into structural homology regions: domain A for helix 1 (amino acids 1–32), domain B for helix 2 (amino acids 36–49), and domain C for helix 3 (amino acids 53–62). The yeast two-hybrid system was used to explore the interactions of BFL-1 with other BCL-2 family members, like BAX (27.Simonen M. Keller H. Heim J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32.Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding human BFL-1, BAX, and truncations of BAX were cloned into the yeast two-hybrid vectors pLex-a and pVP16. The cloning led to in-frame fusions of the proteins with the DNA-binding protein, LexA, and the VP16 transcription activation domain (26.Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz E. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), respectively. The putative transmembrane domain of BAX was omitted to avoid complications in the two-hybrid system. These constructs were used to transform cells of yeast strain L40 in combinations of two to test the interaction of BFL-1 with BAX. The plasmids were also introduced singly into L40 and tested without an interacting partner to see whether the fusion protein on its own had intrinsic transcription activation activity (autoactivation). The protein-protein interactions were determined as growth in the absence of histidine and by β-galactosidase activity. Cotransformation of cells with BFL-1 and BAX resulted in activation of the his3and LacZ reporter genes. The interaction could be detected with both the qualitative β-galactosidase plate assay and the quantitative β-galactosidase liquid assay, which detects only strong interactions. BFL-1 showed no interaction with BCL-2, BCL-xL, or BAG, nor was homodimerization of BFL-1 observed (not shown) indicating that BFL-1 in solution is preferentially in a monomeric form, as is BCL-xL. The growth test and β-galactosidase plate assay indicated that BFL-1 interacted, in addition to full-length BAX, also with several BAX truncations. Interactions of eight different BAX truncations (Fig.2 A) with full-length BFL-1 were tested. The experiment was performed in two different setups, BFL-1 fused to LexA and the BAX truncations to VP16 and vice versa. The growth test and the β-galactosidase plate assay showed that all BAX truncations containing the BH3 domain interacted with BFL-1, and those lacking BH3 did not (not shown). The results were the same in both setups, although the LexA fusions of some BAX truncations showed autoactivation (27.Simonen M. Keller H. Heim J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The quantitative β-galactosidase liquid assay (Fig. 2 B) confirmed the results from the growth and β-galactosidase plate assays. BAX truncations A, C, E, F, and G showed strong interactions with BFL-1. The interaction of BFL-1 with the BAX truncation C, which contains essentially only the BH3 domain, was very strong. The only common domain in the truncations, which was necessary and sufficient for a strong interaction with BFL-1, was BH3 (Fig. 2). The interactions of BAX and its truncations with BFL-1 were roughly as strong as the earlier reported interactions of BAX with BCL-2 (27.Simonen M. Keller H. Heim J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fact that BAX appears to interact similarly with BFL-1 as it does with BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BAX (27.Simonen M. Keller H. Heim J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) supports the idea that BFL-1 could have a three-dimensional structure similar to that of BCL-xL, which consists of 7 helices that create a hydrophobic pocket for BH3 binding. The interaction of BFL-1 with BAX was seen only when BFL-1 was fused to LexA and BAX to VP16. In the other orientation no interaction was seen in the β-galactosidase liquid assay. This is most probably because of the fact that the interaction requires a conformational change, which in some cases is inhibited by the fusion of the proteins to LexA or VP16. We have seen earlier the same phenomenon with BAX and BCL-xL (27.Simonen M. Keller H. Heim J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The results from the yeast two-hybrid assays prompted us to further identify the domains of BFL-1 necessary for the interaction with BAX. Full-length BFL-1 and seven different BFL-1 truncations (M1–M7, Fig. 3 A) were synthesized separately in an in vitrotranscription-translation TNT system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Fig. 3 B). The empty vector (pcDNA3.1/His) served as a control. Full-length 6His-tagged human BAX protein was purified from a bacterial expression system. The physical interaction with BAX was assayed by coimmunoprecipitation using an anti-human BAX polyclonal antibody. Fig. 3 Cdemonstrates that BFL-1 and the truncations M1, M3, and M5 could be coimmunoprecipitated with BAX, indicating that these truncations interacted with BAX. The common domains of the truncations M1, M3, and M5 were BH1 and domains B and C (helix 2 and 3; see Fig. 1). However, BH1 alone (M7) or domains B and C alone (M6) did not show any interaction (Fig. 3 C). Also the control protein did not bind to BAX. Therefore, the minimal domains of BFL-1 that were required for its interaction with BAX were BH1 plus domains B and C. These domains form the majority of the hydrophobic pocket in BCL-xL that binds the BH3 peptide (33.Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Suppression of apoptosis by BFL-1 was studied in REF52 cells, which undergo apoptosis upon serum deprivation (29.Yao R. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 343-345PubMed Google Scholar), round up at an early apoptotic stage and detached from the surface of the dish (27.Simonen M. Keller H. Heim J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DNAs coding for full-length BFL-1 and for truncation M5 were cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector. The BFL-1 constructs were transfected into REF52 rat fibroblasts together with a vector (pEGFP-N1) encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP served as marker for successfully transfected cells. 15 h after transfection, the cells were deprived of serum, and 3 h later apoptotic REF52 cells were counted. Fig.4 shows that after 3 h of serum deprivation, about 50% of cells transfected with the control plasmid (pcDNA3) were apoptotic. Approximately 20 and 10% of the transfected cells could be rescued by BCL-xL and BFL-1 expression, respectively, whereas the expression of BAX increased apoptosis by 25%. The truncated BFL-1 construct, M5, which contains BH1 and domains B and C, did not have statistically significant activity in REF52 cells. M5 showed neither protecting nor killing activity. The lack of a cellular effect was not because of low level or short lived M5 protein; the expression level seen on Western blots was not affected by serum deprivation (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in mouse FL5.12 cells, a murine lymphoid progenitor cell line, in which apoptosis is induced by interleukin-3 deprivation (not shown). It has been shown that the expression of BAX prevents cell growth and is lethal in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae (3.Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 169-1"

Previous studies identified clusters of charged residues within VWF domain A1 that were involved in binding GPIb or botrocetin. The contribution of 28 specific residues within these clusters was analyzed by mutating single amino acids to alanine. Binding to a panel of six conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies was decreased by mutations at Asp514, Asp520, Arg552, and Arg611(numbered from the N-terminal Ser of the mature processed VWF), suggesting that these residues are necessary for domain A1 folding. Binding of 125I-botrocetin was decreased by mutations at Arg629, Arg632, Arg636, and Lys667. Ristocetin-induced and botrocetin-induced binding to GPIb both were decreased by mutations at Lys599, Arg629, and Arg632; among this group the K599A mutant was unique because 125I-botrocetin binding was normal, suggesting that Lys599 interacts directly with GPIb. Ristocetin and botrocetin actions on VWF were dissociated readily by mutagenesis. Ristocetin-induced binding to GPIb was reduced selectively by substitutions at positions Lys534, Arg571, Lys572, Glu596, Glu613, Arg616, Glu626, and Lys642, whereas botrocetin-induced binding to GPIb was decreased selectively by mutations at Arg636 and Lys667. The binding of monoclonal antibody B724 involved Lys660 and Arg663, and this antibody inhibits125I-botrocetin binding to VWF. The crystal structure of the A1 domain suggests that the botrocetin-binding site overlaps the monoclonal antibody B724 epitope on helix 5 and spans helices 4 and 5.

These events are mediated by at least two ligand-receptor interactions: von Willebrand factor (VWF)1 binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) and fibrinogen binding to platelet GPIIb-IIIa. VWF does not bind spontaneously to platelets in blood, and its adhesive properties are induced in vivo upon the binding of VWF to subendothelial connective tissue, particularly under conditions of high shear stress that occur in the microcirculation (1.Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). VWF consists of disulfide-linked multimers that are assembled from subunits of ≈ 250 kDa. The VWF multimers range in size from dimers of ≈500 kDa to >10,000 kDa. VWF binds to an N-terminal domain of the GPIbα subunit (2.Handa M. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Roberts J.R. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

Domain A1 extends from Glu497 to Gly716 and contains an intrachain disulfide loop that is defined by the disulfide bond Cys509–Cys695(5.Marti T. Rösselet S.J. Titani K. Walsh K.A.

Ristocetin apparently can bind both to platelets and to VWF (7.Scott A.P. Montgomery R.R. Retzinger G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8149-8155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas botrocetin binds to VWF domain A1 but not to GPIb (8.Andrews R.K. Booth W.J. Gorman J.J. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8317-8326Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). By clustered charged-to-alanine scanning mutagenesis, we have found several clustered mutants of charged residues within VWF-A1 domain showing reduced or increased function (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Several mutations in the two acidic segments Glu497–Arg511 and Arg687–Val698, which contain the Cys509–Cys695 disulfide, resulted in increased binding to GPIb (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations within discontinuous segments including Glu596–Arg616, Arg629–Arg632, and Lys642–Lys645 decreased binding to GPIb, suggesting that several residues within these segments may interact with GPIb. We now have prepared 28 new mutants in which a single charged residue is changed to alanine, and these proteins were used to characterize the binding sites for botrocetin and GPIb. The results suggest that botrocetin and GPIb bind to adjacent sites on the VWF-A1 domain, and the amino acid residues required for ristocetin-induced binding to GPIb are distinct from those required for botrocetin-induced binding.

The mutatedNgoMI-KpnI fragments then were cloned into pSVHVWF1.1 (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Human 293T cells (12.Dubridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.S. Leong P.-M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected by a calcium-phosphate method and recombinant VWF (rVWF) secreted in the medium was harvested and concentrated by ultrafiltration as described (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). VWF antigen was measured by an ELISA using polyclonal rabbit anti-human VWF antibody 082 and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human VWF antibody 226 (DAKO) (13.Tuley E.A. Gaucher C. Jorieux S. Worrall N.K. Sadler J.E. Mazurier C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Multimer analysis was performed as described (14.Raines G. Aumann H. Sykes S. Street A. Thromb. Res. 1990; 60: 201-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The IgG fractions of mAbs NMC-4, AVWF3, 52K2, CLB-RAG34, and CLB-RAG35 were isolated from ascites fluid by chromatography on recombinant protein A-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding was assessed by ELISA using microtiter plates with U-shaped bottoms (Coster, Cambridge, MA). Plates were coated with 25 μl of each mAb (7.5 μg/ml) in 0.1 msodium carbonate, pH 9.6, for 24 h at 4 °C. The wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with various concentrations of wild type or mutant rVWF diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The wells were washed again and incubated with antibody 226 diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin color development witho-phenylenediamine, and the absorbance at 490 nm was determined. Binding of rVWF mutants was determined at a fixed concentration of rVWF (500 ng/ml) and normalized to the value obtained for wild type rVWF in paired assays. Negative control assays were performed by using concentrated conditioned medium from mock-transfected 293T cells. Botrocetin binding to VWF was assayed according to methods of Fujimura et al. (15.Fujimura Y. Titani K. Usami Y. Suzuki M. Oyama R. Matsui T. Fukui H. Sugimoto M. Ruggeri Z.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as described previously (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The assay was performed using anti-VWF mAb 33E12 that binds to the C-terminal region of the VWF subunit. It has no effect on VWF binding to platelets in the presence of either ristocetin or botrocetin (16.Mazurier C. Gaucher C. Jorieux S. Parquet G.A. Goudemand M. Br. J. Haematol. 1990; 76: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In brief, botrocetin was radioiodinated with 125I using a chloramine-T method (17.Hunter W.M. Grenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). Microtiter plates were coated with 25 μl of 33E12 (7.5 μg/ml) for 16 h at 4 °C. The wells were washed, blocked, and incubated with 15 μl of each rVWF mutant (5 μg/ml) for 3 h at room temperature. The wells were washed again, and 5 μl of125I-labeled botrocetin solution was added for 30 min at room temperature. Following rapid washing, air dried wells were excised and the bound radioactivity was measured by γ spectroscopy. Nonspecific binding was obtained by assaying culture supernatant from mock-transfected cells, and specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific from total binding. Values for mutant proteins at 3 μg/ml of 125I-botrocetin were normalized to paired values for wild type rVWF. mAb B724 was assayed for ability to inhibit 125I-botrocetin binding to VWF. Microtiter plates coated with mAb 33E12 were incubated with wild type rVWF or mutant K599A. 125I-botrocetin (3 μg/ml), and the indicated amount of mAb B724 or control mouse IgG (DAKO) was added and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, the bound radioactivity was measured as described above. The observed botrocetin binding was normalized to the value obtained in the absence of competing IgG. Assays were performed as described previously (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To assay botrocetin-induced binding of VWF to GPIb, 570 ng/ml of rVWF was mixed with 2 × 108/ml of lyophilized human platelets (Biodata, Hatboro, PA) and incubated with various concentrations (0–10 μg/ml) of botrocetin. After 30 min at room temperature, the VWF antigen present in the centrifuged supernatant was measured by ELISA. Data for botrocetin concentrations bracketing the midpoint of the dose response curve (2, 3, and 6 μg/ml) were pooled for statistical analysis. To assay ristocetin-induced binding of VWF to GPIb, 500 ng/ml of rVWF was mixed with 2 × 108/ml of platelets, 4% bovine serum albumin, and various concentrations (0–1.5 mg/ml) of ristocetin (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). After 30 min at room temperature, the VWF in the centrifuged supernatant was measured by ELISA. Reaction mixtures without platelets were tested simultaneously to verify the absence of nonspecific VWF flocculation and sedimentation in the presence of ristocetin. The unbound VWF was expressed as a percentage of the values obtained with no modulators, and the percentage of bound VWF was calculated by subtraction from 100%. The percentage of bound VWF was normalized to the paired value obtained for wild type rVWF assayed concurrently. Data at 1.5 mg/ml ristocetin were used for statistical analysis. Means and S.D. were calculated by standard methods. Confidence intervals (p < 0.05) for the means were estimated using the t distribution where the interval is given by the means ± S.D. ×t/(n)0.5. Connelly surface plots of the VWF A1 domain were prepared with the program INSIGHT II (Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA). Schematic drawings of secondary structure elements of domain A1 were prepared with the program MOLSCRIPT (18.Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). In a previous study by charged-to-alanine scanning mutagenesis, we identified 6 single mutants and 13 clustered mutants with defects in binding to either botrocetin or platelet GPIb. From these data, the binding site for botrocetin or GPIb required amino acid residues within four segments of the VWF-A1 domain: 514–534, 549–552, 596–645, and 663–667 (Fig. 1) (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Other reports suggested that binding to GPIb and heparin required residues within the segment 569–573 (19.Sobel M. Soler D.F. Kermode J.C. Harris R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8857-8862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and preliminary studies indicated that monoclonal antibody B724 (20.Christophe O. Rouault C. Obert B. Pietu G. Meyer D. Girma J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) did not bind to construct (656–660)2A. We further studied these six segments by constructing 28 additional single charged-to-alanine mutations (Fig. 1). Human kidney 293T cells were transfected with each mutant construct, and serum-free media were analyzed for the expression of rVWF. All 28 mutants were expressed and secreted efficiently. The multimer distribution of all mutant proteins was similar to that of wild type rVWF and plasma VWF; in every case, at least 12 multimer bands were detected (data not shown). The folding of the A1 domain with each rVWF protein was evaluated with a panel of six conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies: NMC-4 (21.Mohri H. Fujimura Y. Shima M. Yoshioka A. Houhgten R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17901-17904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22.Fujimura Y. Usami Y. Titani K. Niinomi K. Nishio K. Takase T. Yoshioka A. Fukui H. Blood. 1991; 77: 113-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), AvWF3 (23.Schullek J. Jordan J. Montgomery R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), CLB-RAG34, CLB-RAG35 (24.Stel H.V. Sakariassen K.S. Scholte B.J. Veerman E.C. van der Kwast T.H. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. van Mourik J.A. Blood. 1984; 63: 1408-1415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), B724 (20.Christophe O. Rouault C. Obert B. Pietu G. Meyer D. Girma J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and 211A6 (25.Jorieux S. de Romeuf C. Samor B. Goudemand M. Mazurier C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 57: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Recognition of domain A1 by these antibodies is impaired by reduction or denaturation. Antibody 52K2 reacts with both reduced and nonreduced forms of VWF (21.Mohri H. Fujimura Y. Shima M. Yoshioka A. Houhgten R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17901-17904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was used as a control. For each antibody, the absorbance value obtained for each mutant rVWF was expressed as a percentage of the value obtained for wild type rVWF (Fig.2). All rVWF proteins displayed normal binding to mAb 52K2. Concentrated conditioned medium from mock transfected cells gave no signal with any of these antibodies. Mutants D514A, D520A, R552A, and R611A showed markedly decreased binding to all six conformation-dependent mAbs (Fig. 2), suggesting that these substitutions cause significant misfolding of the A1 domain. Therefore, although further ligand binding data were obtained for these proteins, the results were excluded from additional interpretation. In fact, the binding of this class of mutants to botrocetin and GPIb was reduced >70% in all assays (data not shown). Mutant K534A showed decreased binding to four mAbs (AvWF3, CLB-RAG34, CLB-RAG35, and B724), although it retained nearly normal binding to two others (NMC-4 and 211A6). Thus, Lys534 is at least required for the presentation of epitopes for several antibodies and may be important to maintain the normal conformation of the A1 domain. Other substitutions caused relatively selective defects in mAb binding. For example, at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml mutant rVWF, binding to mAb B724 was decreased markedly by the mutations K660A and R663A (Fig.2). These mutants showed normal binding to all other antibodies. Dose response binding curves illustrate the substantial decrease in affinity caused by the substitution K660A or R663A (Fig.3) and suggest that the epitope of mAb B724 includes the side chains of Lys660 and Arg663. Similarly, binding of mAb NMC4 was reduced selectively by the substitution R632A, suggesting that its epitope contains the side chain of Arg632. Previous charged-to-alanine mutagenesis studies suggested that several amino acid residues of VWF domain A1 participate directly in binding to125I-botrocetin, including Arg632, Arg636, and residues in the segments Lys642–Lys645 and Arg663–Lys667 (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, clustered mutations in other segments decreased binding to botrocetin, but their significance was uncertain because these mutations also impaired binding to mAb NMC4 so that protein misfolding could not be excluded (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To address this uncertainty, additional rVWF mutants were constructed and assayed for binding to 3 μg/ml125I-botrocetin (Fig. 4). At this concentration of botrocetin, binding to VWF is approximately half of the maximum (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15.Fujimura Y. Titani K. Usami Y. Suzuki M. Oyama R. Matsui T. Fukui H. Sugimoto M. Ruggeri Z.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Four previously constructed proteins that had shown decreased binding to GPIb or botrocetin were included as well: K534A, E626A, R632A, and R636A. Four mutants exhibited decreased binding <60% of wild type rVWF: R629A, R632A, R636A, and K667A. As discussed below, the mutations R629A and R632A also disrupt binding to GPIb induced by ristocetin, whereas the mutations R636A and K667A do not. Therefore, the side chains of Arg636 and Lys667 are specifically required for binding to botrocetin. As reported previously for plasma VWF (20.Christophe O. Rouault C. Obert B. Pietu G. Meyer D. Girma J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), mAb B724 inhibited the binding of botrocetin to immobilized wild type rVWF (data not shown). Although botrocetin binding was markedly reduced by the clustered mutation of four lysine residues in construct (642–645)4A (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the individual mutation of each lysine had a modest effect on binding to botrocetin (Fig. 4), suggesting that no one of these residues makes a substantial contribution to this interaction. Similarly, the clustered mutant (613–616)2A exhibited markedly impaired binding to botrocetin (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but the corresponding single mutants E613A and R616A bound with slightly decreased affinity to botrocetin (Fig. 4). Binding to GPIb was assessed by quantitating the rVWF that bound to formalin-fixed platelets in the presence of ristocetin (1.5 mg/ml) or botrocetin (2–6 μg/ml). In either case, binding to platelets was blocked completely by a mAb 6D1 to platelet GPIb (10.Coller B.S. Peerschke E.I. Scudder L.E. Sullivan C.A. Blood. 1983; 61: 99-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as reported previously (26.Rabinowitz I. Tuley E.A. Mancuso D.J. Randi A.M. Firkin B.G. Howard M.A. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9846-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Values for each mutant protein were normalized to those obtained for control assays of wild type rVWF. The VWF mutants R524A, E529A, E531A, K549A, K569A, D570A, R573A, K608A, D610A, K643A, K644A, K645A, H656A, K660A, R663A, and E666A displayed binding to GPIb that was >60% of wild type rVWF in the presence of ristocetin or botrocetin (Fig. 5). These mutants also showed essentially normal 125I-botrocetin binding (Fig. 4), suggesting that the corresponding amino acid side chains are not directly involved in the interactions of VWF with GPIb, ristocetin, or botrocetin. The mutants R636A and K667A showed decreased botrocetin-induced GPIb binding (Fig. 5) that is consistent with their decreased binding to125I-botrocetin (Fig. 4). However, these proteins retained normal ristocetin-induced GPIb binding (Fig. 5), indicating that the side chains of Arg636 and Lys667 interact with botrocetin but not with GPIb. Alanine substitutions at eight residues (Lys534, Arg571, Lys572, Glu596, Glu613, Arg616, Glu626, and Lys642) decreased ristocetin-induced GPIb binding without affecting botrocetin-induced GPIb binding (Fig. 5) or125I-botrocetin binding (Fig. 4). Therefore, these sites appear to be required for ristocetin-dependent VWF modulation but not for direct interaction with GPIb. Mutation at a residue that directly interacts with GPIb would be predicted to reduce both ristocetin-induced and botrocetin-induced GPIb binding, and three mutants had this phenotype: K599A, R629A, and R632A. Among them, only K599A retained normal binding to125I-botrocetin. Because GPIb and botrocetin can bind simultaneously to VWF, the selective loss of GPIb binding suggests that Lys599 interacts directly with GPIb and not with botrocetin. The mutants R629A and R632A decreased binding to both GPIb and 125I-botrocetin, suggesting that these amino acid side chains could be involved in the binding of both ligands. Crystallographic structures were determined recently for two forms of the VWF A1 domain (27.Celikel R. Varughese K.I. Madhusudan Yoshioka A. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28.Emsley J. Cruz M. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10396-10401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The A1 domain contains a central β-sheet of five parallel strands and one antiparallel strand sandwiched between three α-helices on each side (Fig.6). A disulfide bond at one end of the β-sheet links the N-terminal and C-terminal ends, and the sequence flanking the disulfide bond at the N terminus of the domain lies across its lower surface. These structures provide a framework for interpreting the effects of charged-to-alanine mutations on ligand binding. K599A was the only VWF A1 mutant that retained normal binding to botrocetin and lost both ristocetin-induced and botrocetin-induced binding to GPIb. This specific effect suggests that the GPIb-binding site involves Lys599, which is located in the middle of helix 3 (Fig. 6). The mutations R629A and R632A in the adjacent helix 4 impaired binding to GPIb but also decreased botrocetin binding, suggesting that Arg629 or Arg632 may interact with both GPIb and botrocetin. However, the interpretation of this dual defect is complicated by the strong positive cooperativity between botrocetin and GPIb binding. Because of this linkage, a single mutation in domain A1 might reduce the affinity for both ligands by interfering with allosteric changes rather than by disrupting a common binding site. The mutations R636A and K667A have a simpler phenotype, impairing botrocetin binding (Fig. 4) but not ristocetin-induced binding to GPIb (Fig. 5). The selective effect of these mutations indicates that the botrocetin-binding site is, in fact, adjacent to the GPIb-binding site and spans both helix 4 and helix 5 (Fig. 6). This position for the botrocetin site is supported by the localization of epitopes for two monoclonal antibodies that compete for botrocetin binding, NMC-4 (29.Girma J.P. Takahashi Y. Yoshioka A. Diaz J. Meyer D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and B724 (20.Christophe O. Rouault C. Obert B. Pietu G. Meyer D. Girma J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The crystallographic structure of the complex (27.Celikel R. Varughese K.I. Madhusudan Yoshioka A. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) shows that the NMC-4 Fab fragment interacts directly with the amino acid side chains of Arg629, Arg632, and Arg636 of helix 4 in the VWF A1 domain (Fig. 6). The mutation R632A decreased the binding of NMC-4 (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) and is compatible with the location of the NMC-4 epitope. The binding sites for NMC-4 and botrocetin therefore both appear to contain Arg636, and this overlap explains their competitive interaction with VWF (Fig. 6). The proximity of the NMC-4 epitope to the proposed GPIb site involving Lys599 also is consistent with the ability of NMC-4 to inhibit the binding of VWF to platelets (22.Fujimura Y. Usami Y. Titani K. Niinomi K. Nishio K. Takase T. Yoshioka A. Fukui H. Blood. 1991; 77: 113-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Girma J.P. Takahashi Y. Yoshioka A. Diaz J. Meyer D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast to NMC-4, antibody B724 does not prevent the binding of VWF to platelets in the presence of ristocetin (20.Christophe O. Rouault C. Obert B. Pietu G. Meyer D. Girma J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that its epitope is distant from the GPIb site but close to the botrocetin site. This conclusion is supported by the results of mutagenesis (Fig. 2), which indicate that the B724 epitope contains residues Lys660 and Arg663 on helix 5 (Fig. 6). The adjacent residue Lys667 contributes to the botrocetin-binding site and probably accounts for the ability of B724 to inhibit botrocetin binding to VWF (20.Christophe O. Rouault C. Obert B. Pietu G. Meyer D. Girma J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results suggest a model for the location of several binding sites on the VWF A1 domain (Fig. 6). Platelet GPIbα interacts with a site that includes Lys599 within helix 3. Botrocetin binding requires residues in both helices 4 and 5 that are within or adjacent to the epitopes for NMC-4 and B724, respectively. NMC-4 binds to helix 4 at a site that is sufficiently close to the GPIb site to prevent the binding of VWF to platelets. Antibody B724 binds to helix 5 at a site too remote to interfere with GPIb binding. All of these binding sites involve helices that are on the same side of the central β-sheet within the VWF A1 domain. Mutations that abolish the modulation of VWF activity by ristocetin frequently preserve modulation by botrocetin, and this phenotype indicates that ristocetin and botrocetin promote VWF binding to GPIb by fundamentally different mechanisms. Eight VWF mutations (K534A, R571A, K572A, E596A, E613A, R616A, E626A, and K642A) caused a selective decrease in ristocetin-induced binding to platelets. A few patients with severe bleeding and von Willebrand disease type 2M have plasma VWF with a similar phenotype. In three such cases, mutations within the A1 domain have been characterized by expression studies: G561S, F606I, and I662F (26.Rabinowitz I. Tuley E.A. Mancuso D.J. Randi A.M. Firkin B.G. Howard M.A. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9846-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30.Hillery C.A. Mancuso D.J. Sadler J.E. Ponder J.W. Jozwiak M.A. Christopherson P.A. Gill J.C. Scott J.P. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other patients with VWD type 2M, candidate mutations were identified that involve residues also implicated by alanine mutagenesis, including deletion of Lys642 and E596K (31.Meyer D. Fressinaud E. Gaucher C. Lavergne J.M. Hilbert L. Ribba A.S. Jorieux S. Mazurier C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ristocetin induces VWF to bind platelets is not understood. All but three of the mutations that selectively impair ristocetin-induced binding to GPIbα are on the same side of the central β-sheet as the binding sites for GPIbα and botrocetin. Because botrocetin remains capable of inducing high affinity binding to platelets, the affected amino acid residues are not required for binding to GPIbα. Instead they may be required for ristocetin binding or contribute to binding under conditions of fluid shear stress, or mutations at these positions may prevent conformational changes induced by ristocetin. The five residues known to be mutated in patients with VWD type 2M (Gly561, Glu596, Phe606, Lys642, and Ile662) are particularly important for the biological function of the GPIb-binding site in vivo. They are distributed around Lys599(Fig. 7), and mutations at these positions could prevent the normal exposure of the GPIb-binding site during platelet adhesion. A remarkable subtype of VWD, referred to as type 2B, is characterized by mutant VWF that has increased affinity for platelet GPIbα. In vivo, the larger VWF multimers bind spontaneously to platelets and are cleared from the circulation. The remaining small VWF multimers do not function normally, and the patients bleed. Mutations that cause VWD type 2B are known to affect 15 amino acid residues in the VWF A1 domain (32.Ginsburg D. Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 33.Holmberg L. Dent J.A. Schneppenheim R. Budde U. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin.

Interestingly, all of these residues are located on the side opposite the GPIb-binding site, which includes Lys599. The cluster of VWD type 2B mutations appears to mark the location of a regulatory site that normally inhibits the binding of domain A1 to GPIbα. Mutations affecting the regulatory site can relieve this inhibition and cause the constitutive binding that characterizes VWD type 2B (9.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2068422078,"The transactivator protein Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type I plays an important role in the development of adult T-cell leukemia probably through modulation of growth regulatory molecules including p16INK4a. The molecular mechanism of leukemogenesis induced by Tax has yet to be elucidated. We analyzed Tax function in the cell cycle using an interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent human T-cell line (Kit 225) that can undergo cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase by deprivation of IL-2. Tax activated endogenous E2F activity in IL-2-starved Kit 225 cells, resulting in activation of E2F site-carrying promoters of genes involved in G1 to S phase transition in a cell type-dependent and p16INK4a-independent manner. The ability of Tax mutants to activate E2F coincided with that to activate nuclear factors κB and AT, sole expression of which, however, did not activate E2F, suggesting involvement of another pathway in activation of E2F. Introduction of Tax by a recombinant adenovirus induced cell cycle progression to G2/M phase in resting Kit 225 cells accompanied by endogenous cyclin D2 gene expression. Similarly, Tax-induced cell cycle progression was seen with peripheral blood lymphocytes prestimulated with phytohemagglutinin. Analyses with Tax mutants did not allow Tax-induced cell cycle progression to be differentiated from Tax-dependent activation of E2F, suggesting that Tax induces cell cycle progression presumably through activation of E2F. Nevertheless, infection with an E2F1-expressing virus, which is sufficient for induction of S phase in serum-starved fibroblasts, was not sufficient for either E2F activation or cell cycle progression in IL-2-starved Kit 225 cells, implying differential regulation of E2F activation and cell cycle progression in T-cells that is activated by Tax."
https://openalex.org/W2040843438,"It has been suggested that the major function of DNA topoisomerase I in Escherichia coli is to suppress the formation of R-loops, which could inhibit growth. Although the currently available data suggest that the inhibitory effect of R-loops is exerted at the level of gene expression, this has never been demonstrated. In the present report, we show that rRNA synthesis is significantly impaired at the level of transcription elongation in a bacterial strain lacking DNA topoisomerase I. We found that this inhibition is due to transcriptional blocks. RNase H overproduction is also shown to considerably reduce the extent of such transcriptional blocks during rRNA synthesis. Moreover, one of these transcriptional blockage sites is located within a region where extensive R-loop formation was previously shown to occur on a plasmid DNA in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I. Together, these results allow us to propose that an important function of DNA topoisomerase I is to inhibit the formation of R-loops, which may otherwise translate into roadblocks for RNA polymerases. Our results also highlight the potential regulatory role of DNA supercoiling at the level of transcription elongation.

Our results also highlight the potential regulatory role of DNA supercoiling at the level of transcription elongation. nucleotide(s) Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I, a member of the type IA family of topoisomerases, specifically relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA (1.Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 2.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). This specificity is explained by the fact that this enzyme binds to the junction of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA regions. DNA opening, and hence the generation of single-stranded DNA regions, is promoted by negative but not positive supercoiling. Hot spots for relaxation by DNA topoisomerase I are provided during transcription elongation in the frame of the twin-domain model (3.Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar). Indeed, very high levels of negative supercoiling can be generated behind the moving RNA polymerase during transcription elongation (4.Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 5.Tsao Y.P. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). An R-loop, in which the template strand is paired with the nascent RNA, leaving the nontemplate strand unpaired, also provides a hot spot for relaxation by this enzyme (6.Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The accumulated evidence over the last few years has allowed us to conclude that a major function of DNA topoisomerase I in E. coli is to inhibit R-loop formation during transcription elongation. Indeed, the growth problem of topA (encoding DNA topoisomerase I) null mutants was shown to be partially corrected by overproducing RNase H, an enzyme that degrades the RNA moiety of an R-loop (7.Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A correlation was also established between the level of DNA gyrase activity, the enzyme that introduces negative supercoiling within the chromosomal DNA, and the amount of RNase H required to stimulate the growth of topA null mutants (7.Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and to inhibit R-loop formation during transcription (8.Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16659-16664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The finding that severaltopA null mutants carry compensatory gyrmutations (in gyrA or gyrB) that reduce DNA gyrase activity and correct their growth defect (9.DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 10.Pruss G.J. Manes S.H. Drlica K. Cell. 1982; 31: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) was therefore explained by the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase, which promotes R-loop formation (7.Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). On the contrary, DNA topoisomerase I activity inhibits R-loop formation. The results of in vitroexperiments very well support this model in which DNA topoisomerases with opposing enzymatic activities control the formation of growth-inhibitory R-loops (6.Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11.Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). More recent data have suggested that local supercoiling generated during transcription, rather than global supercoiling, which reflects the average superhelical density of all supercoiling domains, is responsible for R-loop formation and hence is linked to the essential function of DNA topoisomerase I (8.Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16659-16664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13.Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16654-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which R-loop formation exerts its growth inhibitory effects is still unknown. The fact that topA null mutants are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions (7.Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 14.Dorman C.J. Lynch A.S. Ni Bhriain N. Higgins C.F. Mol.

For example, the finding that RNase H overproduction allowstopA null mutants to more rapidly adapt to fresh media and to nutritional shift-ups, may suggest that R-loops inhibit the expression of genes required for such growth transitions (7.Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17.Massé E. Drolet M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have shown previously that R-loop formation can occur during transcription of a DNA fragment carrying a portion of therrnB operon on a plasmid DNA, in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I (12.Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that it is during nutritional shift-up conditions that E. coli cells have the highest requirement for rRNA synthesis (encoded byrrn operons; Ref. 18.Condon C. Liveris D. Squires C. Schwartz I. Squires C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4152-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this report, we present data suggesting that R-loop formation inhibits rRNA synthesis at the level of transcription elongation. Our results allow us to propose that DNA topoisomerase I can act as a transcription elongation factor that inhibits R-loop-dependent transcriptional blocks. These findings can have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanism(s) by which DNA topoisomerases and DNA supercoiling influence gene expression.

When needed, ampicillin was added to 50 μg/ml, tetracycline to 10 μg/ml, and kanamycin to 27.5 μg/ml. Overnight cultures were diluted 1/50 in fresh medium supplemented with cold thymidine at 1 μg/ml and then grown to an A 600 of 0.4. Cells were transferred to 27 °C and incubated for the times indicated in the legends to figs. 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Pulse labeling was initiated by adding 24 μCi of [3H]uridine (stock solution at 57 Ci/mmol) to 1.8 ml of cell culture. Total RNA was extracted from 600 μl of cell culture after 3, 5, and 8 min of pulse labeling by a modified version of the hot-phenol procedure of Aiba et al. (23.Aiba H. Adhya S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11905-11910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of being recovered by centrifugation, the cells were directly treated with the lysis solution containing the various ingredients at the required amount to yield the final concentration used in the original protocol. The purified RNA was resuspended in 20 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated deionized water and stored at −70 °C. One μg of the RNA samples was analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.2% denaturing agarose gel containing formaldehyde as described (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual . Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was photographed under UV light. In order to reveal the 3H-labeled rRNA, the gels were treated for fluorography with EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and exposed to x-ray films (RX, Fuji). One μg of the RNA samples was used for primer extension by using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostic) at 42 °C according to published procedures (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual . Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Primer d(GGGTGTGCATAATACGCC) was used in all the experiments; it allows the detection of RNA initiated at the P1 promoter of all E. coli rrn operons. The products of the primer extension experiments were precipitated and loaded on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. RNA samples extracted as described above were loaded on 1.2% denaturing agarose gels containing formaldehyde (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual . Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were photographed under UV light. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridization took place according to published procedures (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual . Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probe (138 base pairs), covering a portion of the leader rRNA, was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using pNO1302 DNA (25.Jinks-Robertson S. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Cell. 1983; 33: 865-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and two oligonucleotides with the sequences d(GGAACAACGGCAAACACG) and d(GCCGCTTCGCTTTTTCTC). Following hybridization, the nylon membranes were washed according to conventional procedures (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual . Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and exposed to x-ray films (RX, Fuji). To evaluate the impact of the loss of DNA topoisomerase I activity on rRNA synthesis, two isogenic strains carrying a Ts gyrB allele were used. One of these strains, MA251, also carries thetopA20::Tn10 allele and is therefore totally deprived of topoisomerase I activity. The combination of these two alleles was used previously to reveal the link between R-loop formation and growth inhibition in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I (7.Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Indeed, such a topA null mutant is able to grow at 37 °C because DNA gyrase activity is low enough to compensate for the absence of DNA topoisomerase I, therefore reducing R-loop formation to a tolerable level for the cell. As the temperature decreases, DNA gyrase becomes more active in promoting R-loop formation (8.Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16659-16664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). RNase H overproduction was shown to significantly improve the growth of thistopA null mutant below 37 °C, down to 27 °C (7.Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To measure the synthesis rate of mature 16 S rRNA and 23 S rRNA, total RNA was pulse-labeled for short periods of time with [3H]uridine. Such experiments could reveal defects at the level of transcription and/or at the level of rRNA maturation. The ratio of the promoter distal 23 S rRNA to the promoter proximal 16 S rRNA (see Fig. 1 for a schematic drawing of an rrn operon) synthesized in these experiments could also reveal problems during transcription elongation and/or differences in the rate of 16 S and 23 S rRNA maturation. The pulse labeling of total RNA of cells growing at 37 °C revealed no significant differences in rRNA synthesis rates, nor in the ratio of the distal (23 S) to proximal (16 S) rRNA, between MA249 (gyrB(Ts)) and MA251 (gyrB(Ts)topA20::Tn10) (data not shown). The next series of pulse-labeling experiments was performed with cells exposed to 27 °C, a nonpermissive temperature for the growth of MA251. In order to show that our approach can indeed be used to reveal problems at the level of transcription elongation, we included a pair of isogenic strains, K37 and K450. The latter carries thenusB5 mutation and was shown previously to be defective in antitermination of rRNA transcription (26.Sharrock R.A. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5275-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One consequence of such a defect is an increase in both rRNA transcription initiation and in the rate of 16 S rRNA synthesis (26.Sharrock R.A. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5275-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pulse labelings were performed for 3, 5, and 8 min. In our hands, shorter pulse-labeling times were shown to be insufficient to reveal a significant amount of labeled mature rRNAs (data not shown). This indicates that any difference observed in the amounts of mature rRNA synthesized following a 3-min pulse labeling cannot be attributed to mature rRNA degradation but must rather be attributed to alterations in rRNA synthesis rates (transcription and/or maturation). K37 and K450 cells were grown at 37 °C to anA 600 of 0.4, at which time they were exposed to 27 °C for 20 min. Pulse labelings with [3H]uridine for 3, 5, and 8 min were then performed. As shown previously (26.Sharrock R.A. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5275-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), our results indicate that the 16 S rRNA synthesis rate is higher in thenusB5 mutant as compared with the rate in the isogenicnusB + strain (Fig.2 B, pulse-labeled rRNA and 2C, ratio of 23 S rRNA to 16 S rRNA). Our experimental approach is therefore appropriate to reveal defects in rRNA synthesis at the level of transcription elongation. Results presented in Fig. 2 also show that the rRNA synthesis rate is significantly reduced when thetopA null mutant is exposed to 27 °C (compare MA249 and MA251). Densitometry analysis reveals that the topA null mutant (MA251) synthesized at least three times less 23 S rRNA after a 5-min pulse labeling compared with the isogenic MA249 strain (data not shown). It can also be seen that the ratio of 23 S to 16 S rRNA synthesis rates is significantly reduced in the topA null mutant (Fig. 2 C, compare MA249 and MA251). Fig. 2 also shows that RNase H overproduction in the topA null mutant (MA251/pSK760) restores both the rRNA synthesis rate (Fig.2 B, compare MA251 and MA251/pSK760) and the 23 S to 16 S ratio (Fig. 2 C, compare MA251 and MA251/pSK760). These results suggest that R-loop formation during rRNA synthesis causes a defect at the level of transcription initiation or elongation and/or at the level of rRNA maturation. Primer extension analysis with an oligonucleotide (Fig. 1) annealing to the usually unstable leader rRNA (27.Sarmientos P. Sylvester J.E. Contente S. Cashel M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1337-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28.Gafny R. Cohen S. Nachaliel N. Glaser G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29.Aviv M. Giladi H. Oppenheim A.B. Glaser G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 71-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reveals that the drop in the rRNA synthesis rate in thetopA null mutant cannot be attributed to a reduction in transcription initiation. In fact, results presented in Fig.3 may suggest that transcription initiation is increased in the topA null mutant not overproducing RNase H (compare MA249, MA251, and MA251/pSK760). As shown before (26.Sharrock R.A. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5275-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it can also be seen that rRNA transcription initiation is increased in the nusB5 mutant (Fig. 3, compare K37 and K450). In agreement with the negative feedback model for the regulation of rRNA synthesis, rRNA transcription is initiated more frequently to compensate for a defect at the level of transcription elongation in the nusB5 mutant (26.Sharrock R.A. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5275-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30.Gourse R.L. Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Appleman J.A. Ross W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 645-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A similar hypothesis could also be made to explain the results obtained with thetopA null mutant. This question is addressed in the next section.Figure 2rRNA synthesis rate in a topAnull mutant at a nonpermissive temperature. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.4 as indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” transferred to 27 °C, and incubated for 10 (MA249), 20 (K37 and K450), or 40 min (MA251 and MA251/pSK760).

Microbiol. 1990; 44: 105-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In normal cells, only 1–2% of rRNA is present as long precursors. A reduction in the mature rRNA synthesis rate could possibly be explained by a defect in one or more of the several steps required for full rRNA maturation. However, if this were happening, large rRNA precursors should be easily detected, which is not the case here for the topA null mutant (Fig. 2and data not shown). The first step in the maturation process is the removal of the leader rRNA (180 nucleotides long) that occurs once the 16 S rRNA sequence has been fully transcribed. This step is triggered by the formation of an appropriate secondary structure involving both a 5′ end and a 3′ end portion of the 16 S rRNA precursor (Fig.4). Cleavage by RNase III follows and both the leader rRNA and the 16 S rRNA precursor are released. The leader rRNA is rapidly degraded, and the large 16 S rRNA precursor is quickly maturated. Therefore, in order to search for prematurely terminated rRNAs or for transcriptional blocks (which reflect blocked RNA polymerases), it was necessary to use a DNA probe covering no more than the leader rRNA region. In this manner, either not entirely transcribed 16 S rRNA or the cleaved leader rRNA could be detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). Aliquots of total RNA extracted for the experiments shown in Fig. 2 and3 were probed with a DNA fragment covering a portion of the leader rRNA (see under “Experimental Procedures”) in a Northern blot experiment. Results shown in Fig. 5reveal the presence of at least four different hybridization signals. One of them, the shortest RNA detected, with roughly 180 nucleotides, probably corresponds to the leader rRNA region. The amount of this short RNA species detected in each strain matches very well with the intensity of the primer extension signal revealed by using an oligonucleotide complementary to a portion of the leader rRNA region (Fig. 3). The longest RNA detected, roughly 2000 nt1 in length, may represent unprocessed 16 S rRNA that was prematurely terminated. This rRNA is easily detected in the nusB5 mutant that was previously shown to be defective in transcription antitermination during rRNA synthesis (26.Sharrock R.A. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5275-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two significant hybridization signals, corresponding roughly to 550- and 1200-nt RNAs in size, were detected in RNA samples extracted from topA null mutants, irrespective of the level of RNase H activity (MA251 and MA251/pSK760). These RNA species were also detected, albeit in much smaller amounts, when the topAnull mutants were grown at 37 °C (data not shown). Interestingly, the 3′ end of the shorter one (550 nt) is situated within a region where extensive R-loop formation was previously shown to occur upon transcription on a plasmid DNA in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I (12.Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These two RNAs most likely reflect prematurely terminated RNAs or transcriptional blocks (Fig. 4). Our primer extension analysis with RNA extracted from topAnull mutants not overproducing RNase H shows that the leader rRNA signal is stronger when the RNA is extracted from cells exposed for longer periods of time to 27 °C (data not shown). This can be taken as an indication that one or several stable RNA(s) are accumulating with time. This could reflect transcriptional blocks with the 3′ RNA ends within blocked RNA polymerases being protected from degradation, rather than prematurely terminated RNAs, with freed 3′ ends that are rapidly degraded (Fig. 4). Moreover, when a Northern blot experiment is performed with RNA samples extracted from cells exposed to 27 °C for various lengths of time, it can be seen that the distribution of the hybridization signals is modified (Fig.6). Indeed, it is apparent that upon longer exposition of the cells to 27 °C, the hybridization signals are shifted toward the shorter RNAs, and therefore toward the 5′ proximal region. Similar results were also obtained with a bacterial strain in which the topA gene is deleted (RFM475, Ref. 7.Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar; data not shown). It is also obvious that this shift is more severe when the topA null mutant do not overproduce RNase H. This may indicate that stable transcriptional blocks are accumulating with time when the level of RNase H activity is too low. The results of experiments described below suggest that this interpretation is most likely correct. To discriminate between transcriptional blocks and prematurely terminated RNAs, we measured the stability of the RNA species carrying the leader rRNA region. RNA stability was measured by adding the transcription initiation inhibitor rifampicin to cells previously exposed to 27 °C for 40 min and thereafter by periodically extracting RNA samples. Primer extension analysis (Fig.7) evaluates the stability of the whole population of RNAs carrying the leader rRNA region, whereas a Northern blot analysis (Fig. 8) measures the stability of every one of these RNAs individually. First of all, the primer extension analysis reveals that the RNA population carrying the leader rRNA in the gyrB(Ts), topA +strain (MA249) is very unstable, its half-life being less than 1 min, as previously shown for the cleaved leader rRNA (Fig. 7 and data not shown; Refs. 27.Sarmientos P. Sylvester J.E. Contente S. Cashel M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1337-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28.Gafny R. Cohen S. Nachaliel N. Glaser G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29.Aviv M. Giladi H. Oppenheim A.B. Glaser G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 71-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this strain, the primer extension analysis reflects the cleaved leader rRNA, because it is the only rRNA species detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5). However, for the isogenictopA null mutant MA251, primer extension analysis shows that the RNA population carrying the leader rRNA region is very stable (Fig.7). In fact, we have found that the primer extension signal is still very strong after 20 min of rifampicin treatment (data not shown). The Northern blot analysis shown in Fig. 8 A reveals that the stable products represent three different RNA species. One has its 3′ end within the leader rRNA region (the strongest signal), and the other two have their 3′ ends situated about 550 or 1200 nt from the P1 promoter initiation site. Considering the very high stability of these RNAs, mostly the one with the 3′ end within the leader rRNA region, we have to conclude that they reflect transcriptional blocks rather than prematurely terminated RNAs. Stable RNA-DNA hybrids are probably involved in transcriptional blocks, because overproducing RNase H renders these RNAs less stable (Figs. 7 and 8, MA249/pSK760). Quantitative evaluations of the half-life of each RNA species (Fig.8 B) reveal that the RNA with the 3′ end within the leader rRNA region is at least six times more stable in the topAnull mutant when RNase H is not overproduced. For the two longer RNAs (∼1200 and 550 nt), the half-life roughly double when RNase H is not overproduced. However, these evaluations may be complicated by the fact that RNA polymerase molecules may progress from 5′ proximal block sites to more distal ones with rifampicin exposition time. The fact that the 5′ proximal block site is more stable than the more distal ones may explain the absence of smears, reflecting a piling up of RNA polymerase molecules, instead of sharp bands in the Northern blots. The results presented in Fig. 9 further illustrate this fact and the high stability of the transcriptional blocks intopA null mutants when RNase H is not overproduced. Indeed, under such conditions, strong hybridization signals were still detected after 30 min of exposition to rifampicin.Figure 8Northern blot analysis to measure the stability of each of the different RNA species initiated at therrn P1 promoter.

Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 10.Pruss G.J. Manes S.H. Drlica K.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), no precise mechanism(s) has been described to explain such a negative effect. One of the first clues that R-loop formation could somehow be involved in this harmful effect came from the results of in vitrostudies in which extensive RNA-DNA hybrids were shown to occur during transcription in the presence of DNA gyrase and in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I (11.Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A key finding was the demonstration that RNase H overproduction can partially complement the growth defect oftopA null mutants (7.Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It was proposed that R-loops could act by triggering inappropriate replication or recombination, such as is suggested to occur in rnhA − mutant (33.Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), or by inhibiting transcription elongation. In the present work, we have shown that transcriptional blocks in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I can be removed by overproducing RNase H. Interestingly, we had previously found that RNase H stimulates the RNA synthesis rate in vitro when a negatively supercoiled template was transcribed (6.Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,12.Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 2E. Massé and M. Drolet, unpublished results. Moreover, one of the transcriptional blocks identified in the present study was found within a region where extensive R-loop formation was observed during in vitro and in vivo transcription on plasmid DNAs in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I (6.Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12.Massé E. Phoenix P. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12816-12823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Together, these observations allow us to propose that the R-loops generated due to the absence of DNA topoisomerase I constitute roadblocks for RNA polymerases. In our model, the nascent RNA invades the template DNA strand behind a moving RNA polymerase, to form an R-loop (Fig.10, 1). This R-loop constitutes a roadblock for the next transcribing RNA polymerases (Fig.10, 2). For the moment, we can only speculate on what the real effects of such transcriptional blocks are on the growth oftopA null mutants, although RNase H overproduction strongly stimulates their growth at 27 °C (7.Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Moreover, because our experimental approaches did not allow to discriminate between the seven different rrn operons of E. coli, we cannot draw a conclusion about the involvement of each of these operons separately, in transcriptional blockage. The fact that a topA null mutant synthesizes at least three times less 23 S rRNA than an isogenictopA + strain during a 5-min pulse-labeling experiment leads us to believe that the observed transcriptional blocks contribute to the growth rate reduction in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I. This is also supported by our finding that the growth of a topA null mutant overproducing RNase H at 27 °C can be further improved by increasing the number of rrn operons per cell. 3M. Drolet and C. Hraiky, unpublished results. This is accomplished by introducing a multicopy plasmid carrying a fully activerrn operon (rrnB) within the topA null mutant. The transcriptional blocks identified within rrn operons seem to be very stable. This is suggested by the results of both primer extension and Northern blot analysis performed with RNA extracted from cells exposed to rifampicin. Indeed, a strong signal was still detected by Northern blot analysis with a DNA fragment hybridizing to the leader rRNA region after an exposition of 30 min to rifampicin. This high stability is also revealed by the fact that the transcriptional block sites were shifted toward the 5′ proximal region upon prolonged expositions of the topA null cells to 27 °C. This is expected because the accumulation of stable transcriptional blocks in the 5′ proximal region precludes downstream transcriptional activity, and consequently, transcriptional blockage in this downstream region. Moreover, our primer extension experiments show that the stability of the RNA species carrying the leader rRNA increases with the time of exposition of the topA null mutant to 27 °C (data not shown). This also indicates that stable transcriptional blocks are slowly accumulating with time. What could explain such a high stability? If an R-loop alone is involved in transcriptional blockage, such a high stability may seem quite surprising considering the presence of RNase H. It is also possible that the initiated R-loop, immediately behind the moving RNA polymerase, provides a single-stranded DNA region, to which RecA or single-stranded binding protein can bind. Thereafter, this binding may progress with the moving RNA polymerase. Therefore, if RNase H does not act rapidly enough, a very long and stably unwound DNA region may form. Such a structure could possibly block the progression of the next transcribing RNA polymerase. The formation of other RNase H-sensitive stable structures may also be considered. For example, transcription of a long polypurine sequence was shown to favor the formation of a very stable structure that involves the participation of an RNA-DNA hybrid and that inhibits transcription elongation (34.Grabczyk E. Fishman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1791-1797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It will also be interesting to test whether the RNase H-sensitive stable structure can inhibit replication fork movement and, as a consequence, possibly trigger the formation of double-stranded breaks (35.Michel B. Ehrlich S.D. Uzest M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In fact, we had observed previously that the duplication rate of rrn operons can be very high in some topA null mutants.2 In light of the results presented in this report and the pleiotropic effects of topA mutations (32.Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 36.Drlica K. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 273-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Dorman C.J. Ni Bhriain N. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 92-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we must consider the possibility that transcription elongation might be frequently involved, more than previously suspected, in the control of gene expression. To our knowledge, there has been only one report that directly addressed the effect of DNA supercoiling on transcription elongation in vitro (38.Krohn M. Pardon B. Wagner R. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In that work, in vitro transcriptional pausing times within the leader region of the rrnB operon were shown to increase with the level of negative supercoiling of the DNA template. Moreover, new pause sites were revealed at higher negative superhelical densities of the DNA template. Whether a link can be established between these observations and the results reported in the present study remains to be demonstrated. In conclusion, we believe that care must be taken before attributing the effects of DNA supercoiling and DNA topoisomerases on gene expression to transcription initiation. More detailed studies may reveal effects at the level of transcription elongation rather than initiation. We thank Dr. D. I. Friedman for the gift of bacterial strains and Sonia Broccoli for careful reading of the manuscript."

Surface LT is composed of two subunits, LTα and LTβ, arranged as a heterotrimers of either LTα1β2 (major form) or LTα2β1 stochiometry (5.Browning J.L. Dougas I. Ngam-ek A. Bourdon P.R. Ehrenfels B.N.

The LTβ subunit, a type II transmembrane protein, provides the membrane anchor for the ligand and the specificity for binding the LTβR. The LTα subunit contributes primarily to the conformation of the heterotrimer (6.Williams-Abbott L. Walter B.N. Cheung T. Goh C.R. Porter A.G. Ware C.F. J. Biol.

Although these ligands show significant cross-receptor specificity, each cytokine-receptor system plays distinct physiologic roles.

We have identified the structural regions of the LTβR required for TRAF binding and initiation of signaling that activates cell death and gene transcription pathways. A panel of LTβR mutants was characterized that reveal several novel features of LTβR signaling including three discrete regions within a short proline-rich sequence that control TRAF binding and receptor compartmentalization and regulate cell death and NF-κB activation. These mutants should provide useful tools for dissecting the molecular components and pathways involved in physiologic roles dependent on the LTβR. Recombinant human TNF (35.Browning J. Ribolini A.

Human embryonic kidney-293 cell line and its derivative 293T cells, which express the SV40 large T antigen, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All lines routinely tested negative for mycoplasm using a PCR-based assay, the Mycoplasma Primer Set (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Retroviral plasmids directing the expression of the C-terminal truncated mutants of LTβR were constructed by PCR using c-Myc-LTβR-pBABE as a template (29.Force W.R. Cheung T.C. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30835-30840Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All deletion mutants were constructed using the common 5′-primer containing a BglII site, 5′-GACGAGAGATCTCTGGCTTCAGGAGCTGAATA-3′. A different 3′-primer was used for each deletion mutant. Each 3′-primer includes a stop codon and a SalI site. The 3′-primers used were as follows: Δ418, 5′-GGAACGCGTCGAC TTAGTGCTCTGTCTCCGCTAGGTGCCAA-3′; Δ410, 5′-GGAACGCGTCGAC TTAAGCCTTGCCATCTTCCTGGTGGGGTGTA-3′; Δ403, 5′-GGAACGCGTCGAC TTAGGGTGTAGAGAGCCCGGGAGGGCCA-3′; Δ396, 5′-GGAACGCGTCGAC TTAGCCAGGGTCCCCCTCTTCGGGAAT-3′; Δ389, 5′-GGAACGCGTCGAC TTAAATGGGGTATGGAGGTTCGGGGGTA-3′; Δ379, 5′-GGAACGCGTCGAC TTAGAGGTCTCCAGGACCCGGTGGT-3′; Δ369, 5′-GGAACGCGTCGAC TTATACTGGTCCATTGTAGATGTA-3′; Δ359, 5′-GGAACGCGTCGAC TTAAGTGATAGTCATAGACCCGCCGGTGA-3′; Δ345, 5′-GGAACGCGTCGAC TTAACCGTGGGCCACCTGGCTCT-3′. PCR was performed under the following conditions (Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermocycler): an initial 4 min at 94 °C and then 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 80 s at 72 °C followed by a final cycle for 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were generated using 30 ng of template plasmid and 5 units of PfuDNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR products were purified using the Wizard PCR DNA Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI), digested with BglII and SalI, gel-purified and ligated into the BamHI and SalI sites of pBABEpuro. The integrity of the c-Myc-LTβR coding region in each of the pBABEpuro deletion constructs was confirmed by sequencing both strands (ABI PRISM Dye Termination Cycle Sequencing kit) with an automated sequencer (ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer). Moloney retroviral vectors were produced by transfection of the φNX amphotrophic packaging cell line with the desired pBABE-derived construct as described (29.Force W.R. Cheung T.C. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30835-30840Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For production of control virus, φNX cells were transfected with the empty pBABEpuro vector. Virus-containing supernatants were harvested after 48 h of transfection. Infection of the HT29.14s and 293 cell lines was performed as described previously (29.Force W.R. Cheung T.C. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30835-30840Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Infected cells were selected in puromycin, and all assays described were performed within 1–2 weeks following selection. HT29.14s cells were detached from the culture vessel using 20 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed once in PBS, and then incubated with mouse isotype IgG control antibody, mouse anti-c-Myc epitope (9E10, IgG1), or anti-human LTβR (BKA11, IgG1) at 10 μg/ml in 50 μl/well in cold binding buffer (PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.05% sodium azide) for 30 min on ice. After washing three times with cold binding buffer, 50 μl of goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG conjugated to R-phycoerythrin (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) was added to wells and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed as above and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickenson). To detect TRAF3 binding to LTβR in HT29.14s cells or 293T cells, Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (19.VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, HT29.14s cell monolayers containing 107 cells were treated with 1 nm recombinant soluble LTα1β2 for 15 min at 37 °C, or 2 × 105 293T cells transfected 48 h previously were extracted in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with goat anti-LTβR IgG. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the gel was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and TRAF3 was detected with a rabbit anti-TRAF3 antiserum (H122; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-c-Myc (9E10) mAb. Immune complexes were detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The TRAF3 antiserum was used at a 1:1000 dilution and showed no cross-reactivity in Western blots with TRAF1, -2, or -5. Whole cell lysates were prepared by treating cell pellets in 1% SDS buffer with 3% mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.8, for analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot. Molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) were phosphorylase b(106 kDa), bovine serum albumin (81 kDa), ovalbumin (47.5 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (35 kDa), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (28.2 kDa). Cell death in response to cytokines or antibodies was determined by a mitochondria dye reduction assay using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, which detects viable cells as described (37.Green L.M. Reade J.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 70: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). After 3 days, the percentage of cell viability was calculated as a ratio of the dye absorbance (570 nm) by cells cultured with cytokines or antibodies to medium alone. After 3 days in culture, the A 570 for individual lines in medium alone ranged from 1.1 to 1.6. Statistical analysis for calculations of IC50 and significance was calculated with GraphPad Prism and Instat software (San Diego, CA). Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate wells. NF-κB DNA binding interactions were performed by a electrophoretic gel shift assay as described (38.Force W.R. Tillman J.B. Sprung C.N. Spindler S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8863-8871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modification (20.Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) using the κB site in the human immunodeficiency virus-1 enhancer. The composition of the activated NF-κB complex was examined by supershift analysis with antiserum to Rel family members (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). NF-κB-dependent transcription was measured using a luciferase reporter construct (39.DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 293T cells seeded at 5 × 105 cells/35-mm well were transfected by the CaPO4 method. Briefly, 250 μl of precipitate containing 4 μg of LTβR expression plasmid and 0.25 μg of a NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid containing two copies of the consensus κB binding motif was added to the cells for an overnight incubation. Cells were washed once, and fresh growth medium was added for a 24-h incubation. Cells were extracted in 250 μl of lysis buffer (25 mmTris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 7000 × g. Luciferase activity was detected in 50 μl of cell lysate using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA), which automatically injects luciferase assay buffer (20 mmTricine, 1.07 mm (MgCO3)4, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.27 mm coenzyme A, 0.47 mm sodium luciferin) and ATP (200 mm, pH 7.0). All samples were measured in duplicate. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, 293T cells were seeded in eight-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek) at 3 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 18–36 h at 37 °C. For staining, wells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 10 min at room temperature in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldhyde in PBS, pH 7.0, washed twice with PBS, and then permeabilized in methanol for 2 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS and then blocked for 10 min at room temperature in PBS containing 3% BSA. Polyclonal goat anti-LTβR TgG (19.VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), diluted to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml, and mouse anti-FLAG M2 to detect TRAF3 were diluted in PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS/BSA/Triton). Primary antibodies were added to the wells to a final volume of 120 μl/well and incubated in a humidified chamber at room temperature for 1 h. Wells were then washed three times in PBS/BSA/Triton buffer. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in combination with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), were diluted to a final concentration of 1:200 in PBS/BSA/Triton in a final volume of 120 μl/well. Slides were incubated in a humidified chamber at room temperature in the dark for 1 h and then washed three times in PBS/BSA/Triton. The slides were mounted in 80% glycerol in PBS, sealed, and kept at 4 °C in the dark for 1–7 days before visualization. Cells were observed with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope with a krypton/argon ion laser and a 60× Nikon objective. Images were acquired using the LaserSharp operation system and were analyzed and manipulated in Adobe PhotoShop. Empty vector-transfected cells or cells stained with normal goat serum or mouse IgG isotype control were used for negative controls. Neither control exhibited background staining. Representative staining patterns were based on counting 200 cells. Secondary structural prediction for the LTβR cytoplasmic domain was compiled by the Protein Sequence Analysis System (available on the World Wide Web) (40.Stultz C.M. Nambudripad R. Lathrop R.H. White J.V. Protein Structural Biology in Bio-Medical Research: Predicting Protein Structure with Probabilistic Models. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1997Google Scholar). The analysis was conducted on a subsequence of the LTβR, residues Thr242-Asp435 C-terminal of the transmembrane domain, using a type-1 discrete state-space model. The model assumes that the cytoplasmic domain is monomeric, single-domain, globular, and water-soluble and folds into well defined structural domains that do not pack against a hydrophobic surface. The cytoplasmic domain of LTβR is 194 amino acids in length and is predicted to belong to the α-β structural superclass (probability = 0.9797) (Fig. 1,A and B). The polypeptide is predicted to emerge from the membrane as a stretch of ∼120 residues that fold into three discrete helices, interspersed by β strands, which precedes a proline-rich stretch (38%) of 36 residues (Pro367–Pro403), likely to assume an elongated or kinked pedicle. The pedicle is followed by another β-strand conformation and a fourth helix at the C terminus. GlutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins of the LTβR cytoplasmic domain previously indicated that the binding site(s) for TRAF2, -3, and -5 and Hepatitis C virus core protein are all located within residues 338–395, which spans the β-strand and pedicle regions (Ref. 41.Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.-Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.-S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.-Y. Ou J.-H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). A series of mutants were constructed to determine the subregions of the LTβR involved in TRAF binding and cellular responses. LTβR mutants were made that successively truncate the C terminus through the pedicle and into the β-strand region and incorporate an N-terminal c-Myc epitope tag to distinguish mutant from endogenous receptor (Fig.1 C). HT29.14s cells trans-infected with retrovirus vectors expressing the c-Myc-LTβR deletion mutants revealed striking differences in cell surface expression (Fig.2). Cells expressing wild type c-Myc-LTβR showed an ∼2–3-fold increase over endogenous levels of surface LTβR as estimated from the difference in specific fluorescence staining between anti-c-Myc and anti-LTβR mAb used at saturating levels. Deletion through the C-terminal 36 residues (Δ389) showed no significant change in surface expression; however, the Δ379 mutant expressed little or no staining by anti-c-Myc. Furthermore, ∼90% of the endogenous LTβR was also lost from the surface of Δ379 mutant-expressing cells. No evidence was obtained that shedding accounted for the decrease in LTβR expression on the cell surface, indicating that the protein is probably retained intracellular. By contrast, deletion of a further 10 residues (Δ369) led to increased expression on the cell surface of mutant and endogenous LTβR. The Δ359 mutant exhibited an ∼5-fold increase in cell surface expression relative to the Δ369 mutant and ∼3-fold above wild type receptor. In unmodified HT29.14s cells, TRAF3 co-immunoprecipitates with the LTβR after brief treatment of cells with ligand (19.VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast, precipitation with anti-c-Myc revealed that TRAF3 was specifically associated with wild type c-Myc-LTβR independently of LTα1β2 (Fig. 3 A). This result demonstrates that the modest overexpression of c-Myc-LTβR in this cell type is sufficient for ligand-independent TRAF3 recruitment. The Δ415 and Δ403 mutants also associated with TRAF3; however, TRAF3 binding was absent in the Δ345, Δ359, and Δ369 mutants. The Δ415 and Δ403 mutants also associated with TRAF3. However, the Δ379 mutant co-immunoprecipitated with a species of TRAF3 that migrated as a doublet of a lower molecular mass (∼48–55 kDa), indicating that TRAF3 is specifically affected by the Δ379 mutation. The nature of this form of TRAF3 is unknown, but it could represent a proteolytic fragment among other possibilities. The analysis of TRAF3 binding was extended to HEK293 cells, including two additional mutants, Δ396 and Δ389, which showed that TRAF3 binding was specifically lost in Δ389 mutant (Fig. 3 B). This result locates the TRAF3 binding site to residues 389PEEGDP. Expression of LTβR in HEK293 cells monitored by Western blot (Fig.3 C) revealed a single 69-kDa band for wild type receptor and proportionally smaller forms through mutant Δ403. Mutants Δ396 and Δ389 were resolved as a tight doublet in which the smaller form became predominant in mutants Δ379 and Δ369. This suggests that post-translation modification (e.g., glycosylation) of the receptor was affected by the Δ379 mutation. The Δ359 and Δ345 mutants were not detected by blotting, although expression was readily detected on the cell surface by fluorescence staining, indicating that the overall abundance of these two mutants was decreased. The loss of endogenous LTβR from the surface of HT29 cells and the coimmunoprecipitation of LTβR and TRAF3 in the absence of ligand prompted us to investigate the subcellular location of these mutants. LTβR and TRAF3 were investigated in the 293T cell line, wh"

We previously described an octapeptide KP*GEP*GPK within the α(1)III-CB4 fragment that binds to platelets and specifically inhibits platelet aggregation induced by type III collagen. In this study, we demonstrated that the octapeptide prevented platelet contact and spreading on type III collagen and subendothelium under static and flow conditions. Platelets adhered to the immobilized octapeptide, and anti-bodies directed against other platelet collagen receptors (glycoprotein (GP) Ia/IIa, GP IV, p65, p47) did not impair this adhesion. The platelet octapeptide receptor was identified by ligand blotting as a protein doublet with molecular masses of 68 and 72 kDa and does not correspond to any other already known platelet collagen receptors (GP Ia, GP IV GP VI, and p65).

Platelet GP Ia/IIa binds to the α1(III)-CB4 peptide on type III collagen and, more precisely, to a GGPP*GPR sequence (residues 522–528) (6.Morton L.F Peachey A.R. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W.

However, the role of GP Ia/IIa in platelet activation remains poorly understood, as it is not involved in the initial platelet contact (7.Monnet, E., Sizaret, P.

In Particular, platelets react with an octapeptide in type III collagen that is located within the α1(III)-CB4 fragment (residues 497–504). This octapeptide (KP*GEP*GPK) specifically inhibits platelet aggregation induced by type III collagen (21.Legrand Y.J. Karniguian A. Le Francier P. Fauvel F. Caen J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 1579-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22.Karniguian A. Legrand Y.J. Lefrancier P. Caen J.P. Thromb.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and the activation of GP IIb/IIIa (24.Pintigny D. Legrand C. Karniguian A. Legrand Y.J. Caen J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we characterize the role of this octapeptide in platelet contact and spreading on type III collagen and subendothelium under static and flow conditions. The octapeptide recognized a doublet of platelet proteins with molecular mass of 68–72 kDa. The major protein (68 kDa) named TIIICBP (type III collagen-binding protein) is a specific platelet receptor for type III collagen that is involved in the first step of platelet collagen interaction. The octapeptide KP*GEP*GPK was synthesized by Genosphère Biotechnologies (Paris, France). Type I and type III collagens (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were dialyzed overnight against 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and polymerized by heating for 5 min at 33 °C before use. Collagen-chain composition and purity were assessed by SDS-PAGE (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Orthophenylenediamine dihydrochloride and HRP-conjugated streptavidin were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy-Pontoise, France). Biotinylated-convulxin was a generous gift from Dr. M. Jandrot-Perrus (Département d'Hématologie, Hémostase et Thrombose, Hôpital Bichat, Paris, France). Tween 20, Hepes, polylysine, N-ethylmaleimide, and other chemical compounds were from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France). The anti-GP Ia (6F1), anti-p65 and anti-p47, and anti-GP IV (FA6) antibodies were kindly, donated respectively, by Dr. B. S. Coller (Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY), Dr. T. M. Chiang (Veterans Administration Medical Center, Memphis, TN), and Dr. L. Edelman (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). HRP-conjugated antibodies directed against mouse or rabbit immunoglobulins were purchased from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Blood obtained from consenting healthy human donors was anticoagulated with either acid-citrate-dextrose for static assays or 10 units/ml Fraxiparin (Sanofi Winthrop, Toulouse, France) for platelet adhesion under flow conditions. For static assays, platelet-rich plasma and washed platelets were prepared as described previously (26.Fauvel-Lafève F. Meric A. Arbeille B. Tabaka V. Legrand Y.J. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 193-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After the last wash, platelets were resuspended in the appropriate buffers used for adhesion or aggregation Platelet contact with collagen in suspension was evaluated as described elsewhere (26.Fauvel-Lafève F. Meric A. Arbeille B. Tabaka V. Legrand Y.J. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 193-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Platelet adhesion to immobilized collagen or octapeptide was studied according to Tandon et al. (11.Tandon N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adherent platelets were quantified colorimetrically as described by Bellavite et al.(27.Bellavite P. Andrioli G. Guzzo P. Arigliano P. Chirumbolo S. Manzato F. Santonastaso C. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Results are the means of three different experiments run in triplicate (± S.E.). Platelet aggregation was allowed to proceed in an aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp., Harvertown, PA). Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with [14C]5HT (Amersham Life Science, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) and radiolabeled serotonin release was measured as described previously (26.Fauvel-Lafève F. Meric A. Arbeille B. Tabaka V. Legrand Y.J. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 193-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Flow assays were done in parallel flow chambers, as described by Sakariassen et al.(28.Sakariassen K.S. Aarts P.A.M.M. de Groot P.G. Houdijk W.P.M. Sixma J.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1983; 102: 522-535PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen (50 μg/cm2) or octapeptide (50 μg/cm2) was sprayed onto Thermanox coverslips (Nalgen Nunc International, Naperville, IL). HUVEC matrix was obtained after ammonia-induced lysis of confluent cells as described previously (7.Monnet, E., Sizaret, P. Y., Arbeille, B., and Fauvel-Lafève, F. (2000) Thromb. Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). For the negative control, coverslips were sprayed with BSA (50 μg/cm2). Two different shear rates (300 and 1500 s−1) were applied for 5 min at 37 °C. After perfusion, coverslips were washed three times in Hepes buffer. Platelets were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with DiffQuick® (Dade AG, Düdigen, Switzerland). The percentage of the surface covered by platelet was estimated by examining 10 microscope fields with a camera coupled to picture analysis software (Biocom Co., Les Ulis, France). Before measuring platelet adhesion to the octapeptide, platelet suspensions were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with monoclonal antibodies directed against GP Ia/IIa (6F1; 10 μg/ml), GP IV (FA6; 10 μg/ml), anti-p65 (60 μg/ml), or anti-p47 (60 μg/ml) (final concentrations). To inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation in flow experiments, the octapeptide (0.5 or 0.25 mm, final concentration) was added to whole blood and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before the perfusion. The octapeptide was resuspended in PBS at 2 mg/ml. EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) (75 μg/ml, final concentration) was added to the solution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The biotinylated octapeptide was separated from free Sulfo-NHS-Biotin by filtration on a Superose 12 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Washed platelets (4 × 107) were adsorbed by centrifugation (1,200 ×g) onto polylysine (50 μg/ml)-coated wells of microtiter plates. Adsorbed platelets were incubated with biotinylated octapeptide (10–400 μg/ml) in Tyrode's buffer for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with the same buffer. Platelets were further incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1 μg/ml) and washed. The HRP was revealed with orthophenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and the optical density was read at 490 nm. Washed platelets were incubated with the biotinylated octapeptide (50 μg/ml) and with the unlabeled octapeptide (0.75, 1.5, or 3 mg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature in Tyrode's buffer and washed three times in the same buffer. The biotinylated octapeptide bound to the platelet surface was revealed by HRP-streptavidin (1 μg/ml) as above. Platelet proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was saturated with 5% skim milk in TBS, washed in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween), and incubated with biotinylated octapeptide (15 μg/ml), 6F1 (10 μg/ml), anti-p65 antibody (20 μg/ml), or biotinylated convulxin (1 μg/ml). For convulxin, the incubations were performed in PBS or PBS-Tween. The reaction was revealed by HRP-streptavidin (1 μg/ml) or HRP antibodies directed against mouse or rabbit IgG (respectively, at 0.5 or 0.15 μg/ml) HRP was visualized by chemiluminescence on Kodak X-Omat film. Two dimensional electrophoresis was performed using the Bio-Rad system for mini gels. For the first dimension, 50 μg of platelet proteins were loaded onto the agarose gel containing an ampholyte gradient in the pH range of 3–10 (Bio-lyte®, Bio-Rad). For the second dimension, a 7.5% acrylamide gel was used. After the second run, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and TIIICBP was detected with the biotinylated octapeptide as described above. Platelet contact was induced by 20 μg/ml (final concentration) of collagen fibers in suspension. Similar numbers of platelets remained associated with type I or type III collagen fibers (Fig. 1,A and B, 2). Platelet interaction with type III collagen was partially inhibited by 0.25 mm octapeptide (Fig. 1 B, 3), and a quasi-complete inhibition was observed in presence of 0.5 mm octapeptide (Fig. 1 B, 4). In contrast, the contact between platelet and type I collagen (Fig.1 B) was not affected by the octapeptide even at 0.5 mm. Under static conditions, similar numbers of platelets adhered to immobilized type III collagen or octapeptide (Fig.2) and comparable amounts of serotonin (∼50%) were released by adherent platelets. Platelet adhesion to immobilized type III collagen (Fig.3 A) was partially inhibited (44 ± 1%) by 0.25 mm octapeptide (Fig.3 A, 3) ,and inhibition was quasi-complete in the presence of 0.5 mm octapeptide (Fig. 3 A,4). Under these static conditions, fewer platelets adhered to the HUVEC matrix and 66 ± 1.5% and 88 ± 2% inhibition were observed in the presence of, respectively, 25 mm (Fig.3 B, 3) and 0.5 mm octapeptide (Fig.3 B, 4). Studies under flow were performed at two shear rates: 300 and 1500 s−1(Fig. 4, A and B). Under shear conditions, type I and type III collagens were equal potent inducers of platelet adhesion and aggregation (20–25% of the exposed slide surfaces were covered with platelets at high and low shear rates). However, both very dense aggregates and individual scattered adherent platelets were observed on type III collagen (Fig. 4,A and B, 1) while on type I collagen most of the platelets adhered individually and only some them formed small aggregates (Fig. 4, A and B, 7). Under flow conditions, fewer platelets adhered to the octapeptide (7% at 300 s−1 and 13% at 1500 s−1), fewer aggregates were formed, and they appeared to be less densely packed at the higher shear rate (Fig. 4 B, 4) than the lower one (Fig. 4 A, 4). At both shear rates, 0.25 mm octapeptide partially inhibited platelet adhesion (around 50%) and aggregate formation on type III collagen (Fig. 4,A and B, 2) and on octapeptide (Fig.4, A and B, 5). On type III collagen, 0.5 mm octapeptide almost completely prevented platelet adhesion and aggregation at a shear rate of 300 s−1 (Fig.4 A, 3), whereas at 1500 s−1 residual adhesion (5% of the surface covered) and a few aggregates were still observed (Fig. 4 B, 3). In the presence of 0.5 mm octapeptide, platelet adhesion to octapeptide was almost completely inhibited, at both shear rates (Fig. 4, A andB, 6). In contrast, platelet adherence to type I collagen was not inhibited by the octapeptide even at 0.5 mm (Fig. 4, A and B, 8 and9). Binding experiments were performed with the biotinylated-octapeptide. The saturation of the octapeptide binding sites on 4.107 platelets was obtained with a concentration of 200 nm octapeptide. The half-saturation was estimated at a concentration of 35 nmoctapeptide (Fig. 5 A). The specificity of the reaction was established with the unlabeled octapeptide; one molecule of the biotinylated octapeptide was displaced by about 60-fold excess of the unconjugated octapeptide (Fig.5 B). After separation of platelet proteins by SDS-PAGE and ligand blotting, the biotinylated octapeptide bound to two platelet proteins with molecular masses of 68 and 72 kDa (Fig. 6 A). This binding was inhibited by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled peptide (data not shown). After reduction, these proteins presented apparent molecular masses of 73 and 77 kDa, indicating the presence of intrachain disulfide bounds. Using a two-dimensional electrophoresis system, we determined the pHi of both bands. The 68-kDa protein comprised four isoforms with pHi situated between 5.6 and 5.9. The 72-kDa protein had a single form with a pHi of 6.9 (Fig.6 B). Other already known platelet collagen receptors, namely GP VI, p65, and GP Ia, were revealed by ligand and immunoblotting. Antibodies directed against GP Ia or p65 and convulxin, which binds to GP VI, did not recognize the protein doublet (Fig.7 A). Moreover platelet adhesion to the immobilized octapeptide (Fig. 7 B) was not inhibited by different antibodies: anti-p65 (Fig. 7 B,3), anti-p47 (Fig. 7 B, 4), anti-GP IV (Fig. 7 B, 5), and anti-GP Ia (Fig. 7 B,6).Figure 7Comparison between TIIICBP and other collagen receptors. A, ligand and immunoblots. Platelet proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and incubated with the HRP-octapeptide (8P) and HRP-convulxin (1) or anti-p65 antibody (2), or anti-GP Ia antibody (3). The membranes were incubated with an HRP-anti-IgG antibody, and the bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence.

Legrand Y.J. Kuhn K. Bentz H. Fietzek P.P. Caen J.P. Thromb. Res. 1978; 13: 269-273Google Scholar) and then as a specific inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by type III collagen (22.Karniguian A. Legrand Y.J. Lefrancier P. Caen J.P. Thromb. Res. 1983; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using a protein sequence data base (Swiss-Prot), we verified that this sequence is specific to type III collagen. It is present in chicken, bovine, mouse, and human type III collagens but not in any other collagen type or any other protein. This octapeptide appears to be the minimal collagen sequence reacting with platelets, since the pentapeptide GEP*GP was inactive (29.Karniguian A. Fauvel F. Legrand Y.J. Actual. Hematol. 1983; 17: 36-46Google Scholar). The activity of this peptide seems to be linked to its rigidity confer by its high content of imino acids (P and P*). Moreover, it contains two symmetrical tripeptides KP*G and GPK, which are linked by a spacer (EP*). The presence of P* in the spacer prevents a free rotation of the sequence and the conformation of the two tripeptides supports platelet accessibility. Morton et al. (6.Morton L.F Peachey A.R. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Am. Soc. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 11044-11048Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have synthesized seven peptides (CB4(III)-1 to CB4(III)-7) incorporating the entire CB4 peptide sequence. The octapeptide sequence present in the CB4(III)-4 (positions 487–495) fragment is not recognized by GP Ia/IIa that binds to CB4(III)-6 (30.Verkleij M.W. Ijsseldijk M.J.W. Heijnen-Snyder G.J. Hulzinga E.G. Morton L.F. Knight C.G. Sixma J.J. de Groot P.G. Barnes M.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, the octapeptide does not contain the GPP* sequence involved in platelet aggregation mediated by GP VI (31.Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Onley D.J. Peachey A.R. Ichinohe T. Okuma M. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of the octapeptide in the first steps of platelet activation, i.e. platelet collagen contact and spreading under static conditions, and platelet collagen interactions under flow conditions. In our assay, platelet contact with collagen is cation-independent (26.Fauvel-Lafève F. Meric A. Arbeille B. Tabaka V. Legrand Y.J. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 193-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), does not induce platelet activation, and is not mediated by GP Ia/IIa, GP IIb/IIIa, or GP IV (7.Monnet, E., Sizaret, P. Y., Arbeille, B., and Fauvel-Lafève, F. (2000) Thromb. Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). On the other hand, platelet contact with type III collagen was specifically inhibited by the octapeptide, indicating that this peptide binds to a primary platelet receptor for this particular collagen. The absence of octapeptide initial binding peptide to GP Ia/IIa confirms that the latter is not involved in the initial contact between platelets and collagen (7.Monnet, E., Sizaret, P. Y., Arbeille, B., and Fauvel-Lafève, F. (2000) Thromb. Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). The octapeptide also inhibits platelet spreading on immobilized type III collagen. Moreover, octapeptide immobilized on plastic induced platelet adhesion and serotonin release equivalent to those of type III collagen. The proximity of octapeptides in the wells favored platelet adhesion and help to cluster high numbers of platelet receptors on one side of the platelets. The clustering of these receptors could induce platelet activation, as assessed by serotonin release and the phosphorylation of signal proteins under these conditions (data not shown). Moreover, platelet adhesion to the octapeptide was not inhibited by antibodies directed against other collagen receptors including GP Ia, GP IV, p65, and p47 (Fig. 7 B). This observation further supports that GP Ia/IIa is not involved in the first steps of platelet type III collagen interaction (7.Monnet, E., Sizaret, P. Y., Arbeille, B., and Fauvel-Lafève, F. (2000) Thromb. Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). Platelet adhesion to HUVEC matrix under static conditions was inhibited by 0.5 mm octapeptide, but the inhibition was not complete, indicating that platelets may also react with other molecules expressed in the matrix. Under flow conditions, the octapeptide inhibited platelet adhesion and aggregation induced by type III collagen at two shear rates (300 and 1500 s−1) but had no effect on platelet type I collagen interaction, supporting the high specificity of its action. At low shear rate (300 s−1), on the octapeptide fewer and smaller aggregates were formed, and this observation was further accentuated at the high shear rate (1500 s−1). Thus, at the low shear rate, as under static conditions, platelet adhesion was followed by platelet activation. The surface covered at low shear rate was higher (7%) than that observed (1%) by Verkleij et al. (30.Verkleij M.W. Ijsseldijk M.J.W. Heijnen-Snyder G.J. Hulzinga E.G. Morton L.F. Knight C.G. Sixma J.J. de Groot P.G. Barnes M.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for the CB4(III)-4 peptide, which contains the octapeptide, probably because this sequence is less accessible in a larger peptide. At the high shear rate (1500 s−1), the absence of platelet aggregate formation on the octapeptide could be due to the inability of plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) to bind to the octapeptide like to CB4(III)-4 (30.Verkleij M.W. Ijsseldijk M.J.W. Heijnen-Snyder G.J. Hulzinga E.G. Morton L.F. Knight C.G. Sixma J.J. de Groot P.G. Barnes M.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), because vWF is necessary for the maintenance of platelet aggregates at a high shear rate. The binding of plasma vWF to the entire type III collagen could explain the presence of sparse small aggregates when platelets where incubated with 0.5 mmoctapeptide before perfusion (Fig. 4 B, 3). The specificity of the binding was assessed with the competition studies: the binding was displaced by a 60-fold excess of unlabeled octapeptide. Ligand blotting, after SDS-PAGE of total platelet proteins, showed that the octapeptide bound to a doublet of proteins with molecular masses of 68 (major) and 72 kDa. This dual binding indicates that the octapeptide also recognizes its platelet receptor under denatured conditions. The protein doublet does not correspond to any already known collagen receptor. The doublet is not stained by the Schiff reagent, indicating that it is not glycosylated. The major band was composed by four isoforms with different phosphorylation states, as observed after immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine kinase that labeled two spots (data not shown). In conclusion, platelet adhesion to type III collagen occurs via a specific non integrin receptor, TIIICBP. This receptor is involved in the contact between platelet and collagen, and our studies under flow conditions demonstrated that platelet TIIICBP reacted directly with the octapeptide or type III collagen. Further investigations are needed to elucidate octapeptide-induced activation pathway and to determine whether eventual interactions with other collagen receptors, for example GP VI, could reinforce platelet aggregation. Nonetheless, results presented herein allow us to complete the model proposed by Verkleij et al. (32.Verkleij M.W. Morton L.F. Knight C.G. de Groot P.G. Barnes M.J. Sixma J.J Blood. 1998; 91: 3808-3816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the collagen-related peptides used in their study (32.Verkleij M.W. Morton L.F. Knight C.G. de Groot P.G. Barnes M.J. Sixma J.J Blood. 1998; 91: 3808-3816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the octapeptide favored platelet adhesion under flow conditions, as shown in Fig.8. During the first step, arrest of platelets on type III collagen, platelet TIIICBP would bind to the octapeptide in CB4(III)-4 (positions 487–495). Very close to this first interaction, platelet GP Ib would react with vWF bound in CB4(III)-7 (residues 541–558) (32.Verkleij M.W. Morton L.F. Knight C.G. de Groot P.G. Barnes M.J. Sixma J.J Blood. 1998; 91: 3808-3816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the adhesion would then be stabilized by the binding of GP Ia/IIa to CB4(III)6/7 (residues 522–528) (30.Verkleij M.W. Ijsseldijk M.J.W. Heijnen-Snyder G.J. Hulzinga E.G. Morton L.F. Knight C.G. Sixma J.J. de Groot P.G. Barnes M.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finally, the binding of GP VI to the collagen triple helix, and the eventual participation of other receptors (p47?) (16.Chiang T.M. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 443-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) would reinforce platelet activation, leading to the formation of large thrombi. Taken together, the results of these studies show that type III collagen has several platelet-binding sites condensed in a small region within the CB4 peptide, a system that could provide a solid foundation for platelet adhesion and aggregation, thereby assuring adequate thrombus formation.

https://openalex.org/W1995889368,"Sodium salicylate inhibits activation of the transcription factor NF-κB by blocking the phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα. We previously demonstrated that salicylate inhibits IκBα degradation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) but not by interleukin-1 (IL-1) and implicated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by salicylate in the inhibition of TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation. Both TNF and IL-1 rapidly activate the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, containing the catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ, which directly phosphorylates IκB proteins. Others have recently suggested that salicylate inhibits NF-κB activation by directly binding to IKKβ. To clarify the mechanism whereby salicylate inhibits IKK activity, we examined its effects upon cytokine-induced IKK activity in intact cells and in vitro. Treatment of intact cells with salicylate inhibited TNF-induced but not IL-1-induced IKK activity, and this inhibition was prevented by the p38 inhibitor SB203580. In contrast, inhibition of IKK activity by salicylate in vitro was neither selective for TNF nor affected by SB203580. In vitro, salicylate treatment comparably inhibited the kinase activity of overexpressed IKKα and IKKβ and also decreased p38 kinase activity. Therefore, direct inhibition of IKK activity in vitro does not reflect the inhibitory mechanism of salicylate in intact cells, which involves interference with TNF signaling.

Therefore, direct inhibition of IKK activity in vitro does not reflect the inhibitory mechanism of salicylate in intact cells, which involves interference with TNF signaling. nuclear factor κB tumor necrosis factor interleukin-1 inhibitor of NF-κB IκB kinase NF-κB-inducing kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAP/ERK kinase kinase 1 sodium salicylate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum minimal essential medium myelin basic protein glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The transcription factor NF-κB1 is an important regulator of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. The NF-κB pathway is activated by a variety of stimuli, including the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide. In most mammalian cells, the NF-κB dimer is sequestered in the cytoplasm by an inhibitory IκB isoform such as IκBα, IκBβ, or IκBε (1.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar). Stimulus-induced phosphorylation of IκB proteins on two conserved N-terminal serine residues leads to IκB degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway allowing for the release of NF-κB and its nuclear translocation. TNF-induced NF-κB activation is initiated by oligomerization of the type 1 or type 2 TNF receptors. This leads to the recruitment of cytoplasmic signaling proteins, such as TNF receptor-associated death domain, TNF receptor-associated factor 2 and receptor interacting protein, and activation of kinases including MAP/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) and the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (2.Malinin N.L.

The IKK complex consists of two catalytic components, IKKα and IKKβ, as well as a regulatory IKKγ subunit, which may facilitate interaction with upstream signaling factors (9.Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M.

Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), have been shown to interact with the IKK complex, and their precise roles in the activation of the IKK complex remain to be defined. Salicylate and its acetylated derivative, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), represent the oldest known nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A well characterized mechanism of action for aspirin involves the acetylation of cyclooxygenase isoforms, leading to irreversible inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (13.Vane J.R. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7347) Google Scholar). In the intact organism, aspirin is rapidly deacetylated to salicylate, which is a relatively weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenases (14.Weissmann G. Sci. Am. 1991; 264: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, both aspirin and salicylate are potent anti-inflammatory agents, used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (14.Weissmann G. Sci. Am. 1991; 264: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,15.Abramson S.B. Weissmann G. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Sodium salicylate (NaSal) and aspirin can inhibit the activation of NF-κB by preventing the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (16.Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar, 17.Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F.W. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of NF-κB may explain some of the clinically documented anti-inflammatory effects seen with high concentrations of salicylates (14.Weissmann G. Sci. Am. 1991; 264: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15.Abramson S.B. Weissmann G. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that NaSal rapidly and persistently activates p38 MAP kinase and that NaSal-induced p38 activation is important for its ability to inhibit TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation (18.Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 19.Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that p38 activation may play a more general role in the inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB activation (20.Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A recent report has suggested that NaSal and aspirin may inhibit NF-κB by an alternative mechanism, via direct binding to the IKK complex (21.Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to clarify the mechanism by which NaSal inhibits IKK activity. We demonstrate that treatment of intact cells with NaSal selectively inhibits IKK activity induced by TNF, yet not by IL-1, and this inhibition is prevented by the p38 inhibitor SB203580. However, we find that inhibition of IKK activity in vitro is not selective and cannot be prevented by SB203580, suggesting that direct inhibition of the IKK complex is not likely to be the mechanism by which NaSal exerts its inhibitory effect upon NF-κB activationin vivo. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and were serum-starved for 18–24 h in DMEM with 0.5% FBS. Normal human diploid FS-4 fibroblasts were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% FBS and were serum-starved for 2–3 days in MEM with 0.25% FBS before use in experiments. NaSal, sodium meta-arsenite, and myelin basic protein (MBP) were purchased from Sigma. NaSal and arsenite were dissolved in distilled water, unless otherwise indicated. Recombinant human TNF-α was provided by Masafumi Tsujimoto of the Suntory Institute for Biomedical Research, Osaka, Japan. Recombinant human IL-1α was obtained from the National Cancer Institute. The p38 inhibitor SB203580 (22.Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R.

The rabbit polyclonal anti-IκBα and anti-IKKα (H-744) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was from Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems. Full-length FLAG-tagged IKKα and IKKβ cloned into the pRK5 vector were provided by David Goeddel (6.Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Full-length NIK cloned into the pcDNA3 vector was a gift from David Wallach (2.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Full-length IκBα in the pGEX-2T vector was provided by John Hiscott (25.Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment encoding the first 62 amino acids of IκBα was amplified from this construct by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the EcoRI andNotI sites of the pGEX-4T1 vector. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-IκBα (amino acids 1–62) was subsequently purified from Escherichia coli DH5α with glutathione-agarose for use in immunokinase assays. Transfections were performed in COS-1 cells plated at a density of approximately 2.5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected the following day using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 1 ml of serum-free DMEM. 5 h post-transfection, 1 ml of serum-free DMEM was added to each well. Cells were incubated for an additional 24 h, prior to stimulation as indicated. Whole cell lysates were generated using a buffer consisting of 1% Igepal, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmpyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mm NaF (18.Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 20.Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate the endogenous IKK complex, equal amounts of lysates were incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C with anti-IKKα antibody followed by collection of immune complexes for 2 h at 4 °C using protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation of transfected FLAG-IKKα, FLAG-IKKβ, or FLAG-p38α, equal amounts of lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody followed by collection of immune complexes using protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were subsequently washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer without ATP. Assays for IKK activity were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer consisting of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmATP, 10 mCi of [γ-32P] ATP, and 5 μg of GST-IκBα (1–62) as substrate. Assays for p38 kinase activity were performed under identical conditions in kinase buffer containing 5 μg of MBP as substrate. Kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 2× protein sample buffer, and phosphorylated GST-IκBα or MBP was visualized following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography. To determine the effect of NaSal treatment in vitro upon IKK activity, aliquots of immunoprecipitates were incubated with various concentrations of NaSal in kinase buffer for 30 min on ice. Kinase assays were then performed as described above in the continuous presence of NaSal. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described (20.Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. Antibody-antigen complexes were detected with the aid of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and a chemiluminescent substrate development kit (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). We and others have reported that NaSal inhibits IκBα degradation induced by TNF but not by IL-1 (19.Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26.Madge L.A. Sierra-Honigmann M.R. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13643-13649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A preponderance of evidence suggests that both TNF and IL-1 induce IκBα phosphorylation and degradation via activation of the IKK complex (23.Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 27.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). To determine whether blockage of IκBα degradation correlates with inhibition of IKK activity, we treated COS-1 cells with various concentrations of NaSal prior to stimulation with TNF or IL-1. An antibody to IKKα was used to immunoprecipitate endogenous IKK complexes from whole cell lysates (21.Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar), which were then assayed forin vitro kinase activity using GST-IκBα as substrate. NaSal inhibited TNF-induced IKK activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of approximately 5 mm (Fig.1 A, top panel). In contrast, NaSal did not appreciably affect IL-1-induced IKK activity. This profile of IKK inhibition is consistent with the selective inhibition of TNF-induced IκBα degradation by NaSal (19.Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates using an antibody against IκBα (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). TNF-induced IκBα degradation was dose-dependently inhibited by NaSal treatment. Although IL-1 induced a less complete degradation of IκBα, this effect was not inhibited at the concentrations of NaSal tested. Yin et al. (21.Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) reported that NaSal and aspirin inhibit IKK activity in vitro by directly binding to IKKβ and postulated this as the mechanism whereby salicylates inhibit NF-κB activation. It seemed difficult to reconcile the notion that NaSal directly binds and inhibits the IKK complex with our finding of selective inhibition of TNF-induced but not IL-1-induced IKK activation by NaSal. We therefore examined the effect of NaSal upon IKK activityin vitro. COS-1 cells were treated with either TNF or IL-1 for 10 min followed by immunoprecipitation of the endogenous IKK complex. The immune complexes were divided into equal fractions, which were incubated with various concentrations of NaSal for 30 min, followed by an in vitro kinase assay. In contrast to the selective inhibition of TNF-induced IKK activity observed in intact cells treated with NaSal, in vitro treatment with NaSal caused a comparable dose-dependent inhibition of both TNF- and IL-1-activated IKK activity (Fig. 1 B). NaSal leads to a rapid and persistent activation of p38 MAP kinase (18.Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 19.Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Engelman J.A.

We have shown that inhibition of TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation by NaSal is preventable by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (19.Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether SB203580 can reverse the inhibition of TNF-induced IKK activity, COS-1 cells were incubated with SB203580 or Me2SO vehicle prior to the addition of NaSal. Cells were harvested following a 10-min treatment with TNF, and the IKK complex was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates and assayed for in vitro kinase activity with GST-IκBα as substrate. NaSal (20 mm) strongly inhibited TNF-induced IKK activity, and this inhibition was significantly reversed by SB203580 (Fig.2 A, top panel). In addition, immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with an antibody against IκBα demonstrated that TNF-induced IκBα degradation was inhibited by NaSal, and SB203580 prevented this inhibition (Fig.2 A, bottom panel). To determine whether SB203580 can reverse the inhibitory effect of NaSal on IKK activity in vitro, IKK complexes were immunoprecipitated from untreated or TNF-treated COS cells and incubated with either SB203580 or Me2SO prior to treatment with 5 or 20 mm NaSal. Immunoprecipitated IKK was then assayed for in vitro kinase activity with GST-IκBα as substrate. NaSal dose-dependently inhibited TNF-induced IKK activity in vitro. However, contrary to the reversal observed in intact cells (Fig. 2 A), SB203580 treatment failed to reverse the inhibition by NaSal in vitro (Fig.2 B). Although NaSal strongly inhibits IκBα degradation in numerous cell systems (17.Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F.W. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar), it fails to appreciably inhibit this step in human FS-4 fibroblasts (20.Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, treatment of intact FS-4 cells with 5 or 20 mm NaSal did not markedly affect TNF-induced IKK activity (Fig.3 A, top panel). Immunoblot analysis of these lysates with an antibody against IκBα confirmed the inability of NaSal to inhibit TNF-induced IκBα degradation (bottom panel). In contrast, treatment of immunoprecipitated IKK with NaSal in vitro inhibited IKK activity, especially at a concentration of 20 mm (Fig.3 B). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of NaSalin vitro is selective for either the IKKα or IKKβ catalytic components of the IKK complex, we transfected COS-1 cells with expression vectors encoding FLAG-IKKα or FLAG-IKKβ. Because the kinase activity of overexpressed IKKβ is at least 20 times higher than that of IKKα (23.Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), we cotransfected NIK along with IKKα to augment its in vitro kinase activity. FLAG-tagged IKKs were immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts and used in an in vitro kinase assay with GST-IκBα as substrate in the presence of 0, 5, or 20 mm NaSal. NaSal dose-dependently inhibited IKKα activity in the presence or absence of cotransfected NIK in addition to inhibiting IKKβ activity in vitro (Fig.4, top panel). Levels of immunoprecipitated IKKα and IKKβ were equivalent in all lanes as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4, bottom panel). To determine whether the in vitro inhibitory effect of NaSal is specific for IKKs or whether other kinases are also affected, we analyzed the effect of NaSal treatment upon in vitro p38 kinase activity. COS-1 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged p38α and either left untreated or treated with arsenite for 15 min to activate p38. FLAG-tagged p38 was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts and used in an in vitro kinase assay with MBP as substrate in the presence of 0, 5, or 20 mm NaSal. Arsenite stimulated p38 kinase activity above baseline, and both baseline and arsenite-stimulated p38 activity were inhibited dose-dependently by NaSal treatment in vitro(Fig. 5, top panel). Expression of immunoprecipitated FLAG-p38 was equivalent in all lanes (Fig. 5, bottom panel). We also observed that in vitro treatment with 5 and 20 mm NaSal inhibited the kinase activity of endogenous p38 activated by TNF treatment (data not shown). Because treatment of cells with NaSal has been shown to activate p38 MAP kinase (18.Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 19.Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of NaSal upon p38 activity supports the argument that the effect of NaSal upon kinase activity in vitro does not reflect the action of NaSal in intact cells. It has been shown that NaSal and aspirin inhibit NF-κB activation by preventing the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα (16.Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar, 17.Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F.W. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar). NaSal inhibits IκBα phosphorylation and degradation induced by TNF but not by IL-1 (19.Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13643-13649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The ability of NaSal to inhibit TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation is dependent upon NaSal-induced p38 MAP kinase activation, and p38 may play a more general role in the inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB activation (19.Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20.Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) have reported that NaSal and aspirin may inhibit the IKK complex by directly binding to IKKβ, thereby interfering with ATP binding. Because both TNF and IL-1 activate the IKK complex (23.Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 27.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), such a mechanism of NF-κB inhibition by NaSal is inconsistent with the observations that NaSal inhibits TNF-induced but not IL-1-induced IκBα degradation (19.Schwenger P.

To clarify the mechanism by which NaSal inhibits IκBα phosphorylation, we analyzed the effects of NaSal upon cytokine-induced IKK activity in intact cells and in vitro. We conclude that the direct inhibitory effect of NaSal upon IKK activity in vitro does not reflect the mechanism whereby NaSal inhibits IKK activity in intact cells. Studies of IKKα and IKKβ knockout mice indicate that only IKKβ is required for cytokine-induced IκBα degradation, whereas IKKα appears to be important for epidermal differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis (reviewed in Refs. 29.Zandi E.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), direct inhibition of IKKβ by NaSal would be expected to impair IKK activation induced by either TNF or IL-1. However, our results demonstrate that treatment of intact cells with NaSal inhibits TNF-induced IKK activity but does not appreciably affect IL-1-induced IKK activity (Fig. 1 A). This observation, in concert with our previous data (19.Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), suggests that NaSal may inhibit NF-κB activation by selectively targeting a component of the TNF signaling pathway leading to IKK activation. On the other hand, treatment of immunoprecipitated IKK with NaSal in vitrodose-dependently inhibited IKK activity from either TNF- or IL-1-treated cells (Fig. 1 B). In addition, we observed that NaSal did not appreciably inhibit either TNF-induced IKK activity or IκBα degradation in intact FS-4 fibroblasts (Fig. 3 A), whereas in vitro treatment of IKK immunoprecipitated from FS-4 cells with 20 mm NaSal led to a strong inhibition of IKK activity (Fig. 3 B). The inhibitory effect of NaSalin vitro is therefore not indicative of its inhibitory profile in whole cells in at least two distinct cell systems. Because the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 can prevent the ability of NaSal to inhibit TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation (19.Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Madge L.A. Sierra-Honigmann M.R. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13643-13649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of this inhibitor on the ability of NaSal to affect TNF-induced IKK activity. Consistent with previous studies, we observed that incubation of cells with SB203580 significantly prevented the NaSal-mediated inhibition of TNF-induced IKK activity (Fig. 2 A). SB203580 is a specific inhibitor of p38α and p38β isoforms and fails to inhibit the activity of numerous other kinases (34.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). However, some reports indicate that high concentrations of SB203580 may exert effects unrelated to inhibition of p38 (35.Borsch-Haubold A.G. Pasquet S. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 36.Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 37.Clerk A. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It seemed possible that SB203580, a low molecular weight imidazole compound, might directly interact with the IKK complex and thereby block NaSal binding. We have ruled out a direct effect of SB203580 on the IKK complex by demonstrating that incubation of immunoprecipitated IKK with SB203580 in vitro, prior to incubation with NaSal, did not reverse the inhibition by NaSal (Fig.2 B). This finding further supports the conclusion that the direct inhibition of IKK activity in vitro does not reflect the mechanism of IKK inhibition by NaSal in vivo. It is likely that the effect of SB203580 in vivo reflects a genuine role for NaSal-induced p38 activation in the inhibition of IKK activity. In support of this notion, diverse stimuli that persistently activate p38, such as hyperosmolarity, H2O2, staurosporine, and vitamin C, similarly inhibited TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in a manner preventable by SB203580 (20.Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26.Madge L.A. Sierra-Honigmann M.R. Pober J.S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that a constitutively active MAP kinase kinase 6 mutant, which activates p38, decreased TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB reporter activity (20.Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and this inhibition occurs at the level of receptor interacting protein or TNF receptor-associated factor 2 in the TNF signaling pathway (data not shown). Other cellular effects of NaSal have been attributed to p38 activation, such as the induction of apoptosis in fibroblasts and induction of adipocyte differentiation (18.Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 28.Engelman J.A. Berg A.H. Lewis R.Y. Lin A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35630-35638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting that NaSal may exert multiple biological effects through activation of p38. Although it has been reported that NaSal and aspirin directly inhibit IKKβ but fail to affect IKKα (21.Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar), we observed that NaSal inhibited the activity of both immunoprecipitated IKKα and IKKβ in vitro (Fig. 4). We observed significant in vitro andin vivo inhibitory effects of NaSal only at millimolar concentrations, although Yin et al. (21.Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) have demonstrated an IC50 for inhibition of the IKK complex, and IKKβ specifically, at concentrations ranging from 50–100 μm. We cannot explain this discrepancy; however, numerous groups have documented significant effects of NaSal upon NF-κB function, MAP kinase activity, induction of apoptosis, and gene expression only at concentrations of NaSal in the 5–20 mm range (16.Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar, 17.Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F.W. Collins T. J.

Physiol. 1999; 179: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although these concentrations exceed the 1–2 mmserum levels that may be achieved in patients undergoing high dose salicylate therapy (15.Abramson S.B. Weissmann G. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), they may nonetheless be consistent with a role for p38-mediated NF-κB inhibition in the anti-inflammatory effects of salicylates. As organic acids, salicylates accumulate at the mildly acidic environments prevailing at sites of inflammation (14.Weissmann G. Sci. Am. 1991; 264: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15.Abramson S.B. Weissmann G. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 42.Brooks P.M. Day R.O. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1716-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Salicylates are uncharged at low pH and can readily cross membranes, yet deprotonate and become trapped as anions in the more neutral environment found within cells (42.Brooks P.M. Day R.O. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1716-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that local concentrations of salicylates at sites of inflammation may reach levels sufficient for NF-κB inhibition. Furthermore, studies employing catalytically inactive IKK mutants indicate that slight reductions in IKK activity may correlate with significant decreases in NF-κB-mediated gene expression (8.Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 9.Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar), suggesting that the reduction in TNF-induced IKK activity observed at 1–5 mm NaSal (Fig.1 A) is likely to translate into biologically relevant NF-κB inhibition. Interestingly, we noted that millimolar concentrations of NaSal significantly inhibited p38 MAP kinase activity in vitro(Fig. 5). However, treatment of numerous cell types with millimolar concentrations of NaSal leads to p38 activation rather than to its inhibition (18.Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 19.Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35630-35638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This finding further underscores the notion that the effect of NaSal upon in vitro kinase activity does not reflect the mechanism by which NaSal affects various kinases within the cell. Furthermore, the inhibitory action on p38 in vitroindicates that the effect of NaSal upon in vitro kinase activity is not limited to the IKKs. In agreement with this conclusion, it was recently reported that 20 mm NaSal inhibits RSK2 kinase activity in vitro (43.Stevenson M.A. Zhao M.J. Asea A. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5608-5616PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, our results emphasize the need to exercise caution when attributing the actions of pharmacological agents in intact cells to effects observed in vitro without thoroughly considering potential interactions with various signal transduction components.

These measurements allowed us to describe secondary structure changes of LmrA during the catalytic cycle. The structure of LmrA is enriched in β-sheet after ATP binding, and the protein recovers its initial secondary structure after ATP hydrolysis, when Pi has been released. 2H/H exchange and fluorescence quenching studies indicate that the protein undergoes two distinct tertiary structure changes during the hydrolysis process.

Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp),1 a 170-kDa plasma membrane protein, is implicated in multidrug resistance of different cancer cell lines (3.Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev.

Pgp belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily and functions as an ATP-driven efflux pump that transports a broad spectrum of structurally unrelated cytotoxic drugs (6.Gottesman M.M.

Several multidrug transport proteins have been identified in bacteria (1.Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Most of them are secondary transporters, acting as drug/H+ antiporter (9.van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 769-777PubMed Google Scholar). LmrA from Lactococcus lactis was the first ABC multidrug transporter identified in bacteria (10.van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 11.Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. J.

It is a 590-amino acid protein containing an N-terminal membrane domain, consisting of six transmembrane segments, followed by a hydrophilic domain containing the nucleotide binding site. This transporter uses the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport a broad range of amphiphilic drugs across the membrane. Although its topology in the lipid membrane has been deduced from its primary structure, its secondary and tertiary structures are unknown. Interestingly, LmrA and each half of Pgp share a high level of sequence homology, including regions implicated in drug recognition and transport in Pgp (10.van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). LmrA and Pgp extrude a similar spectrum of amphiphilic cationic compounds, and their activities are reversed by reserpine and verapamil. Furthermore, LmrA can even functionally complement Pgp in human fibroblast cells (12.van Veen H.W. Callaghan R. Soceneantu L. Sardini A. Konings W.N. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Previous studies, including infrared spectroscopy (13.Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.-M. J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12908-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), have demonstrated that Pgp changes its conformation during its catalytic cycle, and four conformational states have been identified during the hydrolysis cycle. The mechanism of coupling ATP hydrolysis, at the cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain, to drug transport probably involves conformational changes in LmrA structure. Knowledge of these intermediate states is essential for understanding the LmrA-induced transport process. The main goal of the present study is to investigate the different conformations adopted by the protein in the presence of nucleotide ligands. Recently, histidine-tagged LmrA was overexpressed in L. lactis and purified using a Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. LmrA was reconstituted into liposomes prepared fromL. lactis lipids (18.Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and from Escherichia colilipids. 2A. Margolles, H. W. van Veen, and W. N. Konings, unpublished data. The resulting proteoliposomes exhibited ATP-dependent drug transport, which was inhibited by chemosensitizers (18.Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We investigated here the effect of MgATPγS, MgATP, MgADP/Pi, and MgADP on the secondary and tertiary structures of LmrA, using a combination of FTIR spectroscopy, 2H/H exchange, and fluorescence quenching measurements. MgATPγS, the nonhydrolyzable analog of MgATP, was used to discriminate between the influence of nucleotide binding and nucleotide hydrolysis on LmrA structure. The structure of LmrA in the presence of MgADP/Pi and MgADP represents the situation after hydrolysis. This study clearly indicates that the secondary and tertiary structures of LmrA change during its catalytic cycle and allowed us to describe intermediate states involved in the hydrolysis process. ATP, ATPγS, and ADP were from Sigma. D2O was from Merck, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from Qiagen, Bio-Beads SM2 were from Bio-Rad, polycarbonate filters were from Avestin, and dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was from Anatrace.E. coli lipids and l-α-phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. The purification of LmrA was carried out essentially as described previously (18.Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Inside-out membrane vesicles, containing overexpressed LmrA, were solubilized in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mmNaCl, and 1% (w/v) dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. After 30 min of incubation at 4 °C, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was mixed and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (∼8 mg of LmrA/ml of resin), which was preequilibrated in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside) plus 10 mm imidazole. The resin was transferred to a Bio-spin column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm of imidazole and subsequently with 40 column volumes of buffer A (pH 7) plus 40 mm of imidazole. The protein was eluted with buffer A, pH 7, supplemented with 150 mm of imidazole. Liposomes of acetone/ether-washed E. coli lipids andl-α-phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk, in a ratio (w/w) of 3:1, were made by dissolving lipids in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, at a final concentration of 20 mg/ml. Unilamellar liposomes with relatively homogeneous size were prepared by freezing in liquid nitrogen and slow thawing at room temperature followed by extrusion of the liposomes 12 times through a 400-nm polycarbonate filter. The reconstitution of LmrA into liposomes was carried out essentially as described (18.Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), using a protein/lipid ratio of 1:10. The resulting proteoliposomes exhibited ATP-dependent drug transport, inhibited by chemosensitizers (18.Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were resuspended at a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in 3 mm potassium Hepes, pH 7.4. ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded, at room temperature, on a Bruker IFS55 FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride detector at a nominal resolution of 4 cm−1 and encoded every 1 cm−1. The spectrophotometer was continuously purged with air. The internal reflection element (ATR) was a germanium plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm; Harrick EJ2121) with an aperture angle of 45°, yielding 25 internal reflections (19.Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). For each spectrum, used for the determination of the secondary structure, 512 scan cycles were averaged. For each kinetic time point, 24 spectra were recorded and averaged. In each cycle, the sample spectra were rationed against the background spectrum of a clean germanium plate. Thin films of oriented multilayers were obtained by slowly evaporating the sample on one side of the ATR plate in a stream of nitrogen (20.Fringeli U. Günthard H. Grell E. Membrane Spectroscopy. Springer, Berlin1981: 270-332Google Scholar). The ATR plate was then sealed in a universal sample holder. The sample contained 20 μg of reconstituted LmrA. For measurements of LmrA structure in the presence of different nucleotides, 0.5 μl of a 6 mm nucleotide or Pi solution was added to the reconstituted protein. In these conditions, the molar ratio of LmrA over nucleotides is 1:5. The sample on the ATR plate was rehydrated by flushing D2O-saturated N2 for 2 h at room temperature. 512 scans were averaged for each measurement. The determination of the secondary structure was based on the vibrational bands of the protein and particularly the amide I band (1600–1700 cm−1), which is sensitive to the secondary structure (20.Fringeli U. Günthard H. Grell E. Membrane Spectroscopy. Springer, Berlin1981: 270-332Google Scholar). This amide I band, located in a region of the spectrum that is often free of other bands, is composed of 80% pure C=O vibration. The analysis was performed on the amide I region of deuterated samples, because the H/D exchange allows differentiation of the α-helical secondary structure from the random secondary structure whose absorption band shifts from about 1655 to about 1642 cm−1 (21.Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Fourier self-deconvolution was applied to increase the resolution of the spectra in the amide I region. The self-deconvolution was carried out using a Lorentzian line shape for the deconvolution and a Gaussian line shape for the apodization. To quantify the area of the different components of amide I revealed by self-deconvolution, a least squares iterative curve fitting was performed to fit Lorentzian line shapes to the spectrum between 1700 and 1600 cm−1 (21.Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 22.Kauppinen J.K. Moffat D.J. Cameron D.G. Mantsch H. Appl.

To avoid the introduction of artifacts due to the self-deconvolution procedure, the fitting was performed on the nondeconvoluted spectrum. The proportion of a particular structure is the sum of the area of all of the fitted Lorentzian bands having their maximum in the frequency region where that structure occurs divided by the total area of the amide I. The frequency limits for each structure were first assigned according to theoretical (24.Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv.

These limits have been slightly adjusted to obtain a good agreement between the proportion of each structure determined by ATR-FTIR and x-ray crystallography (19.Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Films containing 20 μg of reconstituted LmrA, in the presence or absence of nucleotides, were prepared on a germanium plate as described above. Nitrogen was saturated with D2O by bubbling in a series of three vials containing D2O. Before starting the deuteration, 10 spectra of the sample were recorded to test the stability of the measurements and the reproducibility of the area determination. At zero time, the D2O-saturated N2 flux, at a flow rate of 100 ml/min (controlled by a Brooks flow meter), was connected to the sample. For each kinetic time point, 24 spectra were recorded and averaged at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The signal from the atmospheric water was subtracted as described by Goormaghtigh et al. (25.Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Spectrochim. Acta. 1994; 50: 2137-3144Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The area of amide II, characteristic of the δ(N-H) vibration, was obtained by integration between 1596 and 1502 cm−1. For each spectrum, the area of amide II was divided by the corresponding lipidic ν(C=O) area to correct for any change in total intensity of the spectra during the deuteration process (26.Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). This ratio, expressed as a percentage was plotted versusdeuteration time. The 100% value is defined by the amide II/lipid ratio obtained before deuteration. The 0% value corresponds to a zero absorption in the amide II region, observed for a full deuteration of the protein. Acrylamide quenching experiments were carried out on an SLM Aminco 8000 fluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm to reduce the absorbance of acrylamide. Acrylamide aliquots were added from a 3m solution to the proteoliposome suspension containing 6.5 μg of reconstituted LmrA and the various ligands. The final concentrations for MgATP, MgADP, MgATPγS, and Pi were 3 mm. Fluorescence intensities were measured at 332 nm after each addition of quencher. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C. Acrylamide quenching data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation for collisional quenching (27.Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar), F0/F=1+K[Q]Equation 1 where F 0 and F represent the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher, [Q] is the molar concentration of quencher, and K is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. Data were subjected to a linear fit up to 80 mm acrylamide. Above this concentration, the static quenching by acrylamide causes a deviation from linearity in Stern-Volmer plots. Spectra of LmrA reconstituted into lipids were recorded in the absence and presence of different nucleotides (MgATP, MgATPγS, MgADP, MgADP/Pi). The IR spectrum of LmrA alone, in the 1800–1400-cm−1 region, is shown in Fig. 1. The amide I band, assigned to the ν(C=O) of the peptide bond, is located in the 1700–1600-cm−1 region. The 1570–1500- and the 1500-1400-cm−1 bands represent unexchanged amide II, characteristic of the δ(N-H), and exchanged amide II, characteristic of the δ(N-D) amide bond, respectively. The lipid ester ν(C=O) band is located in the 1700–1800-cm−1 region. The secondary structure of LmrA was determined by Fourier deconvolution and a curve-fitting analysis of the amide I region of a deuterated sample. The percentages of α-helix, β-sheet, β-turn, and random coil structures, in the presence or absence of nucleotides, are presented in Table I. Significant differences detected in the amide I region of LmrA demonstrate that LmrA adopts two different conformations depending on the nature of the nucleotide bound to the protein (Fig. 2). LmrA alone or in the presence of ADP has 35% α-helix, 24% β-sheet, 28% β-turn, and 13% random coil. In the presence of MgATP, MgATPγS, or MgADP/Pi, an enrichment in β-sheet is observed (35% α-helix, 34% β-sheet, 17% β-turn, and 14% random coil) concomitantly with a loss of β-turn structure. The data obtained reveal that the secondary structure of LmrA changes after ATP binding and that the original structure is recovered after hydrolysis and Pi release.Table ISecondary structure of LmrA determined in the absence and presence of nucleotidesSubstratesSecondary structureα-Helixβ-Sheetβ-TurnRandom%%%%None35 ± 224 ± 228 ± 113 ± 1MgADPaLmrA/nucleotide molar ratio of 1:5.35 ± 124 ± 131 ± 110 ± 1MgATPaLmrA/nucleotide molar ratio of 1:5.34 ± 236 ± 216 ± 214 ± 2MgATPγSaLmrA/nucleotide molar ratio of 1:5.35 ± 233 ± 118 ± 114 ± 1MgADP/PiaLmrA/nucleotide molar ratio of 1:5.34 ± 135 ± 117 ± 114 ± 1The percentages were obtained by analysis of the shape of the amide I band according to Goormaghtigh et al.

Kinetics of deuteration of reconstituted LmrA were monitored in the presence and absence of different nucleotides (MgATP, MgATPγS, MgADP, MgADP/Pi). The rate of amide hydrogen exchange by deuterium is related to the solvent accessibility to the NH amide groups. Amide hydrogen exchange was followed by monitoring the amide II absorption peak (maximum at 1544 cm−1) as a function of the time of exposure to D2O-saturated N2. The percentage of exchange was computed between 0 and 100%, as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” The decrease of the amide II region is proportional to the number of hydrogens that have been exchanged by deuterium and provides a sensitive measure of LmrA structure and conformational changes. Deuterium-hydrogen exchange is shown in Fig.3 as a function of the deuteration time. Deuterium-hydrogen exchange is extremely rapid in all of the situations tested; a drastic decrease in the intensity of the amide II band is observed during the first 10 min of exposure, indicating a rapid exchange of a large number of amide hydrogen for deuterium. Deuterium-hydrogen exchange is much slower over the next 2 h. In the absence of nucleotide, about 55% of amide hydrogens of LmrA are not exchanged for deuterium, reflecting a poor accessibility of these hydrogens to the aqueous medium. This percentage is not significantly affected by ADP or ATPγS binding. The addition of ATP to LmrA, however, clearly results in an increase of the deuterium-hydrogen exchange rate. About 43% of amide hydrogens do not exchange. In the presence of MgADP/Pi, the exchange rate is between the rates observed for LmrA alone and in the presence of ATP; 49% of the hydrogen bonds do not exchange. Hydrogen atoms with different exchange rates are implicated in the exchange process. Since the 2H/H exchange is a first order reaction, the exchange curve is expected to display a multiexponential decay corresponding to the different groups of amide protons characterized by a common period T i, H(t)=∑iai exp(−t/Ti)Equation 2 where a i is the proportion of each amide group with identical T i values. The large number of protons makes it impossible to obtain the individual rate constants. Information about the variation in rate constants can be obtained by arbitrarily selection of a number of exponentials to fit the exchange curves. Three exponentials characterized by their period T i (i= 1–3) and by their proportion a i of amide groups were chosen. In order to compare the proportion a iof each amide group for the different experimental curves, the sameT i values are used for all of the fittings. To characterize the amount of very fast (a 1), intermediate (a 2), and very slowly (a 3) exchanging protons, periods of 10 s, 2 min, and 500 min, respectively were chosen. In the absence of ligands, approximately 30% of the amide hydrogen exchanged for deuterium within 10 s of exposure to 2H2O, and an additional 15% exchanged after 2 min (TableII). The remaining 54% exchanged after 8 h, and these protons represent the very inaccessible regions of LmrA. In the presence of ATP and ADP/Pi, the fraction of slowly exchanging amide protons (characterized bya 3, T 3), decrease concomitant with an increase of intermediate exchanging amide protons (characterized by a 2,T 2). In the presence of MgATPγS and MgADP, the fraction of slowly exchanging amide protons is almost identical to that observed for LmrA alone. However, approximately 30 hydrogens are exchanged within 10 s in the protein alone and within 2 min in the presence of MgADP or MgATPγS.Table IIProportion (a1, a2, a3) of the three exponential components characterized by the period of T1 = 0.16, T2 = 2, and T3 = 500 minSubstratea1a2a3%%%No ligand31 (183)15 (89)54 (318)MgADP26 (153)19 (112)55 (325)MgATPγS26 (153)18 (107)56 (330)MgADP/Pi29 (171)22 (130)49 (289)MgATP33 (195)23 (135)44 (260)The proportions are yielded from the analysis of the exchange curves recorded for LmrA in the presence of different ligands.

Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The accessibility of LmrA to the aqueous medium was measured in the presence or absence of nucleotides. MgATP, MgADP, MgATPγS, and Pi were added to a final concentration of 3 mm. The exposure of the tryptophan residues of LmrA to the external solvent was determined by monitoring the LmrA fluorescence intensity in the presence of increasing concentrations (0–0.08 m) of the aqueous quencher acrylamide (28.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 29.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Stern-Volmer plots of fluorescence quenching of the tryptophan of LmrA by acrylamide, in the presence or absence of MgATP, MgADP, MgATPγS, and MgADP/Pi, are shown in Fig.4. The lowest accessibility was observed for LmrA alone or in the presence of MgATPγS or MgADP. In the presence of MgATP, the Trp accessibility to the aqueous environment is strongly enhanced. An intermediate level was observed for LmrA in the presence of MgADP/Pi. These observations indicate clearly that binding of MgATP itself does not affect the accessibility of tryptophan to the aqueous medium but that ATP hydrolysis is needed to increase the Trp accessibility to the aqueous quencher. After hydrolysis, when Pi is still associated with LmrA, Trp accessibility decreases to a intermediate level. After Pirelease, the initial accessibility of Trp to the solvent is restored. Previous experiments have suggested that Pgp may exist in different conformational states during its catalytic cycle (13.Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol.

The present study provides evidence that its procaryotic homolog LmrA undergoes similar secondary and tertiary structural changes during the ATP hydrolysis process. Purified and functionally reconstituted LmrA into liposomes (18.Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) does not contain other cellular constituents and is therefore ideally suited for analysis of the protein structure by ATR-FTIR and fluorescence quenching experiments. ATR-FTIR measurements reveal that LmrA, in the absence of nucleotides, contains 35% α-helix, 24% β-sheet, 28% β-turn, and 13% random coil. This proportion of α-helices is higher than the proportion expected when only six transmembrane segments (20%) are in an α-helical conformation. External α-helices therefore have to be present. Interestingly, the proportions of the different secondary structures in LmrA is similar to that determined for Pgp by ATR-FTIR (13.Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The addition of MgATP, MgADP/Pi, and MgATPγS leads to a reorganization of the hydrogen bonds of the protein as indicated by the enrichment of β-sheet conformation (approximately 10%) in LmrA. LmrA clearly stabilizes in a different secondary structure after ATP binding. It falls back to its initial secondary structure after Pi release, when ADP is still bound to LmrA. Three hypotheses could explain this ATP binding-mediated change of the secondary structure. ATP binding could cause a reorganization of the drug binding site(s). In Pgp, the membrane-spanning α-helices are implicated in drug recognition and transport (30.Chen C.-J. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 381-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar, 31.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11417-11425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In analogy, the sequence homologies between LmrA and each half of Pgp (10.van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that the same holds for LmrA. Since the α-helix content of LmrA is similar to that of Pgp and does not change in the presence of nucleotides, this first hypothesis probably does not explain the secondary structure change of LmrA. ATP binding could also mediate a reorganization of its binding site. Since the ATPase activities of LmrA and Pgp are very similar (12.van Veen H.W. Callaghan R. Soceneantu L. Sardini A. Konings W.N. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and since Pgp does not show an enrichment in β-sheet that could change its ability to bind or hydrolyze ATP (13.Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), this explanation must be rejected. Since this enrichment in β-sheet is not observed for Pgp and since the ATPase and transport activities of Pgp and LmrA are very similar, it can be postulated that the secondary structure change observed for LmrA after ATP binding is related to a typical behavior of this protein. The primary structure homology of LmrA and each half of Pgp demonstrates that LmrA is a half-molecule of Pgp (10.van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Their comparable activities suggest that LmrA must be homodimeric to be active. This has been confirmed recently by fusion of two functional LmrA molecules. 3H. W. van Veen, A. Margolles, M. Müller, R. Callaghan, C. Martin, C. F. Higgins, and W. N. Konings, submitted for publication. Consequently, ATP could mediate the secondary structural change required for the organization of LmrA in its homodimeric form. After ATP hydrolysis and Pi release, the protein recovers its initial secondary structure and monomeric form. Amide 2H/H exchange, followed during the time of exposure of the sample to D2O-saturated N2, allows us to determine the accessibility of the amide hydrogens to the aqueous medium. The kinetics of deuteration of LmrA were observed in the presence or absence of MgATP, MgATPγS, MgADP, and MgADP/Pi. 2H/H exchange measurements provided evidence that a large portion of LmrA is poorly accessible to the aqueous medium. The slowly exchanging amino acids, characterized by a half-decay T 3 = 500 min, represent 55% of the total amino acid content of the protein. The presence of a large amide population, characterized by a very low exchange rate, could be due, in part, to the shielding effect of the membrane on a large number of residues. Transmembrane domains of several membrane proteins, as glycophorin and bacteriorhodopsin, are inaccessible to the solvent as shown by their slow kinetics of amide 2H/H exchange (33.Challou N. Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Conrath K. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6902-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,34.Vigneron L. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17685-17696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The slowly exchanging amide protons of LmrA could therefore be formed by a core of amino acids located within the membrane. However, according to the protein sequence, the predicted transmembrane domains of LmrA account for only 20% of the total amino acids (10.van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A significant proportion of the slowly exchanging amino acids must therefore form additional membrane domains or be located outside the membrane, where they probably form highly structured domains. The kinetics of deuteration of Pgp showed also a large inaccessible fraction (53%) of the protein, whereas only 20% of the total amino acid content of the protein is predicted to be located inside the membrane, suggesting the existence of similar highly structured domains outside the membrane (13.Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The analysis of the amide 2H/H exchange rates allows a determination of the effects of the secondary structure change, observed in the presence of MgATP, MgATPγS, and MgADP/Pi, on the accessibility of LmrA to the aqueous medium. The main changes in the accessibility of LmrA take place in the presence of MgATP. In the presence of MgATP, the inaccessible amino acids decrease from 318 to 260. In the presence of MgADP/Pi, the inaccessible amino acids only decrease to 289, while no changes are observed with MgADP or MgATPγS. Obviously, the secondary structural change, observed in the presence of MgATP, MgATPγS, and MgADP/Pi, is not responsible for the accessibility change of LmrA. Indeed, LmrA in the presence of MgATPγS shows an enrichment in β-sheet but no variation in the inaccessible amino acids, when compared with the situation in the absence of ligand. Since the change of accessibility, observed in the presence of MgATP and MgADP/Pi, is not related to the change of secondary structure, it could be correlated to a change in the tertiary structure of LmrA. A similar effect of MgATP on the accessibility of Pgp has been demonstrated (13.Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14.Sonveaux N. Vigano C. Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17649-17654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching experiments confirm the existence of conformational changes of LmrA in the presence of MgATP or MgADP/Pi. The quenching of the Trp fluorescence of LmrA is the same in the presence or absence of MgATPγS, confirming that the change in the secondary structure does not affect the accessibility of the protein to the aqueous medium. MgADP does not modify the accessibility of the protein, as observed for the 2H/H kinetics. The results of this study reveal that LmrA undergoes a secondary structure change and passes through three different conformational states during its catalytic cycle. After binding of ATP, the protein structure is enriched in β-sheet. When ATP hydrolysis takes place, the tertiary structure of the protein changes, and the protein adopts a more accessible conformation. A third conformation is reached after ATP hydrolysis, when Pi is still associated to the protein. In this conformation, the protein shows an accessibility that is in between the closed conformation, observed in the absence of nucleotides, and the opened conformation, observed in the presence of ATP. After Pi release, the protein recovers its initial secondary and tertiary structures."

The present study examined the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling as well as the expression and activity of cell cycle proteins in FGF2-stimulated intimal smooth muscle cells. FGF2 activates ERKs 1 and 2, and Western blot analysis showed that cyclin D, cyclin E, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDKs) 2 and 4 were expressed in intimal smooth muscle cells after FGF2 infusion. FGF2 stimulation, however, did not lead to phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), CDK 2 activation, or expression of cyclin A. Western blot analysis showed that intimal smooth muscle cells express elevated levels of the cell cycle inhibitors p15<sup>INK4b</sup> and p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, compared with medial smooth muscle cells, and that FGF2 stimulation does not reduce the level of these inhibitors. These studies suggest that despite activation of ERKs 1 and 2 and expression of the cell cycle activators, cyclin D and cyclin E, high levels of cell cycle inhibitors may inhibit cell cycle transit in FGF2-stimulated intimal smooth muscle cells."

However, the molecular mechanisms mediating PTH's inhibitory effect on in vitro biomineralization reactions have not been elucidated yet. The first 34 amino acid residues in PTH contain most of the biological activity of the full-length, natural hormone including ligand-receptor binding and signal transduction functions (26.Nutt R.F.

Two major plasma membrane reactions occur as a result of PTH's binding to its receptor that then initiate three intracellular signaling cascades. First, there is a G protein-coupled stimulation of adenylate cyclase that produces cAMP and thereby activates protein kinase A (PKA) (28.Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8443-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, there is a stimulation of phospholipase C activity, which produces inositol triphosphate and diacyl glycerol, thereby activating intracellular calcium release and protein kinase C, respectively (29.Hruska K.A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5285-5291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and deposit a bioapatitic mineral phase in their extracellular matrix when exposed to phosphate supplements (33.Stanford C.M. Jacobson P.A. Eanes E.D. Lembke L.A. Midura R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9420-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This biomineralization process is an active metabolic process requiring ongoing protein synthesis and secretion (33.Stanford C.M. Jacobson P.A. Eanes E.D. Lembke L.A. Midura R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9420-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this current study aimed to (a) determine whether the biomineralization process exhibited by UMR osteoblastic cells, like primary osteoblasts, is inhibited by PTH, (b) identify the predominant signal transduction process that leads to this inhibitory effect, and (c) identify whether BSP is involved in these PTH-regulated biomineralization reactions.DISCUSSIONThe results indicate that PTH reversibly inhibits the biomineralization process of UMR cultures even at doses approaching physiological significance. These findings are remarkably similar to those previously reported for primary cultures of osteoblasts (22.Bellows C.G. Ishida H. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and growth chondrocytes (24.Kato Y. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Suzuki F. Jikko A. Iwamoto M.

Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported that PTH-(1–84) suppressed bone nodule formation in primary osteoblast cultures derived from newborn rat calvaria. PTH's potency (ED50 ∼ 0.05 nm), reversibility, and efficacy at a late stage in the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells are nearly identical with those obtained for UMR cells in this study. Katoet al. (24.Kato Y. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Suzuki F. Jikko A. Iwamoto M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported that either PTH-(1–84) or PTH-(1–34) suppressed the calcification of primary chondrocyte cultures derived from rabbit costal cartilage. Again, PTH's potency (ED50∼ 1–2 nm), reversibility, and need for long term treatment to maximize the inhibitory effects are consistent with the same parameters in the current study. Thus, PTH's suppression of the biomineralization capacity of UMR cells is a natural response and not one specific to highly differentiated osteosarcoma cells in vitro.Since the effects of PTH can be blocked by selective PKA inhibitors and mimicked by selective PKA activators, it is concluded that PTH initiates its effects on UMR biomineralization via its activation of PKA. While Kato et al. (24.Kato Y. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Suzuki F. Jikko A. Iwamoto M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) did not address potential signaling mechanisms, Bellows et al. (22.Bellows C.G. Ishida H. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported that steady-state cAMP levels in primary osteoblast cultures were only marginally elevated at a PTH-(1–84) dose that completely inhibited bone nodule formation (1 nm). These authors raised the possibility that cAMP may not be critically involved in transducing the inhibitory effects of the hormone. However, given the asynchrony of differentiation in these cultures, only a portion of the total cell population would at any time point respond to PTH with a large increase in intracellular cAMP levels. In addition, the transient nature of cAMP as a second messenger places a temporal constraint on the ability to detect high steady-state levels of cAMP in heterogenous cell populations. Thus, calvarial osteoblasts might have produced enough cAMP at lower PTH doses to activate PKA sufficiently to initiate this hormone's suppression of biomineralization. It has yet to be reported whether PTH's activation of PKA is involved in the suppression of calcification of chondrocyte cultures (24.Kato Y. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Suzuki F. Jikko A. Iwamoto M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25.Iwamoto M. Shapiro I.M. Yagami K. Boskey A.L. Leboy P.S. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).The UMR cell line consists of a homogenous population of osteoblastic cells that yields a uniform temporal response to PTH exposure in vitro. The efficacy of specific PKA inhibitors at blocking PTH's suppression of biomineralization in UMR cultures provides clear proof that PKA is at least involved in the initiation of the inhibitory response, while other signaling processes activated by PTH do not seem to initiate the suppressive effects. The use of selective agents to constitutively activate PKA in UMR cultures and a substantial reversal using simultaneous exposure to PKA inhibitors mimic the suppression of biomineralization by PTH, while activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters or protein kinase G with cGMP does not. Altogether, these data argue that the mechanism underlying PTH's suppression of the biomineralization response of UMR cells is initiated by PKA activation. Given the similarities between UMR and primary cells in response to PTH, it is likely that PKA activation is involved also in the suppression of biomineralization by normal osteoblast and chondrocyte cultures.An in vivo disorder known as McCune-Albright Syndrome is the result of a constitutively activated stimulatory G protein (Gsα) within somatic cells leading to abnormally high steady-state levels of intracellular cAMP (61.Spiegel A.M. Horm. Res. 1997; 47: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The histopathological evaluation of this disease in bone shows a fibrous dysplasia appearing as ample osteoid-like matrix deposition but poorly mineralized (62.Shenker A. Weinstein L.S. Sweet D.E. Spiegel A.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, radiographic analysis of fibrous dysplasia patients reveals a lower than normal bone mineral content and a higher incidence of bone fractures (13.Voytek T.M. Ro J.Y. Edeiken J. Ayala A.G. Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 1995; 19: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 62.Shenker A. Weinstein L.S. Sweet D.E. Spiegel A.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, a constitutive hyperactivation of PKA in the bone tissues of McCune-Albright Syndrome patients correlates with a reduced bone mineral content in vivo, consistent with our observations of osteoblastic cells in vitro.A quantitative, spatial co-localization exists between BSP and apatite deposits in the UMR model system. Kinetic analysis of the biomineralization process reveals that a substantial amount of BSP is deposited in the extracellular matrix of UMR cultures treated with β-GP a few hours before the first apatite deposits are detected, which subsequently appear in close proximity to the BSP deposits. These findings suggest that a prior accumulation of BSP in the extracellular matrix of UMR cultures is a diagnostic reporter of subsequent apatite deposition and may be involved in the mineralization process itself.In direct proportion to its negative effects on apatite deposition, PTH also reversibly blocks the deposition of BSP in the extracellular matrix of UMR cultures. Cultures treated with PTH or cAMP analogs did not deposit either BSP or apatite in their extracellular matrix. Yet, when either agent is removed and the cultures are allowed to recover, they begin to deposit both BSP and apatite in their matrix in proportional amounts. Since BSP normally accumulates in the extracellular matrix of UMR cultures prior to apatite deposition, we hypothesize that PTH's transient activation of PKA early in the culture period leads to subsequent alterations in the assembly of an extracellular matrix, which does not allow BSP retention even in the presence of elevated phosphate levels.In conclusion, low doses of PTH reversibly suppress apatite and BSP deposition in UMR cultures via an activation of PKA. Two major points can be drawn from this conclusion. First, any external signal that ultimately hyperactivates PKA in osteoblasts should manifest an impact on bone matrix production and subsequent mineralization. Second, bone matrix proteins such as BSP may need to be assembled in specific conformations in osteoid in order to promote mineralization reactions. Experiments are ongoing to determine whether this effect is more a function of a change in BSP's post-translational modifications (6.Midura R.J. McQuillan D.J. Benham K.J. Fisher L.W. Hascall V.C. J.

To date, several biomineralization theories have been formulated, and each advances a mechanistic model to explain bone formation (3.Bonucci E. Bone Miner. 1992; 17: 219-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lately, these models have emphasized the role of several bone-specific, noncollagenous proteins (4.Roach H.I. Cell Biol. Int. 1994; 18: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) as promoting the tightly regulated processes of apatite crystal nucleation and growth in an extracellular environment.

Again, PTH's potency (ED50∼ 1–2 nm), reversibility, and need for long term treatment to maximize the inhibitory effects are consistent with the same parameters in the current study. Thus, PTH's suppression of the biomineralization capacity of UMR cells is a natural response and not one specific to highly differentiated osteosarcoma cells in vitro.Since the effects of PTH can be blocked by selective PKA inhibitors and mimicked by selective PKA activators, it is concluded that PTH initiates its effects on UMR biomineralization via its activation of PKA. While Kato et al. (24.Kato Y. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Suzuki F. Jikko A. Iwamoto M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) did not address potential signaling mechanisms, Bellows et al. (22.Bellows C.G. Ishida H. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3111-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported that steady-state cAMP levels in primary osteoblast cultures were only marginally elevated at a PTH-(1–84) dose that completely inhibited bone nodule formation (1 nm). These authors raised the possibility that cAMP may not be critically involved in transducing the inhibitory effects of the hormone. However, given the asynchrony of differentiation in these cultures, only a portion of the total cell population would at any time point respond to PTH with a large increase in intracellular cAMP levels. In addition, the transient nature of cAMP as a second messenger places a temporal constraint on the ability to detect high steady-state levels of cAMP in heterogenous cell populations. Thus, calvarial osteoblasts might have produced enough cAMP at lower PTH doses to activate PKA sufficiently to initiate this hormone's suppression of biomineralization. It has yet to be reported whether PTH's activation of PKA is involved in the suppression of calcification of chondrocyte cultures (24.Kato Y. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Suzuki F. Jikko A. Iwamoto M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25.Iwamoto M. Shapiro I.M. Yagami K. Boskey A.L. Leboy P.S. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).The UMR cell line consists of a homogenous population of osteoblastic cells that yields a uniform temporal response to PTH exposure in vitro. The efficacy of specific PKA inhibitors at blocking PTH's suppression of biomineralization in UMR cultures provides clear proof that PKA is at least involved in the initiation of the inhibitory response, while other signaling processes activated by PTH do not seem to initiate the suppressive effects. The use of selective agents to constitutively activate PKA in UMR cultures and a substantial reversal using simultaneous exposure to PKA inhibitors mimic the suppression of biomineralization by PTH, while activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters or protein kinase G with cGMP does not. Altogether, these data argue that the mechanism underlying PTH's suppression of the biomineralization response of UMR cells is initiated by PKA activation. Given the similarities between UMR and primary cells in response to PTH, it is likely that PKA activation is involved also in the suppression of biomineralization by normal osteoblast and chondrocyte cultures.An in vivo disorder known as McCune-Albright Syndrome is the result of a constitutively activated stimulatory G protein (Gsα) within somatic cells leading to abnormally high steady-state levels of intracellular cAMP (61.Spiegel A.M. Horm. Res. 1997; 47: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The histopathological evaluation of this disease in bone shows a fibrous dysplasia appearing as ample osteoid-like matrix deposition but poorly mineralized (62.Shenker A. Weinstein L.S. Sweet D.E. Spiegel A.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, radiographic analysis of fibrous dysplasia patients reveals a lower than normal bone mineral content and a higher incidence of bone fractures (13.Voytek T.M. Ro J.Y. Edeiken J. Ayala A.G. Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 1995; 19: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 62.Shenker A. Weinstein L.S. Sweet D.E. Spiegel A.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, a constitutive hyperactivation of PKA in the bone tissues of McCune-Albright Syndrome patients correlates with a reduced bone mineral content in vivo, consistent with our observations of osteoblastic cells in vitro.A quantitative, spatial co-localization exists between BSP and apatite deposits in the UMR model system. Kinetic analysis of the biomineralization process reveals that a substantial amount of BSP is deposited in the extracellular matrix of UMR cultures treated with β-GP a few hours before the first apatite deposits are detected, which subsequently appear in close proximity to the BSP deposits. These findings suggest that a prior accumulation of BSP in the extracellular matrix of UMR cultures is a diagnostic reporter of subsequent apatite deposition and may be involved in the mineralization process itself.In direct proportion to its negative effects on apatite deposition, PTH also reversibly blocks the deposition of BSP in the extracellular matrix of UMR cultures. Cultures treated with PTH or cAMP analogs did not deposit either BSP or apatite in their extracellular matrix. Yet, when either agent is removed and the cultures are allowed to recover, they begin to deposit both BSP and apatite in their matrix in proportional amounts. Since BSP normally accumulates in the extracellular matrix of UMR cultures prior to apatite deposition, we hypothesize that PTH's transient activation of PKA early in the culture period leads to subsequent alterations in the assembly of an extracellular matrix, which does not allow BSP retention even in the presence of elevated phosphate levels.In conclusion, low doses of PTH reversibly suppress apatite and BSP deposition in UMR cultures via an activation of PKA. Two major points can be drawn from this conclusion. First, any external signal that ultimately hyperactivates PKA in osteoblasts should manifest an impact on bone matrix production and subsequent mineralization. Second, bone matrix proteins such as BSP may need to be assembled in specific conformations in osteoid in order to promote mineralization reactions. Experiments are ongoing to determine whether this effect is more a function of a change in BSP's post-translational modifications (6.Midura R.J. McQuillan D.J. Benham K.J. Fisher L.W. Hascall V.C. J.

The results indicate that PTH reversibly inhibits the biomineralization process of UMR cultures even at doses approaching physiological significance. These findings are remarkably similar to those previously reported for primary cultures of osteoblasts (22.Bellows C.G. Ishida H. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N.

PTH's potency (ED50 ∼ 0.05 nm), reversibility, and efficacy at a late stage in the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells are nearly identical with those obtained for UMR cells in this study. Katoet al. (24.Kato Y. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Suzuki F. Jikko A. Iwamoto M.

It is shown that ultraviolet B light supported only limited synthesis of protein D1, one of the most important components of photosystem II, whereas it promoted significant degradation of proteins D1 and D2. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of photosystem II subunits was specifically elicited upon exposure to ultraviolet B light. Structural modifications of photosystem II and changes in its lateral distribution between granum membranes and stroma-exposed lamellae were found to be different from those observed after photoinhibition by strong visible light. In particular, more complete dismantling of photosystem II cores was observed. Altogether, the data reported here suggest that ultraviolet B radiation alone fails to activate the photosystem II repair cycle, as hypothesized for visible light. This failure may contribute to the toxic effect of ultraviolet B radiation, which is increasing as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric ozone.

This phenomenon, first described over the Antarctic Circle, is now extending significantly even to temperate regions (1.Kerr J.B. McElroy C.T. Science. 1993; 262: 1032-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). It has been shown that even low levels of ultraviolet B light may harm most biological organisms, land plants being particularly sensitive to this radiation (2.Quaite F.E. Shuterland B.M.

As a consequence of damage, loss of photosynthesis and degradation of reaction center proteins D1 and D2 occur. Studies carried out using in vitro systems have shown that irradiation with ultraviolet B light brings about a loss of protein D1, paralleled by the appearance of an immunodetectable C-terminal fragment of 20 kDa (17.Friso G. Spetea C. Giacometti G.M. Vass I. Barbato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 78-84Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This fragment is produced by cleavage in the second transmembrane α-helix (17.Friso G. Spetea C. Giacometti G.M. Vass I. Barbato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 78-84Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in a reaction depending on the presence of manganese ions bound at the catalytic site(s) of the PSII donor side (10.Barbato R. Frizzo A. Friso G. Rigoni F. Giacometti G.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 27: 723-729Crossref Google Scholar). Degradation of protein D2 upon ultraviolet B exposure occurs bothin vitro (18.Friso G. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 339: 217-221Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and in vivo (19.Jansen M.A.K. Greenberg B.M. Edelman M. Mattoo A.-K. Gaba V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 814-817Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although the appearance of specific degradation fragments of protein D2 has so far been reported only in vitro (18.Friso G. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 339: 217-221Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since protein cleavage was observed only when the QA site was at least partially active, a role for the bound quinone in the ultraviolet B-induced degradation of protein D2 was inferred. Recently, the possible role of protein phosphorylation in ultraviolet B-mediated degradation of proteins D1 and D2 has been proposed, suggesting the possible presence of proteolytic activity involved in the degradative process (20.Barbato R. Bergo E. Giacometti G.M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1999; 48: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A feature that makes PSII unique among membrane protein complexes is the rapid light-dependent turnover of its reaction center subunit, D1 (21.Mattoo A.-K. Pick U. Hoffman-Falk H. Edelman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1572-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Degradation of protein D1 induced by visible light is known to affect both the structural organization and lateral distribution of PSII centers (22.Barbato R. Friso G. Rigoni F. Dalla Vecchia F. Giacometti G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23.Kettunen R. Tyystjärvi E. Aro E.-M. Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. IV.

Current Research in Photosynthesis. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1990: 733-738Crossref Google Scholar). These modifications are thought to be part of a repair cycle in which damaged centers migrate from granum stacks to stroma-exposed membranes, where insertion of newly synthesized protein D1 takes place (for a review, see Ref. 25.Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). Synthesis of protein D1 is regulated mainly at the translational level, through the thioredoxin system and ADP-dependent protein phosphorylation (26.Bruick R.K. Mayfield S.P. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 190-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, at least in cyanobacteria, the synthesis and degradation of protein D1 are synchronized, indicating interplay between the two phenomena (27.Komenda J. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1996; 34: 9625-9631Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently been shown that in higher plants such as Spirodela oligorhiza, pumpkin, and spinach, reversible phosphorylation of protein D1 plays an important role in the regulation of this degradative process (28.Rintamäki E. Kettunen R. Aro E.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14870-14875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 29.Elich T.D. Edelman M. Mattoo A.-K. J. Biol.

Res. 1996; 50: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), dephosphorylation of protein D1 being a compulsory step in its degradation pathway (28.Rintamäki E. Kettunen R. Aro E.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14870-14875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Reversible phosphorylation of other PSII polypeptides (CP43, D2, PsbH) is believed to be involved in coordinating dismantling of damaged centers and their lateral redistribution (31.Baena-Gonzalez E. Barbato R. Aro E.-M. Planta (Heidelb.). 1999; 208: 196-204Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Whether degradation of reaction center proteins induced by ultraviolet B light alone or in combination with visible light has the same effect on PSII structure and lateral distribution is currently unknown. In cyanobacteria, the loss of the dimeric form of PSII induced by ultraviolet B has been shown (32.Giacometti G.M. Barbato R. Chiaramonte S. Friso G. Rigoni F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 799-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, selective dissociation of the inner antenna CP43, mediated by degradation of protein D1, was not detected. Instead, full dismantling of PSII was observed. Whether this is a general effect of ultraviolet B light or a peculiarity of these organisms, in which phosphorylation of core proteins and lateral differentiation of thylakoids are lacking (33.Anderson J.M Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 37: 93-136Crossref Google Scholar,34.Anderson J.M. Aro E.-M. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 41: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), is still an open question. In this study, we report that ultraviolet B light affects protein D1 turnover as well as PSII stability and lateral redistribution, with significant differences with respect to what has been observed under photoinhibitory conditions by visible light. Throughout this study, we used 10 μmol·m−2·s−1 ultraviolet B light, an intensity chosen because its ecological importance is similar to that detected under natural conditions. The intensity of the control visible light (100 μmol·m−2·s−1) was sufficient to drive photosynthesis without photoinhibitory effects. Kernels of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were soaked in tap water for some hours, planted in a mixture of autoclaved vermiculite/garden soil, and vernalized for 48 h at 4 °C. Plants were grown for 7–10 days at 22 °C, with a light intensity of 100 μmol·m−2·s−1 and a photoperiod of 12 h. Relative humidity was 70%. Barley leaves were cut and floated in water. Detached leaves were irradiated using a Vilbert-Lourmat 215M lamp as an ultraviolet B source. The lamp was wrapped in cellulose diacetate foil (0.15-mm thick) to screen out any ultraviolet C component emitted by the ultraviolet B source. Light intensity at the sample surface was 10 μmol·m−2·s−1, as measured with a Skye UV-B sensor. For thylakoid isolation, plants were frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized with a mortar and pestle to a fine powder, and ground in grinding buffer (50 mm Tricine (pH 8.0), 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaF, and 0.33 msorbitol). After filtering through eight layers of cotton gauze, thylakoids were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 4500 ×g. Pellets were resuspended in grinding buffer without sorbitol. Thylakoids were again pelleted and then resuspended in grinding buffer. The activity of thylakoids, as measured by oxygen evolution in the presence of 0.5 mm2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone as an electron acceptor, was in the range of 100–140 μmol of O2·mg of chlorophyll−1·h−1. For digitonin fractionation (35.Kyle D.J. Kuang T.Y. Watson J.L Arntzen C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 89-96Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar), thylakoids were made up to 0.4 mg of chlorophyll·ml−1, and digitonin was added to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v). This suspension was incubated for 30 min in ice with stirring and then diluted with 10 volumes of digitonin-free buffer. Unsolubilized material was eliminated by centrifugation for 5 min at 4000 × g, and granum-, margin-, and stroma-enriched fractions were isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 (10 min), 40,000 (30 min), and 100,000 (90 min) × g, respectively. Thylakoids were resuspended in sucrose-free buffer, and n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v). After 5 min of incubation on ice, unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 ×g, and the supernatant (equivalent to 60 μg of chlorophyll) was loaded on the top of a 4-ml 0.1–1.0 m sucrose gradient made up in 10 mm Tricine (pH 7.8), 10 mm NaF, and 0.03%n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. Gradients were spun for 5 h at 56,000 rpm in a Kontron TST 60.4 rotor at 4 °C. After centrifugation, sucrose gradients were fractionated into 20 aliquots (200 μl each), each of which was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (see below). SDS gel electrophoresis in the presence of 6 m urea was carried out as described previously (36.Barbato R. Friso G. Giardi M.T. Rigoni F. Giacometti G.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10220-10226Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were again transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the carbonate/bicarbonate-based buffer described in Ref. 37.Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar. Blots were immunodecorated as described elsewhere (21.Mattoo A.-K. Pick U. Hoffman-Falk H. Edelman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1572-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 35.Kyle D.J. Kuang T.Y. Watson J.L Arntzen C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 89-96Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The properties of polyclonal antibodies to different PSII subunits and LHCII used in this study have been described previously (22.Barbato R. Friso G. Rigoni F. Dalla Vecchia F. Giacometti G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to phosphothreonine-containing proteins were fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) and were used as described (38.Rintamäki E. Salonen M. Suoranta U.M. Carlberg I. Andersson B. Aro E.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30476-30482Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Immunoreactions were detected using a chemiluminescence kit (either New England Biolabs Inc. or Pierce SuperSignal for alkaline- or peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively) and were visualized by autoradiography using Fuji RX as detection film. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographic films was performed with a GelDoc 1000 system and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Forin vivo labeling, barley leaves were cut into 0.5-cm segments and incubated in a solution containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. For synthesis experiments, labeling was carried out for either 3 or 6 h under the following irradiation conditions: dark, ultraviolet B light (10 μmol·m−2·s−1), and white light (100 μmol·m−2·s−1). For degradation experiments, labeling was instead carried out under visible light for 90 min as described above. Leaves were then incubated in 1 mm unlabeled methionine for the desired periods of time under different irradiation conditions: dark, ultraviolet B light (10 μmol·m−2·s−1), and visible light (100 μmol·m−2·s−1) for 2, 4, 8, and 22 h. The temperature was 24 °C. After urea/SDS-PAGE, gels were stained with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R-250 in methanol/water/acetic acid (5:5:1 by volume) and destained in 7.5% acetic acid and 10% methanol. Before vacuum-drying, gels were soaked in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h and then subjected to fluorography. 7 μg of chlorophyll were applied to each gel lane. A second gel (containing 1 μg of chlorophyll/lane) was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride. The filter was subjected to autoradiography and then probed with antibody to protein D1 or other PSII subunits. Samples from differently irradiated leaves were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 3% glutaraldehyde and 0.1m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.9) and then processed for electron microscopy according as described (39.Rascio N. Mariani P. Dalla Vecchia F. Zanchin A. Pool A. Larcher W. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 144: 314-323Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections, cut with an ultramicrotome (Ultracut, Reichert-Jung), were observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM 300, Itachi) operating at 75 kV. Chlorophyll fluorescence analyses were performed with a PAM 101 fluorometer (Waltz). The steady-state levels of reaction center proteins D1 (panel A) and D2 (panel B) after different periods of exposure of the leaves to ultraviolet B light (lanes 1–4) are shown in Fig.1. A quantitative estimate by densitometric analysis of the immunoblot in panel A is given in panel C (circles). As previously reported, polypeptides D1 and D2 are particularly sensitive to ultraviolet B radiation (17.Friso G. Spetea C. Giacometti G.M. Vass I. Barbato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 78-84Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19.Jansen M.A.K. Greenberg B.M. Edelman M. Mattoo A.-K. Gaba V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 814-817Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, the steady-state levels of both reaction center proteins decreased to ∼45% of the original value after 8 h of irradiation (panels A and B, lanes 1–4; see also Ref.20.Barbato R. Bergo E. Giacometti G.M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1999; 48: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The steady-state levels of other PSII core polypeptides such as CP47 and CP43 were not significantly affected under these conditions (data not shown). No variation in the level of any thylakoid polypeptide was observed upon irradiation with visible light at the intensity used in this study (100 μmol·m−2·s−1), as shown in the case of proteins D1 and D2 (lanes 5–8). The loss of PSII activity (as measured by theF V/F M ratio) is also reported in Fig. 1 C (squares). The decrease in the protein D1 level was correlated in time and amplitude with the loss of PSII activity. The apparent faster decay of protein D1 is not significant, as the difference is within the experimental error. The result is relevant because during photoinhibition by visible light, the level of protein D1 decays at a much lower rate than photosynthetic activity (9.Vass I. Pessarakli M. Handbook of Photosynthesis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 931-949Google Scholar). In principle, the loss of the steady-state level of reaction center proteins observed upon exposure to ultraviolet B light may be due to enhanced degradation, reduced synthesis of the protein, or to both phenomena together. To investigate this point, two types of labeling experiments were performed: (i) labeling of whole leaves during irradiation with either visible or ultraviolet B light and (ii) [35S]methionine labeling of leaves under visible illumination and chase of radioactivity under either visible or ultraviolet B light. Control plants were kept in the dark under the same conditions in the presence of the label. Results from the first type of experiment in which barley leaves were labeled are shown in Fig. 2. Panel A shows a Coomassie Blue-stained gel: no significant differences were observed between the samples under the various conditions. A gel containing the same samples as in panel A, but with only 1 μg of chlorophyll (instead of 7) to avoid saturation, was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and, before immunodetection, subjected to autoradiography (panel B). It was apparent that on a chlorophyll basis, the samples labeled under ultraviolet B light (lanes 2 and 5) incorporated less radioactivity than the samples labeled under white light (lanes 1 and 4). Samples incubated with the label in the dark contained some radioactivity at the level of LHCII (lanes 3 and 6), but not at the level of protein D1. Densitometric evaluation of several autoradiographic films similar to that in panel D indicated that incorporation of radioactivity under white light was higher than that under ultraviolet B by a factor of ∼2. In the magnification shown in panel D, the different positions of LHCII (lower portion of the band) and protein D1 (upper portion) are clearly evident. It may be observed that (i) only the LHCII fraction is significantly labeled in the dark (lanes 3 and 6); (ii) LHCII labeling is essentially the same in the various lanes; and (iii) under both ultraviolet B and visible light, incorporation of radioactivity in protein D1 is already saturated after 3 h of incubation with the label. An immunoblot probed with antibody to protein D1 is shown in Fig.2 C. According to the data reported above, some 30% of total protein D1 was lost during irradiation, and the typical 20-kDa C-terminal D1 breakdown fragment was detected (lanes 2 and5). Results from the second type of experiment are shown in Fig.3. It was possible to compare directly the degradation rate of protein D1 under the two irradiation conditions in this experiment. Panel A shows a Coomassie Blue-stained gel: no significant differences were observed between samples. From the autoradiography results shown in panel B, it can be seen that ultraviolet B light promoted faster degradation of protein D1 than visible light, by a factor of ∼2. This was evaluated from densitometric analysis of the magnification of the protein D1 lane, as reported in panel D. The immunoblot (panel C) shows the expected loss of the steady-state level of protein D1, which paralleled the loss of radioactivity (lanes 1–5). After 22 h of exposure to ultraviolet B, protein D1 was barely detectable, either by autoradiography (panel B, lane 5) or immunoblotting (panel C, lane 5). Instead, the level of protein D1 under visible light, both as radioactive protein (panel B, lane 11) and total protein (panel C, lanes 6–11), remained constant. The next question we posed was whether and to what extent degradation of proteins D1 and D2 affects the structural organization of PSII centers. To answer this question, thylakoids isolated from plants irradiated for 3 and 6 h were solubilized with n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. This technique allows the resolution of the thylakoid membrane into the main photosynthetic complexes, preserving the oligomeric structure of the different complexes if solubilization conditions are carefully controlled. As reported previously by us (22.Barbato R. Friso G. Rigoni F. Dalla Vecchia F. Giacometti G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31.Baena-Gonzalez E. Barbato R. Aro E.-M. Planta (Heidelb.). 1999; 208: 196-204Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and others (41.van Wijk K.-J. Bingsmark S. Aro E.-M. Andersson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25685-25695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), four pigmented bands were resolved under our experimental conditions. These were named B1 to B4 in order of increasing mobility. On the basis of optical properties (absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy), polypeptide content, and reactivity with monospecific polyclonal antibodies, these bands have been identified as monomeric (B1) and trimeric (B2) LHCII, monomeric PSII core complex (B3), and monomeric PSI superimposed on dimeric PSII (B4). It has previously been shown that variation in the supramolecular organization of photosynthetic complexes following light stress can easily be detected by the combination of sucrose gradient centrifugation and immunoblotting (22.Barbato R. Friso G. Rigoni F. Dalla Vecchia F. Giacometti G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,31.Baena-Gonzalez E. Barbato R. Aro E.-M. Planta (Heidelb.). 1999; 208: 196-204Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For example, a transition from the dimeric to monomeric form of PSII may be seen as a shift of immunoreactivity from fractions corresponding to the bottom (where the dimeric form migrates) to fractions corresponding to the middle (where the monomeric form is located); dissociation of CP43 from the core of PSII is detected as an increase in immunoreactivity in fractions corresponding to a upper region of the sucrose gradient. According to this scheme, thylakoids isolated from control and ultraviolet B-treated plants were isolated, solubilized with n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described above. Gradients were fractionated into 20 aliquots (200 μl each), loaded onto a 20-well gel, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as shown in Fig. 4. Lane 1contains unfractionated thylakoids, whereas lanes 2–19contain the respective fractions from the sucrose gradients (from top to bottom). Therefore, lanes 2–8 correspond to green bands B1 and B2 (i.e. antenna and other monomeric proteins);lanes 9–12 correspond to band B3 (monomeric PSII core); andlanes 14–18 correspond to band B4 (i.e. dimeric PSII and monomeric PSI). When probed with antibodies to PSII proteins (a mixture of anti-CP47, anti-D2, and anti-D1 antibodies) two immunoreactive peaks, corresponding to monomeric (fractions 9–12, band B3) and dimeric (fractions 14–18, band B4) PSII cores, were observed with thylakoids from control leaves (panel A). The same kind of distribution was obtained when antibodies to other PSII subunits such as anti-CP43 and anti-cytochromeb 559 α-subunit antibodies were used (data not shown). Upon ultraviolet B irradiation, the intensity of immunoreactions corresponding to the dimeric form did not decrease (panels B and C). These results indicate that, as far as ultraviolet B irradiation is concerned, inactivation of PSII centers, as evaluated by loss of variable fluorescence and degradation of proteins D1 and D2, does not induce monomerization of the centers. Using the same procedure based on sucrose gradient fractionation and immunoblotting, we found that the 20-kDa C-terminal D1 fragment was present in both bands B3 and B4 (Fig. 4 C). In the same sucrose gradient bands, polypeptide D2, CP43, CP47, the cytochromeb 559 subunit, and intact protein D1 were also found (data not shown). No breakdown fragments were observed in fractions from the top of the gradients, which contained free-running proteins. These data indicate that inactivation of centers and cleavage of protein D1 do not induce release of any damaged protein. It should be noted that according to previous data on the effect of high visible light (22.Barbato R. Friso G. Rigoni F. Dalla Vecchia F. Giacometti G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31.Baena-Gonzalez E. Barbato R. Aro E.-M. Planta (Heidelb.). 1999; 208: 196-204Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar), some free CP43 was observed in the top fractions of our sucrose gradients (panel D, lanes 6 and7). However, at variance with those reports, some free-running CP47 was also detected (panel D, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that full dismantling of a fraction of PSII centers occurs as a consequence of extensive damage to PSII induced by ultraviolet B light. Polyclonal antibodies to phosphothreonine-containing proteins, which recognize the phosphorylated forms of LHCII, proteins D1 and D2, and CP43, indicated that the level of phosphorylation in dimeric and monomeric forms of PSII was equivalent, as it was roughly proportional to the intensity of the observed immunoreaction in the same fractions with monospecific antibodies to different PSII proteins (compare Fig.4, panels A and E). It should also be noted that free CP43 was never detected as a phosphorylated protein (panel E), suggesting that its dissociation from the core requires dephosphorylation. No additional low"

In the freshwater protozoans Paramecium and Tetrahymena cAMP and cGMP levels depend on the ion composition of the extracellular milieu. Whereas adenylyl cyclase activity in vivo is stimulated by membrane hyperpolarization (1.Schultz J.E. Klumpp S. Benz R. Schürhof-Goeters W. Schmid A. Science. 1992; 255: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2.Schultz J.E. Schönborn C.

Nature. 1986; 322: 271-273Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported on a group of guanylyl cyclases of 280 kDa that is present in the ciliates Paramecium and Tetrahymena but also in the genome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium (4.Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A. Krüger T. Plattner H. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4222-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This novel signal transduction protein is bifunctional. It has a 155-kDa N-terminal P-type ATPase-like domain and a 115-kDa C-terminal guanylyl cyclase domain. Both are linked by a cytosolic loop of about 110 amino acids (see Fig. 1 A). Surprisingly, the guanylyl cyclase domain is topologically identical to mammalian adenylyl cyclases,i.e. it is composed of two pseudosymmetric modules of six putative transmembrane spans (M1 and M2) that serve as membrane anchors for the cytosolic, catalytic segments C1 and C2 (4.Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A. Krüger T. Plattner H. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4222-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The sequences of both cytosolic subdomains are similar to each other and resemble the catalytic regions of metazoan adenylyl and, to a lesser extent, guanylyl cyclases. Sequence comparisons show that the order of the protozoan C1a- and C2-positioned loops is reversed compared with the corresponding mammalian adenylyl cyclase loops (4.Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A. Krüger T. Plattner H. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4222-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Data based on the crystal structure of a soluble adenylyl cyclase type VC1a/type IIC2 chimera demonstrated that Lys938 and Asp1018 in the catalytic pocket of the C2 domain (adenylyl cyclase type II numbering) are responsible for ATP substrate specificity (5.Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 6.Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

In theParamecium guanylyl cyclase, those two amino acids have evolved as Glu1681 and Ser1748 in the C1-positioned domain, i.e. specify GTP as a substrate, whereas the surrounding amino acid residues are more akin to metazoan adenylyl cyclases (see Fig. 1 B for an abbreviated sequence alignment). The expressed membrane-bound Paramecium guanylyl cyclase domain uses MgGTP as a substrate; it accepts MnATP as a substrate only slightly and is inactive with MgATP (4.Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we wished to assemble a protozoan heterodimeric guanylyl cyclase by expression inEscherichia coli of the catalytic domains either separately or covalently connected by a peptide linker. Here, we report on the expression and activity of such constructs. We then changed the purine nucleotide substrate specificity in this ciliate guanylyl cyclase with mammalian adenylyl cyclase topology by site-directed mutagenesis of two amino acids in the C1-positioned cytosolic loop. The inversion of the cytosolic loops was definitively proven by the successful generation of active adenylyl cyclase chimeras, which consisted only of cytosolic C2 cyclase domains, i.e. the mammalian adenylyl cyclase IIC2 or IXC2 and the C2-positioned domain of the Paramecium guanylyl cyclase. Radiochemicals were purchased from ICN or Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech; pQE vectors and nickel-NTA1 resin were from Qiagen. All enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and New England Biolabs. To obtain the soluble constructs of theParamecium guanylyl cyclase cytosolic loops, we used a clone as a template in which all TAA/TAG-Gln codons had been mutated to the universal CAA/CAG-Gln triplets (GenBankTM accession numberAJ238859; Ref. 4.Linder J.U.

For cloning purposes the C1a- (ParaGC-C1a) and C2- (ParaGC-C2) positioned cytosolic domains were fitted withSalI, MluI, and AscI restriction sites. The exact segment boundaries including the N-terminal His6-sequence and N- and C-terminal stuffer amino acids added to accommodate respective restriction sites are depicted in Fig.2 A. Conventional experimental protocols in molecular biology were followed to obtain the DNA constructs. A list of oligonucleotide sense and antisense primers and of synthetic mutagenic primers that were used in this study is available on request. The peptide linker AAGGPPAAGG in the construct ParaGC-C1aLParaGC-C2 was generated with two complementary oligonucleotide primers. The correctness of all constructs was verified by double-stranded DNA-sequencing. The constructs were cloned into a pQE30 expression vector that was modified to contain only a 5′-SalI and a 3′-AscI/HindIII cloning site. The C2 clone from rat type II adenylyl cyclase (GenBankTMaccession number M80550; IIC2) and a mouse type IX adenylyl cyclase clone (GenBankTM accession number Z50190) were kindly provided by Dr. C. Kleuss (Berlin) and Dr. F. Antoni (Glasgow), respectively. The C2 regions were cloned using the polymerase chain reaction with respective cDNAs as templates and appropriate specific primer pairs with 5′- and 3′-terminal restriction sites suitable for cloning of the products into the pQE30 expression vector (see Fig. 2 B). Site-directed mutagenesis (ParaGC-E1681K and S1748D) was carried out by the method of Deng and Nickoloff (14.Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) following the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) and by polymerase chain reaction techniques (2345LVR2347 to KWQ). cDNAs encoding the C1a- and C2-positioned loops of the Parameciumguanylyl cyclase cloned into pBluescript II SK(−) served as templates. The constructs in the pQE30 expression plasmid were transformed into the E. colistrain BL21(DE3)[pREP4]. Cultures were grown at 23 °C in 600 ml of Luria broth containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin and 50 mg/liter kanamycin and induced with 30 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at anA 600 of 0.5. Cells were harvested after 5 h and frozen in liquid N2. For purification (9.Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16967-16974Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) frozen cells were suspended in 20 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (22 μg/ml l-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-4-phenyl-2-butanone, 22 μg/ml l-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-7-amino-2-hepta none-HCl, 22 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3.2 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor from lima beans, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were sonicated (3 × 15 s), and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme were added. After 30 min 20 μg/ml DNase I and 5 mm MgCl2 were added, and the suspension was incubated for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (31,000 × g, 30 min). The lysates were immediately made 300 mm in NaCl, and 200 μl of nickel-NTA was added. After 45 min at 0 °C, the resin was poured into a column and washed twice with buffers (1.5 ml/wash; wash buffer A: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole; wash buffer B: buffer A with 15 mm imidazole; wash buffer C: buffer A with 10 mm NaCl and 15 mm imidazole). Proteins were eluted with 400 μl of buffer C containing 150 mmimidazole. The stability of the recombinant proteins with respect to adenylyl and guanylyl cyclase activities was analyzed. Using several published stabilizing buffers, we were unable to maintain the protozoan constructs enzymatically active upon storage on ice or by freezing. The decay of enzyme activity equally affected all protozoan constructs and did not vary from one mutant to another. After 1, 2, and 3 h on ice adenylyl or guanylyl cyclase activities were 79.4 ± 2.6, 73 ± 3.3, and 61.7 ± 4.8%, respectively (mean ± S.E., n = 14). Therefore, all assays were carried out within 2 h after elution from the affinity resin. Loss of activity was not due to the proteins being degraded as analyzed by Western blotting but probably due to unfolding. The partially purified proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal mouse anti-RGS-His4 antibody (Qiagen) or a monoclonal mouse anti-His6 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cyclase activities were measured at 30 °C for 10 min in a final volume of 100 μl using either 10 mm MgCl2 or 2 mmMnCl2. 3 mm Creatine phosphate and 1 unit of creatine kinase were used as an NTP-regenerating system. Assays contained 1–3 μg of recombinant proteins, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 22% glycerol (v/v), and 2 mm[3 H]-cNMP (100 Bq). The recombinant cyclase domains were premixed on ice for 10 min prior to starting the reaction by addition of [α-32P]purine triphosphates (75 μm, 25 kBq). Substrate and product were separated using DOWEX and alumina chromatography (15.Klumpp S. Schultz J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16.Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase from the Paramecium consists of two domains (Fig. 1 A). The 155-kDa N-terminal domain resembles a P-type ATPase, and the C-terminal codes for a guanylyl cyclase of 115 kDa with a structure characteristic of canonical mammalian adenylyl cyclases yet with reversed cytosolic C1a- and C2-positioned loops (4.Linder J.U.

We wished to reconstitute a soluble protozoan guanylyl cyclase from its C1- and C2-positioned loops and expressed the recombinant proteins in E. coli either individually or linked by a short peptide in analogy to earlier experiments (17.Yan S.-Z.

We used a His-tagged ParameciumC1a-positioned construct with an expected molecular mass of 25 kDa starting at Asp1607, i.e. one amino acid in front of the 1608ILSILLP1614 sequence, which corresponds to a slightly conserved LLENVLP motif present, for example, in C2 of rat type II adenylyl cyclase. The His-tagged protozoan C2-positioned loop with an expected molecular mass of 29 kDa consisted of the entire region downstream of the last transmembrane span (Fig.2 A). After Ni2+-NTA enrichment of the recombinant proteins, a Western blot analysis identified the expected bands as the most dominant proteins and only a very minor immunoreactive contaminant of 19 kDa, probably a proteolytic product, was present in C1a (Fig.3). Guanylyl cyclase activity of individual catalytic loops was not detected, whereas a mixture of the C1a- and C2-positioned loops had high activity using either MnGTP or MgGTP as substrate (Table I). Obviously, the protozoan guanylyl cyclase loops had a high affinity for each other to form a nonchimeric active dimer. This is in contrast to results with the catalytic domains from mammalian adenylyl cyclases where reconstitution of robust soluble adenylyl cyclase activity usually requires mixing of cytosolic domains from different isoforms and the addition of activators (9.Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

The K m values were determined at saturating concentrations of the C2-positioned loops. It was demonstrated that the activity of soluble constructs of mammalian adenylyl cyclases is retained or even increased when the catalytic loops are linked by a short peptide (7.Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, we linked the protozoan cytosolic domains via a tetradecapeptide maintaining the sequential order of the domains present in the parent enzyme,i.e. reversed compared with mammalian adenylyl cyclases (construct ParaGC-C1aLC2; Fig. 2 A). After affinity purification the expected product was identified by Western blotting as a single band (Fig. 3). Although guanylyl cyclase activity was retained, it did not exceed that obtained in a mixture of the individually expressed loops (Table I). The K m values of the mixture of ParaGC-C1a/ParaGC-C2 for MgGTP and MnGTP were 76 and 9 μm, respectively, and thus not very different from the K m values determined with the linked ParaGC-C1aLC2 construct (60 and 51 μm, respectively) and corresponded closely to theK m determined for the membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase domain expressed in HEK293 or for the native enzyme (4.Linder J.U.

Biochem. 1982; 124: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Double reciprocal plots of substrate kinetics were linear from 9 to 230 μm MgGTP and did not indicate kinetic peculiarities apart from a slight substrate inhibition at GTP concentrations exceeding 230 μm. The Hill coefficient was close to 1, indicating no cooperative interactions with the substrate. In assays with 75 μm GTP as a substrate even a 10-fold excess of ATP barely inhibited guanylyl cyclase activity, indicating a high specificity for GTP as a substrate. The temperature optimum of 32 °C was rather low. A molar activation energy of 150 kJ/mol was derived from the linear leg of an Arrhenius plot (1/T versusln(v)). To examine the substrate specificity of the soluble guanylyl cyclase, we assayed all constructs for adenylyl cyclase activity (Table I). Using MgATP as a substrate, adenylyl cyclase activity was 5% or less of the respective guanylyl cyclase activity (Table I). With MnATP adenylyl cyclase activity was about 20% of guanylyl cyclase activity, and theK m value was similar to that found with GTP as a substrate (Table I). The crystal structure of a rat adenylyl cyclase type IIC2 homodimer and of a Gαs×VC1a/IIC2 (dog and rat isoforms, respectively) heterodimer bound to 2′d,3′-AMP, and enzymatic and modeling studies pinpointed two or potentially three amino acids in the cyclases as being responsible for purine nucleotide triphosphate specificity (5.Zhang G.

In adenylyl cyclases Lys938 and Asp1018in the IIC2 catalytic domain interact with the N-1 and N-6 nitrogen atoms of the adenine (6.Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 23.Tesmer J.G. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In guanylyl cyclases the corresponding amino acids are β1Glu473 and β1Cys541 (β1 refers to the β1-subunit of rat soluble guanylyl cyclase), which probably interact with the N-1 nitrogen and the O-6 oxygen atoms of the guanine ring. An exchange of these amino acid residues switches the respective substrate specificities of mammalian guanylyl and adenylyl cyclases (21.Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16332-16338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22.Tucker C.L. Hurley J.H. Miller T.R. Hurley J.B. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). With regard to the Paramecium guanylyl cyclase, the C1-positioned domain most likely is the functional equivalent of the catalytic β1-subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclases. Glu1681 in the C1-positioned loop is tantamount to β1Glu473, and Ser1748 is tantamount to β1Cys541(Fig. 1 B). In the ciliate, serine replaces a cysteine residue that otherwise is invariant in mammalian guanylyl cyclases (Fig. 1 B). This Cys/Ser replacement apparently did not affect the specific accommodation of GTP in the substrate-binding fold, possibly because a hydrogen bridge can be formed between the O-6 oxygen of the guanine ring and the serine hydroxyl side chain. This was surprising because a β1C541S mutation reduced the bovine guanylyl cyclase activity to almost zero despite the conservative nature of the substitution (24.Friebe A. Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To examine the participation of Glu1681 and Ser1748 in theParamecium C1a-positioned domain in substrate specification, we mutated them to the adenylyl cyclase specific residues Lys and Asp (double mutant E1681K/S1748D). In addition, we generated the single S1748D mutant; the E1681K single mutant was not accessible. The constructs (Fig. 2) were enriched by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography and positively identified by Western blotting. All recombinant proteins displayed the expected molecular mass, and degradation products were more or less absent (Fig. 3). Mutation of Ser1748 to Asp (ParaGC-C1aD) virtually abolished all Mg2+-supported cyclase activities, regardless of ATP or GTP as substrates (Table I). Even with 2 mm Mn2+ as a divalent cation, guanylyl cyclase activity was diminished by more than 98%, and adenylyl cyclase activity was diminished by more than 83% (Table I). Thus, the ratio of the remaining low adenylyl and guanylyl cyclase activities was only 0.43, which means that efficient substrate discrimination was almost lost. The data indicate then that the interaction with the amino acid corresponding to position 1748 contributes much to the energy needed for ATP or GTP substrate binding and little to substrate discrimination. The ParaGC-C1aD/ParaGC-C2 dimer was in essence a low activity, unspecific purine nucleotide triphosphate cyclase. Similar mutants in one of these two amino acids in mammalian membrane-bound or soluble guanylyl cyclases and in the mammalian VC1a/IIC2 heterodimer had lost almost all of their cyclase activity (21.Sunahara R.K.

Miller T.R. Hurley J.B. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the guanylyl cyclase double mutant E1681K/S1748D (ParaGC-C1aKD/ParaGC-C2), the nucleotide specificity was completely switched from GTP to ATP. Independently of Mg2+or Mn2+ guanylyl cyclase activities were less than 1% of wild type activities, whereas adenylyl cyclase activity increased to 0.97 (Mg2+) and 14.5 (Mn2+) nmol cAMP/mg/min (Table I). This experiment unequivocally demonstrated the functional inversion of the arrangment of the cytosolic loops in the ciliate guanylyl cyclase because the mutated, substrate-defining amino acids were localized in the C1a-positioned domain, whereas in mammalian adenylyl cyclases they are localized in the C2 domain (21.Sunahara R.K.

Further, it demonstrated that Ser1748, which replaced a Cys that is invariant in all mammalian guanylyl cyclases, is at its correct and needed location because a change to Asp had the expected profound functional consequences. In addition, it constituted the final proof that the Paramecium guanylyl cyclase with a mammalian adenylyl cyclase membrane topology truly is a guanylyl cyclase because we could switch substrate specificity by site-directed mutagenesis of the protozoan C1a-positioned domain as predicted by the available structural knowledge of the mammalian adenylyl cyclase C2 region (5.Zhang G.

A novel observation for a cyclase with a canonical mammalian adenylyl cyclase topology was the almost total switch in purine nucleotide specificity. This has so far been accomplished only for mammalian guanylyl cyclases (21.Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

The attempt to change the substrate specificity of a soluble mammalian VC1/IIC2 adenylyl cyclase heterodimer resulted in a nonspecific purine nucleotide cyclase (21.Sunahara R.K. Beuve A.

In the C1 domain of adenylyl cyclases Gln503 (dog type V adenylyl cyclase) was identified as a potentially important point of contact for substrate recognition by modeling and by mutational studies (5.Zhang G.

(2000) Glycobiology in pressGoogle Scholar). For the latter enzymes, the order of removal of mannose from Man9GlcNAc2 differs depending on the enzyme, thereby producing different mixtures of oligosaccharide isomers (13.Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17.Kawar, Z., Romero, P. A., Herscovics, A., and Jarvis, D. L. (2000) Glycobiology in pressGoogle Scholar). The two types of enzymes have similar catalytic mechanisms in that the glycosidic bond is cleaved with inversion of the anomeric configuration (13.Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18.Lipari F. Gour-Salin B.J. Herscovics A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but they have complementary specificities since the mannose residue removed by the ER α1,2-mannosidases is the last mannose cleaved by the enzymes that transform Man9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2. The molecular basis for these different specificities has not previously been studied. Recently the structure of the soluble catalytic domain of the yeast ER α1,2-mannosidase was determined by x-ray crystallography (19.Vallée F. Yip P. Lipari F. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since this is the first known structure of a class I α1,2-mannosidase, it serves as a model for other members of the family. The yeast α1,2-mannosidase consists of an (αα)7 barrel that is closed on one side by a β-hairpin close to the C terminus of the enzyme. The catalytic acidic residues and the calcium ion essential for enzyme activity are located in the center of the barrel at the top of the β-hairpin. The yeast α1,2-mannosidase is a glycoprotein containing three high mannose oligosaccharides, and theN-glycan attached to asparagine 96 from each molecule within the crystal was found to extend into the barrel of the adjacent symmetry-related molecule as an enzyme/product complex. The intermolecular contacts have allowed identification of amino acids that participate in protein-carbohydrate interactions in the region of the active site (19.Vallée F. Yip P. Lipari F. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrate that, as predicted from the crystal structure, mutation of a single amino acid residue, Arg273 to Leu, is sufficient to alter the specificity of the yeast ER α1,2-mannosidase. The R273L mutant is capable of trimming Man9GlcNAc to Man5GlcNAc. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Biocorp Inc (Montréal, Québec, Canada). Restriction enzymes were from MBI Fermentas (Flanborough, Ontario, Canada), New England Biolabs (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Baie d'Urfé, Québec, Canada). Unlabeled Man9GlcNAc was isolated from soybean agglutinin. The lectin was digested with Pronase, and the resulting glycopeptides were incubated with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H to produce Man9GlcNAc, as reported previously (20.Romero P.A. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). [3H]Mannose-labeled Man9GlcNAc was prepared from rat liver glycoproteins, as described earlier (6.Jelinek-Kelly S. Akiyama A. Saunier B. Tkacz J.S. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2253-2257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ThePichia pastoris expression kit was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), deuterium oxide 99.996 was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA), and other chemicals were of reagent grade. The α1,2-mannosidase nucleotide sequence encoding amino acids 34–549 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and ligated into theXhoI and BamHI sites of the pHIL-S1 vector (Invitrogen) producing plasmid YpHΔ33. The nucleotide sequence encoding amino acids 367–371 in the plasmid YpHΔ33 was then deleted using the U.S.E. mutagenesis kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech to produce the plasmid for expression of the parent enzyme whose crystal structure was determined (19.Vallée F. Yip P. Lipari F. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The arginine in position 273 of the catalytic domain was changed to leucine with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) to produce the R273L mutant. The sense and antisense primers used were ctatccggttcggatcactcggggattctttttatgag and ctcataaaaagaatccccgagtgatccgaaccggatag, respectively. These oligonucleotides include a silent mutation creating a newAvaI site that was used to screen for positive clones. The resulting plasmid was sequenced completely to establish that the only mutation is R273L. For expression of parent and mutant enzymes,BglII-digested plasmids were used to transform the P. pastoris strain KM71 (his4, aox1) by electroporation and clones expressing α1,2-mannosidase activity were selected following methanol induction for 3 days, as described previously (21.Lipari F. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27615-27622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The R273L mutant had the same mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as the parent. To determine the kinetic parameters, mutant and parent α1,2-mannosidases were purified and Lineweaver-Burke analysis was performed, as described previously (22.Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,23.Lipari F. Herscovics A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), following incubation of 1 h at 37 °C with 0.03–0.7 mm unlabeled Man9GlcNAc, 20,000 cpm [3H]Man9GlcNAc, 0.1 m PIPES (pH 6.5), 1 mm NaN3, and 20 μg of BSA in a final volume of 20 μl. Under these conditions, enzyme activity was linear with time for at least 1 h and Man8GlcNAc was the only product formed during that time. For analytical purposes, 30 μl of medium from either parent or R273L-transformed cells was incubated at 37 °C for different times in a total volume of 120 μl containing 100 mm PIPES (pH 6.5), 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.2 mm Man9GlcNAc mixed with 30,000 cpm [3H]Man9GlcNAc. At different times 20-μl aliquots were removed, diluted with 100 μl of water, and boiled for 3 min. Internal standards of [14C]Glc1–3Man9GlcNAc were added in a final volume of 250 μl of 40% acetonitrile. The samples were chromatographed on a Waters Spherisorb S5 NH2 column, as described previously (24.Romero P.A. Saunier B. Herscovics A. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For preparative purposes, 125 μl of medium was incubated at 37 °C with 2.4 mg of Man9GlcNAc and 4 × 105 cpm of [3H]Man9GlcNAc in 100 mm PIPES buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.02% NaN3 in a total volume of 500 μl. Aliquots collected at different times were analyzed by HPLC, and samples containing primarily Man8GlcNAc or Man6GlcNAc were processed for1H NMR, as described previously (8.Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similar assays were done using Man8GlcNAc isomer B as substrate. Examination of the interactions between amino acids in the barrel of the yeast α1,2-mannosidase structure and the N-glycan shows that Arg273 forms the largest number of contacts with the oligosaccharide. Specifically Arg273 interacts through its Nε, Nη1, and Nη2 atoms with three mannose residues (Man3, Man4, Man7) and oneN-acetylglucosamine residue of the N-glycan (Fig.1). These interactions occur in a strategic position of the oligosaccharide at the α1,6-linked mannose branch, suggesting that the specificity of the yeast enzyme may be due to the stabilizing influence of this arginine residue on the oligosaccharide conformation. There is evidence from high resolution1H NMR studies that the α1,6-arm of N-glycans has inherent flexibility resulting in the existence of different oligosaccharide conformations (25.Brisson J.R. Carver J.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3680-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26.Homans S.W. Pastore A. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6649-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a comparison of the sequences in class I α1,2-mannosidases shows that this particular arginine residue is only present in the two ER α1,2-mannosidases that cleave a single mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc2. It is replaced by leucine in most of the α1,2-mannosidases known to trim Man9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 (Fig.2). The possibility that the specificity of the yeast enzyme is partly determined by the interactions of Arg273 with the oligosaccharide was therefore investigated.Figure 2Partial amino acid sequence alignment of class I α1,2-mannosidases. Sequences of a few representative members of the family whose specificity has been established are shown. The GenBank™ accession numbers are as follows: Aspergillus saitoi, D49827; human IB, AF027156; murine IB, U03458; human IA, X74837; murine IA, U04299; Sf9 cells, AF005035; human ER, AF148509; Saccharomyces cerevisiae, M63598. The amino acid number of the first residue shown for each sequence is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Site-directed mutagenesis of the arginine to leucine was performed and the mutated enzyme was expressed as a soluble secreted protein inP. pastoris, as described previously (21.Lipari F. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27615-27622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides formed from [3H]Man9GlcNAc at different incubation times were fractionated by HPLC (data not shown), and the time course of oligosaccharide product formation was compared with that obtained from the parent enzyme (Fig.3). It is clear that with time the R273L mutant removes additional mannose residues from Man9GlcNAc and that Man5GlcNAc is the end product (Fig.3 A). Relatively large amounts of Man8GlcNAc and Man6GlcNAc intermediates tend to accumulate during the course of the reaction, and little Man7GlcNAc is present at any time, indicating that removal of mannose from Man8GlcNAc and Man6GlcNAc is less efficient compared with mannose trimming from Man9GlcNAc and Man7GlcNAc. In contrast, primarily Man8GlcNAc is formed by the parent enzyme (Fig. 3 B). The structures of the Man8GlcNAc and Man6GlcNAc oligosaccharides formed by the R273L mutant were determined by high resolution 1H NMR following preparative HPLC in order to establish the order of mannose trimming. Man8GlcNAc isomer B is the only isomer formed by the mutant (Fig.4 A), indicating that the order of mannose removal from Man9GlcNAc is different from that previously observed with mammalian Golgi α1,2-mannosidases IA and IB and with Sf9 α1,2-mannosidase. The latter enzymes were shown to form different isomers of Man8GlcNAc (13.Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17.Kawar, Z., Romero, P. A., Herscovics, A., and Jarvis, D. L. (2000) Glycobiology in pressGoogle Scholar). The formation of isomer B by the mutant yeast α1,2-mannosidase was also demonstrated when Man9GlcNAc2-pyridylamino was used as substrate (data not shown). The 1H NMR spectrum of the Man6GlcNAc indicates that a single isomer is formed by the mutant (Fig. 4 B). The same isomer of Man6GlcNAc was formed after incubation of Man8GlcNAc isomer B with the R273L mutant (data not shown), whereas this oligosaccharide is not a substrate for the parent enzyme. Since there was little accumulation of Man7GlcNAc at any time, the 1H NMR spectrum of this intermediate could not be obtained. However, given that only single isomers of Man8GlcNAc and Man6GlcNAc are formed, there is only one possible Man7GlcNAc isomer, as indicated by the order of removal of mannose depicted in Fig.5. This pathway of mannose trimming by the mutant is different from that observed with mammalian Golgi α1,2-mannosidases IA and IB (13.Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and with Sf9 recombinant α1,2-mannosidase (17.Kawar, Z., Romero, P. A., Herscovics, A., and Jarvis, D. L. (2000) Glycobiology in pressGoogle Scholar). The mutant yeast enzyme has acquired the combined activities of the ER and Golgi mammalian α1,2-mannosidases.Figure 5Order of removal of mannose from Man9GlcNAc by the R273L mutant. M, mannose;N, N-acetylglucosamine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The specific activity of the mutant α1,2-mannosidase was 20–25% of that observed for the parent enzyme. Kinetic analysis of the purified enzymes showed that the K m of the mutant enzyme was greatly increased compared with the parent enzyme. The mutant had aK m greater than 9 mm compared with 0.3 mm for the parent. This large decrease in affinity for the oligosaccharide substrate further demonstrates the importance of Arg273 in binding the oligosaccharide substrate. The present results provide the first insight into the molecular differences responsible for the distinct specificities of different class I α1,2-mannosidases. They indicate that very small differences in non-conserved amino acids within the α1,2-mannosidase barrel containing the active site are responsible for the distinct specificities by controlling the orientation of the oligosaccharide substrate and hence the accessibility of the α1,2-mannose-linked residues to the catalytic residues.

https://openalex.org/W2102715394,"A full-length cDNA clone of a serine proteinase, mouse brain serine proteinase (mBSP), was isolated from a mouse brain cDNA library. mBSP, which has been recently reported to be expressed in the hair follicles of nude mice, is most similar (88% identical) in sequence to rat myelencephalon-specific protease. The mBSP mRNA was steadily expressed in the brain of adult mice with a transient expression in the early fetal stage during development. The genomic structure of the mouse gene for mBSP was determined. The gene, which is mapped to chromosome 7B4-B5, is about 7.4 kilobases in size and contains 7 exons. Interestingly, the 5′-untranslated region of the mBSP gene was interrupted by two introns. In situhybridization analyses revealed that mBSP is expressed in the white matter of the cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and capsula interna and capsula interna pars retrolenticularis of mouse brain. Further, mBSP was immunolocalized to the neuroglial cells in the white matter of the cerebellum. Recombinant mBSP was produced in the bacterial expression system and activated by lysyl endopeptidase digestion, and the activated enzyme was purified for characterization. The enzyme showed amidolytic activities preferentially cleaving Arg-X bonds when 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide-containing peptide substrates were used. Typical serine proteinase inhibitors, such as diisopropyl fluorophosphates, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, and benzamidine, strongly inhibited the enzyme activity. The recombinant mBSP effectively hydrolyzed fibronectin and gelatin, but not laminin, collagens I and IV, or elastin. These results suggest that mBSP plays an important role in association with the function of the adult mouse brain.

Proteinases have been implicated in tumor cell invasion and metastasis by numerous laboratories (1.Ossowski L. Reich E. Cell. 1983; 35: 611-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 2.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, 3.Khokha R. Denhardt D.T. Invasion Metastasis. 1989; 9: 391-405PubMed Google Scholar). One such enzyme is tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA),1 a serine proteinase widely distributed in tissues and organs (4.Rickles R.J. Strickland S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been established that tPA can be purified from the culture medium of human melanoma cell lines (Bowe) in two molecular forms of a single polypeptide chain (M r = 64,000) and two polypeptide chains (M r = 32,000 and 30,000), and that a proteinase(s) is involved in the proteolytic conversion of a single-chain form to the two-chain enzyme. Ichinose et al.(5.Ichinose A. Kisiel W. Fujikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) suggested that tissue kallikrein or a tissue kallikrein-like proteinase is responsible for the conversion. We recently demonstrated that, like human melanoma cells, mouse Lewis lung carcinoma and B16 melanoma cells secrete a common serine proteinase capable of rapidly converting a single-chain tPA to the two-chain enzyme (6.Matsui H. Ohnishi J. Takahashi T. Zool. Sci. 1998; 15: 499-505PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to search a mouse cancer cell cDNA library for a cDNA clone encoding the tPA-converting enzyme by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a series of degenerated oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the consensus sequences of the serine proteinase active sites, we happened to find a PCR product representing a unique proteinase that is expressed almost exclusively in the mouse brain. In the present study, we undertook molecular and biochemical analyses of this enzyme, designated mouse brain serine proteinase (mBSP), including the genomic structure and chromosomal localization, tissue distribution of the mBSP mRNA and protein product in the brain, and characterization of the recombinant enzyme. The results clearly show that mBSP is the homologue of rat myelencephalon-specific protease first reported by Scarisbrick et al. (7.Scarisbrick I.A. Towner M.D. Isackson P.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8156-8168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is the same enzyme very recently reported as brain and skin serine protease (BSSP) by Meier et al. (8.Meier N. Dear T.N. Boehm T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The current results also show that the recombinant mBSP is capable of degrading casein, fibronectin, and gelatin, suggesting a role of this enzyme in extracellular matrix protein degradation in the brain. Mouse B16 melanoma (RCB 0557) and Lewis lung carcinoma (RCB 0558) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Both cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 0.3 mg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mice (C57BL/6NCrj strain, female) were killed by cervical dislocation, and the brains were rapidly removed, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNAs were prepared from frozen tissues or confluent monolayers of the melanoma and carcinoma cells using the guanidine isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method (9.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs were selected by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography. The first strand cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+ RNAs of mouse B16 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma using a SuperScript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two degenerated oligonucleotide primers for PCR were synthesized based on the cDNA sequence for key regions of histidine and serine residues in some mouse serine proteinases (sense: 5′-GT(G/T)(C/G)T(G/T)(A/T)C(A/T)GCTGC(A/T/C)CACTG-3′ corresponding to the amino acid sequence Val-Leu-Thr-Ala-Ala-His-Cys, and antisense: 5′-AG(A/C/G)GG(A/G/T)CCICC(A/T/C)GA(A/G)TC(A/G)CC-3′ corresponding to the amino acid sequence Gly-Asp-Ser-Gly-Gly-Pro-Leu). Conditions for PCR were 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 3 min, and then a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Fragments between 0.4 and 0.5 kb in size were recovered from PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragments were subcloned into pBluescript (II) KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) cut with EcoRV. Transformation of the recombinant plasmids into Escherichia coli JM109 cells resulted in acquisition of 80 clones each from PCR products with both cells. Among these, one clone from poly(A)+ RNA of Lewis lung carcinoma represented a unique serine proteinase. This clone was 434 bp long, and corresponded to the nucleotide sequence numbers 382–815 of the full-length cDNA deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTMData Bank under accession number AB015206. Mouse multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). For preparation of the blot loading total RNAs from mouse brains of various postnatal developmental stages, 30 μg of the total RNA was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde/1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a Nytran-Plus membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The blots were hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe at 42 °C in a buffer containing 50% formamide (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), 5× SSPE, 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and washed with increasing stringency, with a final wash of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. The probe used was the 434-bp cDNA fragment described above. A mouse brain cDNA library was constructed in λgt10 with 5 μg of mouse brain poly(A)+RNA and packaged using Gigapack III packaging extract (Stratagene). Approximately 7×105 plaques from the library were transferred to nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and hybridized at 65 °C in a buffer containing 5× SSPE, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution (Wako, Osaka, Japan), and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA with 1×106 cpm/ml of the 32P-labeled, 434-bp cDNA fragment. Filters were washed with increasing stringency, with a final wash of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. One positive clone was obtained. The phage DNA was subcloned into pBluescript (II) KS+ for sequencing. The nucleotide sequence was determined using ABI automatic sequencer models 373 and 377 (Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). About 1×106 clones of the mouse genomic library (C57Black/6, liver, female, 1 year, Stratagene) were screened with the 32P-labeled mBSP cDNA. Two positive plaques (λ411 and λ91) were isolated and digested with several restriction enzymes, and examination by Southern blotting with the 32P-labeled mBSP cDNA revealed that λ411 included additional exons. We then determined the restriction enzyme maps and sequenced the full length of λ411 using an ABI automatic sequencer model 377. 1 μg of mouse brain poly(A)+RNA or E. coli transfer RNA was hybridized at 65 °C for 90 min in a total of 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.25 m KCl with 5 pmol of the oligonucleotide probe, 5′-CTGTAAGTCCCTCTGTGGGT-3′ (1778–1797, genomic sequence), which had been endo-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were then allowed to cool for 90 min at room temperature. After adding 46 μl of 65 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 4.3 mmMgCl2, 15 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.72 mm dNTP mixture, 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was introduced into the reaction mixture, which was incubated at 42 °C for 60 min. The reactions were phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and electrophoresed in a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel along with a sequence ladder generated with the unlabeled primers using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Sequenase version 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp.). The dried gel was visualized by autoradiography. Mouse genomic DNA was extracted as described previously (10.Kimura A. Yoshida I. Takagi N. Takahashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24047-24053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 5 μg of the genomic DNA was completely digested with EcoRI, HindIII,BamHI, and XhoI. The DNA was fractionated on a 0.7% agarose gel and alkaline-transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The blot was hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h in 6× SSPE, 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA with the32P-labeled full-length mBSP cDNA including exons 2–7. The membrane was washed at 50 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to Kodak Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Metaphase preparations were obtained from concanavalin-stimulated splenocytes of normal male mice after bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. The mixture of two mBSP genomic DNA (λ91 and λ411) was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by nick-translation. After hybridization, slides were washed, blocked, and incubated with goat antibodies against biotin (Vectashield Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA). Slides were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit antibodies against goat IgG (American Qualex, La Mirada, CA) and then with Alexa 488-conjugated rabbit antibodies against fluorescein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Antisense and sense RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription of a reverse transcriptase-PCR-amplified fragment of mBSP cDNA with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Mouse brain sections (10 μm) were cut on cryostat and thaw-mounted onto slides coated with silan. Sections on slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min. After washing with PBS, the sections were treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K (Wako) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C, postfixed in the same fixative, permeabilized in 0.2 m HCl for 10 min, acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine (Merck), and dehydrated through an ascending alcohol series. The DIG-labeled RNA probe (antisense or sense) in hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 10% dextran sulfate (Wako), 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.25% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were placed on the sections, and then incubated at 50 °C for 18 h. The sections were washed at 50 °C in 50% formamide, 2× SSC for 30 min. Sections were then treated with 40 μg/ml RNase A in RNase buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, sections were washed in RNase buffer for 10 min at 37 °C, rinsed in 2× SSC for 20 min at 50 °C, and then in 0.2× SSC for 20 min at 50 °C twice. The hybridized probes were detected using a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Sections were treated with 1% blocking reagent in DIG buffer 1 (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) for 60 min, and incubated in 500× diluted anti-DIG antibody in DIG buffer 1 for 30 min. Sections were washed with DIG buffer 1, equilibrated with DIG buffer 3 (100 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmMgCl2), and then incubated with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in DIG buffer 3 for 12 h. Whole brains dissected from mouse (8 weeks old) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (pH 7.0). After dehydration in serial concentrations of ethanol and xylene, they were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a 10 μm thickness. The sections were mounted on a coverslip, and dried overnight at 45 °C. Following deparaffinization and hydration, the sections were immersed in PBS-BT buffer (0.1 g of bovine serum albumin, 50 μl of Tween 20, 0.1 g of NaN3 in 100 ml of PBS) and incubated in normal goat serum (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-mBSP antiserum/PBS-BT (1:100 dilution) or rabbit polyclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Sanbio, Netherlands)/PBS-BT (1:300 dilution) was applied on the coverslip for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS-BT, the specimens were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Cappel Products, West Chester, PA)/PBS-BT (1:100 dilution) containing propidium iodide (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslip was mounted on a slide with 70% glycerin containing 5%n-propyl gallate. In control studies for mBSP-specific immunofluorescence, the specimens were incubated with normal rabbit serum. The stained sections were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The antigen used was the recombinant mBSP eluted from an Ni2+ column as described in the following section. Specific antiserum was raised by injecting female rabbits (2 months old) with 200 μg each of the above protein emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant. Boosting was started 2 weeks later by injecting each at 2-week intervals with 200 μg of the antigen emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The antisera were obtained from the blood collected after three booster injections. The expression vector for mBSP was constructed by inserting its cDNA (amino acids 14–246) including the complete pro-enzyme region of the mBSP gene intoEcoRI site of pET30a (Novagen, Madison, WI). PCR was performed with oligonucleotide primers pro-mBSP (5′-GGAATTCGCCTGGTCGGAGGAACAGGA-3′) and mBSP-AS (5′-GGAATTCTCACAGCCACTTGTTTCTGA-3′) to create EcoRI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends. The reaction product was sequentially digested withEcoRI, gel purified, and ligated in-frame in theEcoRI site of expression vector pET30a. The orientation and sequence of the BSP cDNA in the pET plasmid were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The ligated vector was transformed to E. colistrain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen), and the cells were grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of 2% LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, followed by incubation at 37 °C for an additional 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifuging at 6,000 × g for 10 min, and treated by freeze-thawing to lyse the cells. After washing with 0.5% Triton X-100 twice, the sample was solubilized by dissolving and incubation in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 6 m urea and 0.5 m NaCl for 12 h at room temperature. Solubilized materials were directly applied to an Ni2+-chelate column (5 ml volume, Novagen) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 0.5m NaCl and 6 m urea. The retained materials were eluted with 50 mm histidine in the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 6 m urea. The eluted protein (30 ml) was dialyzed against 2 liters of 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5) twice. The sample was then incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) with immobilized lysyl endopeptidase on Sepharose 4B at 37 °C for 6 h. The immobilized protease was removed by filtration, and the resulting filtrate was directly applied to a column of soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI)-Sepharose 4B (1 ml bed volume) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 m NaCl. The retained materials were eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3). Fractions of 1 ml were collected in a tube that had contained 0.2 ml each of 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9). NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the activated mBSP was performed using an ABI sequenator model 477A. Immobilization of lysly endopeptidase (Wako) and SBTI on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol. mBSP activity was determined with MCA substrate according to the method of Barrett (11.Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The assay was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in a 0.5-ml reaction mixture comprising 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.1 mm substrate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3) containing 0.1 m monochloroacetic acid. The amount of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin released was spectrofluorophotometrically measured (6.Matsui H. Ohnishi J. Takahashi T. Zool. Sci. 1998; 15: 499-505PubMed Google Scholar). Casein and gelatin zymography were performed according to the methods previously described (12.Heussen C. Dowdle E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). Briefly, mBSP was electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.1% casein (Wako) or 1 mg/ml type A porcine skin gelatin (Sigma) under nonreducing conditions. After electrophoresis, gels were washed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and then incubated with shaking in 0.1m glycine-NaOH (pH 8.3) for 18 h at 37 °C. The gels were stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize zones of lysis. 4 μg of human plasma fibronectin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), 4 μg of mouse laminin (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA), 20 μg of acid-soluble type I collagen from calf skin (Sigma), and 20 μg of acid-soluble type IV collagen from human placenta (Sigma) were each incubated at 37 °C for 18 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), with mBSP (500 ng) in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were stopped with SDS sample buffer, and the reaction mixtures were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 6% gel. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The activity of mBSP on elastin was assessed using elastin-orcein (Elastin Products Co., Inc., Owensville, MO) as a substrate according to the method of Apple (13.Apple W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2. Academic Press, New York1974: 1041-1045Crossref Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (14.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206983) Google Scholar) under reducing and nonreducing conditions, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by the method of Towbin et al. (15.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44889) Google Scholar). The blotted membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-mBSP antiserum at 1:3000 dilution and subsequently with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive signals were detected using an ECL Western blot detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. mRNAs prepared from mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cells and B16 melanoma cells were used for reverse transcriptase-PCR with two degenerated oligonucleotide primers as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Among the 160 PCR products analyzed, one with a length of 434 bp was found to have a nucleotide sequence highly homologous to that of the serine protease, rat myelencephalon-specific protease, which has been reported by Scarisbrick et al. (7.Scarisbrick I.A. Towner M.D. Isackson P.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8156-8168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This 434-bp cDNA fragment was then used as a probe for Northern blot analysis conducted with mRNAs isolated from several mouse tissues. As shown in Fig.1 A, an intense band of 1.3 kb was detected only in the brain. Based on this observation, we screened a mouse brain cDNA library using the same cDNA fragment as a probe, and isolated a full-length cDNA clone (the nucleotide sequence has been deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM Data Bank under accession number AB015206). This clone was 1,115 bp long, including the 5′-noncoding region (213 bp), the coding nucleotide sequence (738 bp), and the 3′-noncoding region (164 bp). There are 5 ATG codons between nucleotide positions 193 and 222. Since the codon at positions 214–216 best meets the criteria for the initiation site of the translation (16.Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar), we tentatively assume that translation starts at this ATG codon. As a result, the open reading frame codes for a protein of 246 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,664. During the course of this study, Meier et al. (8.Meier N. Dear T.N. Boehm T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported a cDNA clone encoding a novel serine protease designated BSSP. The authors demonstrated a predominant expression of this gene in the hair follicles of nude mice. mBSP is undoubtedly the same molecule as BSSP, and is highly homologous to rat myelencephalon-specific protease (88% identical in amino acids, Ref. 7.Scarisbrick I.A. Towner M.D. Isackson P.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8156-8168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mBSP also exhibited 67% identity to human zyme (17.Little S.P. Dixon E.P. Norris F. Buckley W. Becker G.W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8307-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In adult mice, the mBSP mRNA was exclusively detected in the brain among the tissues examined (Fig.1 A), confirming the result of Meier et al. (8.Meier N. Dear T.N. Boehm T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine the changes of mBSP gene expression during development, a time-course experiment was conducted by Northern blot analysis using RNAs obtained from various stages of developing mice. In the prenatal periods, the mRNA was transiently detected with poly(A)+ RNA of the 7-day fetus, but virtually disappeared thereafter (Fig. 1 B). Expression of the mRNA was resumed with the mouse brain of postnatal day 28 (Fig. 1 C). The screening described under “Experimental Procedures” resulted in isolation of two genomic clones (λ91 and λ411) that hybridized to the mBSP cDNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of the mBSP gene, including introns, was determined (the sequence data are available from the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM Data Bank under accession number AB032402). Sequence comparison with the cDNA revealed that the mBSP gene encompassed a 7.4-kb region and consisted of 7 exons (Fig. 2). The first two introns (introns 1 and 2) interrupted the 5′-untranslated region and four introns (introns 3, 4, 5, and 6) interrupted the coding sequence. The coding regions of mBSP are contained in exons 3–7. As shown in Table I, all intron-exon splice junctions follow the GT-AG rule of Shapiro et al. (22.Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). The active site residues, His62, Asp106, and Ser197 (numbered from the putative translation initiation Met), of the catalytic triad are encoded by exons 4, 5, and 7, respectively.Table IExon-intron organizationExon no.Exon sizeSequence at exon/intron junctionPhaseIntron size5′ splice donor3′ splice acceptor1174GAC TTA CAGgtaggtgagttcatgcagGTC GGA TCA9172156CAC CAG CAGgtgagtgaacctctcaagATG CCC ATG391361AAA TCA GgtgatttaactccctcagCC TGG TCG1681Lys Ser A1a Trp Ser4157AAA AAA CCgtgagtttctcttcccagG AAT CTG21466Lys Lys Phe Asn Leu5248GAA AAT GgtcagtgagacctcctagGT GAC TTC1464Glu Asn Gly Asp Phe6137TCC TGT CAGgtaagaccgtccacacagGGT GAT TCT02214Ser Cys GlnGly Asp Ser7296TAG TGA CACagagcacag Open table in a new tab The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the mBSP gene is shown in Fig. 3. To determine the transcription initiation site, we performed a primer extension experiment. The labeled antisense primer corresponding to the region from nucleotide residue 1778 to residue 1797 was hybridized to mouse brain RNA and subjected to reverse transcription. This analysis demonstrated a single band having the size of 174 nucleotides (data not shown), indicating that transcription initiates at the adenine residue 1624. A CAAT box, but not a TATA box, was detected in the vicinity of the transcription initiation site. A computer search for consensus binding sites of transcription factors indicated the presence of motifs for Sp1, AP1, and C/EBP. We performed Southern blot hybridization using the cDNA encompassing exons 2–7 as a probe. When mouse genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, two hybridization-positive bands (5.0 and 6.5 kb for EcoRI; 1.2 and 6.8 kb for BamHI) were detected. On the other hand, digestion with HindIII andXbaI produced three bands (1.8, 2.8, and 10.0 kb forHindIII; 2.0, 7.3, and 8.5 kb for XbaI) (data not shown). The patterns were consistent with the numbers of the respective restriction enzyme sites present in the g"

A caldesmon fragment that encompasses residues 1–240 (N240) was found to bind full-length smooth muscle myosin on the basis of co-sedimentation experiments. The interaction between myosin and N240 was not affected by phosphorylation of myosin, but it was weakened by the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin. To locate the myosin-binding site, we have designed several synthetic peptides based on the N-terminal caldesmon sequence. We found that a peptide stretch corresponding to the first 27 residues (Met-1 to Tyr-27), but not that of the first 22 residues (Met-1 to Ala-22), exhibited a moderate affinity toward myosin. We also found that a peptide containing the segment from Ile/Leu-25 to Lys-53 bound both myosin and heavy meromyosin more strongly and was capable of displacing caldesmon from myosin. Our results demonstrate that the sequence near the N-terminal extreme of caldesmon harbors a major myosin-binding site of caldesmon, in which both the nonpolar residues and clusters of positively and negatively charged residues confer the specificity and affinity of the caldesmon-myosin interaction.

Huber P.A.J. Bárány M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 77-90Crossref Google Scholar). Its ability to reversibly inhibit the actomyosin ATPase activity in vitro has made CaD a good candidate to modulate smooth muscle contraction via a thin filament-based mechanism. North et al. (2.North A.J. Gimona M. Cross R.A. Small J.V. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 437-444PubMed Google Scholar) have previously reported that CaD is present in the “contractile zone” where both actin and myosin exist. In our recent immunogold electron microscopy studies (3.Mabuchi K. Li Y. Tao T. Wang C.-L.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we further found that the majority of CaD is around myosin filaments in partially shortened gizzard muscles that exhibit banding patterns made up of alternating myosin-rich and myosin-deficient zones, known as “contraction bands” (4.Draeger A. Amos W.B. Ikebe M. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 11: 2463-2473Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that when myosin filaments aggregate, the CaD-bearing actin filaments, or portions thereof, maintain some kind of contact with the thick filaments. One possibility to explain this phenomenon is that CaD may weakly bind myosin. Indeed, CaD has been known to interact with myosin (5.Ikebe M. Reardon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3055-3058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Hemric M.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1878-1885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the functional significance of such interactions remains unclear. Since CaD also binds actin, and binding of actin does not prevent CaD from interacting with myosin, it has been suggested that CaD bridges actin and myosin and forms a ternary complex (7.Velaz L. Ingraham R.H. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2929-2934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this ternary complex, CaD may act as a force-maintaining tether between the thick and thin filaments, which could explain the “latch” phenomenon found in many tonic smooth muscle tissues (8.Marston S.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). There is no indication, however, what role the CaD-myosin interaction might play in phasic smooth muscles, such as gizzard, where the latch-type contractions are not observed under normal physiological conditions. The precise location of the myosin-binding site(s) in CaD has not been determined. There seems to be a general consensus that the N-terminal portion of the CaD molecule contains a myosin-binding domain (7.Velaz L. Ingraham R.H. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2929-2934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9.Katayama E. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1989; 264: 578-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although a CaD fragment containing the C-terminal 288 residues was also reported to be able to bind myosin (13.Huber P.A.J. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The finding that phosphorylation of CaD in the N-terminal region by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II abolishes its interaction with myosin (12.Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 578-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Hemric M.E. Lu F.W.M. Shrager R. Carey J. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15305-15311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with an N-terminal myosin-binding site. More recently, a deletion mutant of CaD lacking a 30-amino acid residue stretch (from 24 to 53) was shown to lose the capacity to co-sediment with myosin (11.Wang Z. Jiang H. Yang Z.Q. Chacko S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11899-11904Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), further supporting the idea that the major myosin-binding site of CaD is in its N-terminal region. Compared with the C-terminal part of CaD, relatively little is known about the functional domain of the N-terminal region. While C-terminal CaD fragments can be prepared by either proteolysis or by bacterial expression, the N-terminal fragments are more difficult to obtain. For unknown reasons, bacterial cells do not express well the N-terminal peptides. Here we report the preparation of a recombinant N-terminal CaD fragment that encompasses residues 1–240 (N240) by overexpression in insect cells. Using this recombinant fragment and synthetic peptides corresponding to segments in this region, we found that the myosin-binding site is localized within a relatively short stretch near the N terminus of CaD. Some of these peptides are capable of displacing full-length CaD from myosin and may therefore be useful in probing the functional significance of the myosin-binding property of smooth muscle CaD. CaD-N240 (chicken gizzard residues 1–240) cDNA fragment was obtained by using the PCR techniques with the full-length CaD cDNA as a template. Primers of the following sequences were used: 5′-CGC GGA TCC ATG GAT GAC TTT GAA CGC CGT AGA-3′ and 5′-CCC AAG CTT TCA ATC AGT TAT ACT CTG CTC CCC TTC-3′, where the upstream primer contains the CaD translation start codon ATG and the BamHI restriction site, and the downstream primer contains the translation stop site and HindIII restriction site. The PCR product was inserted into pBlueBacIII (Invitrogen) between the BamHI andHindIII sites. The sequence of the resulting vector, pBlueBacIIICaDN240, was confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing over the region of insertion. 3 μg of pBlueBacIIICaDN240 DNA was cotransfected into Sf9 cells with 1 μg of linear AcMNPV DNA (Invitrogen) by the technique of cationic liposome-mediated transfection according to the protocol provided by Invitrogen. To amplify the recombinant pBlueBacIIICaDN240 baculoviruses, Sf9 cells in a 60-mm dish (1.5 × 106 cells) were infected with 10-fold dilutions of virus inoculum (from cotransfections) in the range of expected titer and overlaid with 5 ml of 0.7% agarose containing 150 μg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside). The recombinants were clearly distinguishable within 5–6 days postinfection as blue plaques, which were picked with a Pasteur pipette. Several rounds of plaque assay enabled us to obtain the pure recombinant baculovirus, and propagation of the purified virus yielded large scale, high titer stocks (∼108 plaque-forming units/ml). Determination of virus titer and the time course for production of recombinant protein were also carried out as described in the Invitrogen instruction manual. Expression of N240 was confirmed by immunochemical reaction and partial amino acid sequencing. Expression of recombinant N240 in large scale was performed in High-Five cells as previously described (15.Zhuang S. Mabuchi K. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30242-30248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 48 h after infection, the maximally expressing cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended with 50 ml of buffer A (50 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm leupeptin), frozen and thawed twice, and centrifuged at 42,000 rpm for 40 min. The supernatant was collected and loaded onto a DE-52 column. After washing the column with buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted with a 50–500 mm NaCl gradient in buffer A; fractions containing N240 were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The overall yield was ∼80 mg/liter culture. Smooth muscle myosin was prepared from chicken gizzard according to published procedures (16.Ikebe M. Aiba T. Onishi H. Watanabe S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 83: 1643-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of myosin was carried out by using purified gizzard myosin light chain kinase (a kind gift from Dr. Phil Graceffa) in the presence of Ca2+/CaM and 2 mm ATP (17.Zhuang S. Wang E. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19964-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HMM and S-1 were prepared by cleavages of chicken gizzard myosin with chymotrypsin and papain, respectively (18.Seidel J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4355-4361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscles (19.Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant chicken gizzard CaD was purified from baculovirus-transfected insect cells without heat treatment as described previously (15.Zhuang S. Mabuchi K. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30242-30248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer (ABI-431A) as described previously (20.Wang E. Wang C.-L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For peptides containing N terminus residues (i.e. MY27C and MA22C), acetylated Met was used. The synthesized peptides were purified by reversed phase HPLC using a C8 column (Si-O-Si-(CH2)7-CH3 from Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The purity of the peptides was ascertained by amino acid composition and sequence analyses, as well as mass spectrometry (PerSeptive Biosystems, Voyager Elite). For fluorescence titration studies, purified peptides were labeled at the C-terminal Cys withN,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nirobenz-z-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine as described previously (17.Zhuang S. Wang E. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19964-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The interaction of recombinant CaD fragment and synthetic peptides with myosin was assayed by centrifugation in a Beckman Airfuge. Mixtures of N240 (3–15 μm) or peptides (5–80 μm) and myosin (1.9–2.3 μm), with or without gizzard CaD (1 μm), were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a solution containing 80 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and 2 mm CaCl2 and then centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For quantification, the images of the Coomassie-stained gels were digitized, and the amount of dye associated with the bands of interest was analyzed by the NIH Image program (version 1.61). Binding of CaD peptides to myosin was also studied by adding aliquots of the smooth muscle HMM stock solution (22.3 μm) to 0.6 ml of a solution containing 2–3 μm NBD-labeled IK29C or MY27C (in 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0); the NBD emission (λex = 490 nm; λem = 540 nm) was monitored on a SPEX fluorimeter. The titration data of both the co-sedimentation experiments and fluorescence measurements were fitted to a binding equation described by Morris and Lehrer (21.Morris E.P. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2214-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar): AKv2−(1+nKA+KB)v+nKB=0Equation 1 where A and B are the total concentrations of N240 (or NBD-labeled peptides) and myosin (or HMM), respectively;v is the binding density of myosin (or HMM) to the CaD fragment or peptide (e.g. the fluorescence enhancement),K is the binding constant, and n is the apparent stoichiometry of the saturated complex, AB n. The curve fitting was carried out using a nonweighted, nonlinear least squares method to obtain the binding parameters. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy was carried out as described previously (22.Mabuchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Antibody labeling was necessary for the identification of N240 when bound to HMM. To do this, N240 and monoclonal antibody, C18, of which the epitope locates in the N-terminal CaD (23.Lin J.J.-C. Davis-Nanthakumar E.J. Jin J.-P. Lourim D. Novy R.E. Lin J.L.-C. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), were incubated at concentrations of 5 μm each overnight in 50 mm ammonium acetate and 30% glycerol, pH 7, at room temperature. The mixture was further incubated with gizzard HMM at 0.5 μm each. CaD (0.2 μm) or N240 (0.5 μm), gizzard or skeletal HMM (0.5 μm), and F-actin (10 μm) were mixed in 2 mm MgATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 30% glycerol, and 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7. All of these mixtures were then processed for visualization. Since it was expected that binding of N240 to HMM or that of HMM to F-actin in the presence of ATP was rather weak, we adopted a recently modified shadowing method (3.Mabuchi K. Li Y. Tao T. Wang C.-L.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that allowed us to use HMM and actin concentrations at near micromolar ranges, as compared with ∼10 nm in the conventional methods. In order to minimize the bundling of F-actin induced by CaD, proteins were adsorbed on mica within 10 s after the addition of CaD. N240 alone did not cause bundling of F-actin. The recombinant N-terminal CaD fragment N240 showed binding to unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin, as evidenced by co-sedimentation experiments (Fig.1 A). To estimate the binding affinity of N240 for myosin, we have carried out a series of centrifugations by mixing a fixed amount of myosin and increasing amounts of N240. The Coomassie-stained N240 bands in the pellet were then digitized, normalized against the myosin light chain band, and fitted to a binding equation (see “Materials and Methods”). The fitting yielded a binding constant of 1.2 × 105m−1. Phosphorylation of the myosin light chain had no effects on the apparent binding (data not shown). Inclusion of Ca2+/CaM in the mixture slightly decreased, but did not eliminate, the amount of N240 co-precipitated with myosin, and this effect was reversible by the addition of EDTA (Fig.1 B). CaM appeared to modulate the binding between the N-terminal region of CaD and myosin in a Ca2+-dependent manner; this is in agreement with an earlier report that showed that myosin was retained to CaD-Sepharose to a much lesser extent in the presence of Ca2+/CaM than in its absence (5.Ikebe M. Reardon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3055-3058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of CaD does not have a well characterized CaM-binding site as does in the C-terminal region of CaD; however, it contains a weak CaM-binding site, as shown previously by photocross-linking and affinity chromatography (24.Wang C.-L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25.Wang C.-L.A. Wang L.-W.C. Lu R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is possible that this secondary site around Cys-153 is responsible for the observed CaM-dependent interaction with myosin. The physiological role of such a modulatory effect awaits further study. Binding of N240 to myosin was further studied by electron microscopy. At concentrations of 0.5 μm each, we observed only occasional complex formation between N240 and HMM (Fig.2). The site of binding, based on the positions of the monoclonal antibody molecules (asterisks), was predominantly at the C-terminal end of the S2 region with a few exceptions, in which case N240 appeared to bind at the myosin heads (see inset). A rough statistical tally revealed that 22 out of ∼350 HMM molecules were bound at the S2 region, while five bound at the head. Although the S2-binding site agrees well with the biochemical data (5.Ikebe M. Reardon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3055-3058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the significance of N240 binding at the myosin head is not clear, considering the relatively low affinity between the two proteins. However, regardless of the specificity of such binding, the presence of multiple binding sites could explain the ability of CaD to promote myosin filaments formation (26.Katayama E. Scott-Woo G. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3919-3925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or aggregation (see below). The 22 complexed HMM out of ∼350 molecules could be translated to an affinity constant of ∼1.5 × 105m−1; thus, the frequency of bound molecules observed by EM is in good agreement with the results of the co-sedimentation experiment (see above). Marston (27.Marston S. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) previously reported that in the presence of ATP, CaD potentiated binding of gizzard HMM to actin filaments. He calculated that each CaD molecule caused binding of ∼20 HMM molecules, thus suggesting a mechanism other than direct cross-linking of HMM to actin by CaD. We have tried to reproduce his experimental conditions within the limit of electron microscopy and indeed observed very similar phenomena. Gizzard HMM did not show much binding to F-actin in the presence of ATP (Fig.3 A), but binding was greatly enhanced by the addition of CaD (Fig. 3 B). We have also tested skeletal HMM and found only very little binding (data not shown), again confirming the result of this earlier study (27.Marston S. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, CaD seemed to have also caused aggregation of gizzard HMM at the same time when most gizzard HMM bound to F-actin. Thus our findings suggest that binding or cross-linking of merely a fraction of HMM in a given aggregate could bring the entire HMM aggregate close to F-actin. If this is the case, the observed apparent potentiation in HMM binding to F-actin in the presence of CaD and ATP could be an artifact and not take place in situ, since myosin molecules do not aggregate. The molecular mechanism of how CaD causes HMM to aggregate; nevertheless, is an intriguing question in view of the fact that CaD indeed facilitates myosin filament formation. N240 did not induce as drastic an enhancement of HMM binding as in the case of full-length CaD. A lesser extent of HMM aggregation, albeit at a much lower frequency, and highly HMM-decorated F-actin was nevertheless observed (Fig. 3 C). The difference in the degree of enhancement may be explained by the lack of the C-terminal CaD sequence in N240. Their similarity in causing HMM aggregation and enhancement of HMM binding to F-actin, on the other hand, could be attributed to their common myosin-binding properties. It remains uncertain whether or not the observed aggregation requires N240 to bind F-actin, but such ability should conceivably facilitate the binding of HMM to F-actin. A comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of several CaD isoforms (Fig.4) revealed that the peptide stretch from residue Tyr-27 to Lys-53 (chicken gizzard numbering system) represents a segment of identical sequence for both mammal and avian CaD. Assuming that myosin binding is a common property of CaD, and that all CaD isoforms target at a conserved sequence in the myosin molecule, this homologous segment would be a good candidate for the myosin-binding site. Consistent with this hypothesis is the finding that a CaD mutant with this segment deleted indeed lost myosin binding capacity (11.Wang Z. Jiang H. Yang Z.Q. Chacko S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11899-11904Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One caveat for the negative results derived from the internal deletion mutation is that the observed lack of binding for the mutant may be due to an altered conformation resulting from the deletion rather than the loss of these residues per se. To show that the deleted segment in fact contains the myosin-binding site of CaD, we have prepared a synthetic peptide, IK29C, corresponding to this N-terminal common sequence. IK29C (25IAYQRNDDDEEEAARERRRRARQERLRQK53-C) was found to co-sediment with gizzard myosin in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the scrambled peptide, IK29CX1 (REAERARQRE IDLRAREKQRAERYDQRND-C) only displayed very weak, basal binding (Fig. 5, A andB). To quantitate the binding, we have carried out fluorescence titration using NBD-labeled peptides and gizzard HMM. The binding constants were estimated to be 3.83 × 106m−1 and 1.14 × 106m−1 for IK29C and MY27C, respectively (Fig.6).Figure 6Binding of CaD peptides to gizzard HMM. NBD-labeled IK29C (2.0 μm) or MY27C (3.24 μm) was titrated with gizzard HMM (22.3 μm). The NBD emission (λex = 490 nm; λem = 540 nm) was monitored. Solid lines are best fit curves with binding constants of 3.83 × 106m−1 (IK29C;upper curve) and 1.14 × 106m−1 (MY27C; lower curve).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also did the co-sedimentation experiments in the presence of CaD, under which condition IK29C showed weakened binding to myosin. Binding of the peptide was found to be accompanied by concomitant dissociation of CaD (Fig. 7), indicating that IK29C effectively competes with CaD for myosin binding, and thus that IK29C must contain the major myosin-binding sequence in CaD. As a control, the scrambled peptide, IK29CX1, did not co-sediment with myosin; nor was CaD displaced from the pellet. It is noteworthy that the IK29C sequence contains mainly charged residues with a cluster of negative charges (DDDEEE) followed by a cluster of positive charges (RRRRAR). We have designed another “scrambled” peptide, IK29CX2 (EEEEDDDEAAALAIYNRRRRRRRRRKQQQ-C), in which the two clusters of opposite charges were preserved and augmented. Curiously, IK29CX2 sedimented by itself, apparently resulting from self-aggregation because of the highly polarized charges and the hydrophobic core. In the presence of added bovine serum albumin, the aggregation was much alleviated, and the peptide no longer precipitated in significant amounts, either by itself or in the presence of myosin. Thus, the specific sequence and the separation of clustered charges, rather than the charges alone seem to be the determinant for myosin binding. In addition to the charged residues, there are also three hydrophobic residues (Ile-Ala-Tyr) at the N terminus of IK29C. To test whether these nonpolar residues play any role in myosin-binding, we have synthesized two peptides, MY27C, which corresponds to the first 27 residues in the gizzard sequence (1MDDFERRRELRRQKREEMRLEAERLSY27-C), and MA22C, corresponding to the first 22 residues of the same sequence except that the C-terminal 5 residues, including the three nonpolar ones, are truncated (1MDDFERRRELRRQKREEMRLEA22-C). Both peptides were prepared with acetylation at the N terminus and purified by HPLC. We found that MY27C exhibited a weak affinity toward myosin; only at a relatively high concentration (≥20 μm) was there an appreciated amount of peptide detected in the pellet when co-sedimented with myosin. MA22C, on the other hand, did not show any significant binding to myosin (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the 3 uncharged residues (Ile-Ala-Tyr in the mammalian sequence, or Leu-Ser-Tyr in the avian sequence) most likely contribute to the specific interaction between CaD and myosin, although the downstream charged residues are also needed for the observed affinity. This finding is in good agreement with a report by Vorotnikov et al. (28.Vorotnikov A.V. Marston S.B. Huber P.A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) who predicted that one of the myosin-binding sites is within the N-terminal 28-residue peptide stretch on the basis that a fragment lacking this stretch (29N152) was unable to displace intact CaD from myosin filaments. Interestingly, such a truncated fragment nevertheless exhibited nonspecific binding toward myosin with a nearly identical affinity to that of intact CaD, suggesting the the specificity for the CaD-myosin interaction stems from residues other than the charged clusters. While the major myosin-binding site is located at the N terminus, we cannot rule out the presence of other, weaker myosin-binding sites in the CaD molecule. Huber et al. (13.Huber P.A.J. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) found that a 288-residue C-terminal CaD fragment (H1) co-sedimented with smooth muscle myosin and therefore proposed a myosin-binding site in the region between residues 506 and 793 of the human sequence. This binding site, however, may not be significant under physiological conditions, because the binding occurred only at low salt (5 mm KCl) and became negligible at higher ionic strength (90 mm; see Ref.13.Huber P.A.J. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Possible functional roles of CaD-myosin interactions postulated thus far include (i) to stabilize unphosphorylated myosin filaments (26.Katayama E. Scott-Woo G. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3919-3925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); (ii) to maintain force at no cost of energy (latch) (8.Marston S.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); (iii) to keep thick filaments in an organized form during contraction (3.Mabuchi K. Li Y. Tao T. Wang C.-L.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); and (iv) to enhance binding of myosin to actin filaments (29.Haeberle J.R. Trybus K.M. Hemric M.E. Warshaw D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23001-23006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of thein situ localization of CaD in smooth muscle cells, we further propose that (v) interactions between CaD and myosin may play a role in determining the positioning of CaD along the actin filament. It remains to be seen which if any of these possibilities are the true functions. If the CaD-myosin interaction indeed plays a physiological role, the question then is whether or not such an interaction is regulated and how. These issues are ultimately linked to the function of CaD. The myosin-binding peptides (IK29C and MY27C) should provide us with a useful tool for the design of experiments to find these answers. We thank Gina Pagani for synthesizing the peptides and Dr. Guanming Wu for mass spectrometric analysis."

Geil L. et al.Science. 1993; 260: 1317-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). VHL binds specifically to the elongin BC complex in vivo and in vitro via a motif that is conserved between VHL and elongin A (11.Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 14.Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10589-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this site is mutated in a subset of naturally occurring VHL mutants, suggesting that the tumor suppressor function of VHL could involve interaction with a subcomplex of elongin. As well as its involvement in transcription elongation, a role for elongin in the regulation of protein ubiquitination has been inferred from the similarity of elongin to a class of E3 ubiquitin ligases known as SCF complexes (forSkp1-Cullin-F-box). SCFs are heterotetramers that contain a member from each of four protein families, which are conserved from yeast to man. The complex comprises an F-box-containing protein, a Skp1 homologue, the ring finger protein Rbx1, and a cullin (Cdc53 in yeast). Although neither elongin nor elongin complexes have been shown directly to possess E3 ligase activity, elongin bears overall similarity to SCF complexes in many ways. First, mammalian elongins B and C form a complex not only with VHL but also with both cullin 2, a Cdc53 homologue, and Rbx1 (19.Pause A. Lee S. Worrell R.A. Chen D.Y. Burgess W.H. Linehan W.M.

Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Second, elongin C is a sequence homologue of Skp1 (22.Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Third, elongin B is a ubiquitin-like protein (24.Garrett K.P. Aso T. Bradsher J.N. Foundling S.I. Lane W.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7172-7176Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fourth, elongin A has an F-box (22.Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Fifth, VHL, and likely the VHL-containing protein complexes, are implicated in protein turnover in vivo; VHL affects the turnover of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (25.Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4087) Google Scholar). Last, the complex comprising elongins B and C, VHL, cullin 2, and Rbx1 is associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (26.Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 27.Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T. Minato N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Klausner R.D. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12436-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The homologue of elongin C in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,which is named Elc1, stimulates the activity of mammalian elongin A. This protein is termed Elc1 (28.Aso T. Conrad M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We identified and characterized a yeast protein (Ela1 = elongin A), that forms a complex with Elc1 and displays strong sequence similarity to mammalian elongin A. Ela1 contains two conserved sequence motifs: an elongin C binding site and an F-box. We identified the structural domain of Ela1 that interacts with Elc1. Our results contribute further insight into the genetics and structure of elongin, and identify a core complex amenable to structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Plasmid YNL230CY encoding C-terminal V5 epitope-tagged yeast elongin A under control of the GAL1 promoter and with aURA3-selectable marker was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Two rounds of PCR were employed to construct yeast elongin C with a N-terminal HPC4 epitope (29.Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 826-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using yeast genomic DNA as a template. The first round introduced a polyhistidine tag at the N terminus. The second round added a HPC4 epitope to the N terminus, 5′ to the polyhistidine tag. The following primers were used: 1st round, 5′-CATCATCATCATCATCATATGTCTCAAGATTTCGTTACG-3′ and 5′-CAAGCTTCTATATACTCAAATAGTCCGC-3′; 2nd round, 5′-AGGATCCACCATGGAGGACCAGGTGGACCCCAGGCTGATCGACGGCAAGCATCATCATCATCATCAT-3′ and 5′-CAAGCTTCTATATACTCAAATAGTCCGC-3′. The final PCR product was cloned into vector Topo 2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then excised with BamHI and HindIII and subcloned into vector YEplac112 placed under control of the GAL1 promoter (30.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar) (TRP1 marker). For co-immunoprecipitation studies, elongin A was coexpressed with elongin C in strain MDY433 (31.Dresser M.E. Ewing D.J. Conrad M.N. Dominguez A.M. Barstead R. Jiang H. Kodadek T. Genetics. 1997; 147: 533-544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two liters of culture coexpressing elongin A and elongin C were grown to 5 × 107cells/ml in SC, ura−, trp− media using 2% galactose as the sole carbon source. The cells were pelleted and washed with one-half volume of ice-cold water and pelleted again. The cell pellet was resuspended with 7 ml of lysis buffer (900 mm(NH4)2SO4, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm DTT, 30% glycerol, 150 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) and enough water to bring the final cell suspension volume to 20 ml. 200 μl of zymolyase was added, and the extract incubated on ice for 1 h. The cells in the suspension were then lysed with one pass through a French pressure cell at 1,500 p.s.i. 200 μl of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P-9599, Sigma) was immediately added. The lysate was then clarified for 30 min at 30,000 rpm in a Beckman 45Ti rotor and the supernatant frozen at −80 °C in aliquots. The cell lysate was thawed and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge for 15 min. CaCl2 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10 mm. 500 μl of the supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of the appropriate antibody and 30 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h. The beads were then washed four times with 500 μl of 20 mmTris HCI, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton, 10 mm CaCl2. The final wash was performed with an Immunocatcher spin column (Cytosignal, Irvine, CA). Complexes were then eluted from the beads with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. Anti-V5 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Anti-HPC4 antibody was was provided by C. Esmon (Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation). Ela1 and Elc1 and various truncations of Ela1 were expressed in bacteria. The coding sequences were amplified from yeast genomic DNA using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) by PCR. For expression of full-length Ela1 and Elc1, the restriction sitesNdeI and BamHI were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the PCR products respectively. The NdeI- andBamHI-digested PCR products were inserted between the corresponding sites of the T7 polymerase expression vector pET15b (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI), generating plasmids p15bELA1 and p15bELC1. The recombinant proteins were expressed as fusions to an N-terminal six-histidine tag and a thrombin protease site. To generate a plasmid for coexpression of Ela1 with Elc1, the coding sequence for Ela1 was first inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of the T7 polymerase expression vector pET11a, generating plasmid p11aELA1. p11aELA1 was then digested with BamHI andBglII to obtain an 1257-base pair product containing the T7 promoter and the Ela1 protein coding sequence. This fragment was then cloned into the BamHI site of p15bELC1, generating plasmid p15bA/C1. The various truncations of Ela1 were introduced into p15bA/C1 using the Quick-Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), generating plasmids as described under “Results.” Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the plasmids described above were grown at 30 °C to an OD600 of 0.3–0.4 in 10 liters of medium. For15N-labeled proteins, M9 minimal medium containing15NH4Cl was used; Luria broth was used for unlabeled proteins. Isopropyl-6-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. The cells were grown for an additional 3.0 h before harvesting and were then resuspended in Buffer A (30 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnSO4, 10% glycerol) containing 5 mm imidazole and protease inhibitors (1× PI) (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mg/ml chymostatin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin). The cells were lysed using a French pressure cell, and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 40 min at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The supernatant solution was loaded onto a 5 × 5-cm DE52 (Whatman, Maidstone, United Kingdom) column, previously equilibrated in Buffer A with 5 mm imidazole. The flow-through was loaded onto a 1 × 6-cm His-bind column (Novagen), washed extensively with Buffer A containing 30 mm imidazole and eluted with Buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed immediately against Buffer B (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mmDTT, and 10 μm ZnSO4) containing 300 mm NaCl. For the purification of the complex containing full-length Ela1 and Elc1 (Ela1/Elc1), the dialyzed eluate was applied to a Mono-S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie D'Urfe, Quebec, Canada), washed with Buffer B containing 500 mmNaCl and eluted with Buffer B containing 1 m NaCl. The eluate was dialyzed immediately against Buffer B with 300 mm NaCl. Purified proteins were stored at −70 °C. When necessary, the hexahistidine tag was removed by the addition of thrombin in Buffer B according to the pET system technical manual (Novagen). The resulting Elc1 protein contained 3 additional residues at the N terminus (Gly-Ser-His). The digested samples were then concentrated to 2 mm protein and resolved on a Superose 12 HR 10/50 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 0.2 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing purified complexes were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon 10, Amicon), filtered through a 0.22-μm Acrodisc (Millex-GP, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at 4 °C. Yeast RNA polymerase II was purified from bakers' yeast as described previously (32.Edwards A.M. Darst S.A. Feaver W.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2122-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), except that 10 μm ZnCl2 was included in all buffers. The polymerase preparations were stored at −70 °C in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 40 mm ammonium sulfate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmEDTA, and 10 μm ZnCl2. The purification of recombinant yeast elongin C/A complex was described under the section “Purification of Recombinant Elongin Complexes.” The ability of yeast elongin C/A to stimulate RNA polymerase II was analyzed by an in vitro nonspecific transcript assay. Briefly, transcription by purified RNA polymerase II was carried out in the presence or absence of recombinant yeast elongin C/A complex. Activity was assayed in a 20-μl mixture containing 60 mmTris-OAc, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgOAc, 5% glycerol, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 6 mm spermidine HCl, 0.8 mm each ATP, GTP, and UTP, 0.1 mm CTP, 1 μm[α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), 1 unit of RNase inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, Quebec, Canada), 50 μg/ml native salmon sperm DNA, and 150 ng of RNA polymerase II with increasing amounts of elongin A/C complex or buffer as indicated. Samples were processed after a 25-min incubation at 30 °C by spotting on DE81 cellulose, washing away the unincorporated nucleotides and measuring the relative incorporation of [α-32P]CTP. Four micrograms of purified full length Ela1/Elc1 complex were incubated with 4 ng of chymotrypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C for up to 8 h in Buffer B containing 300 mm NaCl. The proteolytic products were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. For preparative purposes, 500 μg of purified full-length Ela1/Elc1 complex were incubated with 500 ng of chymotrypsin at 4 °C for 4 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.1%. Proteolytic products were purified by reverse-phase chromatography using a 30-ml linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The absorbance at 220 nm was used to identify peak fractions, which were then precipitated using trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The molecular weights of the purified products were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (University of Waterloo). To isolate Ela11–143 and Elc1 individually, the Ela11–143/Elc1 complex was denatured and the individual subunits purified as follows. After elution from the His-bind column, the purified Ela11–143/Elc1 complex was dialyzed against Buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole. Subsequent steps were performed at 25 °C. Urea was added to a final concentration of 6.0m to dissociate the Ela11–143 and Elc1 subunits. The denatured complex was then re-applied to a 1 × 6-cm His-bind column (Novagen), previously equilibrated with Buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole and 6.0 m urea. Elc1, which contained a hexahistidine tag, bound to the nickel resin; free, purified Ela11–143 flowed through the column. To purify Elc1, the column was washed extensively with Buffer A containing 30 mm imidazole and 6 m urea. Elc1 was eluted with the same solution augmented with 500 mm imidazole. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. The isolated, denatured Ela11–143was diluted to 0.1 mm and renatured by dialysis against decreasing concentrations of urea in Buffer B containing 500 mm NaCl. The urea concentration was decreased by 0.4m urea decrements every 6 h. The final dialysate, containing no urea, was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 15 min to remove any protein that had precipitated. The supernatant was concentrated to 0.2 mm, filtered through a 0.22-μm Acrodisc (Millex-GP, Millipore) and stored at 4 °C. Denatured Elc1 was renatured as for Ela11–143. After the last dialysis step, the hexahistidine tag was removed by the addition of thrombin (pET System Technical Manual, Novagen). Following digestion for 4 h at 4 °C, the protein was loaded onto a 1 × 6-cm His-bind column (Novagen), pre-equilibrated in Buffer B containing 5 mm imidazole and 500 mm NaCl, and washed with the same buffer. Elc1 lacking the hexahistidine tag flowed through the nickel resin while undigested protein remained bound to the resin. The cleaved protein was concentrated to 1.0 - 2.0 mm by ultrafiltration (Centricon 10, Amicon), filtered through a 0.22-μm Acrodisc (Millex-GP, Millipore) and stored at 4 °C. To renature the complex of Ela11–143 and Elc1, a 2-fold molar excess of Elc1 was added to Ela11–143 and the complex renatured as described for free Elc1. Following renaturation, the complex was resolved on a 1 × 10-cm Superose 12 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 0.2 ml/min. Circular dichroism experiments were performed on an Aviv-62A DS spectropolarizer using 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvettes. 25 μm samples of Ela11–143, Elc1, Ela1/Elc1, or Ela11–143/Elc1 (both native and renatured complexes were used) were prepared in Buffer B containing 500 mm NaCl and lacking DTT. Exact protein concentrations were then determined by amino acid analysis. A wavelength scan measuring observed ellipticities was recorded for each sample at 25 °C, employing a 15-s averaging time. The melting temperatures were determined for each protein by monitoring the observed residue ellipticity at 222 nm from 15 °C to 105 °C. Data points were collected every 2 °C with equilibration and averaging times of 60 and 15 s, respectively. All NMR experiments were acquired on Varian Unity or Unity+ spectrometers operating at 500- and 600-MHz proton frequencies and equipped with pulse field gradients. 10% D2O was added to the samples for a lock signal. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. HSQC spectra (33.Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) were acquired with sweep widths of 8000 Hz centered on the hydrogen, oxygen, deuterium peak for the proton dimension, and 2000 Hz centered at 118 ppm relative to external 15N urea in Me2SO. The1H chemical shifts were referenced to the hydrogen, oxygen, deuterium peak at 4.772 ppm at 25 °C. Data were processed with the NMRPipe/NMRDrawt software package (34.Delaglio F.S. Gnzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11443) Google Scholar) on a Sun SPARC5 workstation. Typically, Lorentzian-to-Gaussian or adjustable sine functions were applied before the transformation. Data were zero-filled in ω2(1H) and ω1(15N) dimensions to give a final matrix of 1024 × 256 real points. In a search for homologues of mammalian elongin in the yeast S. cerevisiae, we identified two genes with significant sequence similarity to human elongins A and C (35.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69652) Google Scholar). The yeast elongin C homologue (ELC1) had been identified previously (28.Aso T. Conrad M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Elc1 is probably the functional homologue of mammalian elongin C because it can activate the transcription activity of mammalian elongin A and can interact with the VHL tumor suppressor protein (28.Aso T. Conrad M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of the elongin A homologue (YNL230C), which we have termedELA1, encodes a 379-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 44 kDa (Fig.1 A). The most significant similarity (31% identity) is exhibited in the region of the mammalian protein most critical for transcriptional activity (36.Aso T. Haque D. Barstead R.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This portion of the protein also contains an elongin C binding motif (15.Kibel A. Iliopoulos O. DeCaprio J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 1995; 269: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and an F-box (37.Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). The ELC1 open reading frame encodes a 99-amino acid protein displaying 41% identity to human elongin C (28.Aso T. Conrad M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In an initial characterization of Ela1 and Elc1, yeast strains bearing deletions of ELA1 and ELC1 were generated. Strains bearing deletions of ELA1, ELC1, or both genes had no detectable phenotype. We were also unable to detect a synthetic effect of elongin A or C disruptions in strains bearing mutations in other transcription elongation factors, such as TFIIS, Rpb9, and Spt4 (data not shown). A structural and biochemical examination of the yeast elongins was also initiated in an attempt to gain insight into their functions. We reasoned that if Ela1 is thebona fide homologue of elongin A, then Ela1 and Elc1 should form a stable heterodimer. To test whether the yeast Elc1 and Ela1 interacted in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies on tagged versions of the proteins overexpressed in yeast. Yeast cells were transformed with plasmids encoding HPC4-Elc1 and V5-Ela1 under control of a galactose-inducible promoter. Complexes were immunoprecipitated from induced cell lysates with anti-V5 or anti-HPC4 and detected by immunoblotting (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig.2 illustrates that Ela1 and Elc1 form a stable complex in yeast. To facilitate the functional studies of the complex, a recombinant Elc1/Ela1 dimer was generated. Neither Elc1 nor Ela1 expressed well in bacterial cells (<0.2 mg/liter) and both proteins were completely insoluble (data not shown). Co-expression of the two subunits from the same plasmid led to the production of soluble products; in the construct, only Elc1 contained a hexahistidine tag. Both tagged Elc1 and Ela1 expressed to a relatively high level (>2 mg/liter). These data suggest that there is a co-dependence of the two proteins for proper folding. To explore if the bacterially expressed proteins formed a stable complex, histidine-tagged Elc1 was purified using a combination of metal-chelate, cation exchange, and gel filtration chromatography and the co-purification of Ela1 monitored. A protein with the same relative mass as Ela1 co-purified with Elc1 over all chromatographic steps. This protein was shown to be Ela1 using mass spectrometry. The co-migration of the Elc1 and Ela1 through all these steps of purification indicated that the two proteins formed a stable complex (termed Ela1/Elc1) and that the ELA1 gene corresponds to a yeast homologue of elongin A (Fig. 3). Rat elongin is able to stimulate the rate of transcription of rat RNA polymerase II on a double-stranded DNA template. To test if purified yeast Ela1/Elc1 possessed this biochemical activity, we performed nonspecific assays of RNA chain elongation with purified yeast RNA polymerase II. Briefly, RNA polymerase II transcription was initiated on a sheared salmon sperm double-stranded DNA template and the rate of incorporation of ribonucleotides into RNA chains was measured in the presence or absence of Ela1/Elc1. We found that Ela1/Elc1 had no effect on the rate of nucleotide incorporation. A representative experiment is shown in Fig.4. We monitored activity under a wide ran"
