https://openalex.org/W2120328280,"ELO2 and ELO3 were identified from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome data base as homologues of ELO1, a gene involved in the elongation of the fatty acid 14:0 to 16:0. Mutations in these genes have previously been shown to produce pleiotropic effects involving a number of membrane functions. The simultaneous disruption ofELO2 and ELO3 has also been shown to produce synthetic lethality, indicating that they have related and/or overlapping functions. Gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analyses reveal that null mutations of ELO2and ELO3 produce defects in the formation of very long chain fatty acids. Analysis of the null mutants indicates that these genes encode components of the membrane-bound fatty acid elongation systems that produce the 26-carbon very long chain fatty acids that are precursors for ceramide and sphingolipids. Elo2p appears to be involved in the elongation of fatty acids up to 24 carbons. It appears to have the highest affinity for substrates with chain lengths less than 22 carbons. Elo3p apparently has a broader substrate specificity and is essential for the conversion of 24-carbon acids to 26-carbon species. Disruption of either gene reduces cellular sphingolipid levels and results in the accumulation of the long chain base, phytosphingosine. Null mutations in ELO3 result in accumulation of labeled precursors into inositol phosphoceramide, with little labeling in the more complex mannosylated sphingolipids, whereas disruption of ELO2 results in reduced levels of all sphingolipids.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sphingolipids comprise approximately 10% of the total membrane lipid species (1Smith S.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3395-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobic moiety of these lipids is ceramide, which consists of a long chain base coupled to a very long chain fatty acid that is almost exclusively 26:0 1The standard numerical fatty acid nomenclature is used in which the number preceding the colon represents the number of carbons in the hydrocarbon chain and the number following the colon indicates the number of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain,i.e. 26:0, hexacosanoic acid; HO-26:0; α-hydroxyhexacosanoic acid. or hydroxy 26:0 (2Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). Although sphingolipids are relatively minor membrane lipid species, they are highly concentrated on the plasma membrane and appear to be essential for a number of critical membrane and cellular functions (3Hechtberger P. Zinser E. Saf R. Hummel K. Paultauf F. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Patton J.L. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem.

Inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis results in growth inhibition and cell death (6Zweerink M.M. Edison A.M. Wells G.B. Pinto W. Lester R.L. J. Biol.

Pelaez F. Harris G.H. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 48: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Ceramide has also been implicated as a component of an essential cell signaling pathways inSaccharomyces (8Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Gene Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In wild type cells, most fatty acids are 12–18-carbon species that are found in glycerolipids. Those species appear to be formed de novo by the well characterized soluble cytoplasmic fatty acid synthase complex. The very long chain (20+ carbon) fatty acids found in sphingolipids, however, are formed by membrane-bound fatty acid elongation systems that are not well characterized. These enzyme systems extend 14–18-carbon fatty acids by 2-carbon units by a sequence of reactions similar to those catalyzed by fatty acid synthases, with the exception of one reduction step, which in mammalian cells appears to be mediated by cytochrome b 5(9Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We recently identified a gene (ELO1) that encodes a membrane protein involved in the elongation of 14:0 to 16:0 (10Toke D. Martin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18413-18422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of that gene with the recently completedSaccharomyces genome data base revealed two additional genes with high identity to ELO1. These are referred to asELO2 and ELO3 in this paper, based on their function in fatty acid elongation. Both genes have been previously identified as open reading frames of unknown function; mutations in these genes induce pleiotropic phenotypes that appear to play a key role in membrane and cytoskeletal functions (11Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C. Rahier A. Taton M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Loison G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2719-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ELO2 was initially cloned by complementation of mutants ofGNS1 (12El-Sherbeini M. Clemas J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Those mutants confer resistance to echinocandins and have defects in β-glucan synthase activities. It was also reported as FEN1 (11Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C. Rahier A. Taton M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Loison G. Mol. Cell.

Acta. 1995; 1263: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a gene whose mutants exhibited bud localization defects and resistance to the sterol isomerase inhibitor SR 31747. ELO3 was previously cloned and identified, respectively, as APA1 with mutant alleles that cause a decrease in the level of the plasma membrane ATPase (14Garcia-Arranz M. Maldonado A.M. Mazon M.J. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18076-18082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),SUR4 (15Desfarges L. Durrens P. Juguelin H. Cassagne C. Bonneau M. Aigle M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whose mutants suppress the reduced viability on starvation mutant phenotype (rvs161), and SRE1(11Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C. Rahier A. Taton M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Loison G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2719-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) whose mutants suppress the effects of the steroid isomerase inhibitor, SR 31747. At least two laboratories have reported that simultaneous disruption of ELO2 and ELO3 produces a lethal phenotype (11Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C.

Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) which indicates that their encoded proteins have related and overlapping functions. Similar studies in this laboratory also support the synthetic lethality of the double disruptions. The characterization of the genes described in this paper suggests that they encode proteins required for the production of very long chain fatty acids. Each gene apparently encodes a single enzyme component of one or more systems that elongate C16 and C18acids to C20-C26 very long chain fatty acids. Disruption of either gene causes either the reduction or loss of 26:0, the end product of the elongation pathway, with a concomitant reduction in ceramide synthesis and striking changes in sphingolipid composition. The strains used in this study and their genotypes are presented in Table I. Plasmids constructed for this study are shown in Table II. Standard yeast genetics methods were used for construction of strains bearing the appropriate mutations (16Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Course Manual.

Martin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18413-18422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Methyl esters were prepared from washed cells grown to a density of 2–3 × 107 ml in 50 ml of CM or CM (−URA) medium containing either 2% glucose or 2% galactose. Gas chromatography temperature programming was modified to optimize analysis of very long chain fatty acids on a 0.32 mm × 30 m SupelcoWax™10 column. Two-ml cultures were grown to 2 × 106 cells/ml in CM medium at 30 °C and then labeled with either 20 μCi/ml [3H]serine for 6 h or 1 μCi/ml [3H]dihydrosphingosine (10 μm) for 30 min. Cultures were chilled on ice with an additional 0.5 ml of unlabeled stationary phase cells and centrifuged at 2800 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed 2 times with 5 ml of cold H2O and treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 20 min. Lipids were extracted twice in 1 ml of ethanol/water/diethyl ether/pyridine/NH4OH (15:15:5:1:0.018) at 60 °C as described (18Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [3H]serine-labeled extract was subjected to mild alkaline methanolysis by one treatment of 0.5 ml of monomethylamine reagent as prepared by Clarke and Dawson (19Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 52 °C. The alkali-stable [3H]serine-labeled lipids were dried under N2, resuspended in 0.1 ml of chloroform/methanol/H2O (16:16:5), applied to Whatman Linear K6D silica gel TLC plates (25 μl/spot), and resolved in CHCl3/methanol/ 4.2 n NH4OH (9:7:2). The [3H]dihydrosphingosine-labeled total lipid extracts were dried under N2, resuspended in 0.2 μl, and subjected to TLC as described (7Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Frommer B.R. Curotto J.E.

The amplified product was ligated into the pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen), resulting in formation of pCRELO2. This plasmid was digested with HpaI/MfeI to remove most part of the ELO2 coding region. A 1.2-kb DNA fragment of the Saccharomyces HIS3 gene was inserted into blunt-ended sites of the vector. The resulting plasmid (pCRelo2HIS) contains the HIS3 gene coding sequence in an orientation opposite to that of ELO2. A 2.2-kbelo2Δ::HIS3 linear disruption cassette was released from that plasmid by digestion withSalI and XbaI. This DNA fragment was electroporated into strain DTY10A to creating strain DTY004. Interruption of the ELO2 gene by that fragment was confirmed by PCR, using primers that flank the ELO2 open reading frame sequence.Table IIIPCR primers used in this workGeneOligonucleotide designation and sequenceELO1–5′ELO1A, (5′-GCAAGTATGGTAAGTGATTGG-3′)ELO1–3′ELO1B, (5′-GGACTGGTTAATTGTTTTTGTTG-3′)ELO2–5′ELO2A, (5′-GAACTAATTATCTTCGTCTAGAAGCC-3′)ELO2–3′ELO2B, (5′-GTCGACGTAATATATAACAAAACCATCC-3′)ELO3–5′ELO3A, (5′-GTCAATAATCAGGGTTGGAG-3′)ELO3–3′ELO3B, (5′-GTCCTGCGATTTTATTCG-3′) Open table in a new tab The plasmid pCRELO2 was digested with BamHI and SalI. The released 1.2-kb DNA fragment was ligated into plasmid YCpGAL1URA downstream of the GAL1 promoter sequences. This construct (YCpGALELO2(U)) was analyzed by diagnostic restriction enzyme digest to confirm the correct orientation of the ELO2 fragment in respect to the GAL1 promoter. That plasmid was electroporated into strain CSY3H for over-expression studies of theELO2 gene in the elo3 −background. A 2.9-kb fragment containing the coding sequence for ELO3 was derived by PCR using primers ELO3A and ELO3B (Table III) and strain DTY10A genomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was digested withKpnI and SalI and ligated into plasmid YEp352 in which the HindIII site had been destroyed to produce YEpElo3. This plasmid was digested with HindIII followed by Klenow fill-in to remove the ELO3 coding region. A 1.2-kb DNA blunt-ended SalI-XhoI fragment containing theS. cerevisiae HIS3 gene was inserted into the vector creating plasmid YEpelo3HIS. The resulting plasmid (YEpelo3HIS) contains the HIS3 gene coding sequence in an orientation opposite to that of ELO3. A 3.4-kbelo3Δ::HIS3 linear disruption cassette was released from that plasmid byKpnI/SalI restriction digest. This DNA fragment was electroporated into strain DTY10A to disrupt the chromosomal copy of ELO3. Interruption of the ELO3 gene was confirmed by PCR, using primers that flank the ELO3 open reading frame sequence. A DNA fragment containing the GAL1 promoter derived from vector YCpGAL1 by EcoRI digestion was inserted upstream of theELO3 mRNA coding sequences in plasmid YEpElo3 at aSacI restriction enzyme site. The 5′-untranslated region ofELO3, including its presumptive basal promoter elements (TATA), was removed from the plasmid by partial HindIII digestion. A 2.0-kb DNA fragment, containing the GAL1promoter and adjacent ELO3 protein coding sequences, was released from the resulting plasmid by EcoRI digestion. The recovered fragment was ligated into complementary EcoRI sites on plasmid YCpGAL1 which contains the URA3 gene as a selectable marker. These constructs YCpGALELO3(U) were analyzed by diagnostic restriction enzyme digest to confirm the correct orientation of the EL03 fragment in respect to the GAL1promoter. These constructs were electroporated into strain DTY004 for over-expression studies of the ELO3 gene in anelo2 − background. Fatty acid methyl esters were extracted from washed yeast cell pellets as described previously (17Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16537-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These were generated by boiling the cell pellets derived from 50-ml cultures containing 1–4 × 107 cells/ml in a mixture of 3n methanolic-HCl. The samples were then extracted with hexane/anhydrous ethyl ether (1:1). Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using a Varian 3400 CX gas chromatograph and with a 30 m × 0.32 mm SupelcoWax™-10 column with a film thickness of 0.32 μm using helium as the carrier gas. The injector temperature (splitting ratio 50:1) for gas chromatograph was 240 °C and the oven temperature was increased from 70 to 240 at 20 °C/min. Gas chromatography data was collected and quantified using the Shimadzu EZChrom data system. Mass spectra data were collected and quantified on a Finnigan Mat 8230 mass spectrograph using the Finnigan Mat SS300 data system. The same gas chromatography column and temperature programming parameters were used to fractionate fatty acids prior to ionization. The ion source temperature for mass spectra was 250 °C, and the filament emission current was 1 mA. Mass spectra were recorded at an ionization voltage of 70 eV. Ions from 35 to 600 amu were scanned at 1 s/decade and interscanned at 0.85 s/decade. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed according to standard protocols (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 13.0.1-13.11.4Google Scholar). All PCR reactions were performed in a “OmniGene” thermal cycler (Hybaid, Ltd.) using a heat-stable recombinant “Vent” DNA polymerase with 5′–3′- and 3′–5′-exonuclease activity. This allowed for greater fidelity of PCR products with an error rate of approximately 1 in 105 base pairs of DNA. All PCR reactions used either a 50 or 55 °C annealing temperature. Extension times at 72 °C were typically between 2.0 and 4.0 min or were adjusted to the size of the expected product. PCR reactions were routinely run for a total of 30 cycles. A list of all PCR primers used in this work appears in TableIII. Two genes were identified from the S. cerevisiae genome data base that had high identity to ELO1, a gene involved in the fatty acid synthase-independent elongation of 14:0 to 16:0 (10Toke D. Martin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18413-18422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).ELO2 is located on yeast chromosome III at the locus designated YCR34W. ELO3 is located on chromosome XII at the locus designated YLR372W. Fig. 1 shows regions of homology betweenELO1, ELO2, and ELO3 protein coding sequences. Elo2p and Elo3p are, respectively, 76 and 72% similar and 56 and 52% identical to that of Elo1p. The three genes contain multiple regions of contiguous identical residues throughout the protein sequence. Hydropathy analyses of ELO1p, ELO2p, and Elo3p by the TMpredict algorithm (Fig. 2) suggest that the three proteins contain five membrane-spanning regions. The identified core regions of these sequences align identically with previously predicted transmembrane regions of Elo1p (10Toke D. Martin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18413-18422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The regions of highest identity in all three genes lie between presumptive transmembrane-spanning regions II and III (Fig. 2). That region has 16 identical amino acid residues located between residues 185 and 200 of Elo3p (from the amino terminus) and contains a cluster of four consecutive basic residues followed by an HXXHH motif, which has been previously identified with fatty acid desaturase, ribonucleotide reductase, hemerithrin, and other iron-containing proteins (9Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Elo2p also has a hydrophobic stretch in that region that contains several polar residues, suggesting that it might serve as a hydrophobic cleft associated with an active site of the enzyme. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of Elo2p and Elo3p are most dissimilar to Elo1p. In all three proteins the C-terminal sequences that follow transmembrane segment V contain unusually high numbers of basic residues, suggesting that those domains have some homologous function. Both ELO2 and ELO3 peptide sequences lack a GSA motif near the carboxyl terminus ofELO1 that is proposed to be an NADPH binding site for a number of lipid biosynthetic enzymes (10Toke D. Martin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18413-18422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Analysis of total fatty acids fromelo2Δ and elo3Δ strains showed only minor changes in the composition of C14–C18 fatty acids (Table IV). Those species comprise approximately 95% of the total cellular fatty acids. Compared with wild type,elo2Δ C14 fatty acids were reduced by 45%, 16:1 was reduced approximately 8%, and 18:1 was increased by about 10%. The elo3Δ strain showed complementary changes with increased 16:1 (∼30%) and decreased 18:1 (∼30%).Table IVDistribution of 14–18 carbon-saturated and -unsaturated fatty acids in wild type, elo2Δ, and elo3Δ strainsStrain14–18 carbon fatty acid species14:04-aFatty acids are designated according to standard nomenclature in which the first number designates the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain.

Open table in a new tab These species represent >95% of the total fatty acids in wild type cells. Values are indicated as weight % of total fatty acid methyl esters. The very long chain fatty acid composition of wild type,elo2Δ, and elo3Δ strains is shown in Fig.3. The most abundant species in wild type are 26:0 and α- hydroxy 26:0 (2Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22156-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was confirmed by GC/MS of total fatty acid methyl esters and by separate GC/MS analyses of authentic standards. They comprise approximately 2.2 and 0.9% of the total fatty acid mass in mid-log cells grown in glucose medium. Minor peaks representing 22- and 24-carbon-saturated, monounsaturated, and hydroxy fatty acid species were also identified in the wild type strains. These combined represent less than 0.6% of the total fatty acids and are apparently derived from metabolic intermediates in the fatty acid elongation pathway. GC/MS analysis also identified several prominent peaks with retention times similar to the long chain species. These are the free fatty acids 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, and 18:1. They are apparently equilibrium products of the transmethylation reaction and do not represent a unique pool of unesterified species in vivo. The relative levels of the esterified and unesterified forms were combined for each species in data shown in Table IV. Quantitative gas chromatography and GC/MS analysis of fatty acid methyl ester fractions indicate that the 26:0 and HO-26:0 species are absent in theelo3Δ strain. Sharply reduced levels of 26:0 (approximately 20% wild type levels) and HO-26:0 (approximately 40% of wild type levels) were found in the elo2Δ strain (Fig.3, Table V). The reductions in C26 species were accompanied by increases in minor (and in some cases, undetectable) wild type species. Lipids from the elo2Δstrain displayed new peaks with retention times between 9 and 11 min. GC/MS analysis indicated that they were hydroxy 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids with fragmentation patterns consistent with the α-hydroxy fatty acid standards.

https://openalex.org/W2035044405,"The RNA-binding protein CsrA (carbon storage regulator) is a new kind of global regulator, which facilitates specific mRNA decay. A recombinant CsrA protein containing a metal-binding affinity tag (CsrA-H6) was purified to homogeneity and authenticated by N-terminal sequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, and other studies. This protein was entirely contained within a globular complex of approximately 18 CsrA-H6 subunits and a single ∼350-nucleotide RNA, CsrB. cDNA cloning and nucleotide sequencing revealed that thecsrB gene is located downstream from syd in the 64-min region of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome and contains no open reading frames. The purified CsrA-CsrB ribonucleoprotein complex was active in regulating glg(glycogen biosynthesis) gene expression in vitro, as was the RNA-free form of the CsrA protein. Overexpression ofcsrB enhanced glycogen accumulation in E. coli, a stationary phase process that is repressed by CsrA. Thus, CsrB RNA is a second component of the Csr system, which binds to CsrA and antagonizes its effects on gene expression. A model for regulatory interactions in Csr is presented, which also explains previous observations on the homologous system in Erwinia carotovora. A highly repeated nucleotide sequence located within predicted stem-loops and other single-stranded regions of CsrB, CAGGA(U/A/C)G, is a plausible CsrA-binding element.

During studies on the genetic regulation of glycogen biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, a metabolic pathway that is induced as cultures enter the stationary phase of growth, we identified a gene encoding a factor that effects potent negative regulation of glycogen biosynthesis, csrA or “carbon storage regulator” (1Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Romeo T. Gong M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5740-5741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that csrA is a global regulatory gene that controls numerous genes and enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism. In E. coli K-12, it acts as a negative regulator of glycogen biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogen catabolism and as a positive factor for glycolysis, and it affects cell surface properties (1Romeo T.

Recent experiments of Chatterjee et al. (6Chatterjee A. Cui Y.Y. Liu Y. Dumenyo C.K. Chatterjee A.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1959-1967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Cui et al. (7Cui Y. Chatterjee A. Liu Y. Dumenyo C.K. Chatterjee A.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5108-5115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) document a key regulatory role for the csrA homolog of the pathogenicErwinia species, rsmA (repressor of stationary phase metabolites), in the expression of several virulence factors of soft rot disease of higher plants, including pectinase, cellulase, and protease activities, and further suggest that it may modulate the production of the quorum-sensing metaboliteN-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone. Homologs of this metabolite are secreted by numerous Gram-negative bacteria, in which they serve to activate the expression of a wide variety of genes in response to cell density (reviewed in Refs. 8Fuqua W.C. Winans S.C. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar and 9Swift S. Throup J.P. Williams P. Salmond G.P. Stewart G.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 214-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Widespread phylogenetic distribution of csrA homologs among eubacteria points to a broad significance and ancient origin for this regulatory system in this group of organisms (10White D. Hart M.E. Romeo T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 182: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Romeo T. Res. Microbiol. 1996; 147: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Studies conducted in vivo have indicated that the CsrA gene product facilitates the decay of glgCAP mRNA, which encodes two enzymes required for glycogen biosynthesis and the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase (3Liu M.Y. Yang H. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2663-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Yang H. Liu M.Y. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CsrA gene product is a 61-amino acid protein whose deduced amino acid sequence contains a conserved RNA-binding motif, KH (3Liu M.Y. Yang H. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2663-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cis-acting region located close to or overlapping the glgC ribosome binding site mediates its regulatory effects (Ref. 3Liu M.Y. Yang H. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2663-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and RNA mobility shift experiments). 1Liu, M. Y., and Romeo, T. (1977) J. Bacteriol., in press. 1Liu, M. Y., and Romeo, T. (1977) J. Bacteriol., in press. To further elucidate the mechanism of CsrA, we have now expressed and purified a recombinant CsrA protein, CsrA-H6. 2The abbreviations used are: CsrA-H6, recombinant CsrA gene product containing 6 histidine residues (a His tag) at the carboxyl terminus; CsrA-CsrB, a ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of 18 CsrA-H6 protein subunits and one CsrB RNA molecule; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time of flight; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 2The abbreviations used are: CsrA-H6, recombinant CsrA gene product containing 6 histidine residues (a His tag) at the carboxyl terminus; CsrA-CsrB, a ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of 18 CsrA-H6 protein subunits and one CsrB RNA molecule; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time of flight; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unexpectedly, this protein was found to be noncovalently bound to an RNA molecule, CsrB, in a large multisubunit complex. The characterization of purified recombinant CsrA protein, the CsrA-CsrB ribonucleoprotein complex, and the csrB gene are described herein. Experimental evidence supports a model in which CsrB RNA competes with cellular mRNAs for binding to CsrA and thereby antagonizes its activity. This hypothesis also provides the mechanistic framework for understanding observations made on the homologous system ofErwinia carotovora. In this species, the apparentcsrB homolog was previously called aepH, because it somehow activates the expression of extracellular proteins (12Murata H. Chatterjee A. Liu Y. Chatterjee A.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3150-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in fact are the same proteins that are repressed viarsmA (7Cui Y. Chatterjee A. Liu Y. Dumenyo C.K. Chatterjee A.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5108-5115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, rsmA and aepH are not linked in the genome and have not been demonstrated to function together in a regulatory system. Evidence that the regulatory factor encoded by the aepH region is the CsrB RNA homolog ofE. carotovora will be discussed. Agarose Ni-NTA affinity resin was purchased from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). The enzymes for DNA manipulation were from the sources previously described (3Liu M.Y. Yang H. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2663-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Romeo T. Preiss J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2773-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sheep anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase, prestained and unstained protein standards for SDS-PAGE, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Bio-Rad. DNA and RNA size markers and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. RNase A, high quality imidazole, and native protein molecular weight markers were purchased from Sigma. The [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dATP, [α-35S]dATP, and [35S]methionine were purchased from DuPont NEN. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by BioSynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). The strains used in this study include BW3414 (ΔlacU169), TR1–5BW3414 (ΔlacU169 csrA::kanR), and TR1–5BW3414[pCSR10] (csrA-overexpressing strain) (1Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TR1–5BW[pCSRH6–19] (expresses the recombinant protein CsrA-H6) (this study), DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169(Φ80lacZΔM15)hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1) (14Ausubel F.M.

Blattner, University of Wisconsin, Madison). Plasmids include pUC18, pUC19 (15Yanish-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar), pCSR10 (csrA cloned into pUC19) (1Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pKK223–3 (16Brosius J. Holy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81 (2nd Ed.): 6929-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and pCSRB-SR and pCSRB-SF, in which csrB was cloned into pUC18 or pUC19, respectively, such that csrB was either in the same (SF) or in the opposite orientation (SR) with respect to the lacpromoter (this study). Plasmids pAKC671 and pAKC672 encode the E. carotovora aepH* and aepH genes (12Murata H. Chatterjee A. Liu Y. Chatterjee A.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3150-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteriophage λ DD628, encoding DNA from the 63–64-min region of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome was obtained from F. R. Blattner (University of Wisconsin). Standard procedures were used for isolation of plasmid DNA and restriction fragments, restriction mapping, transformation, and molecular cloning, as described previously (13Romeo T. Preiss J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2773-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for PCR amplification (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Alternatively, plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen plasmid mini-DNA cartridges. Dideoxynucleotide sequencing (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) was performed using the SequenaseTM version 2.0 kit under the conditions described by the manufacturer (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Data base searches were performed using BLAST analysis (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.L J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) via the Internet services at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. A PCR product containing the csrA coding region and six in-frame histidine codons followed by a termination codon was prepared usingHindIII-treated pCSR10 (1Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotide primers ATGCTGATTCTGACTCGTCG and TTAATGATGATGATGATGATGGTAACTGGACTGCTGGGAT and was treated with polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA polymerase and ligated into the dephosphorylated SmaI site of the expression vector pKK223–3. The ligation mixture was used to transform DH5α to ampicillin resistance. A resulting plasmid clone, pCSRH6–19, complemented the csrA::kanR mutation of TR1–5BW3414, and its csrA coding region was free of any PCR-generated mutations, as determined by DNA sequence analysis. cDNA was prepared by treating CsrB RNA (5 μg) with poly(A) polymerase (4 units) in a reaction containing 250 μm ATP, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, followed by cDNA synthesis using the Riboclone cDNA Synthesis Systems avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's specifications. cDNA was made blunt-ended using T4 DNA polymerase and was cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19 using DH5α as the host strain for transformation. Approximately 200 clones were saved, 14 of which were at least partially sequenced and mapped on theE. coli genome using data base searches. The csrB gene was amplified from λ DD628 DNA by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers GTAAGCGCCTTGTAAGACTTC and CTGGAGACGAACGCGGTCATG, and the PCR product was treated with T4 DNA polymerase and polynucleotide kinase and cloned into theSmaI site of pUC18 to yield pCSRB-SR. Subsequently, pCSRB-SR was treated with EcoRI and BamHI, and the insert DNA was subcloned into pUC19 to yield the plasmid clone pCSRB-SF, which was later sequenced. For large scale preparation of protein, 3 liters of an overnight culture of TR1–5BW3414[pCSRH6–19] was used to inoculate a 500-liter fermenter containing 350 liters of LB medium (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C, harvested at late exponential phase, resuspended in 7 liters of binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl), lysed in a French pressure cell, and kept at −80 °C until use (conducted at the Fermentation Facility, University of Alabama, Birmingham). The cell lysate (1 liter) was thawed at room temperature, imidazole was added to 20 mm, and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min. The clear supernatant solution was mixed with 2 ml of prewashed Ni-NTA resin in binding buffer. After stirring on ice for 2 h, the batch was poured into a glass column and washed first with 40 volumes of binding buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm was less than 0.01 and then with 40 volumes of wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole) until the absorbance was less than 0.01. The CsrA-H6 protein was eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of imidazole (20 mm to 500 mm) in wash buffer followed by 12 ml of 1 m imidazole in wash buffer. Column fractions containing protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% gel), and the resolved polypeptides were detected with Coomassie Blue staining or by Western immunoblot analysis. The fractions containing electrophoretically pure protein were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-OAc, pH 8.0, and assayed for total protein (21Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). The CsrA-CsrB complex was subjected to nondenaturing electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (22Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 126: 155-164Crossref Scopus (1485) Google Scholar) and was detected by staining protein with Coomassie Blue or nucleic acid with acridine orange, which renders single-stranded RNA red and double-stranded DNA green (23McMaster G.K. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 11: 4835-4838Crossref Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Denaturing electrophoresis was carried out using SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) to separate polypeptides that had been denatured with SDS and β-mercaptoethanol according to a method specifically suggested for the analysis of His-tagged proteins (Qiagen). In Western blotting of SDS or nondenaturing gels, proteins were transferred onto a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 20% methanol; Ref. 25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked in 0.3% gelatin and incubated for 4 h with 2,000-fold diluted rabbit anti-CsrA peptide (Lys-Glu-Val-Ser-Val-His-Arg-Glu-Glu-Ile-Tyr; residues 38–48; prepared by Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with sheep anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate and developed with 4-chloro-N-naphthyl. The purified CsrA-H6 complex (1 mg/ml protein in 10 mm Tris-OAc) was loaded onto a trifluoroacetic acid-activated glass fiber filter, and its amino-terminal sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation using an ABI 475A gas phase instrument (26Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction cartridge temperature was 50 °C. For amino acid composition analysis, 2 μg of concentrated affinity-purified CsrA-CsrB was subjected to electrophoresis on 15% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was rinsed with water, stained with 0.025% Coomassie Blue and 40% methanol, and destained in 50% methanol. The protein was excised, hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 24 or 48 h, and analyzed on an ABI model 420 automated amino acid analyzer (Foster City, CA) (performed by BioSynthesis, Inc., Lewisville, TX). Mass spectra were acquired using a Vestec LaserTec Research linear instrument (Perceptive Biosystems, Houston, TX), employing a nitrogen laser (337 nm), a 1.2-m flight tube, and an accelerating voltage of 10 kV (27Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6873-6877Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The mass axis was set by calibration with insulin. Samples were diluted into 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and mixed on the target with an equal volume of MALDI matrix consisting of a saturated solution of either 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic (sinapinic) acid or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 40% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Data from 25–75 spectra were averaged and assigned using the GRAMS-LaserTec program. Affinity-purified CsrA-CsrB (4 μg of protein) and standard proteins (α-lactalbumin, 14.2 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; bovine serum albumin monomer, 66 kDa; bovine serum albumin dimer, 132 kDa; urease trimer, 272 kDa; and urease hexamer, 545 kDa) were analyzed by electrophoresis on a series of nondenaturing gels containing 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, and 9% acrylamide, and their resulting R F values were calculated as the ratio of migration distance relative to the dye bromphenol blue. The values of 100(log(R F × 100)) for each of the proteins was plotted versus gel concentrations as percentages, and the logarithm of the negative slope of each curve was then plotted against the logarithm of known molecular mass of each protein to generate a curve from which the molecular mass of CsrA-CsrB was estimated (28Bryan J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). RNA was purified from the CsrA-CsrB complex by extraction once with phenol/chloroform (1:1) and once with chloroform and was precipitated with ethanol. RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm or by an orcinol assay (29Schmidt G. Thannhauser S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 181: 83-89Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For molecular mass estimation, purified RNA was subjected to denaturing electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The entire nucleotide sequence was folded with the program STAR 4.1, developed by F. H. D. van Batenburg, running on a Macintosh PowerMac 7500 platform. STAR arrives at a secondary structural prediction using one of three algorithms (sequential, stochastic, or genetic folding algorithm) by simulating the folding pathway of an RNA from the 5′-end of the molecule rather than by necessarily calculating the most stable structure predicted by the RNA sequence. The results presented here were obtained with a stochastic algorithm (30Gultyaev A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2489-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using the default nearest neighbor energy rules, an increment value of 25 nucleotides, and a population size of 10. Structure predictions obtained with STAR were rendered by LoopDloop (obtained from D. Gilbert, Indiana University). Secondary structural models generated by the sequential folding algorithm (31Abrahams J.P. Berg M.V.D. van Batenburg F.H.D. Pleij C.W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3035-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were substantially similar to those obtained with the stochastic algorithm. Nucleotides 1–217 and 295–360 were folded identically by both algorithms; nucleotides 218–294 were folded into four stem structures, which were distinct in each case. Models generated with a genetic algorithm (32Gultyaev A.P. van Batenburg F.D.H. Pleij C.W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) were also similar to the stochastic model, except that two sets of long range interactions between single-stranded regions involving nucleotides 64–66 base pairing with 315–317 and 118–121 with 270–273 were predicted. In the absence of other phylogenetic or chemical modification data, these three models cannot be distinguished from one another. Samples of native complex or complex pretreated with 10 mm EDTA were diluted to 5 μg/ml with 10 mm Tris-OAc, pH 8.0, and 2% glutaraldehyde. Glow-discharged Formvar-coated grids were touched to 5-μl drops of fixed sample, excess fluid was removed, and the grids were floated on 2% uranyl acetate for 2 min. Grids were then blotted with filter paper, air-dried, and examined on a Zeiss EM910 instrument (33Sogo J. Stasiak A. de Bernardin W. Losa R. Koller T. Sommerville J. Scheer U. Electron Microscopy in Molecular Biology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, London1987: 61-79Google Scholar). Images were recorded either on Kodak so-163 or digitally with a Dage-MTI Model 72 CCD camera connected to a Scion LG-3 frame grabber board in an Apple Power Macintosh 7200/90 computer. Digital images were used to measure the diameter of the complexes using NIH Image and were analyzed statistically with Abacus Statview. RNA-free CsrA protein was prepared by treating CsrA-CsrB (0.6 mg of protein) with DNase-free RNase A (10 μg/ml) in 5 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 30 min. After dialyzing at 4 °C overnight against two changes of binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole), the protein was separated from the reaction mixture by binding to a Ni-NTA spin column (Qiagen) and elution with 1 m imidazole in binding buffer. The eluate was dialyzed overnight against two changes of 10 mm Tris-OAc, pH 8.0, and concentrated to 0.4 mg/ml in an Amicon stirred cell (Amicon Inc, Beverly, MA). Alternatively, RNA of the CsrA-CsrB was hydrolyzed with the Ca2+-dependent enzyme micrococcal nuclease, which was then inactivated using EGTA (34Heins J.N. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. Procedures in Nucleic Acid Research.in: Cantoni J. Davies D. Harper and Row, New York1966Google Scholar). Effects of the CsrA gene product on the expression of glycogen biosynthesis genes encoded by plasmid pOP12 (glgB, glgC, andglgA) were examined in transcription-translation reactions using an S-30 extract prepared from strain TR-15BW3414 (csrA::kanR) and containing 100 μmcAMP and 1 μg of cAMP receptor protein. The methodology has been previously described in detail (3Liu M.Y. Yang H. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2663-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Romeo T. Preiss J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2773-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of the E. coli csrAand csrB genotypes on glycogen levels were observed by staining colonies with iodine vapor (3Liu M.Y. Yang H. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2663-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon previous experiments, which showed that the carboxyl terminus of CsrA could be modified without destroying its in vivo biological activity (1Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a plasmid was constructed to allow the expression of recombinant CsrA containing 6 histidine residues at the carboxyl terminus, permitting its purification via metal-binding affinity chromatography (35Janknecht R. de Martynoff G. Lou J. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Stunnenberg H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8972-8976Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This plasmid, pCSRH6–19, complemented thecsrA::kanR mutation (data not shown), indicating that it encodes a biologically active CsrA gene product. Preliminary small scale experiments showed that the CsrA-H6 protein was expressed by TR1–5BW3414[pCSRH6–19] and could be purified in modest yield (0.1 mg/liter of batch culture) by a single step of affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA agarose (data not shown). The CsrA-H6 protein preparation used for all of the experiments described here was prepared in large scale from cells grown to late exponential phase in a 500-liter fermenter (see “Materials and Methods”); its electrophoretic properties were indistinguishable from those of smaller scale preparations. The fractions that were pooled and saved from the affinity matrix contained a single detectable ∼7-kDa band on SDS-PAGE using Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot analysis (Fig.1, A and B). The yield of CsrA protein from the large scale preparation was approximately 3 mg/35 liters of culture. To authenticate the CsrA-H6 polypeptide of the CsrA-CsrB complex and to determine whether it may be covalently modified, N-terminal sequencing, amino acid composition analysis, and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry were performed. Fifteen cycles of automated Edman degradation yielded the sequence Met-Leu-Ile-Leu-Thr-Arg-Arg-Val-Gly-Glu(X)-Thr-Leu-Met-Ile-Gly, identical to the deduced amino acid sequence of CsrA (1Romeo T. Gong M. Liu M.Y. Brun-Zinkernagel A.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4744-4755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except for an unexplained minor peak (X) observed in addition to the expected glutamic acid residue at cycle 10. Amino acid analysis was also consistent with the deduced composition of the CsrA protein, with the exception of Gly, which was almost 4-fold higher than expected and was apparently carried over from the transfer buffer, and His was somewhat lower than expected, 4.6 versus 7 residues (data not shown). MALDI TOF mass spectrometry revealed a molecular mass of 7677.7, differing by less than 3 Da from the predicted value of CsrA-H6 (data not shown), indicating that the polypeptide was not covalently modified, except for the deformylation of the N-terminal methionine residue. The ultraviolet absorbance spectrum of purified CsrA-H6 was found to be typical of nucleic acid instead of protein,i.e. the ratio of absorbance at 260–280 nm was 2.0 (data not shown). In view of the fact that CsrA modulates glgCmRNA stability in vivo (3Liu M.Y. Yang H. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2663-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative RNA-binding domain, this nucleic acid was suspected to be RNA. This was confirmed by several approaches. The ribose content of the preparation was quantified by an orcinol assay (29Schmidt G. Thannhauser S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 181: 83-89Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and a mass ratio of RNA to protein was determined to be 1.27. Substantial orcinol reactivity relative to absorbance at 260 nm excluded DNA as a major constituent of the preparation, which is not reactive with orcinol (data not shown). Analysis of the CsrA-H6 preparation by 7.5% native PAGE revealed a single major product that stained with Coomassie Blue, Western blot analysis, and acridine orange (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–3, respectively), indicative of a discrete ribonucleoprotein complex. A ladder of faster running minor components extending downward from the major component was observed with the most sensitive treatment, Western blotting. The complex yielded red fluorescence with acridine orange treatment,"

The human CD36 and LIMPII analogous-1 (CLA-1) receptor shows high sequence homology with SR-BI, but their functional relationship has not been determined. Transfected cells expressing CLA-1 bound HDL with a K d of about 35 μg/ml, similar to the K d for HDL binding to rodent SR-BI. This binding resulted in an intracellular accumulation of HDL-derived [3H]cholesterol esters without internalization or degradation of 125I-apolipoprotein. CLA-1 was strongly expressed in the adrenal gland and was also abundant in liver and testis, suggesting that CLA-1, like SR-BI, could play a role in the metabolism of HDL. However, CLA-1 was also expressed in monocytes and, like SR-BI, recognized modified forms of low density lipoproteins as well as native LDL and anionic phospholipids. These findings suggest that CLA-1 might have additional physiological functions. We found that CLA-1 recognizes apoptotic thymocytes. Our results demonstrate that CLA-1, a close structural homologue of SR-BI, is also functionally related to SR-BI and may play an important role as a “docking receptor” for HDL in connection with selective uptake of cholesterol esters.

Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its ligand-binding specificity was similar to that of CD36, and thus it was included as a member of the new family of scavenger receptors, designated class B (2Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar).Subsequent studies showed that SR-BI has a high affinity for the binding of HDL and that it mediates the selective uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL (3Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S.Z. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the tissue distribution of SR-BI, which is predominantly expressed in liver, adrenal gland, and ovary, was compatible with its playing a role in the transport of HDL-derived cholesterol esters to the liver and to steroidogenic tissues (4Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that mice deficient in apoA-I overexpressed SR-BI, presumably in an effort to compensate for the decreased plasma level of HDL cholesterol and the depleted stores of adrenal cholesterol (5Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In contrast, transgenic mice deficient in apolipoprotein A-II, apolipoprotein E, the LDL receptor, or cholesterol ester transfer protein did not show any changes of SR-BI expression in either adrenal gland or liver (5Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated a strong inverse correlation between plasma HDL levels and risk of coronary heart disease (6Buring J.E. O'Connor G.T. Goldhaber S.Z. Rosner B. Herbert P.N. Blum C.B. Breslow J.L. Hennekens C.H. Circulation. 1992; 85: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), possibly because HDL plays a critical role in reverse cholesterol transport, i.e. transport from peripheral tissues to the liver for catabolism (7Miller N.E. La Ville A. Crook D. Nature. 1985; 314: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Franceschini G. Maderna P. Sirtori C.R.

Taken together, these results suggest that SR-BI may play a physiologically important role in metabolism of HDL-derived cholesterol.Human CLA-1 was cloned from a cDNA library prepared from differentiated HL-60 cells based on the existence of regions with amino acid sequence highly conserved between CD36 and LIMPII (10Calvo D. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18929-18935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD36 is an 88-kDa surface glycoprotein present on monocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells (11Greenwalt D.E. Lipsky R.H. Ockenhouse C.F. Ikeda H. Tandon N.N. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1992; 80: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and LIMPII, a structural homologue of CD36, is expressed mainly on lysosomal membranes. Two distinct isoforms of CLA-1 that differ by an insertion of a segment consisting of 100 amino acid residues at the N-terminal region have been identified. Analysis of the CLA-1 cDNAs predicts proteins of 409 and 509 amino acid residues with several potential N-glycosylation sites. Like CD36, which binds to thrombospondin (12Asch A.S. Silbiger S. Heimer E. Nachman R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1208-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 13Leung L.L.K. Li W.-X. McGregor J.L. Albrecht G. Howard R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum (15Ockenhouse C.F. Tandon N.N. Magowan C. Jamieson G.A. Chulay J.D. Science. 1989; 243: 1469-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 16Oquendo P. Hundt E. Lawler J. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 58: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), CLA-1 is found mainly on the plasma membrane, underlining its potential function as a receptor.The long (509 amino acid residues) form of human CLA-1 shares 81% sequence identity with hamster SR-BI and thus most probably represents the same gene. However, the function of CLA-1 has not been systematically studied. If the primary function of SR-BI in rodents is to facilitate selective uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL, its human homologue CLA-1 might be redundant since human tissues are supplied with cholesterol mainly via LDL. We have generated stably transfected cells to test whether CLA-1 has biological functions similar to those of rodent SR-BI. The current report provides evidence that CLA-1 can function as a receptor for HDL and can mediate selective uptake of cholesterol esters, suggesting that CLA-1 is indeed functionally related to the rodent SR-BI. We find CLA-1 primarily expressed in liver and steroidogenic tissues, like SR-BI. However, we also find it in circulating monocytes and to a lesser extent in fully differentiated macrophages. Preliminary data show also that apoptotic thymocytes can bind to cells transfected with CLA-1. Thus, in addition to its role as receptor for HDL in liver and steroidogenic tissues, CLA-1 may have alternative functions in leukocytes.DISCUSSIONThese studies show that the 509-amino acid residue isoform of CLA-1, like its very close homologue, rodent SR-BI, binds HDL in a specific, saturable fashion and can mediate the selective uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL. Whether or not this role of the receptor is important in lipid transport in humans remains to be determined. Many studies suggest that the major source of cholesterol for steroidogenesis in humans is LDL, but it is difficult to assess the relative importance of LDL and HDL under in vivo conditions. Certainly in situations where LDL concentrations are very low (e.g. in hypobetalipoproteinemia), adrenal function remains adequate although less able to respond to stress. Under these situations selective cholesterol ester transport from HDL via CLA-1 might become physiologically important. The role of SR-BI in the selective uptake of HDL-derived cholesterol esters has been demonstrated in recent animal studies (4Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 5Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). CLA-1 not only displays a high sequence homology, but as our results suggest, it is also functionally related to SR-BI. Both receptors display a very similar ligand-binding specificity and show essentially an identical tissue distribution, indicating that in humans CLA-1 may have a function similar to that of SR-BI in rodents. Ligand binding analysis clearly demonstrated that CLA-1 can function as receptor for HDL. The binding of HDL was associated with accumulation of HDL-derived CE without any significant degradation of apoA-I. In contrast, the transfected cells not only bound LDL, but also internalized and degraded its apoB. CLA-1 binds LDL with relative high affinity (K d = 5 μg of protein/ml), but its importance as a receptor for LDL is questionable. In humans, defects in the apoB receptor lead to a significant increase in plasma LDL cholesterol, suggesting that the apoB receptor is the major LDL receptor (38Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) and that CLA-1 might not be importantly involved in LDL metabolism.The rather high level of expression of CLA-1 in circulating human monocytes (levels comparable to that found in human liver) was surprising. At first glance it is not clear why monocytes would require selective uptake of HDL cholesterol esters, since they do not, as far as we know, metabolize cholesterol to any important extent. However, during hematopoiesis and development of mature monocytes, the requirement for cholesterol is high and might exceed the amount available from LDL. Conceivably the progenitor cells in the bone marrow, when they are dividing rapidly, may require delivery of cholesterol at very high rates, and HDL delivery via selective cholesterol ester uptake might become quantitatively important. The other possibility is that CLA-1, shown here to bind apoptotic thymocytes, may play a role in the scavenging of damaged cells. Speaking against a function of CLA-1 as a scavenger receptor is the fact that its expression is down-regulated when the monocyte differentiates into a macrophage. However, low levels of CLA-1 mRNA were detected in human monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig.4 B), some CLA-1 expression and HDL binding was seen in THP-1 cells differentiated with PMA (Fig. 5, B and C), and selective uptake of cholesterol esters was demonstrated in plated human macrophages (39Rinninger F. Deichen J.T. Jackle S. Windler E. Greten H. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 105: 145-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of SRA, CD36, and macrosialin/CD68, a recently identified receptor for OxLDL and possibly apoptotic cells, is up-regulated in the macrophage, which is teleologically rational for receptors that are involved in clearance of damaged cells (40Kodama T. Reddy P. Kishimoto C. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9238-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 41Huh H.Y. Pearce S.F. Yesner L.M. Schindler J.L. Silverstein R.L.

A. 1996; 93: 14833-14838Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). One might speculate that CLA-1 on the developing monocyte might play a role in the selective removal of cells differentiating along undesirable lines within the bone marrow, but there is no direct evidence for this.One of the mechanisms by which phagocytes recognize apoptotic cells is mediated through putative receptors for PS (37Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Senescent cells and cells undergoing apoptosis lose the normal membrane asymmetry in which anionic phospholipids are confined to the inner layer of the plasma membrane. As a consequence, PS appears on the outer leaflet of the membrane. CLA-1-transfected cells, like SR-BI- and CD36-transfected cells, bound PS and also recognized apoptotic thymocytes. Oxidized red blood cells, which are phagocytosed by macrophages through a presumably PS-dependent mechanism (45Sambrano G.R. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), were not recognized by the transfected cells (data not shown), indicating that several distinct PS-dependent pathways for phagocytosis might exist. Also, the mechanisms for internalizing oxidized red blood cells is more complex and depends on modifications of the plasma membrane in addition to increased PS exposure on the outer leaflet (45Sambrano G.R. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The receptor(s) required for the recognition of these additional modifications may not be present on the CLA-1-transfected cells, which therefore do not bind oxidized red blood cells. Anionic phospholipids not only blocked the binding of apoptotic thymocytes by CLA-1, but they are also very effective inhibitors for the binding of HDL. The negative charges on the phospholipids as well as their spacing on the liposomes have been suggested to play an important role in that interaction (2Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar).Taken together, these data suggest that several mechanisms exist by which monocytes could recognize apoptotic cells, one of which involves CLA-1. The initial interaction does not induce phagocytosis, but may trigger a CLA-1 mediated cell signaling, resulting in cell differentiation and expression of components necessary for phagocytosis. A similar role has been suggested for CD36, which may contain a signal-transducing element able to trigger activation of monocytes and thus may have functions extending beyond adherence and phagocytosis (46Trezzini C. Jungi T.W. Spycher M.O. Maly F.E. Rao P. Immunology. 1990; 71: 29-37PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, we have demonstrated that, like SR-BI, CLA-1 can function as a receptor for HDL and mediate the selective uptake of the HDL cholesterol esters. It is expressed mainly in liver and nonplacental steroidogenic tissues. In addition, CLA-1 shows, like SR-BI, a ligand specificity pattern that is characteristic for scavenger receptors; however, its expression is drastically down-regulated in fully differentiated macrophages. The role of CLA-1 in cholesterol metabolism, as well as its function as a scavenger/signaling receptor on monocytes, deserves further investigations.

Taken together, these results suggest that SR-BI may play a physiologically important role in metabolism of HDL-derived cholesterol. Human CLA-1 was cloned from a cDNA library prepared from differentiated HL-60 cells based on the existence of regions with amino acid sequence highly conserved between CD36 and LIMPII (10Calvo D. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18929-18935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD36 is an 88-kDa surface glycoprotein present on monocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells (11Greenwalt D.E. Lipsky R.H. Ockenhouse C.F. Ikeda H. Tandon N.N. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1992; 80: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and LIMPII, a structural homologue of CD36, is expressed mainly on lysosomal membranes. Two distinct isoforms of CLA-1 that differ by an insertion of a segment consisting of 100 amino acid residues at the N-terminal region have been identified. Analysis of the CLA-1 cDNAs predicts proteins of 409 and 509 amino acid residues with several potential N-glycosylation sites. Like CD36, which binds to thrombospondin (12Asch A.S. Silbiger S.

Cell. 1989; 58: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), CLA-1 is found mainly on the plasma membrane, underlining its potential function as a receptor. The long (509 amino acid residues) form of human CLA-1 shares 81% sequence identity with hamster SR-BI and thus most probably represents the same gene. However, the function of CLA-1 has not been systematically studied. If the primary function of SR-BI in rodents is to facilitate selective uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL, its human homologue CLA-1 might be redundant since human tissues are supplied with cholesterol mainly via LDL. We have generated stably transfected cells to test whether CLA-1 has biological functions similar to those of rodent SR-BI. The current report provides evidence that CLA-1 can function as a receptor for HDL and can mediate selective uptake of cholesterol esters, suggesting that CLA-1 is indeed functionally related to the rodent SR-BI. We find CLA-1 primarily expressed in liver and steroidogenic tissues, like SR-BI. However, we also find it in circulating monocytes and to a lesser extent in fully differentiated macrophages. Preliminary data show also that apoptotic thymocytes can bind to cells transfected with CLA-1. Thus, in addition to its role as receptor for HDL in liver and steroidogenic tissues, CLA-1 may have alternative functions in leukocytes. DISCUSSIONThese studies show that the 509-amino acid residue isoform of CLA-1, like its very close homologue, rodent SR-BI, binds HDL in a specific, saturable fashion and can mediate the selective uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL. Whether or not this role of the receptor is important in lipid transport in humans remains to be determined. Many studies suggest that the major source of cholesterol for steroidogenesis in humans is LDL, but it is difficult to assess the relative importance of LDL and HDL under in vivo conditions. Certainly in situations where LDL concentrations are very low (e.g. in hypobetalipoproteinemia), adrenal function remains adequate although less able to respond to stress. Under these situations selective cholesterol ester transport from HDL via CLA-1 might become physiologically important. The role of SR-BI in the selective uptake of HDL-derived cholesterol esters has been demonstrated in recent animal studies (4Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 5Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). CLA-1 not only displays a high sequence homology, but as our results suggest, it is also functionally related to SR-BI. Both receptors display a very similar ligand-binding specificity and show essentially an identical tissue distribution, indicating that in humans CLA-1 may have a function similar to that of SR-BI in rodents. Ligand binding analysis clearly demonstrated that CLA-1 can function as receptor for HDL. The binding of HDL was associated with accumulation of HDL-derived CE without any significant degradation of apoA-I. In contrast, the transfected cells not only bound LDL, but also internalized and degraded its apoB. CLA-1 binds LDL with relative high affinity (K d = 5 μg of protein/ml), but its importance as a receptor for LDL is questionable. In humans, defects in the apoB receptor lead to a significant increase in plasma LDL cholesterol, suggesting that the apoB receptor is the major LDL receptor (38Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) and that CLA-1 might not be importantly involved in LDL metabolism.The rather high level of expression of CLA-1 in circulating human monocytes (levels comparable to that found in human liver) was surprising. At first glance it is not clear why monocytes would require selective uptake of HDL cholesterol esters, since they do not, as far as we know, metabolize cholesterol to any important extent. However, during hematopoiesis and development of mature monocytes, the requirement for cholesterol is high and might exceed the amount available from LDL. Conceivably the progenitor cells in the bone marrow, when they are dividing rapidly, may require delivery of cholesterol at very high rates, and HDL delivery via selective cholesterol ester uptake might become quantitatively important. The other possibility is that CLA-1, shown here to bind apoptotic thymocytes, may play a role in the scavenging of damaged cells. Speaking against a function of CLA-1 as a scavenger receptor is the fact that its expression is down-regulated when the monocyte differentiates into a macrophage. However, low levels of CLA-1 mRNA were detected in human monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig.4 B), some CLA-1 expression and HDL binding was seen in THP-1 cells differentiated with PMA (Fig. 5, B and C), and selective uptake of cholesterol esters was demonstrated in plated human macrophages (39Rinninger F. Deichen J.T. Jackle S. Windler E. Greten H. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 105: 145-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of SRA, CD36, and macrosialin/CD68, a recently identified receptor for OxLDL and possibly apoptotic cells, is up-regulated in the macrophage, which is teleologically rational for receptors that are involved in clearance of damaged cells (40Kodama T.

One might speculate that CLA-1 on the developing monocyte might play a role in the selective removal of cells differentiating along undesirable lines within the bone marrow, but there is no direct evidence for this.One of the mechanisms by which phagocytes recognize apoptotic cells is mediated through putative receptors for PS (37Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Senescent cells and cells undergoing apoptosis lose the normal membrane asymmetry in which anionic phospholipids are confined to the inner layer of the plasma membrane. As a consequence, PS appears on the outer leaflet of the membrane. CLA-1-transfected cells, like SR-BI- and CD36-transfected cells, bound PS and also recognized apoptotic thymocytes. Oxidized red blood cells, which are phagocytosed by macrophages through a presumably PS-dependent mechanism (45Sambrano G.R. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), were not recognized by the transfected cells (data not shown), indicating that several distinct PS-dependent pathways for phagocytosis might exist. Also, the mechanisms for internalizing oxidized red blood cells is more complex and depends on modifications of the plasma membrane in addition to increased PS exposure on the outer leaflet (45Sambrano G.R. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The receptor(s) required for the recognition of these additional modifications may not be present on the CLA-1-transfected cells, which therefore do not bind oxidized red blood cells. Anionic phospholipids not only blocked the binding of apoptotic thymocytes by CLA-1, but they are also very effective inhibitors for the binding of HDL. The negative charges on the phospholipids as well as their spacing on the liposomes have been suggested to play an important role in that interaction (2Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar).Taken together, these data suggest that several mechanisms exist by which monocytes could recognize apoptotic cells, one of which involves CLA-1. The initial interaction does not induce phagocytosis, but may trigger a CLA-1 mediated cell signaling, resulting in cell differentiation and expression of components necessary for phagocytosis. A similar role has been suggested for CD36, which may contain a signal-transducing element able to trigger activation of monocytes and thus may have functions extending beyond adherence and phagocytosis (46Trezzini C. Jungi T.W. Spycher M.O. Maly F.E. Rao P. Immunology. 1990; 71: 29-37PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, we have demonstrated that, like SR-BI, CLA-1 can function as a receptor for HDL and mediate the selective uptake of the HDL cholesterol esters. It is expressed mainly in liver and nonplacental steroidogenic tissues. In addition, CLA-1 shows, like SR-BI, a ligand specificity pattern that is characteristic for scavenger receptors; however, its expression is drastically down-regulated in fully differentiated macrophages.

Transcription of PSA is initiated when ligand-activated androgen receptor (AR) binds to a region in the PSA promoter that contains an androgen-responsive element (ARE). It was found that TPA inhibited androgen-induced PSA gene expression by a mechanism that did not alter nuclear levels of AR protein. Overexpression of AP-1 (junand fos proteins) also inhibited androgen-induced PSA promoter activity. These observations were apparently related to the disruption of AR·ARE complexes as demonstrated by the results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Specifically, c-Jun inhibited the formation of AR·ARE complexes and conversely that AR-glutathioneS-transferase proteins inhibited the formation of c-Jun·TPA-responsive element (TRE) complexes. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of both proteins, anti-c-Jun antibody blocked the inhibition of AR·ARE complex formation by c-Jun. A similar, but less marked, effect was obtained when anti-AR antibody was used to prevent AR inhibition of c-Jun·TRE complex formation. These findings together with results obtained from co-immunoprecipitation experiments strongly suggest that mutual repression of DNA binding activity is due to direct interaction between the two proteins and that the degree of repression may be determined by the ratio of AR to c-Jun. The mechanism of repression studied in mutant analysis experiments yielded evidence of an interaction between the DNA- and ligand-binding domains of AR and the leucine zipper region of c-Jun. Thus, the AR is similar to other nuclear receptors in its ability to interact with AP-1.

These receptors contain a highly conserved DNA-binding domain comprised of zinc finger-like motifs responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding, as well as protein-protein interactions. There is evidence to suggest that the DNA-binding domain of a nuclear receptor may interact with the leucine zipper of AP-1 to result in mutual transrepression (7Yang-Yen H.-F. Chambard J.-C.

However, this interaction between nuclear receptors and AP-1 may be cell-specific, gene-specific, and may involve various mechanisms, including protein-protein interaction and/or adjacent or overlapping binding sites (10Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). AP-1 is a transcriptional factor whose components are nuclear proteins encoded by c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogenes induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). AP-1 has been implicated in cell growth, differentiation, and development with its activity modulated by growth factors, cytokines, oncogenes, and tumor promoters activating protein kinase C (PKC) (10Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). AP-1 induces transcriptional activation through interaction with the TPA-responsive element (TRE or AP-1 DNA-binding site) (11Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdort H.J. Jonat C.

Since the zinc finger motifs of the AR share a high degree of homology with the same regions of other nuclear receptors and in the face of mounting evidence of AP-1 interaction with such motifs, the question arose whether AR function could also be affected by interaction with AP-1. Accordingly, in this study we examined the direct interaction of AP-1 with AR protein and the effects of elevated AP-1 on androgen-stimulated PSA gene expression. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless stated otherwise. PC3 and CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% FBS (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada).

For Northern blot analyses, LNCaP cells were down-shifted to RPMI 1640 containing 2% FBS plus 2% TCM™ (serum replacement obtained from Celox Corp., Hopkins, MN), for 10–14 days and 5 × 105 or 3 × 105 cells were initially plated on 6-cm dishes or 6-well plates, respectively. Culture medium was changed to RPMI 1640 with 2% TCM™ (i.e. serum-free), with or without 10 nm R1881, when wells were 60–70% confluent with the cells. Total RNA was extracted with acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) and fractionated by electrophoresis prior to blotting onto Hybond-N+ filters (Amersham, Oakville, Ontario, Canada).

Cell. 1980; 20: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Random Primers DNA labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 40-base oligonucleotides for either c-Jun or c-Fos (Ciderlane, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) were end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP. Hybridization was performed as reported previously (20Sato N. Gleave M.E. Bruchovsky N. Rennie P.S. Goldenberg S.L. Lange P.H. Sullivan L.D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Filters with PSA and β-actin were washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C, while filters with AR, c-Jun and c-Fos were in 0.5 × SSC, 0.2% SDS for 30 min at 55 °C. Densitometric analyses of mRNA bands were performed using NIH image (National Institutes of Health) from scanned x-ray films. LNCaP cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 2% TCM™ for 24 h prior to the addition of vehicle (0.1% ethanol), 10 nm R1881, or 1 nm TPA. After incubation with compounds, cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Antras et al. (21Antras J. Lasnier F. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1157-1161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were performed with approximately 40 μg of protein in each lane. Immunoblots were blocked overnight in 5% dry milk (w/v) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 500 nm NaCl (TBS). Blots were incubated for 4 h with antibodies to AR (PG-21) (22Prins G.S. Birch L. Greene G.L. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3187-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), c-Jun (sc-045, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA), or c-Fos (sc-052, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The blots were then washed and incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody (1:10,000). Antibodies were diluted in 5% milk/TBS solution. AR, c-Jun, and c-Fos proteins were detected using the ECL luminescence kit (Amersham Corp.). Densitometric analyses of protein bands were performed using NIH image from scanned x-ray films. LNCaP and PC3 cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, containing 5% dextran-coated stripped serum, 10 nm R1881 for 24 h, and 10 nm TPA for 6 h. The cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Antraset al. (21Antras J. Lasnier F. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1157-1161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclei were solubilized in mild Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml leupeptin 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml bacitracin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min at 4 °C. The nuclear extracts were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min and incubated with anti-AR antibody PG-21 (22Prins G.S. Birch L. Greene G.L. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3187-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) or 15071A (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C. The antigen antibody complexes were collected by the addition of protein A-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed once with mild Nonidet P-40 buffer prior to separating on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blots analyses were carried out with anti c-Fos antibody and anti c-Jun antibody as described above. PSA 5′-flanking DNA was obtained by PCR-mediated amplification of human genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the PSA gene. The sequences for primers were 5′-CATTGTTTGCTGCACGTTGGAT-3′ and 5′-TCCGGGTGCAGGTGGTAAGCTTGG-3′. The PCR fragments were purified by gel electrophoresis, blunt-ended, and ligated withEcoRV-digested pBluescript (pBS) SK(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pBS containing the PSA 5′-flanking DNA (designated as pBS-PSA-630) was amplified and purified from transformedEscherichia coli DH-5α and sequenced by dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using double-stranded DNA cycle sequencing system kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA fragments corresponding to −630/+12 of the PSA 5′-flanking region were excised from pBS-PSA-630 with HindIII and inserted into the HindIII site of promoterless plasmid, pGL-2 basic (Promega, Madison, WI), which contains firefly luciferase as a reporter gene. This pGL-2 basic containing the −630/+12 fragment of the PSA 5′-flanking DNA was referred to as pPSA-630. LNCaP cells (2–2.5 × 105) were plated on 6-well plates and incubated in RPMI 1640 with 5% FBS for 3 days, resulting in 50–60% confluence. Plasmid DNA was mixed with 5 μl of Lipofectin agent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for 15–20 min at room temperature. The total amount of plasmid DNA used was normalized to 3 μg/well by the addition of empty plasmid. Medium was replaced after 24 h by RPMI 1640 with 2% TCM™ with or without R1881 (i.e. serum-free media). Cells were collected after 48-h incubation using cell lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). Luciferase activities were measured using a commercial kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's protocol, and activities were normalized by either protein concentration determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) or β-galactosidase activities measured with Galacto-Light (Tropix Inc.). Luciferase activities are expressed as relative luminescent units/mg of protein/min. All transfection experiments were carried out in triplicate wells and repeated two to eight times using at least two sets of plasmids prepared separately. Full-length rat AR cDNA (amino acid 1–902) was cloned into pRc-CMV whose transcription is driven by cytomegalovirus promoter and this plasmid was referred to as pAR6. In our previous report, transcriptional efficacy of pAR6 was determined by expression of mRNA and binding assay in AR-negative PC3 cells when stably transfected with pAR6 (24Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N. Leco K.J. Sheppard P.C. McQueen S.A. Cheng H. Snoek R. Hamel A. Bock M.E. MacDonald B.S. Nickel B.E. Chang C. Liao S. Cattini P.A. Matusik R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Several mutant rat AR expression plasmids were constructed in our laboratory. Regions of amino acids encoded by these mutant AR expression plasmids are as follows: pAR4 (232–649), pAR5 (390–649), and pAR7 (232–902). pRSV-c-Jun and pRSV-c-Fos are wild type c-Jun and c-Fos expression plasmids, respectively. pRSV-c-Jun-Δ1 is lacking a small portion of the N-terminal activator domain, -c-Jun-Δ3 lacks the N-terminal domain, and -c-Jun-ΔLZ lacks the leucine zipper. pRSV-Jun B, -Jun D, -Fra 1, and -Fra 2 are Jun B, Jun D, Fra 1, and Fra 2 expression plasmids, respectively. pRSV-0 is the empty plasmid for pRSV series of plasmids. ARR3-tk-luciferase reporter construct consists of three congruent rat probasin AREs (−244 to −96) ligated in tandem into theHindIII site of the pT81 luciferase vector (ATCC, Rockville, MD) as described by us previously (25Snoek R. Rennie P.S. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Bruchovsky N. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). pCH110 (Amersham), a β-galactosidase expression plasmid, was co-transfected as an internal marker for normalizing efficacy of transient transfection. The prokaryotic expression vector pET-8c/c-Jun coding for the full-length c-Jun was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The recombinant protein was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and extracted from inclusion bodies according to the protocol of Lin and Cheng (26Lin K.-H. Cheng S.-Y. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 752-753Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the inclusion bodies were isolated and subjected to several rounds of sonication in the appropriate buffers. The insoluble pellet was solubilized in 5m guanidinium HCl, followed by stepwise dialysis against buffers containing 2 m, 1 m, and 0.5m guanidinium HCl. Yields were typically 14 mg of c-Jun protein per 200 ml of bacterial culture with 90% purity. AR1 and AR2 were expressed in E. coli as isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST), purified through glutathione affinity chromatography, and calculated to have greater than 90% purity when assayed by Coomassie Blue staining of polyacrylamide gels (25Snoek R. Rennie P.S. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Bruchovsky N. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). AR1 encodes amino acids 524–902 (rat AR) encompassing the DNA-binding domain, hinge region, and ligand-binding domain. AR2 encodes amino acids 524–649 (rat AR) encompassing the DNA-binding domain and hinge region. Nuclear extracts from LNCaP cells or purified proteins were used for EMSA studies. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells treated with vehicle (0.1% ethanol), 10 nm R1881, or TPA (1 and 10 nm) for 6 h before harvesting. DNA binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 25 μl, containing DNA binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.)). Approximately 1.5 fmol of double-stranded 32P-labeled TRE oligonucleotide (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′), PSA ARE oligonucleotide (5′-TTGCAGAACAGCAAGTGCTAGCTC-3′), PSA mutant ARE (5′-TTGCAAAAAAGCAAGTGCTAGCTC-3′) were used. SP-1 oligonucleotide (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAG-3′) and the TRE oligonucleotide were obtained from Promega. All lanes were normalized for additions of purified proteins by correction for the amount of buffer and total protein. For competition experiments 100-fold excess unlabeled oligonucleotide was used. DNA-protein complexes were separated under nondenaturing conditions in a 8% polyacrylamide gel (29:1) containing 2.5% glycerol and run in 0.5 × TBE (1 × = 89 mm Tris borate, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 200 V. Bands from dried EMSA gels were quantified by the STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Experiments employing antibodies were first preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with the antigen and antibody before the probe was added. The Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. The significance levels were set at: ***,p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; and *,p < 0.05, unless stated otherwise in the figure legend. TPA alters the transcriptional activity of numerous nuclear receptors. Therefore, to examine the biological effects of TPA upon androgen regulation of PSA gene expression, we exposed LNCaP cells to TPA and performed Northern blot analyses. Cells exposed to the synthetic androgen, R1881 (10 nm), showed a 5-fold increase in accumulated PSA mRNA as compared with control levels (Fig.1 A). Androgen-stimulated cells exposed to TPA for 9 h showed a dose-dependent decrease in PSA mRNA levels. However, TPA concentrations of 10 and 100 nm induced “apoptosis-like” cell death of LNCaP cells consistent with the observations of Day et al. (27Day M.L. Zhao X. Wu S. Swanson P.E. Humphrey P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar) and Young et al. (28Young C.Y.F. Murtha P.E. Zhang J. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar). TPA concentrations of 1 nmand less did not alter morphology nor reduce cell viability (data not shown). Therefore, all subsequent experiments employed a TPA concentration of 1 nm. β-Actin mRNA levels did not appear to be altered in cells undergoing apoptosis, as compared with untreated cell levels, after 9 h of treatment with 10 and 100 nm TPA, which is consistent to observations with HeLa cells undergoing programmed cell death (29French L.E. Wohlwend A. Sappino A.-P. Tschopp J. Schifferli J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). TPA is thought to increase AP-1 transactivation through the PKC signal transduction pathway (30Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of PKC activity by staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, should block TPA induction of AP-1. In Fig. 1 B, a 50 nm concentration of staurosporine completely blocked the TPA-associated decrease of androgen-induced PSA mRNA levels. Staurosporine (50 nm) alone had no effect on androgen-induced PSA mRNA levels. A time-dependent decrease of androgen-induced levels of PSA mRNA was observed when cells were exposed to 1 nm TPA (Fig. 1 C). These decreases were apparent after 6 h of TPA treatment and levels continued to decline for the duration of the experiment at 24 h. β-Actin mRNA levels remained consistent, and androgen-induced levels of PSA mRNA remained elevated in the absence of TPA for the duration of the study. TPA has been shown to induce c-jun and c-fosmRNA levels in LNCaP cells (27Day M.L. Zhao X. Wu S. Swanson P.E. Humphrey P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement, TPA (1 nm) caused a transient increase in both c-junand c-fos mRNA levels (Fig. 1 D), regardless of the presence of androgen (R1881). This suggests that androgen stimulation and the subsequent activation of AR does not interfere with the signal transduction pathway leading from PKC to c-junand c-fos induction in LNCaP cells. A time course study of TPA induction of c-Jun and c-Fos proteins in LNCaP cells showed that maximum levels were achieved after 4.5 h of exposure (Fig. 2). At this time point, c-Jun levels were 6.6-fold higher and c-Fos levels 49-fold higher than levels in untreated cells. c-Jun levels remained 3–4-fold higher in TPA-treated cells, as compared with levels in untreated cells, for the duration of the experiment (32 h). Androgen induction of PSA mRNA has been shown to be mediated by the AR which binds to AREs on the PSA promoter (4Riegman P.H.J. Vlietstra R.J. van der Korput J.A.G.M. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 5Cleutjens K.B.J.M. van Eekelen C.C.E.M. van der Korput H.A.G.M. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6379-6388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To determine whether the TPA-associated decreases in androgen-induced PSA mRNA demonstrated in Fig. 1 A were due to reduced expression of AR, we examined levels of AR protein. AR protein was detected as a band at approximately 110 kDa in both nuclear and cytosolic extracts (Fig. 3). Nuclear extracts prepared from cells exposed to R1881 had increased levels of nuclear AR, as compared with cells not exposed to androgen. Cytosolic and nuclear levels of AR were not altered by treatment with TPA (1 nm) for 24 h. Therefore, TPA does not appear to decrease PSA gene expression by a mechanism that involves decreasing the nuclear levels of AR protein. PSA promoter activity was examined by transient transfection of LNCaP cells with a PSA promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (pPSA-630). LNCaP cells express endogenous AR, and the addition of 10 nm R1881 to cells resulted in a 5-fold increase of PSA promoter activity (data not shown). Co-transfection of cells with the rat wild type AR (pAR6) expression plasmid (0.5 μg/well) resulted in a 34-fold increase in androgen-induced PSA promoter activity in the presence of 10 nm R1881 (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, all subsequent studies measuring androgen-induced PSA promoter activities were performed with cells transiently transfected with pAR6. In Fig. 1, A and C, it was demonstrated that TPA decreased androgen-induced PSA mRNA. In agreement with these data, androgen-induced PSA promoter activity was also inhibited by 39% in LNCaP cells exposed to 1 nm TPA for 24 h (data not shown). Numerous nuclear receptors have been shown to interact with TPA-inducible proteins, c-Jun and/or c-Fos (10Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether c-Jun and/or c-Fos are involved in TPA repression of androgen-induced PSA promoter activity, pPSA-630, pAR6, and increasing amounts of c-Jun and/or c-Fos expression plasmids were transfected into LNCaP cells. Androgen-induced PSA promoter activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with transfection of increasing amounts of c-Jun and c-Fos, c-Jun, or c-Fos expression plasmids (in order of descending potency) (Fig. 4 B). Overexpression of c-Jun and c-Fos had negligible effects on the empty plasmid GL-2 basic (data not shown) that originates from pUC18 plasmid reported to contain a TRE (31Kushner P. Baxter J.D. Duncan K.G. Lopez G.N. Schaufele F. Uht R.M. Webb P. West B.L. Endocrinology. 1994; 8: 405-407Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of c-Jun and c-Fos also had no effect on the pGL2-Control vector (Promega), which contains the SV40 promoter inserted into the same HindIII site as the PSA promoter (data not shown). To investigate the specificity of c-Jun and c-Fos inhibition, we examined the effects of other members of thejun and fos families on androgen-induced PSA promoter activity by transfection of the respective expression vectors into LNCaP cells. All members of the jun family examined significantly attenuated androgen-induced PSA promoter activity relative to RSV-0 values (Fig. 5). However, for members of the fos family investigated, only c-Fos significantly inhibited androgen-induced PSA promoter activity in the absence ofjun members. Maximum inhibition of androgen-induced PSA promoter activity was generally observed in cells co-transfected with expression plasmids from both jun and fosfamilies (lanes 8–16). EMSA with radiolabeled synthetic oligonucleotide containing a TRE consensus site and nuclear extracts prepared from LNCaP cells exposed to TPA for 6 h showed comparable DNA binding activities in vehicle-treated (0.1% ethanol) and 10 nmR1881-treated cells (Fig. 6 A). Cells treated with 1 nm TPA (lane 3) showed a 3.7-fold increase in DNA binding activity (compared with vehicle-treated levels,lane 1), which was similar to levels obtained with nuclear extracts from cells treated with 1 nm TPA and R1881 (lane 4). These data are comparable with the 4-fold increase in cellular levels of TPA-induced c-Jun protein for this time point as shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 6 A, TPA (10 nm) was the more potent of the two concentrations of TPA examined and resulted in a 11.7-fold increase in DNA binding activity of nuclear extracts to the TRE oligonucleotide (lane 5). The addition of R1881 to 10 nm TPA-treated cells consistently resulted in approximately a 33% reduction in AP-1 DNA-binding activity (lane 6). Specificity of DNA binding activity was shown by competition experiments using 100-fold excess unlabeled SP-1 oligonucleotide (nonspecific competitor) (lane 7) and TRE oligonucleotide (specific competitor) (lane 8). Thus, nuclear extracts from TPA-treated LNCaP cells are characterized by enhanced AP-1 DNA-binding activity which is reduced by R1881. The work of Kallio et al. (32Kallio P.J. Poukka H. Moilanen A. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that AR inhibits c-Jun DNA binding activity, while c-Jun does not affect AR DNA binding to the C3 ARE. Similarly, the c-Jun DNA binding activity seen in our experiments (Fig. 6 B, lane 3) was also inhibited by peptide fragments of the AR. AR1-GST, containing both the ligand- and DNA-binding domains, was more potent in the inhibition of c-Jun DNA binding activity (lanes"
https://openalex.org/W2047102191,"In mammals, plasma concentrations of amino acids are affected by nutritional or pathological conditions. Here we examined the role of amino acid limitation in regulating the expression of CHOP, a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-related gene. CHOP protein is capable of interacting with other C/EBPs to modify their DNA binding activities and may function as a negative regulator of these transcription factors. Our data show that leucine limitation in human cell lines leads to induction of CHOPmRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner.CHOP mRNA induction is rapidly reversed by leucine replenishment. Elevated mRNA levels result from both an increase in the rate of CHOP transcription and an increase in theCHOP mRNA stability. Using a transient expression assay, we show that a promoter fragment, when linked to a reporter gene, is sufficient to mediate the regulation of CHOPexpression by leucine starvation in HeLa cells. In addition, we found that decreasing amino acid concentration by itself can induceCHOP expression independently of a cellular stress due to protein synthesis inhibition. Moreover, CHOP expression is induced at leucine concentrations in the range of those observed in blood of protein-restricted animals suggesting that amino acids can participate, in concert with hormones, in the regulation of gene expression.

Cells regulate gene expression in response to changes in the external environment. Metabolite control of gene expression has been well documented in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. Specific mechanisms have evolved to allow these organisms to quickly metabolize various molecules based on their availability in the external medium (1Kolter R. Yanofsky C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1982; 16: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, much less is known about the response of multicellular organisms to nutrient variations. The control of gene expression differs in many aspects from those operating in single cell organisms and involves complex interactions of hormonal, neuronal, and nutritional factors. It has been shown that major (carbohydrates, fatty acids, sterols) or minor (minerals, vitamins) dietary constituents participate, in concert with many hormones, in the regulation of gene expression in response to nutritional changes (3Towle H.C.

There is considerably less information available concerning the control of mammalian gene expression by amino acids. However, it has been shown that starvation of one essential amino acid causes a specific increase in mRNA abundance of certain genes including c-myc, c-jun, ornithine decarboxylase (8Pohjanpelto P. Hölttä E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5814-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), asparagine synthetase (9Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell.

FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have shown that the abundance of several different mRNAs is affected by amino acid starvation. In this study the greatest induction in response to amino acids starvation was exhibited by the CHOP gene. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in gene regulation by amino acids. It has only been shown that the induction of asparagine synthetase gene by amino acid starvation involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (9Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These authors have characterizedcis-acting elements involved in transcriptional regulation of that gene in response to amino acid starvation. CHOP (also called gadd153) is a mammalian gene whose expression is also induced in all tested cells by a wide variety of stresses and agents (13Luethy J.D. Holbrook N.J.

In mammals, plasma concentrations of glucose and free amino acids are markedly affected by nutritional or pathological conditions (27Fafournoux P. Remesy C. Demigne C. Am. J.

In the present study we have examined the role of amino acids in the regulation of CHOP expression. We demonstrate that amino acid limitation, in conditions which do not inhibit protein synthesis, can induce CHOP expression. Particularly, we show that leucine starvation induces CHOPexpression through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. The implication of these findings are discussed in a general context of the control of mammalian gene expression by amino acids in various nutritional conditions. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12 (DMEM/F12) (Sigma) containing 10% (HeLa and HepG2) or 20% (Caco-2) fetal bovine serum. When indicated, DMEM/F12 lacking leucine was used. For other amino acid or glucose starvation experiments, MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used. For amino acid starvation experiments 10% dialyzed calf serum was used. Total RNA was prepared as described previously (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63176) Google Scholar). Northern blots were performed according to the procedure of Sambrook et al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.46Google Scholar). The membranes were UV cross-linked and then prehybridization was carried out for 2 h at 55 °C in 50% formamide, 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 10 μg/ml yeast tRNA. The human CHOP cDNA (BH1), generously provided by Dr. N. J. Holbrook (31Park J.S. Luethy J.D. Wang M.G. Fargnoli J. Fornace Jr., A.J. McBride O.W. Holbrook N.J. Gene ( Amst .). 1992; 116: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), was used as a probe. BH1 plasmid was linearized by PstI, and32P-riboprobes were synthesized (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.46Google Scholar) using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 55 °C. The membranes were washed for 15 min at 55 °C successively in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS, 0.5 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS, 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Labeled bands were detected by autoradiography. Autoradiogram signals were quantified by using a densitometric scanner (Appligene) and NIH image software. To control for variation in either the amount of RNA in different samples or loading errors, all blots were rehybridized with an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to 18 S RNA. All densitometric values forCHOP mRNA were normalized to 18 S RNA values obtained on the same blot. Relative CHOP mRNA was determined as the ratio of CHOP mRNA and 18 S RNA. HeLa cells (5 × 105) were plated in 60-mm diameter dishes and transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (32Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of CAT plasmid were transfected into the cells along with 2 μg of pCMV-βGal, a plasmid carrying the bacterial β-galactosidase gene fused to the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/promoter region, as an internal control. Cells were exposed to the precipitate for 16 h, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with DMEM/F12 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were amino acid-starved for the desired time and then collected for CAT assay (33Gorman C. Moffat F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the cell extracts was determined using the BCA method (34Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18638) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described by Hall et al. (35Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar) and used to calibrate transfection efficiency. Relative CAT activity was given as a percentage of pSV2CAT activity. All values are the means calculated from the results of at least three independent experiments. Total cellular RNA from transfected cells was isolated as described above. A 20-base pair oligonucleotide (5′-CAACGGTGGTATATCCAGTG-3′), complementary to the DNA sequence located 11–30 base pairs downstream from the translation initiation site of the cat gene, was end-labeled with T4polynucleotide kinase (Eurogentec) and then used for primer extension as described previously (36Trienzenberg S.J.

In vitrotranscription experiments in isolated HeLa cell nuclei were carried out essentially as described by Liu et al. (37Liu Y. Sun L. Jost J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2718-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). RNA was labeled with [32P]UTP and then hybridized to filter-bound cDNAs of CHOP (31Park J.S. Luethy J.D. Wang M.G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and pBluescript DNA (Stratagene). Hybridization with labeled RNA was performed at 45 °C for 24 h. The filters were washed twice for 15 min in 5 × SSC plus 0.2% SDS at 45 °C, followed by three washes in 2 × SSC plus 0.2% SDS at 45 °C. Radioactive dots were visualized and quantified by using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad) and the MOLECULAR ANALYST software. HeLa cells were incubated for 16 h in DMEM/F12 containing 420, 140, 70, 35, or 0 μm leucine. During the last 3 h of incubation, 0.5 μCi/ml [35S]methionine were added. The medium was then removed, and the cells were incubated for 30 min in cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. The wells were washed once with trichloroacetic acid and three times with water. The radioactivity incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was measured by liquid scintillation counting after protein solubilization in 0.1m NaOH plus 0.5% SDS. Results are given as a percentage of methionine incorporation in cells incubated in DMEM/F12 control medium. Cells were lysed in a SDS-containing buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS) and immediately boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. CHOP and the ubiquitous nuclear protein TLS were detected in D. Ron's laboratory as previously described (39Wang X.-Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.-J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell.

To understand the regulation of gene expression by amino acids at a molecular level, we have studied the regulation ofCHOP expression in response to leucine limitation because (i) leucine is an essential amino acid that is poorly utilized by cells during a 16-h incubation period (data not shown), (ii) leucine, which is transported by system L, is rapidly equilibrated through the cell membrane (41Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 42McGivan J.D. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and (iii) Marten et al. (12Marten N.W. Burke E.J. Hayden J.M. Straus D.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have shown that leucine depletion strongly induces CHOP expression. To test the possibility that leucine concentration can influenceCHOP expression, HeLa, HepG2, or Caco-2 cells were incubated for 16 h in medium containing different concentrations of leucine. As shown in Fig. 1 A, CHOP mRNA levels were very low in each cell type in control medium containing 420 μm leucine and were inversely proportional to the leucine concentration in the medium, ranging from 15- to 30-fold over the control value. These results indicate that the expression ofCHOP mRNA in human cells is regulated in response to changes in leucine concentration. Fig. 1 B shows that the increase in CHOP mRNA levels results in the increase in the CHOP protein. Kinetic analysis of CHOP mRNA level in HeLa cells exposed to medium lacking leucine indicated that mRNA was detectable 2 h after starvation, and a maximum level was reached after 10–12 h (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether the induction of CHOP expression by leucine starvation is reversible by leucine replenishment, 420 μm leucine was added to the culture medium of HeLa cells incubated for 16 h in leucine-free medium. Fig. 2 Bclearly shows that leucine addition resulted in a rapid loss ofCHOP mRNA expression with levels declining over 90% by 1 h following the addition of leucine.Figure 2Induction and reversal of CHOPexpression by leucine starvation. A, HeLa cells were incubated either in DMEM/F12 (+Leu) or in DMEM/F12 lacking leucine (−Leu) and harvested for RNA isolation after the indicated incubation times. Northern blot analysis was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The blots were hybridized with a CHOP probe and rehybridized with an 18 S probe to normalize for RNA loading. B, following 16 h of leucine starvation, 420 μm leucine was added to the culture medium of HeLa cells, and the RNA was harvested at the times indicated. The error bars represent standard deviation from the mean of two independent experiments in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether leucine limitation affects protein synthesis, HeLa cells were incubated in medium containing different concentrations of leucine and then [35S]methionine incorporation in the acid-precipitable fraction was measured (Fig. 3 A). Cells incubated in medium lacking leucine showed a 40% reduction of methionine incorporation into total protein together with a drastic increase in CHOP mRNA level (Fig. 3 B,lane b). However, cells incubated in medium containing 35 or 70 μm leucine gave no significant reduction of the global protein synthesis, whereas CHOP mRNA expression was significantly increased (Fig. 3 B, lanes c and d). These observations are consistent with the idea that inhibition of protein synthesis is not responsible for the induction ofCHOP mRNA expression. Leucine starvation could increase CHOP mRNA expression either by increasing the rate of transcription or by stabilizing existing transcripts, or through both mechanisms. Nuclear run-on experiments provided evidence that the rate of CHOP transcription was increased by leucine starvation (Fig. 4 A). Four hours of leucine starvation increased dramatically the transcription of CHOP (21-fold), while the transcription of the S26 ribosomal gene remained unchanged. To determine whether leucine starvation can affect the half-life of CHOPmRNA, HeLa cells were first incubated for 16 h in medium lacking leucine and then incubated with actinomycin D (4 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 420 μm leucine, and total mRNA was extracted from cells at various times. As shown in Fig.4 B, addition of leucine resulted in a rapid decline inCHOP mRNA levels. In starved cells, the CHOPmRNA half-life was increased about 3-fold compared with cells incubated in the control medium. These findings indicate that leucine starvation elevates CHOP mRNA levels both by increasing the rate of CHOP transcription and by enhancing the stability of CHOP mRNA. To assess the importance of protein synthesis for the increase of CHOP mRNA expression during leucine starvation, cells were leucine-starved and treated with cycloheximide for 4 h. As shown in Fig.4 C, cycloheximide present during leucine starvation prevented the accumulation of CHOP mRNA. This result indicates that the increase in CHOP mRNA during leucine starvation is dependent on de novo protein synthesis. To analyze the role of CHOP promoter in transcription activation by leucine starvation, a chimeric gene (pCHOP-CAT) containing the 5′-flanking sequence from nucleotides −954 to +91 fused to the cat gene (31Park J.S. Luethy J.D. Wang M.G. Fargnoli J. Fornace Jr., A.J. McBride O.W. Holbrook N.J. Gene ( Amst .). 1992; 116: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was transiently transfected in HeLa cells. The data presented in Fig.5 A (summarized in the graph of Fig.5 B) show that CAT activity expressed under the control of the CHOP promoter was induced 7-fold by 16 h of leucine starvation, whereas CAT activity expressed from the pSV2CAT construct used as a control was not induced. These results gave direct evidence that regulation of CHOP transcription by leucine starvation is mediated through the promoter sequence situated between nucleotide position −954 and +91. Similar increased levels of CAT activity were also observed with transfection of pCHOP-CAT into HepG2 and Caco-2 cells (data not shown). To correlate CAT activity and amounts of CAT mRNA transcribed under leucine-starved and non-starved conditions, primer extension experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 6, under leucine starvation, the amounts of CAT mRNA initiating at the correct start site of the promoter were much higher (lane b) than those transcribed in normal conditions (lane a), and the levels of CAT mRNA derived from pSV2CAT remained unchanged (lanes c and d). These results show that the degree of induction of pCHOP-CAT mRNA expression (6–7-fold) is in agreement with the degree of induction determined in CAT assays and indicate that, under our experimental conditions, leucine starvation does not affect significantly translation of the CAT mRNA.Figure 6Regulation of CAT mRNA expression under the control of the CHOP promoter. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmid pCHOP-CAT or with plasmid pSV2CAT as described under “Materials and Methods” 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated for 16 h in DMEM/F12 (420 μm) or in DMEM/F12 lacking leucine (0 μm) and harvested. Total cellular RNA was extracted, and 50 μg of each sample was analyzed for CAT mRNA expression by primer extension as described under “Materials and Methods.” Eacharrow indicates the CAT mRNA correctly initiated from the CHOP or the SV40 promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the CHOP promoter-driven CAT induction is consistent with that described for the endogenous CHOPmRNA, we examined the characteristics of the CHOPpromoter activity in response to leucine limitation. Fig.7 A shows that the transcriptional activity from CHOP promoter was enhanced by a decrease in leucine concentration in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of the cat gene expression revealed that maximal CAT activity induction was reached 16 h after starvation (Fig. 7 B). Starvation of other amino acids was tested for their abilities to influence CHOP promoter-driven CAT expression in HeLa cells (Fig. 8). The most potent amino acids increasing CAT activity level appeared to be methionine, lysine, arginine, phenylalanine, and threonine. They produced about the same induction level of CAT activity as that obtained with leucine (5–8-fold). Glutamine, aspartate, asparagine, cysteine, proline, and glutamate had minor but consistent increasing effects on CAT activity (2- to 3-fold). In contrast, alanine and serine had no significant effect on the level of CAT activity. These results provide evidence that the degree of effectiveness for each amino acid on theCHOP promoter activity varied widely. Moreover, this part ofCHOP promoter also responds to glucose deprivation. In these experimental conditions, the induction in CAT activity due to glucose deprivation appeared to be not additive with that for leucine starvation. In mammals, plasma concentrations of amino acids are affected by nutritional or pathological conditions. The experiments reported in this paper were designed to investigate the role of amino acids in the control of gene expression. A study performed by Marten et al. (12Marten N.W. Burke E.J. Hayden J.M. Straus D.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) showed that in a rat hepatoma cell line, removal of one amino acid in the culture medium induced an increase in the expression of several genes. Among these genes, CHOP expression exhibited the greatest induction in response to amino acid starvation. Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation ofCHOP mRNA expression have not been elucidated to date. To understand the regulation of gene expression by amino acids at a molecular level, we have studied the regulation of CHOPexpression in response to leucine limitation. The main effect of amino acid limitation on cellular function is the inhibition of protein synthesis. We show that low leucine concentrations (35 and 70 μm) can induce CHOPexpression but do not significantly inhibit total protein synthesis. However, this does not preclude the possibility that low leucine concentrations could affect the synthesis of particular proteins. These findings demonstrate that the regulation of CHOP expression by amino acid limitation is not a consequence of a cellular stress due to protein synthesis inhibition. Since no general accumulation of mRNAs in amino acid-starved cells has been observed, mammalian cells must have a specific mechanism(s) that enables them to alter one specific pattern of gene expression in response to amino acid deprivation. Accumulation of asparagine synthetase, c-myc, c-jun, and c-fosmRNA have been reported to be induced transcriptionally and/or post-transcriptionally by amino acid starvation (8Pohjanpelto P. Hölttä E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5814-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 43Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 44Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We show that regulation of CHOP expression by leucine limitation has both transcriptional and post-transcriptional components. Our results clearly establish that the stability of CHOP mRNA is very low in the presence of leucine and is markedly increased in the absence of leucine. However, the mechanisms affecting CHOPmRNA stability in leucine-starved cells remain to be characterized. Furthermore, the induction of CHOP mRNA expression is sensitive to cycloheximide treatment suggesting that signaling pathways activated by leucine starvation involve synthesis of essential regulatory protein(s). We also show that starvation of other amino acids like lysine, methionine, arginine, phenylalanine, or threonine increases strongly CHOP promoter activity. These results suggest that gene regulation by leucine may be an example of a more general regulatory mechanism by which CHOP expression would be controlled by the levels of amino acids. In yeast, the general control response to amino acid starvation is mediated through translational control of the positive transcription factor GCN4 which in turn modulates expression of numerous genes (2Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1985; 43: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with the existence in mammal cells of such a regulatory protein(s) involved in a general regulatory mechanism of gene expression by amino acid starvation. This hypothesis remains to be demonstrated. However, it is also possible, as suggested by Wanget al. (39Wang X.-Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.-J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), that what is being sensed is not the level of amino acids as such but rather some perturbation that arises when amino acid levels become limiting, for example the synthesis of abnormal proteins. Our present results show that the 5′-flanking region of the humanCHOP gene contains cis elements involved in the regulation of the CHOP transcription by leucine starvation. The promoter of the human asparagine synthetase gene has been shown to contain a 7-base pair region (5′-CATGATG-3′), designated amino acid response element (AARE), which mediates the transcriptional activation of the gene in response to amino acid starvation (9Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicates that the CHOP promoter region contains several sequences homologous to the AARE, but their functional role remains to be demonstrated. Moreover, numerous regulatory elements that are likely to function in controlling the expression of this gene in response to cellular stress have been identified (31Park J.S. Luethy J.D. Wang M.G. Fargnoli J. Fornace Jr., A.J. McBride O.W. Holbrook N.J. Gene ( Amst .). 1992; 116: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Promoter deletion analyses have shown that several cis elements are involved in transcriptional activation of CHOP by UV irradiation or oxidant treatment (46Guyton K.Z. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, the cis elements involved in CHOP regulation by amino acid limitation remain to be identified. The CHOP protein has been shown to heterodimerize with members of the C/EBP family (23Fawcett T.W. Eastman H.B. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14285-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). McKnight et al. (17McKnight S. Lane M.D. Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) have hypothesized that C/EBP transcription factor family could play an important role in the control of energy metabolism. Through its interaction with C/EBPs, CHOP may participate in the regulation of downstream effector gene transcription during cellular response to amino acid limitation. It has been reported that C/EBP is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase gene and two other urea cycle enzyme genes (47Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9186-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Lagacé M. Goping I.S. Mueller C.R. Lazzaro M. Shore G.C. Gene ( Amst .). 1992; 118: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 49Murakami T. Nishiyori A. Takiguchi M. Mori M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1180-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, CHOP could play a crucial role in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism under amino acid control, although the cause and effect relationships have to be demonstrated. In mammals, the plasma concentration of free amino acids shows striking alterations according to the nutritional or pathological conditions. For example, blood amino acid concentrations drop in animals fed with a low protein diet or starved (27Fafournoux P. Remesy C. Demigne C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E614-E625PubMed Google Scholar, 50Nair K.S. Woolf P.D. Welle S.L. Matthews D.E. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1987; 46: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Under such extreme nutritional conditions, cells could undergo a limitation for essential amino acids. Indeed, Strauss et al. (11Straus D.S. Burke E.J. Marten N.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1090-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have hypothesized that induction of IGFBP-1 gene expression in the liver of protein-restricted animals may be partially explained by a limitation for essential amino acids. We show that CHOP induction by amino acid limitation can take place (i) in all human cell lines tested (HepG2, CaCo-2, HeLa cells) and (ii) at a leucine concentration (70 μm) in the range of those observed in the blood of protein-restricted animals. Therefore, leucine limitation related to those observed in nutritional situations may be a factor contributing to the induction of CHOP gene expression. Further work will be necessary to determine whether changes in blood amino acid concentrations could play an important role, in concert with hormones, in the modulation of gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2024299275,"Stimulation of cells with certain agonists often activates both phospholipases C and D. These generate diacylglycerol and phosphatidate, respectively, although the two lipids are also apparently interconvertable through the actions of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and diacylglycerol kinase. Diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C while one role for phosphatidate is the activation of actin stress fiber formation. Therefore, if the two lipids are interconvertable, it is theoretically possible that an uncontrolled signaling loop could arise. To address this issue structural analysis of diacylglycerol, phosphatidate, and phosphatidylbutanol (formed in the presence of butan-1-ol) from both Swiss 3T3 and porcine aortic endothelial cells was performed. This demonstrated that phospholipase C activation generates primarily polyunsaturated species while phospholipase D activation generates saturated/monounsaturated species. In the endothelial cells, where phospholipase D was activated by lysophosphatidic acid independently of phospholipase C, there was no activation of protein kinase C. Thus we propose that only polyunsaturated diacylglycerols and saturated/monounsaturated phosphatidates function as intracellular messengers and that their interconversion products are inactive. Stimulation of cells with certain agonists often activates both phospholipases C and D. These generate diacylglycerol and phosphatidate, respectively, although the two lipids are also apparently interconvertable through the actions of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and diacylglycerol kinase. Diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C while one role for phosphatidate is the activation of actin stress fiber formation. Therefore, if the two lipids are interconvertable, it is theoretically possible that an uncontrolled signaling loop could arise. To address this issue structural analysis of diacylglycerol, phosphatidate, and phosphatidylbutanol (formed in the presence of butan-1-ol) from both Swiss 3T3 and porcine aortic endothelial cells was performed. This demonstrated that phospholipase C activation generates primarily polyunsaturated species while phospholipase D activation generates saturated/monounsaturated species. In the endothelial cells, where phospholipase D was activated by lysophosphatidic acid independently of phospholipase C, there was no activation of protein kinase C. Thus we propose that only polyunsaturated diacylglycerols and saturated/monounsaturated phosphatidates function as intracellular messengers and that their interconversion products are inactive. Stimulation of cells by particular agonists which occupy either heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors or those with an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity induce an increase in the mass of diradylglycerols (collectively diacylglycerol, alkyl, acylglycerol and alkenyl, acylglycerol; DRG), 1The abbreviations used are: DRG, diradylglycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; PKC, protein kinase C; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PA, phosphatidate; PBut, phosphatidylbutanol; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: DRG, diradylglycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; PKC, protein kinase C; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PA, phosphatidate; PBut, phosphatidylbutanol; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. in particularsn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), the physiological activator of protein kinase C (PKC) (1Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). DAG is produced, together with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate which stimulates the elevation of intracellular free calcium concentration, by phospholipase C (PLC)-catalyzed phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis. Agonist stimulation of this pathway is rapidly desensitized, DAG generation has been demonstrated to be rapid, but transient, declining toward basal levels within 1–2 min (2Wright T.M. Rangan L.A. Shin H.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9374-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Cook S.J. Palmer S. Plevin R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, there is frequently a second sustained phase of DAG generation. This phase has been associated with an increase in the activation of phospholipase D (PLD)-catalyzed phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis, producing phosphatidate (PA) which can be converted to DAG by the action of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. It has also been proposed that DAG can be derived from other pathways, e.g. through a PC-PLC pathway, although the evidence for stimulation of this pathway in mammalian cells remains mostly circumstantial (4Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 119: 14-45Google Scholar, 5Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar).Cells contain multiple species of DAG, however, a limited subset of these change following stimulation. Comparison of the acyl chain DAG structures with those of the cellular phospholipids indicated that the initial phase of DAG increase was predominantly from inositol phospholipids, while the sustained phase, which was accompanied by an increase in choline release, was probably produced from PC (6Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8729-8738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem.

Baldassare J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7959-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial phase of DAG generation was made up of specific polyunsaturated DAG species, in particular 18:0/20:3n-9, 18:0/20:4n-6, and 18:0/20:5n-3, while the second phase was predominantly represented by more saturated species (7Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The role of the PLD pathway remains incompletely defined. We have recently demonstrated that PA, generated by the activation of PLD, can stimulate rho-mediated actin stress fiber formation in porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells (10Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This would suggest that while PLD activation clearly results in an increase in DAG, it is not certain that this lipid plays a signaling role. Rather, it may be that the initial product, PA, functions as a messenger and that it is converted to DAG to attenuate the signal. In vitro studies have demonstrated that essentially all DAG species can activate PKC, however, the in vivo evidence for activation by PLD-derived DAG remains mixed. One report has demonstrated no activation of PKC in IIC9 fibroblasts stimulated with a concentration of thrombin which did not activate inositol lipid hydrolysis but did activate PLD (11Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Wright T.M. Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while another report found activation of PKCε under the same conditions (12Ha K.-S. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10534-10539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of signaling roles have been proposed for PA including activation of a kinase (13Khan W.A. Blobe G.C. Richards A.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9729-9735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), membrane fusion (14Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1988; 32: 87-112Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and actin stress fiber formation (10Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since DAG is converted to PA in cells by DAG kinase activity and PA is metabolized to DAG by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity, if both PA and DAG are second messengers an uncontrolled signaling cycle could result. Therefore we have re-examined the role of the PLD pathway in regulating PKC and have analyzed the acyl chain structure of DAG and PA in stimulated cells. We demonstrate here that the DAG and thus PA derived from PLC activation is predominantly polyunsaturated while the lipids generated by PLD activation are saturated or monounsaturated. In addition PLD-derived DAG does not appear to regulate PKC activity in stimulated PAE cells.DISCUSSIONAgonist-stimulated PLD activity has been proposed to provide the source of sustained DAG generation in cells leading to the sustained activation of protein kinase C. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the PA product of PLD activation itself functions as an intracellular messenger. The potential for interconversion of PA and DAG in cells thus raises the possibility of uncontrolled signaling in a normal cell and makes it difficult to reconcile the possibility that both lipids can indeed function as messenger molecules. The results presented in this report provide a molecular basis for separate signaling functions of DAG and PA.We and others have previously reported that in stimulated cells the rapidly generated DAG is predominantly polyunsaturated and apparently derived from inositol phospholipids (6Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8729-8738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22837-22846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that the acyl chain structure of the PA in stimulated Swiss 3T3 and PAE cells is predominantly saturated or monounsaturated, in particular 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1n-9. Conversion of this PA to DAG by the action of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase thus produces a saturated/monounsaturated rather than a polyunsaturated species. We have only been able to detect extremely small quantities of polyunsaturated acyl groups in PA, e.g. 20:4n-6 in the presence or absence of butan-1-ol. This presumably reflects the rapid utilization of these species by PA-cytidyl transferase, forming cytidyl monophosphate-PA for the resynthesis of inositol phospholipids, a possibility supported by the observed reduction in polyunsaturated PA mass in stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells. Attempts to trap cytidyl monophosphate-PA, by inositol depletion and LiCl treatment as described by other groups (e.g. Ref. 20Rodriguez R. Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were largely unsuccessful, with no significant accumulation of this lipid (data not shown). Others have also found that this trapping technique did not to work with all cell types (19Drummond A.H. Raeburn C.A. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Rodriguez R. Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21Monaco M.E. Adelson J.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of cytidyl monophosphate-PA showed predominantly 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1n-6 fatty acids with no detectable 20:3n-9, 20:4n-6, or 20:5n-3 at any time point, suggesting that molecular species containing these fatty acids are selectively metabolized more rapidly than other species.Analysis of the acyl structure of the PBut formed in cells stimulated in the presence of 30 mm butan-1-ol demonstrated that the saturated/monounsaturated PA was produced by PLD activation, rather than by PLC-catalyzed phospholipid hydrolysis followed by DAG kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the generated DAG. The reduction in stimulated DAG generation in the presence of the alcohol defined the fraction generated by PLD activation. Thus the results in Fig. 1 and Table I demonstrate that PLD activation is responsible for sustained DAG generation in both Swiss 3T3 and PAE cells. It was considered possible that the “alcohol trap” of generated PA was incomplete, however, in the LPA-stimulated PAE cells, where PLD is the only agonist-stimulated phospholipase, butan-1-ol, but not butan-2-ol completely prevented DAG generation (Fig. 1).It has been proposed that PLD-derived DAG can stimulate PKC activity in chronically stimulated cells (see Ref. 5Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, for review). This implies that the acyl chain structure of the DAG is not relevant to the ability of a species to function as an activator. The PAE cell provided a useful experimental model to test this hypothesis since LPA stimulation only increased saturated/monounsaturated DAGs which were produced as a result of PLD activation. In the PAE cells all the PKCα and -δ and a significant proportion of the PKCε and -ζ were found in the membrane fraction under basal conditions. This membrane localization was probably a consequence of the high level of 18:0/20:4n-6 and 18:0/20:3n-9 DAGs (Fig. 2) found in the resting cells. This provides support for a specific role for the polyunsaturated DAGs in activating PKC. Fig. 5 clearly shows that the increase in the saturated/monounsaturated DAG species in LPA-stimulated PAE cells was unable to induce the translocation of PKCε to a membrane fraction. PKCε is a calcium independent isoform, thus it would be expected to be translocated by an increase in DAG mass; as a control inclusion of PMA clearly induced complete translocation. This lack of translocation reflected the inability of LPA to stimulate PKC activity in the PAE cells (Fig. 6). Thus the DAG species produced as a result of PLD activation do not appear to be regulators of PKC, at least in this cell line. Therefore, while they can activate in vitro, we suggest that saturated/monounsaturated DAG species do not regulate PKC activity in an intact normal cell.Previous reports (11Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Wright T.M. Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that PKCα translocation is a consequence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, rather than PC hydrolysis since an increase in both DAG and [Ca2+] are required. It was previously proposed that the DAG derived from PC hydrolysis did not activate PKC (11Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Wright T.M. Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this study only examined PKCα and a later study in the same cell line suggested that the DAG derived from PC hydrolysis could stimulate PKCε translocation (12Ha K.-S. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10534-10539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the results reported here differ from that report. A possible explanation for the differences in results may be that in the work reported here we have been able to clearly demonstrate that all of the increased DAG in the stimulated PAE cells is indeed PLD derived.An alternative explanation for the lack of stimulation of PKC by PLD-derived DAG is that the phospholipase has been activated in a compartment devoid of PKC. Subcellular fractionation studies have provided evidence for PLD activity in plasma membranes, Golgi membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear membrane (22Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4952-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 23Whatmore J. Morgan C.P. Cunningham E. Collison K.S. Willison K.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4911-4914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus it is unlikely that PLD-derived DAG would be formed in a membrane devoid of PKC, particularly since PKC isoenzymes appear to be able to translocate to most membranes in the cell including those where PLD activity has been detected. Additional support for our proposal that PLD-derived DAG does not activate PKC is the observation that incubation of HL-60 cells with Streptomyces chromofuscus PLD had no effect upon PKC redistribution, while incubation withBacillus cereus phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C induced cytosol to membrane translocation (27Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In keeping with this result, we were only able to observe sustained activation of PKCδ and -ε in Swiss 3T3 cells where polyunsaturated DAG species were elevated (28Olivier A.R. Hansra G. Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 425-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Thus we propose that the DAG derived from PLD hydrolysis is not involved in signaling, rather it is a metabolite utilized in the resynthesis of phospholipids. This also suggests that the monounsaturated/saturated PA species themselves play a signaling role in cells. Indeed, in our recent demonstration of PA-stimulated actin stress fiber formation in PAE cells, the stimulant was the dioleoyl structure (10Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order for PA to function as a signal a target molecule must exist and thus proof of PA's signaling function is dependent upon the identification of specific PA targets. It is, however, implicit in the proposed function for PA, that the polyunsaturated PA species do not bind to and activate such target proteins under physiological conditions and thus do not function as signaling molecules. In conclusion we suggest that, while both PLD and PLC pathways directly generate second messengers, it is only the polyunsaturated DAGs and the saturated/monounsaturated PAs which serve as signals under physiological conditions. Stimulation of cells by particular agonists which occupy either heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors or those with an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity induce an increase in the mass of diradylglycerols (collectively diacylglycerol, alkyl, acylglycerol and alkenyl, acylglycerol; DRG), 1The abbreviations used are: DRG, diradylglycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; PKC, protein kinase C; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PA, phosphatidate; PBut, phosphatidylbutanol; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: DRG, diradylglycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; PKC, protein kinase C; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PA, phosphatidate; PBut, phosphatidylbutanol; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. in particularsn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), the physiological activator of protein kinase C (PKC) (1Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). DAG is produced, together with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate which stimulates the elevation of intracellular free calcium concentration, by phospholipase C (PLC)-catalyzed phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis. Agonist stimulation of this pathway is rapidly desensitized, DAG generation has been demonstrated to be rapid, but transient, declining toward basal levels within 1–2 min (2Wright T.M. Rangan L.A. Shin H.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9374-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Cook S.J. Palmer S. Plevin R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, there is frequently a second sustained phase of DAG generation. This phase has been associated with an increase in the activation of phospholipase D (PLD)-catalyzed phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis, producing phosphatidate (PA) which can be converted to DAG by the action of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. It has also been proposed that DAG can be derived from other pathways, e.g. through a PC-PLC pathway, although the evidence for stimulation of this pathway in mammalian cells remains mostly circumstantial (4Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 119: 14-45Google Scholar, 5Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Cells contain multiple species of DAG, however, a limited subset of these change following stimulation. Comparison of the acyl chain DAG structures with those of the cellular phospholipids indicated that the initial phase of DAG increase was predominantly from inositol phospholipids, while the sustained phase, which was accompanied by an increase in choline release, was probably produced from PC (6Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8729-8738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem.

Baldassare J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7959-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial phase of DAG generation was made up of specific polyunsaturated DAG species, in particular 18:0/20:3n-9, 18:0/20:4n-6, and 18:0/20:5n-3, while the second phase was predominantly represented by more saturated species (7Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The role of the PLD pathway remains incompletely defined. We have recently demonstrated that PA, generated by the activation of PLD, can stimulate rho-mediated actin stress fiber formation in porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells (10Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This would suggest that while PLD activation clearly results in an increase in DAG, it is not certain that this lipid plays a signaling role. Rather, it may be that the initial product, PA, functions as a messenger and that it is converted to DAG to attenuate the signal. In vitro studies have demonstrated that essentially all DAG species can activate PKC, however, the in vivo evidence for activation by PLD-derived DAG remains mixed. One report has demonstrated no activation of PKC in IIC9 fibroblasts stimulated with a concentration of thrombin which did not activate inositol lipid hydrolysis but did activate PLD (11Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Wright T.M. Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while another report found activation of PKCε under the same conditions (12Ha K.-S. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10534-10539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of signaling roles have been proposed for PA including activation of a kinase (13Khan W.A. Blobe G.C. Richards A.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9729-9735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), membrane fusion (14Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1988; 32: 87-112Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and actin stress fiber formation (10Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since DAG is converted to PA in cells by DAG kinase activity and PA is metabolized to DAG by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity, if both PA and DAG are second messengers an uncontrolled signaling cycle could result. Therefore we have re-examined the role of the PLD pathway in regulating PKC and have analyzed the acyl chain structure of DAG and PA in stimulated cells. We demonstrate here that the DAG and thus PA derived from PLC activation is predominantly polyunsaturated while the lipids generated by PLD activation are saturated or monounsaturated. In addition PLD-derived DAG does not appear to regulate PKC activity in stimulated PAE cells. DISCUSSIONAgonist-stimulated PLD activity has been proposed to provide the source of sustained DAG generation in cells leading to the sustained activation of protein kinase C. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the PA product of PLD activation itself functions as an intracellular messenger. The potential for interconversion of PA and DAG in cells thus raises the possibility of uncontrolled signaling in a normal cell and makes it difficult to reconcile the possibility that both lipids can indeed function as messenger molecules. The results presented in this report provide a molecular basis for separate signaling functions of DAG and PA.We and others have previously reported that in stimulated cells the rapidly generated DAG is predominantly polyunsaturated and apparently derived from inositol phospholipids (6Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8729-8738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22837-22846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that the acyl chain structure of the PA in stimulated Swiss 3T3 and PAE cells is predominantly saturated or monounsaturated, in particular 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1n-9. Conversion of this PA to DAG by the action of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase thus produces a saturated/monounsaturated rather than a polyunsaturated species. We have only been able to detect extremely small quantities of polyunsaturated acyl groups in PA, e.g. 20:4n-6 in the presence or absence of butan-1-ol. This presumably reflects the rapid utilization of these species by PA-cytidyl transferase, forming cytidyl monophosphate-PA for the resynthesis of inositol phospholipids, a possibility supported by the observed reduction in polyunsaturated PA mass in stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells. Attempts to trap cytidyl monophosphate-PA, by inositol depletion and LiCl treatment as described by other groups (e.g. Ref. 20Rodriguez R. Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were largely unsuccessful, with no significant accumulation of this lipid (data not shown). Others have also found that this trapping technique did not to work with all cell types (19Drummond A.H. Raeburn C.A. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Rodriguez R. Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21Monaco M.E. Adelson J.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of cytidyl monophosphate-PA showed predominantly 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1n-6 fatty acids with no detectable 20:3n-9, 20:4n-6, or 20:5n-3 at any time point, suggesting that molecular species containing these fatty acids are selectively metabolized more rapidly than other species.Analysis of the acyl structure of the PBut formed in cells stimulated in the presence of 30 mm butan-1-ol demonstrated that the saturated/monounsaturated PA was produced by PLD activation, rather than by PLC-catalyzed phospholipid hydrolysis followed by DAG kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the generated DAG. The reduction in stimulated DAG generation in the presence of the alcohol defined the fraction generated by PLD activation. Thus the results in Fig. 1 and Table I demonstrate that PLD activation is responsible for sustained DAG generation in both Swiss 3T3 and PAE cells. It was considered possible that the “alcohol trap” of generated PA was incomplete, however, in the LPA-stimulated PAE cells, where PLD is the only agonist-stimulated phospholipase, butan-1-ol, but not butan-2-ol completely prevented DAG generation (Fig. 1).It has been proposed that PLD-derived DAG can stimulate PKC activity in chronically stimulated cells (see Ref. 5Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, for review). This implies that the acyl chain structure of the DAG is not relevant to the ability of a species to function as an activator. The PAE cell provided a useful experimental model to test this hypothesis since LPA stimulation only increased saturated/monounsaturated DAGs which were produced as a result of PLD activation. In the PAE cells all the PKCα and -δ and a significant proportion of the PKCε and -ζ were found in the membrane fraction under basal conditions. This membrane localization was probably a consequence of the high level of 18:0/20:4n-6 and 18:0/20:3n-9 DAGs (Fig. 2) found in the resting cells. This provides support for a specific role for the polyunsaturated DAGs in activating PKC. Fig. 5 clearly shows that the increase in the saturated/monounsaturated DAG species in LPA-stimulated PAE cells was unable to induce the translocation of PKCε to a membrane fraction. PKCε is a calcium independent isoform, thus it would be expected to be translocated by an increase in DAG mass; as a control inclusion of PMA clearly induced complete translocation. This lack of translocation reflected the inability of LPA to stimulate PKC activity in the PAE cells (Fig. 6). Thus the DAG species produced as a result of PLD activation do not appear to be regulators of PKC, at least in this cell line. Therefore, while they can activate in vitro, we suggest that saturated/monounsaturated DAG species do not regulate PKC activity in an intact normal cell.Previous reports (11Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Wright T.M. Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that PKCα translocation is a consequence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, rather than PC hydrolysis since an increase in both DAG and [Ca2+] are required. It was previously proposed that the DAG derived from PC hydrolysis did not activate PKC (11Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Wright T.M. Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this study only examined PKCα and a later study in the same cell line suggested that the DAG derived from PC hydrolysis could stimulate PKCε translocation (12Ha K.-S. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10534-10539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the results reported here differ from that report. A possible explanation for the differences in results may be that in the work reported here we have been able to clearly demonstrate that all of the increased DAG in the stimulated PAE cells is indeed PLD derived.An alternative explanation for the lack of stimulation of PKC by PLD-derived DAG is that the phospholipase has been activated in a compartment devoid of PKC. Subcellular fractionation studies have provided evidence for PLD activity in plasma membranes, Golgi membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear membrane (22Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A.

Thus it is unlikely that PLD-derived DAG would be formed in a membrane devoid of PKC, particularly since PKC isoenzymes appear to be able to translocate to most membranes in the cell including those where PLD activity has been detected. Additional support for our proposal that PLD-derived DAG does not activate PKC is the observation that incubation of HL-60 cells with Streptomyces chromofuscus PLD had no effect upon PKC redistribution, while incubation withBacillus cereus phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C induced cytosol to membrane translocation (27Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In keeping with this result, we were only able to observe sustained activation of PKCδ and -ε in Swiss 3T3 cells where polyunsaturated DAG species were elevated (28Olivier A.R. Hansra G. Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 425-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Thus we propose that the DAG derived from PLD hydrolysis is not involved in signaling, rather it is a metabolite utilized in the resynthesis of phospholipids. This also suggests that the monounsaturated/saturated PA species themselves play a signaling role in cells. Indeed, in our recent demonstration of PA-stimulated actin stress fiber formation in PAE cells, the stimulant was the dioleoyl structure (10Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order for PA to function as a signal a target molecule must exist and thus proof of PA's signaling function is dependent upon the identification of specific PA targets. It is, however, implicit in the proposed function for PA, that the polyunsaturated PA species do not bind to and activate such target proteins under physiological conditions and thus do not function as signaling molecules. In conclusion we suggest that, while both PLD and PLC pathways directly generate second messengers, it is only the polyunsaturated DAGs and the saturated/monounsaturated PAs which serve as signals under physiological conditions. Agonist-stimulated PLD activity has been proposed to provide the source of sustained DAG generation in cells leading to the sustained activation of protein kinase C. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the PA product of PLD activation itself functions as an intracellular messenger. The potential for interconversion of PA and DAG in cells thus raises the possibility of uncontrolled signaling in a normal cell and makes it difficult to reconcile the possibility that both lipids can indeed function as messenger molecules. The results presented in this report provide a molecular basis for separate signaling functions of DAG and PA. We and others have previously reported that in stimulated cells the rapidly generated DAG is predominantly polyunsaturated and apparently derived from inositol phospholipids (6Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8729-8738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Pettitt T.R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22837-22846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that the acyl chain structure of the PA in stimulated Swiss 3T3 and PAE cells is predominantly saturated or monounsaturated, in particular 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1n-9. Conversion of this PA to DAG by the action of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase thus produces a saturated/monounsaturated rather than a polyunsaturated species. We have only been able to detect extremely small quantities of polyunsaturated acyl groups in PA, e.g. 20:4n-6 in the presence or absence of butan-1-ol. This presumably reflects the rapid utilization of these species by PA-cytidyl transferase, forming cytidyl monophosphate-PA for the resynthesis of inositol phospholipids, a possibility supported by the observed reduction in polyunsaturated PA mass in stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells. Attempts to trap cytidyl monophosphate-PA, by inositol depletion and LiCl treatment as described by other groups (e.g. Ref. 20Rodriguez R. Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were largely unsuccessful, with no significant accumulation of this lipid (data not shown). Others have also found that this trapping technique did not to work with all cell types (19Drummond A.H. Raeburn C.A. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Rodriguez R. Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21Monaco M.E. Adelson J.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of cytidyl monophosphate-PA showed predominantly 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1n-6 fatty acids with no detectable 20:3n-9, 20:4n-6, or 20:5n-3 at any time point, suggesting that molecular species containing these fatty acids are selectively metabolized more rapidly than other species. Analysis of the acyl structure of the PBut formed in cells stimulated in the presence of 30 mm butan-1-ol demonstrated that the saturated/monounsaturated PA was produced by PLD activation, rather than by PLC-catalyzed phospholipid hydrolysis followed by DAG kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the generated DAG. The reduction in stimulated DAG generation in the presence of the alcohol defined the fraction generated by PLD activation. Thus the results in Fig. 1 and Table I demonstrate that PLD activation is responsible for sustained DAG generation in both Swiss 3T3 and PAE cells. It was considered possible that the “alcohol trap” of generated PA was incomplete, however, in the LPA-stimulated PAE cells, where PLD is the only agonist-stimulated phospholipase, butan-1-ol, but not butan-2-ol completely prevented DAG generation (Fig. 1).

https://openalex.org/W2155524198,"The high affinity interaction of integrin α5β1 with the central cell binding domain (CCBD) of fibronectin requires both the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence (in the 10th type III repeat) and a second site (in the adjacent 9th type III repeat) which synergizes with RGD. We have attempted to map the fibronectin binding interface on α5β1 using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit ligand recognition. The binding of two anti-α5 mAbs (P1D6 and JBS5) to α5β1 was strongly inhibited by a tryptic CCBD fragment of fibronectin (containing both synergy sequence and RGD) but not by GRGDS peptide. Using recombinant wild type and mutated fragments of the CCBD, we show that the synergy region of the 9th type III repeat is involved in blocking the binding of P1D6 and JBS5 to α5β1. In contrast, binding of the anti-β1 mAb P4C10 to α5β1 was inhibited to a similar extent by GRGDS peptide, the tryptic CCBD fragment, or recombinant proteins lacking the synergy region, indicating that the RGD sequence is involved in blocking P4C10 binding. P1D6 inhibited the interaction of a wild type CCBD fragment with α5β1 but had no effect on the binding of a mutant fragment that lacked the synergy region. The epitopes of P1D6 and JBS5 mapped to the NH2-terminal repeats of the α5 subunit. Our results indicate that the synergy region is recognized primarily by the α5 subunit (in particular by its NH2-terminal repeats) but that the β1 subunit plays the major role in binding of the RGD sequence.

These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms, specificity, and topology of integrin-ligand interactions. Integrins are a large family of αβ heterodimeric receptors, many of which play critical roles in cell migration, differentiation, and survival. Integrins recognize a large variety of extracellular and cell surface proteins, and two widespread recognition motifs have been identified within these ligands: Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 2Newham P. Humphries M.J. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 304-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).The extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin contains a number of domains that mediate its interaction with integrins; the most studied of these domains lies near the center of the fibronectin subunit and is known as the central cell binding domain (CCBD). 1The abbreviations used are: CCBD, central cell binding domain of fibronectin; mAb(s), monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ABTS, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). 1The abbreviations used are: CCBD, central cell binding domain of fibronectin; mAb(s), monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ABTS, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). This region contains a number of homologous repeating polypeptide modules termed fibronectin type III repeats, each about 90 amino acid residues in length. An RGD sequence, located in the 10th type III repeat, is a key recognition site for several different integrins, including the prototypic fibronectin receptor α5β1. Synthetic peptides containing the RGD sequence completely block cell adhesion to the CCBD (3Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar, 4Yamada K.M. Kennedy D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, other data show that additional sequences outside the RGD region are sometimes required for full adhesive activity. In particular, a region of the 9th type III repeat which contains the sequence Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn (PHSRN) appears to synergize with RGD for recognition by α5β1 (5Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of this sequence with a corresponding sequence from the 8th type III repeat results in a major loss of adhesive activity (5Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of this region from the CCBD results in ∼20-fold loss in activity (6Aota S. Nagai T. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15938-15943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An overlapping, but distinct, sequence plays a similar role in αIIbβ3-fibronectin interactions (7Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mode of action of such synergy sequences is not currently understood.Recently, we described the effect of GRGDS peptide and a tryptic fragment of fibronectin containing the CCBD on the binding of the inhibitory monoclonal antibody (mAb) 13 to α5β1 (8Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our results showed that both GRGDS peptide and the CCBD fragment act as allosteric inhibitors of mAb 13 binding to α5β1. Our data indicated that mAb 13 recognizes an epitope that is strongly attenuated by ligand occupancy rather than a site directly involved in ligand recognition. We hypothesized that inhibitory mAbs recognize sites attenuated during the conformational adaptation of the integrin to ligand and have termed these ligand-attenuated binding sites (8Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although mAb 13 does not appear to recognize a sequence that interacts directly with ligand, its epitope lies very close to regions of the β1 subunit which have been shown to participate in ligand binding (10Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).A region of the α5 subunit which plays an important role in fibronectin recognition has been identified by site-directed mutagenesis (12Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal portion of the α5 subunit comprises seven homologous repeats, each of ∼60 amino acid residues. Point mutations in a short hydrophobic sequence in the third NH2-terminal repeat block fibronectin binding. The epitope recognized by the inhibitory anti-α5 mAb 16 was found to lie near to this hydrophobic sequence (12Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). By analogy with our results for mAb 13, these findings suggested to us that fibronectin recognition by α5β1 may affect the binding of inhibitory anti-α5 mAbs and furthermore, that it might be possible to use inhibitory mAbs as probes to determine whether the α5 and β1 subunits recognize distinct regions of the CCBD.In this study we tested whether recognition of the CCBD by α5β1 perturbs the binding of inhibitory anti-α5 mAbs and if this perturbation is different from that observed for inhibitory anti-β1 mAbs. We show that the binding of the anti-α5 mAbs P1D6 and JBS5 to α5β1 is inhibited by fibronectin fragments containing both the RGD sequence and the synergy site but is not inhibited by GRGDS peptide or by fibronectin fragments lacking the synergy sequence. In contrast, the binding of the anti-β1 mAb P4C10 is inhibited by GRGDS peptide and fibronectin fragments containing the RGD sequence alone. We also present evidence that P1D6 blocks recognition of only the synergy site by α5β1. Taken together, our data suggest that the α5 subunit is largely responsible for recognition of the synergy site, whereas the RGD sequence appears to be recognized mainly by β1 subunit. Based on an x-ray crystal structure for the CCBD (13Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), these results allow us to predict a spatial topology for α5β1-fibronectin interactions.DISCUSSIONThe NH2-terminal portions of both integrin α and β subunits appear to cooperate in ligand recognition; however, it is not yet understood how this cooperativity arises, how specificity is generated, and whether the α and β subunits recognize the same or distinct sequences in the ligand. The prototypical interaction of α5β1 with the CCBD of fibronectin studied here allows us to begin to address these questions.The main findings of this report are as follows. (i) Binding of the anti-α5 mAbs P1D6 and JBS5 to α5β1 is strongly inhibited by CCBD fragments containing both synergy and RGD sequences, but not by GRGDS peptide or CCBD fragments containing only the RGD site. In contrast, binding of the anti-β1 mAb P4C10 to α5β1 is inhibited to a similar extent by GRGDS peptide, CCBD fragments containing both synergy and RGD sequences, or CCBD fragments containing only the RGD site. (ii) P1D6 inhibits the interaction of a wild type recombinant CCBD fragment with α5β1 but has no effect on the binding of a mutant CCBD fragment that lacks the synergy sequence. In contrast, the binding of both wild type and mutant fragments to α5β1 is inhibited by P4C10 (and by other anti-β1 mAbs). (iii) The epitopes of P1D6 and JBS5 lie in the NH2-terminal repeats of the α5 subunit. Taken together, our results indicate that the synergy region is recognized primarily by the α5 subunit (in particular by its NH2-terminal repeats) but that the β1 subunit plays the major role in binding of the RGD sequence.Although our data suggested that ligand acted mainly as an allosteric inhibitor of antibody binding, we believe that this should not be taken as evidence that these antibodies recognize epitopes that are spatially distant from the ligand binding sites. Inhibitory mAbs probably recognize sites proximal to the ligand binding domains because they lie in the same regions of the subunits implicated by other techniques (such as cross-linking and site-directed mutagenesis) as containing ligand binding sequences (9Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our epitope mapping results indicate that the epitopes of JBS5 and P1D6 include a putative β-turn sequence in the third NH2-terminal repeat of α5, a region that has previously been shown to pay a role in fibronectin recognition (12Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the concept that inhibitory mAb epitopes are at sites that are attenuated as a result of the conformational changes that take place in the integrin upon ligand recognition and that these changes take place close to the ligand binding sites. Furthermore, our results suggested that the inhibition of JBS5 binding to α5β1 by ligand was not purely allosteric but also involved a direct competition; hence the epitope recognized by this mAb appears to be partly overlapping with the ligand binding pocket.P1D6 only inhibited binding of the wild type CCBD fragment that contained both synergy sequence and RGD to α5β1 but had no effect on the binding of a mutant fragment lacking the synergy site but retaining the RGD sequence. These results imply that P1D6 only blocks recognition of the synergy sequence by α5β1. A similar conclusion was reached in a study examining the effect of P1D6 on epithelial cell adhesion to mutant fibronectin fragments (28Obara M. Yoshizato K. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, we found that the other anti-α5 mAb used in this study (JBS5) inhibited binding of both wild type and mutant CCBD fragments to α5β1. Since not all β1 integrins recognize RGD sequences, it is likely that the α5 subunit plays some role in RGD binding, and thus it is possible that the JBS5 epitope may be spatially close to a region of the α5 subunit involved in recognition of RGD. In agreement with this suggestion, mutations in the third NH2-terminal repeat of the αIIb subunit blocked binding of mAbs containing an RGD-type motif to αIIbβ3 (29Kamata T. Irie A. Tokuhira M. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18610-18615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Alternatively, as seen with the anti-β1 mAb 13 (8Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), JBS5 may induce a conformational change in α5β1 which precludes binding of the RGD sequence. All of the inhibitory anti-β1 mAbs tested blocked the binding of both wild type and mutant fragments, as would be predicted if they allosterically affect an RGD-binding region of the β1 subunit. Our proposal that the β1 subunit contains the main site involved in RGD recognition is consistent with studies examining the cross-linking of RGD-containing peptides to αIIbβ3 and αVβ3, which showed that the β3 subunit contained the major site of cross-linking (30D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Lam S.C.T. Plow E.F. Science. 1988; 242: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 31Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18726-18731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible RGD binding motif in integrin β subunits has recently been identified from a phage display library (32Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).Our observation that the 9th type III repeat appears unable to bind to α5β1 in the absence of the 10th type III repeat is consistent with a previous report showing that the 9th repeat alone cannot support α5β1-mediated cell attachment (18Mardon H.J. Grant K.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has also been shown previously that a peptide containing the PHSRN sequence is unable to inhibit α5β1-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin; however, when the same peptide was positioned via a covalent bond in the corresponding site of the normally inactive 8th type III repeat in a recombinant fragment containing the 8th and 10th repeats, adhesive activity was partially restored (5Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence it was proposed that the PHSRN sequence may need to be located a specific distance from the RGD sequence to be recognized by α5β1. Our data suggest an explanation for this observation, i.e. the recognition site for the PHSRN sequence on the α5 subunit is positioned a specific distance from the RGD recognition site on the β1 subunit. The synergistic activity of the PHSRN site can also be readily explained if it provides a second (weaker) site for integrin recognition. α5β1 recognizes fibronectin with high affinity but binds only poorly, or not at all, to other extracellular matrix proteins containing an RGD sequence. The interaction of α5β1 with the synergy region provides a mechanism for achieving higher affinity and higher fidelity binding that could be conferred by the RGD site alone. By analogy, the binding of an RGD/LDV site in an integrin ligand to the β subunit and the binding of a second (synergistic) sequence to the α subunit may constitute a widespread paradigm for generating specificity of integrin-ligand interactions.The x-ray crystal structure of a recombinant protein spanning type III repeats 7–10 of the CCBD revealed that the synergy sequence and the RGD site are located on the same face of the fibronectin molecule, separated by 3–4 nm (13Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Since the large globular head of an integrin (about 12 nm across) can easily span this distance, it is possible that an integrin could interact simultaneously with both sites. Based on the structure of the CCBD (13Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), the recognition site for the PHSRN sequence on the α5 subunit is probably positioned 3–4 nm away from the RGD binding site on the β1 subunit. The NH2-terminal repeats of integrin α subunits have recently been proposed to form a β-propeller structure in which the sequences implicated in ligand recognition are within loops on the upper surface of the propeller (27Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal portion of integrin β subunits has been proposed to contain a region with an A-domain-like fold (11Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,33Lee O.-J. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 34Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), with the ligand binding site on the top face of this domain. Since the synergy site and the RGD sequence lie on the same side of the fibronectin molecule, our results imply that the top surface of the α subunit β-propeller and the top face of the β subunit A-domain must be approximately coplanar in the ligand-occupied state of α5β1. This arrangement would also place sites involved in ligand binding and the epitopes of inhibitory mAbs near the α subunit/β subunit interface, as proposed in models of integrin activation (9Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Calvete J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,37Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Integrins are a large family of αβ heterodimeric receptors, many of which play critical roles in cell migration, differentiation, and survival. Integrins recognize a large variety of extracellular and cell surface proteins, and two widespread recognition motifs have been identified within these ligands: Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 2Newham P. Humphries M.J. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 304-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin contains a number of domains that mediate its interaction with integrins; the most studied of these domains lies near the center of the fibronectin subunit and is known as the central cell binding domain (CCBD). 1The abbreviations used are: CCBD, central cell binding domain of fibronectin; mAb(s), monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ABTS, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). 1The abbreviations used are: CCBD, central cell binding domain of fibronectin; mAb(s), monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ABTS, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). This region contains a number of homologous repeating polypeptide modules termed fibronectin type III repeats, each about 90 amino acid residues in length. An RGD sequence, located in the 10th type III repeat, is a key recognition site for several different integrins, including the prototypic fibronectin receptor α5β1. Synthetic peptides containing the RGD sequence completely block cell adhesion to the CCBD (3Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar, 4Yamada K.M. Kennedy D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, other data show that additional sequences outside the RGD region are sometimes required for full adhesive activity. In particular, a region of the 9th type III repeat which contains the sequence Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn (PHSRN) appears to synergize with RGD for recognition by α5β1 (5Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of this sequence with a corresponding sequence from the 8th type III repeat results in a major loss of adhesive activity (5Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of this region from the CCBD results in ∼20-fold loss in activity (6Aota S. Nagai T. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15938-15943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An overlapping, but distinct, sequence plays a similar role in αIIbβ3-fibronectin interactions (7Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mode of action of such synergy sequences is not currently understood. Recently, we described the effect of GRGDS peptide and a tryptic fragment of fibronectin containing the CCBD on the binding of the inhibitory monoclonal antibody (mAb) 13 to α5β1 (8Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our results showed that both GRGDS peptide and the CCBD fragment act as allosteric inhibitors of mAb 13 binding to α5β1. Our data indicated that mAb 13 recognizes an epitope that is strongly attenuated by ligand occupancy rather than a site directly involved in ligand recognition. We hypothesized that inhibitory mAbs recognize sites attenuated during the conformational adaptation of the integrin to ligand and have termed these ligand-attenuated binding sites (8Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although mAb 13 does not appear to recognize a sequence that interacts directly with ligand, its epitope lies very close to regions of the β1 subunit which have been shown to participate in ligand binding (10Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A region of the α5 subunit which plays an important role in fibronectin recognition has been identified by site-directed mutagenesis (12Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal portion of the α5 subunit comprises seven homologous repeats, each of ∼60 amino acid residues. Point mutations in a short hydrophobic sequence in the third NH2-terminal repeat block fibronectin binding. The epitope recognized by the inhibitory anti-α5 mAb 16 was found to lie near to this hydrophobic sequence (12Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). By analogy with our results for mAb 13, these findings suggested to us that fibronectin recognition by α5β1 may affect the binding of inhibitory anti-α5 mAbs and furthermore, that it might be possible to use inhibitory mAbs as probes to determine whether the α5 and β1 subunits recognize distinct regions of the CCBD. In this study we tested whether recognition of the CCBD by α5β1 perturbs the binding of inhibitory anti-α5 mAbs and if this perturbation is different from that observed for inhibitory anti-β1 mAbs. We show that the binding of the anti-α5 mAbs P1D6 and JBS5 to α5β1 is inhibited by fibronectin fragments containing both the RGD sequence and the synergy site but is not inhibited by GRGDS peptide or by fibronectin fragments lacking the synergy sequence. In contrast, the binding of the anti-β1 mAb P4C10 is inhibited by GRGDS peptide and fibronectin fragments containing the RGD sequence alone. We also present evidence that P1D6 blocks recognition of only the synergy site by α5β1. Taken together, our data suggest that the α5 subunit is largely responsible for recognition of the synergy site, whereas the RGD sequence appears to be recognized mainly by β1 subunit. Based on an x-ray crystal structure for the CCBD (13Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), these results allow us to predict a spatial topology for α5β1-fibronectin interactions. DISCUSSIONThe NH2-terminal portions of both integrin α and β subunits appear to cooperate in ligand recognition; however, it is not yet understood how this cooperativity arises, how specificity is generated, and whether the α and β subunits recognize the same or distinct sequences in the ligand. The prototypical interaction of α5β1 with the CCBD of fibronectin studied here allows us to begin to address these questions.The main findings of this report are as follows. (i) Binding of the anti-α5 mAbs P1D6 and JBS5 to α5β1 is strongly inhibited by CCBD fragments containing both synergy and RGD sequences, but not by GRGDS peptide or CCBD fragments containing only the RGD site. In contrast, binding of the anti-β1 mAb P4C10 to α5β1 is inhibited to a similar extent by GRGDS peptide, CCBD fragments containing both synergy and RGD sequences, or CCBD fragments containing only the RGD site. (ii) P1D6 inhibits the interaction of a wild type recombinant CCBD fragment with α5β1 but has no effect on the binding of a mutant CCBD fragment that lacks the synergy sequence. In contrast, the binding of both wild type and mutant fragments to α5β1 is inhibited by P4C10 (and by other anti-β1 mAbs). (iii) The epitopes of P1D6 and JBS5 lie in the NH2-terminal repeats of the α5 subunit. Taken together, our results indicate that the synergy region is recognized primarily by the α5 subunit (in particular by its NH2-terminal repeats) but that the β1 subunit plays the major role in binding of the RGD sequence.Although our data suggested that ligand acted mainly as an allosteric inhibitor of antibody binding, we believe that this should not be taken as evidence that these antibodies recognize epitopes that are spatially distant from the ligand binding sites. Inhibitory mAbs probably recognize sites proximal to the ligand binding domains because they lie in the same regions of the subunits implicated by other techniques (such as cross-linking and site-directed mutagenesis) as containing ligand binding sequences (9Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our epitope mapping results indicate that the epitopes of JBS5 and P1D6 include a putative β-turn sequence in the third NH2-terminal repeat of α5, a region that has previously been shown to pay a role in fibronectin recognition (12Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the concept that inhibitory mAb epitopes are at sites that are attenuated as a result of the conformational changes that take place in the integrin upon ligand recognition and that these changes take place close to the ligand binding sites. Furthermore, our results suggested that the inhibition of JBS5 binding to α5β1 by ligand was not purely allosteric but also involved a direct competition; hence the epitope recognized by this mAb appears to be partly overlapping with the ligand binding pocket.P1D6 only inhibited binding of the wild type CCBD fragment that contained both synergy sequence and RGD to α5β1 but had no effect on the binding of a mutant fragment lacking the synergy site but retaining the RGD sequence. These results imply that P1D6 only blocks recognition of the synergy sequence by α5β1. A similar conclusion was reached in a study examining the effect of P1D6 on epithelial cell adhesion to mutant fibronectin fragments (28Obara M. Yoshizato K. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, we found that the other anti-α5 mAb used in this study (JBS5) inhibited binding of both wild type and mutant CCBD fragments to α5β1. Since not all β1 integrins recognize RGD sequences, it is likely that the α5 subunit plays some role in RGD binding, and thus it is possible that the JBS5 epitope may be spatially close to a region of the α5 subunit involved in recognition of RGD. In agreement with this suggestion, mutations in the third NH2-terminal repeat of the αIIb subunit blocked binding of mAbs containing an RGD-type motif to αIIbβ3 (29Kamata T. Irie A. Tokuhira M. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18610-18615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Alternatively, as seen with the anti-β1 mAb 13 (8Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), JBS5 may induce a conformational change in α5β1 which precludes binding of the RGD sequence. All of the inhibitory anti-β1 mAbs tested blocked the binding of both wild type and mutant fragments, as would be predicted if they allosterically affect an RGD-binding region of the β1 subunit. Our proposal that the β1 subunit contains the main site involved in RGD recognition is consistent with studies examining the cross-linking of RGD-containing peptides to αIIbβ3 and αVβ3, which showed that the β3 subunit contained the major site of cross-linking (30D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Lam S.C.T. Plow E.F. Science. 1988; 242: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 31Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18726-18731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible RGD binding motif in integrin β subunits has recently been identified from a phage display library (32Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).Our observation that the 9th type III repeat appears unable to bind to α5β1 in the absence of the 10th type III repeat is consistent with a previous report showing that the 9th repeat alone cannot support α5β1-mediated cell attachment (18Mardon H.J. Grant K.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has also been shown previously that a peptide containing the PHSRN sequence is unable to inhibit α5β1-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin; however, when the same peptide was positioned via a covalent bond in the corresponding site of the normally inactive 8th type III repeat in a recombinant fragment containing the 8th and 10th repeats, adhesive activity was partially restored (5Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence it was proposed that the PHSRN sequence may need to be located a specific distance from the RGD sequence to be recognized by α5β1. Our data suggest an explanation for this observation, i.e. the recognition site for the PHSRN sequence on the α5 subunit is positioned a specific distance from the RGD recognition site on the β1 subunit. The synergistic activity of the PHSRN site can also be readily explained if it provides a second (weaker) site for integrin recognition. α5β1 recognizes fibronectin with high affinity but binds only poorly, or not at all, to other extracellular matrix proteins containing an RGD sequence. The interaction of α5β1 with the synergy region provides a mechanism for achieving higher affinity and higher fidelity binding that could be conferred by the RGD site alone. By analogy, the binding of an RGD/LDV site in an integrin ligand to the β subunit and the binding of a second (synergistic) sequence to the α subunit may constitute a widespread paradigm for generating specificity of integrin-ligand interactions.The x-ray crystal structure of a recombinant protein spanning type III repeats 7–10 of the CCBD revealed that the synergy sequence and the RGD site are located on the same face of the fibronectin molecule, separated by 3–4 nm (13Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Since the large globular head of an integrin (about 12 nm across) can easily span this distance, it is possible that an integrin could interact simultaneously with both sites. Based on the structure of the CCBD (13Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), the recognition site for the PHSRN sequence on the α5 subunit is probably positioned 3–4 nm away from the RGD binding site on the β1 subunit. The NH2-terminal repeats of integrin α subunits have recently been proposed to form a β-propeller structure in which the sequences implicated in ligand recognition are within loops on the upper surface of the propeller (27Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal portion of integrin β subunits has been proposed to contain a region with an A-domain-like fold (11Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol.

Since the synergy site and the RGD sequence lie on the same side of the fibronectin molecule, our results imply that the top surface of the α subunit β-propeller and the top face of the β subunit A-domain must be approximately coplanar in the ligand-occupied state of α5β1. This arrangement would also place sites involved in ligand binding and the epitopes of inhibitory mAbs near the α subunit/β subunit interface, as proposed in models of integrin activation (9Mould A.P.

In contrast, however, we found that the other anti-α5 mAb used in this study (JBS5) inhibited binding of both wild type and mutant CCBD fragments to α5β1. Since not all β1 integrins recognize RGD sequences, it is likely that the α5 subunit plays some role in RGD binding, and thus it is possible that the JBS5 epitope may be spatially close to a region of the α5 subunit involved in recognition of RGD. In agreement with this suggestion, mutations in the third NH2-terminal repeat of the αIIb subunit blocked binding of mAbs containing an RGD-type motif to αIIbβ3 (29Kamata T. Irie A. Tokuhira M. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18610-18615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Alternatively, as seen with the anti-β1 mAb 13 (8Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), JBS5 may induce a conformational change in α5β1 which precludes binding of the RGD sequence. All of the inhibitory anti-β1 mAbs tested blocked the binding of both wild type and mutant fragments, as would be predicted if they allosterically affect an RGD-binding region of the β1 subunit. Our proposal that the β1 subunit contains the main site involved in RGD recognition is consistent with studies examining the cross-linking of RGD-containing peptides to αIIbβ3 and αVβ3, which showed that the β3 subunit contained the major site of cross-linking (30D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Lam S.C.T. Plow E.F. Science. 1988; 242: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 31Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18726-18731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible RGD binding motif in integrin β subunits has recently been identified from a phage display library (32Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Our observation that the 9th type III repeat appears unable to bind to α5β1 in the absence of the 10th type III repeat is consistent with a previous report showing that the 9th repeat alone cannot support α5β1-mediated cell attachment (18Mardon H.J. Grant K.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has also been shown previously that a peptide containing the PHSRN sequence is unable to inhibit α5β1-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin; however, when the same peptide was positioned via a covalent bond in the corresponding site of the normally inactive 8th type III repeat in a recombinant fragment containing the 8th and 10th repeats, adhesive activity was partially restored (5Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence it was proposed that the PHSRN sequence may need to be located a specific distance from the RGD sequence to be recognized by α5β1. Our data suggest an explanation for this observation, i.e. the recognition site for the PHSRN sequence on the α5 subunit is positioned a specific distance from the RGD recognition site on the β1 subunit. The synergistic activity of the PHSRN site can also be readily explained if it provides a second (weaker) site for integrin recognition. α5β1 recognizes fibronectin with high affinity but binds only poorly, or not at all, to other extracellular matrix proteins containing an RGD sequence. The interaction of α5β1 with the synergy region provides a mechanism for achieving higher affinity and higher fidelity binding that could be conferred by the RGD site alone. By analogy, the binding of an RGD/LDV site in an integrin ligand to the β subunit and the binding of a second (synergistic) sequence to the α subunit may constitute a widespread paradigm for generating specificity of integrin-ligand interactions. The x-ray crystal structure of a recombinant protein spanning type III repeats 7–10 of the CCBD revealed that the synergy sequence and the RGD site are located on the same face of the fibronectin molecule, separated by 3–4 nm (13Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Since the large globular head of an integrin (about 12 nm across) can easily span this distance, it is possible that an integrin could interact simultaneously with both sites. Based on the structure of the CCBD (13Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), the recognition site for the PHSRN sequence on the α5 subunit is probably positioned 3–4 nm away from the RGD binding site on the β1 subunit. The NH2-terminal repeats of integrin α subunits have recently been proposed to form a β-propeller structure in which the sequences implicated in ligand recognition are within loops on the upper surface of the propeller (27Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal portion of integrin β subunits has been proposed to contain a region with an A-domain-like fold (11Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,33Lee O.-J. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), with the ligand binding site on the top face of this domain. Since the synergy site and the RGD sequence lie on the same side of the fibronectin molecule, our results imply that the top surface of the α subunit β-propeller and the top face of the β subunit A-domain must be approximately coplanar in the ligand-occupied state of α5β1. This arrangement would also place sites involved in ligand binding and the epitopes of inhibitory mAbs near the α subunit/β subunit interface, as proposed in models of integrin activation (9Mould A.P.

The underlying molecular mechanism, which is poorly understood, was studied in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Suspension of PMN in hypertonic media induced rapid cellular shrinkage and activation of NHE1, which is measurable as a cytosolic alkalinization.

Pretreatment of PMN with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, prevented not only the tyrosine phosphorylation in response to a hypertonic shock but also the activation of NHE1. The signal elicited by hyperosmolarity that induces activation of tyrosine kinases and NHE1 was investigated.

Increasing medium and intracellular osmolarity in normovolemic cells failed to activate tyrosine kinases or NHE1.

These findings imply that cells detect alterations in cell size but not changes in osmolarity or ionic strength. The identity of the proteins that were tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cell shrinkage was also investigated. Unexpectedly, the mitogen-activated protein kinases SAPK, p38, erk1, and erk2 were not detectably phosphorylated or activated. In contrast, the tyrosine kinases p59 fgr and p56/59 hck were phosphorylated and activated upon hypertonic challenge. We propose that cells respond to alterations in cell size, but not to changes in osmolarity, with increased tyrosine phosphorylation, which in turn leads to the activation of NHE1.

NHE1 is nearly quiescent in resting cells but becomes activated upon cytosolic acidification or by treatment of the cells with a variety of hormones and growth factors (see Ref. 1Noel J. Pouysségur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). Phosphorylation of the exchanger was suggested to induce its activation, since treatment with growth promoters was found to increase the phosphoserine content of NHE1 (2Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sardet C. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19166-19171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, increased phosphorylation and functional activation were also induced by inhibitors of Ser/Thr phosphatases, such as okadaic acid (3Sardet C. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19166-19171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NHE1 is also rapidly stimulated when cells are made to shrink in hypertonic solutions (4Grinstein S. Woodside M. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23823-23828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear whether increased osmolarity or reduced cell volume are the signals that trigger activation of the exchanger. The osmotic stimulation of Na+/H+exchange requires intracellular ATP and is not additive with that induced by growth factors (5Bianchini L. Woodside M. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Takai A. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15406-15413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that phosphorylation was also involved in the osmotic activation of NHE1. However, the phosphorylation state of the exchanger was found to be unaffected during osmotic challenge (4Grinstein S. Woodside M. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23823-23828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, osmotic stimulation could still be observed following truncation of all the putative phosphorylation sites of NHE1 (6Bianchini L. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Wasan S. Wakabayashi S. Pouysségur J. Yu F.H. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C998-C1007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism responsible for osmotically induced stimulation of the exchanger remains unclear. It is possible that phosphorylation of ancillary regulatory proteins is involved. In this context, calcineurin Bhomolog protein (CHP), a substrate of Ser/Thr kinases, was reported to bind to the cytosolic tail of the antiporter (7Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Also, a polypeptide of ≈24 kDa, the approximate size of CHP, is constitutively associated with NHE1 in several cell types (8Goss G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1493-C1502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Osmotic shrinkage of mammalian cells is a powerful stimulant of MAPK including the stress kinases p38 and SAPK (JNK) (9Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.-H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 10Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar) and in some instances Erk (11Itoh T. Yamauchi A. Miyai A. Yokoyama K. Kamada T. Ueda N. Fujiwara Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). MAPK have recently been invoked as possible regulators of the activity of NHE1 in platelets (12Aharonovitz O. Granot Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16494-16499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (13Bianchini L. L'Allemain G. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) treated with various agonists. The precise mechanism whereby shrinkage stimulates the kinases is unknown, as is their relationship to the osmotic stimulation of NHE1. In this report, we investigated the relationship between the stimulation of protein kinases and the activation of NHE1, and we attempted to determine whether reduced cell volume or increased cytosolic osmolarity were the signals leading to the activation of these effectors. To this end we used human blood neutrophils, which express NHE1 (14Fukushima T. Waddell T.K. Grinstein S. Goss G.G. Orlowski J. Downey G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1037-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and are known to respond vigorously to changes in medium osmolarity (15Grinstein S. Furuya W. Cragoe E.J. J.

Bicarbonate-free RPMI 1640 was buffered to pH 7.4 with 10 mm Hepes. Isotonic NaCl buffer contained (in mm) 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 140 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4. Isotonic KCl buffer contained 10 glucose, 145 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4. Hypertonic NaCl buffer contained 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 240 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4. Hypertonic KCl buffer was similar to hypertonic NaCl buffer, except that NaCl was replaced with KCl. Hypotonic NaCl buffer contained 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 50 NaCl 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4. Iso-osmotic sucrose buffer contained 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 280 sucrose, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4. Ca2+ and Mg2+ were omitted from all buffers that were used during permeabilization with nystatin. The iso-osmolar buffers were adjusted to 290 ± 5 mOsm with either water or the major salt. All buffers used for cell incubations were nominally HCO3−-free. Laemmli sample buffer (LSB) contained 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8. Nonidet P-40 buffer contained 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mmNaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Human PMN were isolated from fresh blood drawn by venipuncture into heparinized tubes. Isolation of cells was performed using dextran sedimentation and centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque cushions as described previously (16Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 and kept on a rotary shaker at room temperature until use. When immunoprecipitation was performed, PMN were pretreated with 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate for 30 min to minimize proteolysis. Cell volume and counts were assessed with a Coulter Counter (model ZM) equipped with a Channelyzer. Treatments were stopped by the addition of 2 volumes of ice-cold buffer of the corresponding osmolarity, and the PMN were rapidly sedimented in a microcentrifuge. For experiments where whole cell anti-phosphotyrosine blotting was performed, the cell pellet was resuspended in hot LSB and boiled for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, the cell pellet was dissolved in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm NaF) and kept on ice for at least 10 min. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (17Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes, and blotted with the appropriate antibody. Tyrosine kinase activity was assayed in vitro using enolase as the substrate, as described previously (18Brumell J.H. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). SAPK assays using GST-c-jun as a substrate were performed essentially as described (19Coso O.A.

Reaction products were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and incorporated 32P was quantified with a PhosphorImager equipped with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). PMN (107/ml) were incubated with 2 μm of the acetoxymethyl form of BCECF for 15 min at 37 °C, sedimented, and resuspended (at 2 × 107/ml) in the appropriate buffer. Where indicated, the cells were pretreated with nystatin (50 μg/ml) to increase the permeability of the plasmalemma to small monovalent ions (see “Results”). An aliquot of the cell suspension (106cells) was added to 1 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) buffer of the required osmolarity in the cuvette compartment of a spectrofluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer model 650-40). Measurements of BCECF emission and the calibration of fluorescence versus pHi were performed as described previously (20Grinstein S. Furuya W. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C272-C285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Data are presented as means ± S.E. or illustrated as representative traces or blots. Significance was assessed using Student's paired t test. A score ofp < 0.05 was considered significant. We tested the effect of hypertonic solutions on PMN volume, measured electronically, and pHi, estimated from the fluorescence of BCECF. Increasing the osmolarity of the medium from 290 to 475 mOsm by addition of 100 mm NaCl caused a rapid reduction of median cell volume from 327 ± 3 fl to 273 ± 2 fl (means ± S.E., n = 5, p < 0.01). 2Note that PMN shrink in response to osmolarity less than predicted for a perfect osmometer by the Van't Hoff relationship. This is due to the presence of a sizable osmotically unresponsive volume within the cells, likely the secretory granules and/or the nucleus. As shown in Fig.1 A, hypertonic stress also induced an alkalinization of the cytosol ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 pH units, which was evident at 30 s and stabilized within 5 min. As in other cells, this alkalinization was mediated by the NHE, since it was abolished by omission of external Na+ (not shown) or by addition of the specific inhibitor compound HOE694 (see below). Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is one of the earliest events in a variety of signaling cascades. We questioned whether tyrosine phosphorylation was also involved in signaling the osmotic activation of NHE1. To address this possibility, the content of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting in PMN subjected to hypertonic stress. Fig. 1 B shows that osmotic shrinkage was associated with a remarkable increase in the phosphotyrosine content of several proteins, which was clearly apparent at 30 s, attained maximum levels by 2 min, and persisted for up to 30 min. Polypeptides of ≈210, 125, 74, 60, 42, and 40 kDa were consistently tyrosine-phosphorylated in all of our experiments. We next investigated whether tyrosine phosphorylation was a consequence or the cause of NHE1 activation. To determine if activation of Na+/H+ exchange was required for induction of tyrosine phosphorylation, PMN were pretreated with 2 μmHOE694, a concentration predicted to produce almost complete inhibition of NHE1 (21Counillon L. Scholz W. Lang H.J. Pouysségur J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1041-1045PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to a hypertonic shock. As shown in Fig.2, while the inhibitor largely eliminated the cytosolic alkalinization, the accumulation of phosphotyrosine induced by hyperosmolarity was unaffected. A comparable degree of tyrosine phosphorylation was also obtained in cells suspended in a hypertonic KCl (Na+-free) medium. The absence of Na+, the external substrate for NHE, precluded cytosolic alkalinization (results not shown). These experiments imply that stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation by hyperosmolar solutions is not a consequence of activation of NHE1.Figure 2Effect of NHE1 inhibition on tyrosine phosphorylation in response to a hypertonic shock. A,BCECF-loaded PMN were suspended in isotonic NaCl medium in the presence or absence of 2 μm HOE694, and pHi was monitored fluorimetrically, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Where indicated by the arrow the medium was made hypertonic by addition of an extra 100 mm NaCl.B, PMN in isotonic NaCl medium was pretreated with or without 2 μm HOE694 for 5 min and then stimulated with hypertonic NaCl (100 mm) for 5 min. Samples were collected before (ctrl, HOE694) or after addition of NaCl (NaCl, NaCl+HOE694), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting as in Fig. 1. Results in A and Bare representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We therefore considered whether tyrosine phosphorylation was instead the cause of NHE1 activation. Cells were pretreated with 100 μm genistein, a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and subjected to hypertonicity. Under these conditions, both the cytosolic alkalinization (Fig. 3 A) and tyrosine phosphorylation were inhibited (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained by pretreating PMN with 10 μg/ml erbstatin analog, a structurally unrelated tyrosine kinase inhibitor (not shown). These findings suggest that phosphotyrosine accumulation is required for the hypertonic activation of NHE1. We next investigated the signal that triggers phosphotyrosine accumulation in cells exposed to hypertonic media. In principle, the response could be initiated by osmosensors that detect the change in medium or intracellular tonicity. Alternatively, the signal for phosphorylation could be the cellular shrinkage that results from the net loss of cytosolic water. The experiments described below were designed to discern between these alternative models. Fig. 4 A illustrates the protocol used to increase the intracellular osmolarity while keeping the cellular volume constant. PMN were suspended in isotonic KCl medium and treated with 50 μg/ml nystatin, a pore-forming molecule that allows the passage of small monovalent ions across the plasma membrane (22Cass A. Dalmark M. Nature. 1973; 244: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Sucrose (50 mm), which cannot permeate through nystatin, was added to the medium to prevent swelling due to the presence of impermeant osmolytes within the cells (20Grinstein S. Furuya W. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C272-C285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 9 min, the time required for adequate permeabilization, an additional 125 mm KCl was introduced to render both the extracellular and intracellular solutions hyperosmotic. Because both K+ and Cl− permeate readily through nystatin, cell shrinkage is minimal (step III in Fig. 4 A). Cells were then washed at 37 °C to remove extracellular as well as membrane-associated nystatin, resulting in rapid and effective resealing of the membrane, and the hypertonic KCl was replaced with hypertonic NaCl (step IV). Sizing with the Coulter-Channelyzer confirmed that, following nystatin treatment in the hypertonic buffer, the volume of the cells was similar to that of untreated PMN in isotonic solution (cf. columns I andIV in Fig. 4 B). This contrasts with the shrinkage noted when cells were suspended in hypertonic NaCl or KCl in the absence of nystatin 2Note that PMN shrink in response to osmolarity less than predicted for a perfect osmometer by the Van't Hoff relationship. This is due to the presence of a sizable osmotically unresponsive volume within the cells, likely the secretory granules and/or the nucleus. (II in Fig.4, A and B). Fig. 4 C confirms that cell shrinkage induced by the hypertonic media (in the absence of nystatin) stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins, regardless of the solute used (lanes labeled II in Fig.4 C). By contrast, exposure to hyperosmotic solutions under conditions where shrinkage was prevented (i.e. in nystatin-treated cells) resulted in a substantially lower level of tyrosine phosphorylation (cf. lane IV). It is noteworthy that the residual increase in phosphorylation may have been caused by a transient shrinkage of the cells that likely occurred when the osmolarity of the medium was raised. Despite the presence of nystatin, some efflux of water from the cells may have preceded entry and equilibration of hyperosmotic KCl into the cells. We also used a second approach to assess the effect of increasing the osmolarity on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of significant cell volume changes. For these experiments osmolarity was increased adding 200 mm urea, a rapidly permeating solute, to cells suspended in isotonic NaCl buffer. Fig.5 A illustrates the protocol used. The addition of urea did not alter the steady state volume of the cells (measured after 5 min; II in Fig. 5), which contrasts with the sustained shrinkage induced by an equimolar concentration of sucrose (IV in Fig. 5, A and B) or 100 mm NaCl (e.g. Fig. 4). In parallel experiments, tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed in cells exposed to hyperosmotic urea and was found to be similar to that of cells maintained in isotonic NaCl medium throughout (Fig. 5 C). That urea did not exert an inhibitory effect on tyrosine phosphorylation was tested by treating cells with either 200 mm sucrose or 100 mm NaCl in the presence (III in Fig.5 A) or absence (IV in Fig. 5 A) of urea. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the impermeant osmolytes induced shrinkage both in the presence and absence of urea. More importantly, both sucrose (cf. lanes 3 and 4 in Fig.5 C) and NaCl (cf. lanes 5 and 6) activated tyrosine phosphorylation to comparable degrees whether urea was present or not. These results suggest that urea does notper se prevent phosphotyrosine accumulation and that an increase in the osmolarity of the medium and/or the intracellular space is not sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PMN proteins. In the next series of experiments, we analyzed the contribution of cell volume changes to the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation. To this end, we attempted to induce cell shrinkage while maintaining iso-osmolar conditions. Fig. 6 A illustrates the first method used; PMN were resuspended in an ice-cold iso-osmotic sucrose medium and permeabilized with nystatin for 10 min. While the extracellular sucrose is unable to diffuse through the nystatin pores, intracellular KCl readily diffuses out of the cells (II in Fig. 6 A). The net efflux of KCl is accompanied by osmotically obliged water, thus causing a reduction in cell volume (cf. I and III in Fig. 6, A andB). Interestingly, the resulting shrinkage of nystatin-permeabilized PMN in the isotonic sucrose buffer caused a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 6 C, lane 4), which was in fact greater than that caused by hypertonic NaCl buffer (cf. lane 5). The effect of sucrose was not due to the reduction in ionic strength, since in the absence of nystatin tyrosine phosphorylation was not stimulated. As expected, cell volume was unaffected under these conditions (Fig. 6 B). Moreover, the stimulation of phosphorylation was not due to nystatin itself, because cells treated with the pore former under conditions intended to keep cell volume constant (125 mm NaCl plus 50 mm sucrose; see Fig. 6 B) did not show increased phosphorylation. It is also noteworthy that treatment with nystatin in isotonic NaCl buffer, which induced cell swelling (Fig. 6 B), decreased tyrosine phosphorylation below the level noted in untreated (isotonic) cells (Fig. 6 C, cf. lanes 1 and2). A second method used to dissociate the effects of cell shrinkage and hypertonicity is illustrated in Fig. 7 A. PMN were suspended in hypotonic NaCl buffer (≈50% of the normal osmolarity), thereby causing the cells to swell (II in Fig.7, A and B). This initial passive swelling was followed by a gradual loss of volume, reaching near normal size after approximately 30 min (III in Fig. 7, A andB). This secondary volume loss, known as regulatory volume decrease, is thought to be mediated by increased permeability to K+ and anions (23Strange K. Emma F. Jackson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C711-C730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent addition of 90 mm NaCl to the medium, which restored the osmolarity to the initial (iso-osmotic, 290 mOsm) level, caused the cells to shrink (IV in Fig. 7). Such shrinkage under iso-osmotic conditions was accompanied by a marked phosphotyrosine accumulation, usually exceeding that induced by comparable hypertonic shrinkage (Fig.7 C). The combined results of Figs. 6 and 7 demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation can be promoted in PMN by reducing the volume of the cells, regardless of the osmolarity of the medium or cytosol. The preceding data indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation was triggered by a reduction of the cell volume and not by hypertonicityper se. It was therefore of interest to define whether cell volume, as opposed to medium osmolarity, is responsible for activation of NHE1. Protocols like those employed above were used to differentially alter cell volume and osmolarity while measuring pHi to evaluate the state of activation of NHE1. Fig.8 shows that a significant cytosolic alkalinization, comparable to that observed during hypertonic stress, was caused by reducing cell volume isotonically using nystatin/sucrose, or by restoring iso-osmolarity after regulatory volume decrease. Conversely, increasing osmolarity while keeping the volume constant, using either nystatin/KCl or urea, failed to activate the antiporter. This pattern correlates closely with that of tyrosine phosphorylation and is consistent with the notion that NHE1 activation lies downstream of phosphotyrosine accumulation. Because the activation of NHE1 appears to be dependent on phosphotyrosine accumulation, we tried to identify some of the proteins that become tyrosine-phosphorylated when PMN shrink. The stimulation of NHE1 by growth factors has recently been reported to be partially dependent on the erk1 and erk2 MAPK (p42/44 MAPK ) pathway (13Bianchini L. L'Allemain G. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is well established that kinases of the MAPK family require phosphorylation on tyrosine residues to become active (24Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Since hypertonic stress has been shown to induce the activation of erk1 and erk2 in other cell types (11Itoh T. Yamauchi A. Miyai A. Yokoyama K. Kamada T. Ueda N. Fujiwara Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13Bianchini L. L'Allemain G. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we investigated whether these MAPK are the 40–42-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins observed in shrunken PMN. Cells were subjected to hypertonic stress for up to 30 min, and whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of erk1 anderk2. Fig. 9 A shows that neithererk1 nor erk2 were tyrosine-phosphorylated in PMN in response to hypertonic stress. The sensitivity of the phospho-specific antibody and the responsiveness of the cells were assessed by stimulation with 100 nm fMLP, a well documented activator of erk1 and erk2 in PMN (25Grinstein S. Furuya W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18122-18125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Torres M. Hall F.L. O'Neill K. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1563-1578PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9, comparable amounts of cell lysate revealed sizable amounts of phosphorylated erk1 and erk2 after treatment with the chemoattractant. We conclude that erk1and erk2 are not phosphorylated during hypertonic challenge and are therefore unlikely to mediate the activation of NHE1. Another member of the MAPK family, p38, has been shown to be activated by hypertonic stress in other cells (10Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar) and was recently detected in fMLP-stimulate"

The pCWori plasmid was used to overexpress the nNOSoxy (amino acids 1–723 with a six-histidine tag incorporated at the C terminus) in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The procedure to incorporate nNOSoxy cDNA into the pCWori plasmid was similar to that reported by McMillan and Masters (9McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). PCR was used to amplify the nNOSoxy DNA (corresponding to amino acids 1–720 with an incorporated hexahistidine tag at the C terminus), using as a template a pCIS-2 construct of full-length nNOS. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-ATATTGACCATATGGAAGAGAACACGTTTGGG as the forward primer (to create anNdeI site), and 5′-ATATTGACGTCGACTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTTGGTGCCCTTCCACACG as the backward primer (to create the hexahistidine tag and a stop codon followed by an SalI site). PCR was done using the Expand Long Template system from Boehringer Mannheim. A typical 50-μl mixture included 350 μm dNTPs, 100 pmol of each primer, 10 ng of nNOS template, PCR buffer containing 1.75 mmMgCl2, and 2.5 units of enzyme mix containingTaq and Pwo DNA polymerases. The PCR product was restricted with NdeI and SalI and ligated into a similarly restricted pCWori plasmid. The product was transformed to competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and transformants were selected on LB plates containing 125 mg/L ampicillin. The sequence of the final construct was checked at the DNA core facility of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. One liter of Terrific Broth (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 4 ml of glycerol and 125 mg of ampicillin was inoculated with a 50-ml overnight culture of the bacteria containing the plasmid for expression of nNOSoxy and grown at 37 °C at 250 rpm up to anA 600 of 1. Protein expression was then induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside along with 0.4 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid, and the culture was grown at 25 °C for 2 days. Cells were harvested and suspended in the buffer A (40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.25 mNaCl) containing protease inhibitors and 1 mg/ml lysozyme, lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing, and sonicated (three times at 30 s each with a 1-min rest on ice between the pulses). Cell-free supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C was applied to a column containing Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (10 ml) equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 mm PMSF. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A containing 1 mm PMSF and then eluted with buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole and 1 mm PMSF, and 1.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing nNOSoxy were pooled and concentrated using a Centriprep-30. The protein was dialyzed against buffer A without NaCl and containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The purity of the protein was estimated to be 90% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The hemeprotein concentration was estimated based on the absorbance at 444 nm for the ferrous-CO complex, using an extinction coefficient 76 mm−1 cm−1 (21Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nNOSoxy samples were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 40 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol alone or plus 4 μm H4B, plus 3 mml-arginine, or plus H4B andl-arginine. l-Arginine and H4B saturation of nNOSoxy samples was confirmed spectroscopically (35Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The protein solutions were made anaerobic by repeated cycles of evacuation and equilibration with catalyst-deoxygenated N2 before use in stopped-flow experiments. Solutions of 40 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.4, containing various concentrations of O2 were prepared by mixing different volumes of O2-saturated buffer with air-saturated or anaerobic buffer solutions. Saturation was achieved by bubbling O2 for 2 h in a septum-sealed flask at 21 °C. Final O2 concentrations were calculated based on a saturating O2 concentration of 1.2 mm at 21 °C. Anaerobic spectra of ferrous nNOSoxy were recorded at 15 °C in septum-sealed quartz cuvettes that could be attached through a ground-glass joint to a vacuum gas train. Measurements were obtained using a stopped-flow apparatus from Hi-tech Ltd. (model SF-51) equipped for anaerobic work. Measurements were carried out at 10 °C and initiated by mixing anaerobic solutions of 5 μm nNOSoxy that had been pre-reduced with excess dithionite (40 μm) with an equal volume of buffer containing O2 at different concentrations. Formation and decay of the oxygenated nNOSoxy complex were monitored at 410 nm, 405 nm, or at other wavelengths as indicated in the text. In some experiments, the stopped-flow instrument was equipped with a rapid-scanning detector (Hi-Tech, MG-3000) designed to collect a complete spectrum (200–800 nm) within 90 ms. The detector was calibrated relative to four principal peak absorption wavelengths of a didymium filter (BG 20) at 236, 358, 584, and 738 nm. Rapid scanning involved mixing anaerobic solutions containing 6 μm dithionite-reduced nNOSoxy, 2 mml-arginine, and 10 μm H4B with air-saturated buffer at 6 °C. In all cases, 10–20 successive scans were recorded to generate an average. The time course of oxygenated complex formation and decay were fit to Equations 1 and 2 by use of a nonlinear least-squares method provided by the instrument manufacturer, where Y=Ae−k1t+CEquation 1 Y=Ae−k1t+Be−k2t+CEquation 2 k 1 and k 2 are first-order rate constants, t is time, A andB are amplitude factors, e is 2.718, andC is a constant. Equation 1 describes a process that takes place via single exponential decay, while Equation 2 represents the sum of two independent exponentials for a parallel process. Rapid mixing a solution of ferrous nNOSoxy containingl-arginine and H4B with an equal volume of air-saturated buffer resulted in formation of a transient species whose spectrum was characterized by absorbance peaks at 427 and ∼560 nm (Fig. 1, upper panel). This spectrum differs from that of either ferric or ferrous nNOS, whose Soret maxima are centered at 400 nm or 414 nm, respectively (Fig. 1, lower panel), but is similar to that of FeIIO2cytochrome P-450s, whose Soret maxima range from 418 to 423 nm (36Oprian D.D.

A similar species was observed when reacting ferrous nNOSoxy with O2 in the absence of l-arginine and H4B, indicating that these molecules are not required for generating the transient species. The nNOSoxy intermediate formed within 7 ms after mixing at 10 °C, but was unstable and converted to its ferric form within 1 s as judged by a time-dependent shift in Soret absorbance from 427 to 400 nm (Fig. 1, upper panel). Thus, formation of the nNOSoxy intermediate and its subsequent autooxidation occur at sufficiently different rates to enable each process to be studied by conventional stopped-flow methods.Figure 1Formation of the ferrous nNOSoxy-dioxygen complex. The upper panel shows the rapid scanning spectra for the intermediate and final products formed by reacting ferrous nNOSoxy with air-saturated buffer in the presence of saturatingl-arginine and H4B. The first spectrum (dashed line, Fe2+O2) was collected within 7 ms of initiating the reaction while the second spectrum (solid line, Fe3+) was collected 25 s after mixing. Intermediate spectra were omitted for clarity. The lower panel shows the absorbance spectra of the nNOSoxy ferric (solid line, Fe3+) and deoxyferrous (dotted line, Fe2+) forms in the presence of saturating H4B and l-arginine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate more closely the formation and decay of the oxygenated intermediate, we monitored absorbance change at various single wavelengths. Traces obtained at 410 or 440 nm are shown in Fig.2. Changes in absorbance versus time were biphasic at both wavelengths. For the reaction monitored at 410 nm (upper panel), there was a rapid initial absorbance decrease followed by a slower increase in absorbance. When the reaction was monitored at 440 nm (lower panel), the direction of absorbance change was reversed but otherwise proceeded with identical kinetics. At either wavelength, the absorbance observed at the start of the reaction can be attributed to ferrous nNOSoxy, while the absorbance at the inflection and end points can be attributed to sequential formation of the transient intermediate and ferric nNOSoxy, respectively. We thus monitored the reaction at a range of single wavelengths and plotted the maximum absorbance obtained for each of the three species as a function of wavelength. As shown in Fig.3, the spectra so derived match the rapid scanning spectra reported in Fig. 1 and are consistent with the sequential nature of the proposed reaction. Fitting each stopped-flow trace obtained at single wavelengths to a two-exponential function showed that there was no variation in the observed rate constants for formation or autooxidation. This indicates that the transient intermediate and ferric nNOSoxy are the only two observable products of the reaction. We next examined the formation and decay of the transient species as a function of O2 concentration by monitoring absorbance change at 410 nm. The pseudo-first order rate constants obtained for its formation in the presence of saturating l-arginine and H4B are plotted as a function of O2concentration in panel A of Fig. 4. The association and dissociation rate constants derived from the graph are listed in Table I along with rate constants obtained under similar conditions for nNOSoxy samples saturated either withl-arginine or H4B alone or in the absence of both molecules.Table IRate constants for formation and decay of the oxygenated nNOSoxy complexConditionsk onk offDecaym −1 s −1s −1−l-Arginine − H4B1.4 × 1061770.12, 2.3+l-Arginine − H4B1.1 × 106650.14−l-Arginine + H4B7.8 × 10513010+l-Arginine + H4B9.0 × 10510810Ferrous nNOSoxy in the presence or absence of l-arginine and/or H4B was rapid-mixed with buffer containing O2 at various concentrations.

Open table in a new tab Ferrous nNOSoxy in the presence or absence of l-arginine and/or H4B was rapid-mixed with buffer containing O2 at various concentrations. Rates of complex formation and decay were determined by following absorbance change at 410 nm, and the rate constants determined as described in the text. As shown in panel B of Fig. 4, the decay rate of the transient species did not change with O2 concentration, indicating decay is independent of dissolved O2. The autooxidation rate for the H4B- andl-arginine-saturated protein was best fit to a single exponential function and was therefore monophasic, giving a rate of 10 s−1 (Table I). An identical monophasic decay rate was also observed with nNOSoxy that was saturated with H4B alone (Table I). However, decay of the transient species in nNOSoxy samples devoid of both l-arginine and H4B was biphasic, giving rate constants of 2.3 s−1 and 0.12 s−1(Table I). Again, these decay rates did not change as a function of O2 concentration (data not shown). With an nNOS sample saturated with l-arginine alone, only the slow decay rate was observed (Table I). These data provide the first direct evidence for O2binding to the NOS heme iron, consistent with its proposed role in oxygen activation during NO synthesis (5Marletta M.A. J. Biol.

Mixing an O2-containing solution with ferrous nNOSoxy resulted in rapid formation of a transient intermediate whose spectral and kinetic characteristics were quite similar to the FeIIO2 complexes of a number of cytochrome P-450s (36Oprian D.D.

Although its Soret maxima (427 nm) is somewhat red-shifted compared with most FeIIO2 cytochrome P-450s which absorb maximally at 418–420 nm (36Oprian D.D. Gorsky L.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol.

Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9309-9314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectral features of FeIIO2 nNOSoxy did not change noticeably in the absence of bound substrate (l-arginine) or H4B (data not shown), consistent with bound substrate also not altering the visible spectra of the ferrous-CO or -NO complexes of nNOS (19McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 23Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In air-saturated solution, formation of the nNOSoxy FeIIO2 complex occurred at a rates that were 40–4000 times faster than complex decay. Under such circumstances, practically all of the nNOSoxy sample exists in its FeIIO2 form prior to decay. 3This enabled us to estimate an extinction coefficient for the nNOSoxy FeIIO2 complex (64.1 mm−1 cm−1 at 427 nm), which is lower than the estimated extinction coefficients of ferric or ferrous nNOSoxy (76 and 69.1 mm−1cm−1 at 400 and 414 nm, respectively). Rates of complex formation and decay were invariant as a function of wavelength and both processes generated spectral isosbestic points. This indicates that complex formation and decay occur without formation of other observable intermediates, which is also the case for most cytochrome P450s examined to date (36Oprian D.D. Gorsky L.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8684-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Peterson J.A. Ishimura Y. Griffin B.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Formation of FeIIO2nNOSoxy was first order with respect to O2, reversible, and followed a simple one-step mechanism. Decay of the complex was independent of O2 concentration, occurred via a one- or two-exponential process depending on sample conditions, and generated ferric nNOSoxy as a product. A model consistent with the data is shown in Scheme 1. Mechanisms proposed for the autooxidation of FeIIO2 hemeproteins generally involve electron transfer to O2 as a primary step to form superoxide, which undergoes further irreversible reactions (45Momenteau M. Reed C.A. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 659-698Crossref Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 46Sligar S.G. Lipscomb J.D. Debrunner P.G. Gunsalus I.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 61: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Indeed, uncoupled NADPH oxidation by nNOS is reported to generate superoxide as a primary product (31Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because cytochrome P-450s can also generate H2O2 or water as primary products of uncoupled oxidation (36Oprian D.D. Gorsky L.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8684-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Loida P.J. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11530-11538Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 48Gorsky L.D. Koop D.R. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6812-6817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that nNOS may form these products under favorable conditions. nNOS(FeII)+O2kon⇔koffnNOS(FeIIO2)→decaynNOS(FeIII)+O·̄2 SCHEME 1Dioxygen binding to ferrous nNOSoxy was fast enough to be kinetically competent regarding NO synthesis (5Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the second order rate constants were comparable to that published for ferrous cytochrome P-450CAM (40Peterson J.A. Ishimura Y. Griffin B.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, estimated rate constants for O2 dissociation from ferrous nNOSoxy were one to two orders of magnitude greater than that published for P-450CAM (40Peterson J.A. Ishimura Y. Griffin B.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The reason for this difference is unclear.l-arginine or H4B did not significantly influence O2 binding and dissociation rates, suggesting that the O2 interaction is not greatly influenced by bound substrate or pterin. This differs from CO, whose rebinding to the nNOS heme is decreased 12-fold in the presence of boundl-arginine (34Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate this difference may arise from steric constraints in the distal pocket brought on by substrate and pterin that appear to force a bent FeII-ligand geometry (22Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22255-22258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) instead of the linear geometry particularly favored by ferrous-CO complexes. In the absence of l-arginine and H4B, the autooxidation of FeIIO2 nNOSoxy was biphasic, giving rate constants of 0.12 and 2.3 s−1. Only the slow decay rate was observed in the presence of l-arginine, implying that bound substrate stabilizes FeIIO2nNOSoxy. Biphasic decay in the absence of substrate and/or stabilization in its presence have also been reported for some FeIIO2 cytochrome P-450s (36Oprian D.D. Gorsky L.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8684-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Tuckey R.C. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9309-9314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Bonfils C. Debey P. Maurel P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 88: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, even in its most stable form (i.e. l-arginine-bound) the FeIIO2nNOSoxy complex still decays 2 or 100 times faster than the substrate-bound FeIIO2 complexes of cytochrome P-450SCC (41Tuckey R.C. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9309-9314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and P-450CAM (40Peterson J.A. Ishimura Y. Griffin B.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), respectively. Remarkably, bound H4B accelerated the decay of FeIIO2 nNOS by a factor of 70 even in the presence of bound l-arginine. The apparent ability of H4B to destabilize an oxy-iron complex is unprecedented and represents a new role for pterins in biology. The impact of this finding on NOS catalysis is not yet clear. However, it is pertinent to discuss with regard to oxygen activation during NO synthesis, which is thought to proceed as in the cytochrome P-450s (reviewed in Ref. 49Guengerich F.P. Macdonald T.L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2453-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) (Scheme 2). Heme FeIII→O2e− heme FeIIO2I→e− heme FeIIO·̄2II→−H2OH+ heme(FeIVO)III SCHEME 2Initial reduction of the ferric heme iron enables formation of the FeIIO2 species (I). Transfer of a second electron is thought to generate an iron-peroxy intermediate (II) that loses water and forms a high valence oxo-iron species (III) that can carry out substrate hydroxylation. In NOS, the FeIIO2 species (I) has been proposed to play a different role in each step of catalysis (5Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the first step (N-hydroxylation of l-arginine) it may function solely as an intermediate on the path to the oxo-iron species (III) that is thought to hydroxylatel-arginine. However, in the second step (conversion of theN-hydroxyarginine intermediate to NO and citrulline) the FeIIO2 species (I) may instead act as an oxidant that removes an electron or hydrogen atom from boundN-hydroxyarginine. 4An investigation of nNOS catalysis under single turnover conditions shows that the FeIIO2species can catalyze the second step of NO synthesis, consistent with its acting as an oxidant in this step (H. M. Abu-Soud, P. A. Presta, B., Mayer, and D. J. Stuehr, unpublished results). Thus, productive oxygen activation in both steps of NO synthesis may require that a second electron be provided to the FeIIO2 complex. When viewed this way, destabilization of the FeIIO2 complex by H4B seems counterproductive, because it would favor a decomposition reaction that yields ferric nNOS and superoxide instead of further reductive steps that lead to NO synthesis. However, the fact that NO synthesis by nNOS is tightly coupled to NADPH oxidation in the presence of saturating H4B (5Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that decay of the FeIIO2 species under normal reaction conditions is slower than the additional reductive steps required to activate oxygen for productive catalysis. Recent work with H4B-free forms of nNOS (27Gorren A.C.F. List B.M. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and inducible NOS 5P. A. Presta, U. Siddhanta, and D. J. Stuehr, unpublished results. shows that they can catalyze NADPH-dependent, heme iron-based O2 consumption in the presence of bound l-arginine without catalyzing NO synthesis. This implies that formation of oxygenated iron species within the active site can occur in the absence of H4B but is itself not sufficient to support NO synthesis. Thus, we speculate that H4B destabilization of the nNOSoxy FeIIO2 complex as described here may actually reflect a more global influence of H4B on the reactivity of all nNOS iron-oxy species that somehow enables oxygen activation at the heme to become coupled to NO synthesis. Our current findings provide a foundation to explore this hypothesis. We thank Pam Clark, Jingli Zhang, Bryant Miles, and Suk-Bong Hong for excellent technical assistance."

In addition, a role for c-Abl in the stress response to DNA damage is indicated by the observations that it is activated by ionizing radiation and alkylating agents, and that c-Abl-deficient cells fail to activate the stress-activated protein kinase pathway in response to these agents (10Kharbanda S.

Arg, in contrast to c-Abl, is detected exclusively in the cytoplasm when examined by indirect immunofluorescence (12Wang B. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 193-197PubMed Google Scholar), and does not appear to have a nuclear function. In addition to nuclear functions, increasing evidence suggests that c-Abl and Abl oncoproteins may influence the actin cytoskeleton. Cytoplasmic c-Abl, and the Bcr-Abl and v-Abl oncoproteins, which are exclusively located in the cytoplasm, have been reported to be localized in actin cytoskeletal structures. c-Abl and Bcr-Abl are localized in stress fibers (3Van Etten R.A.

Pisick E. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1149-1155PubMed Google Scholar). v-Abl has also been detected in focal adhesions (16Rohrschneider L.R. Najita L.M. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 547-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences that mediate the association of c-Abl and Bcr-Abl with F-actin have been mapped to the distal COOH-terminal domain of c-Abl (13McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Van Etten R.A. Jackson P.K. Baltimore D. Sanders M.C. Matsudaira P.T. Janmey P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). While Arg is located in the cytoplasm, it is not detected in stress fibers (12Wang B. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 193-197PubMed Google Scholar). However, the proposed Abl F-actin binding sequences are conserved in the Arg COOH-terminal domain, suggesting the possibility that it may also associate with actin under certain conditions. In addition to subcellular localization studies, a role for Abl family kinases in actin cytoskeletal events has also been suggested by reports describing potential interactions between Abl and proteins that are associated with cytoskeletal signaling cascades. One potential association is p130 cas, an SH3-containing protein that was originally isolated as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in v-Crk-transformed cells (17Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N.

The observation that p130 cas has numerous predicted phosphorylation sites for the Abl kinase (17Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and is an in vitro substrate of Abl (22Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and that the v-Crk adapter protein associates with Arg and c-Abl (23Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa J. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1379-1385PubMed Google Scholar, 24Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 25Ren R. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), suggest the possibility that Abl family kinases may function as v-Crk effectors that phosphorylate p130 cas . A more direct link between Abl family kinases and the actin cytoskeleton has been established for Hef1, another SH3-containing protein (26Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Hef1 is structurally related to p130 cas, and its function in cytoskeletal signaling is indicated by its interaction with FAK, the induction of pseudohyphal outgrowth in yeast, and its localization in adhesion plaques. Hef1 associates with v-Abl in cells and is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in v-Abl-transformed fibroblasts. Other potential associations between Abl kinases and components of the actin cytoskeleton include the focal adhesion proteins FAK, paxillin, vinculin, talin, and tensin, which have been reported to be constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in Bcr-Abl-transformed myeloid cells (15Salgia R. Brunkhorst B. Pisick E. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1149-1155PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, 3BP-1, a protein isolated using the Abl SH3 domain as a probe (27Cicchetti P. Mayer B.J. Thiel G. Baltimore D. Science. 1992; 257: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), has been shown to have GTPase-activating protein activity for Rac-related small GTP-binding proteins that are involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton (28Cicchetti P. Ridley A.J. Zheng Y. Cerione R.A. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3127-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although these observations support the idea that c-Abl has a role in signaling to the actin cytoskeleton, none of the previously implicated proteins have been demonstrated to be both localized in stress fibers and to directly association with c-Abl. This suggests that Abl family kinases may associate with as yet unidentified cytoskeletal proteins. In the present study we describe ArgBP2, the secondArg-binding protein that we isolated using a segment of the Arg COOH-terminal domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. ArgBP2 contains three COOH-terminal SH3 domains, several potential phosphorylation sites for c-Abl, and a serine/threonine-rich region. We show that ArgBP2 associates with Arg and v-Abl in living cells and that the endogenous ArgBP2 protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in v-Abl-transformed NIH3T3 cells. ArgBP2 is widely expressed in human tissues and extremely abundant in heart. In epithelial cells ArgBP2 is located in stress fibers and the nucleus, similar to the reported localization of c-Abl. In cardiac muscle cells ArgBP2 is localized in the Z-disks of sarcomeres. Thus, this study suggests that ArgBP2 functions as an adapter protein to assemble signaling complexes in stress fibers, and that ArgBP2 is a potential link between Abl family kinases and the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, ArgBP2 is the first known component of the Z-disk that associates with signaling cascades. The localization of ArgBP2 in Z-disks thus suggests that ArgBP2 may function to influence the contractile or elastic properties of cardiac sarcomeres, and that the Z-disk may be target of signal transduction cascades. COS and PtK2 cells (a gift of Joseph W. Sanger, University of Pennsylvania) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Native and v-Abl-transformed NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. Sf9 cells (PharMingen) were grown in Grace's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 33 mg/ml yeastolate, and 33 mg/ml lactalbumin hydroxylate (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 27 °C. Cardiomyocytes were obtained from 7-day-old chicken embryos and grown on glass coverslips in serum-free M199 medium for 2 days prior to analysis by indirect immunofluorescence. ArgBP2 polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with the first SH3 domain of the protein expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein, and prepared using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The polyclonal Arg antibody 0.7CT has been described previously (29Perego R. Ron D. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1899-1902PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories, and anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The bait plasmid used in the two-hybrid screen, pNLex-ArgSH3BR, has been described previously (30Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Krainc D. Jensen R.A. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1921-1929PubMed Google Scholar). CB6+-ArgBP2A and CB6+-ArgBP2B were prepared by inserting the respective coding sequences, whose 5′-untranslated sequence had been modified by truncation and altered such that the sequence immediately upstream of the initiation ATG conformed to a Kozak consensus sequence, into the EcoRI andBamHI sites of the cytomegalovirus promoter-based expression vector CB6+ (a gift of Frank Rauscher, Wistar Institute). A Myc-tagged ArgBP2 cDNA, pJ3M-Myc-ArgBP2, was constructed by first creating an in-frame EcoRI site at the second codon and aBglII site downstream of the stop codon, and inserting this cDNA into the EcoRI and BglII sites of pJ3M (a gift of Jonathan Chernoff, Fox Chase Cancer Center). DNA fragments encoding each of the ArgBP2 SH3 domains were generated by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The pGEx plasmids containing the Arg SH3 binding sites, pGExABS-1, pGExABS-2, and pGExABS-3, and the baculovirus expression vector pVL-ArgIB have been described previously (30Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Krainc D. Jensen R.A. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1921-1929PubMed Google Scholar). pVL-ArgBP2A was constructed by inserting the ArgBP2A sequence of CB6+-ArgBP2A into the EcoRI and BglII sites of pVL1393 (PharMingen). All constructs prepared using PCR products or double-stranded oligonucleotides were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. A genetic screen using the yeast two-hybrid system was performed as described previously (30Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Krainc D. Jensen R.A. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1921-1929PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The bait plasmid, pNLex-ArgSH3BR, was described previously (30Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Krainc D. Jensen R.A. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1921-1929PubMed Google Scholar), and the human brain interaction library was a gift of Roger Brent (Massachusetts General Hospital). The specificity of interaction of candidate plasmids with pNLexArgSH3BR was tested by retransformation of positive clones into yeast harboring either the Arg bait plasmid or several unrelated bait plasmids. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA inserts was performed using an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. Filters containing poly(A)+ RNAs prepared from various human tissues (CLONTECH) were hybridized with a radiolabeled ArgBP2A probe as described previously (30Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Krainc D. Jensen R.A. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1921-1929PubMed Google Scholar). ArgBP2 cDNA clones were isolated by plaque hybridization from a human heart cDNA library (Stratagene) as described previously (30Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Krainc D. Jensen R.A. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1921-1929PubMed Google Scholar). DNA probes were prepared using [32P]dCTP and a random priming kit (Amersham). Filters were preincubated for at least 1 h at 65 °C in hybridization solution (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm EDTA, 0.6 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA). The filters were then incubated overnight at 65 °C with the radiolabeled probe in hybridization solution, washed three times with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and analyzed by autoradiography. Solution binding assays used to analyze the interaction of GST fusion proteins with proteins expressed in COS or Sf9 cells were performed as described previously (30Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Krainc D. Jensen R.A. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1921-1929PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione-agarose beads. Proteins were expressed in baculovirus or COS cells as described previously (30Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Krainc D. Jensen R.A. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1921-1929PubMed Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed by incubating 5 μg of GST fusion proteins (conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose beads) proteins with lysates of Sf9 cells (100 μg) or COS cells (1 mg) in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanidate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Reactions were allowed to proceed for at least 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Glutathione-agarose beads (15 μl) (Pharmacia) were then added, and the bound proteins were washed four times with 1 ml of incubation buffer (lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100). Proteins were eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Eiserling F.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1968; 101: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. COS cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method as described (33Morris J.F. Madden S.L. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2339-2348PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (1.6 × 106) were seeded in 100-mm dishes and transfected the following day with 3 μg of plasmid DNA. After 2.5 h of incubation at 37 °C, growth medium containing 10% Me2SO was added for 1 min. The dishes were then washed twice with growth medium and incubated in growth medium for 36–60 h. PtK2 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the specifications of the manufacturer. Baculoviruses were obtained by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with plasmid constructs and gold-baculovirus (PharMingen). Sf9 cells (2 × 106) were infected in 60-mm dishes using 50 μl of baculovirus stocks and then incubated for 36–60 h. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell lysate (2 mg for COS cells and 300 μg for Sf9 cells) was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 1–3 μl of antiserum or monoclonal antibody. For immunoprecipitations using the murine monoclonal antibody, after a 1-h incubation anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) was added. Protein G-bound Sepharose beads (30 μl of a 50% suspension, Pharmacia) were then added, and the suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with constant rotation. The beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of incubation buffer, and the proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. For immunoblot analysis, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. After a brief rinse with PBST, the filters were incubated with appropriate antibodies in PBST, 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The filters were then washed with PBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:5000 in PBST, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 40 min. The filters were washed extensively with PBST followed by PBS and developed with an ECL kit (Amersham). PtK2 cells were grown on glass coverslips for at least 2 days (collagen-coated coverslips were used in experiments to detect the endogenous protein). For transfection experiments 1 μg of plasmid DNA was used, and the cells were analyzed 2 days later. Cells were fixed using PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 8.0) for 15 min and permeabilized with PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Chicken cardiomyocytes (5 × 104) were grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes for 36 h, and fixed and permeabilized at room temperature for 2 min with acetone:methanol (1:1). PtK2 cells and cardiomyocytes were then washed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h with 150 μl of PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 4% goat serum (PBSBG) containing either preimmune, anti-ArgBP2 polyclonal antibody or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody at a dilutions of 1:1000. After two washes with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with PBSBG containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Vector) (1:250 dilution) and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) (1:100 dilution). The cells were then washed three times with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting fluid (Vector). Imaging was accomplished using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope with a 60× power lens. A segment of the Arg COOH-terminal domain that contains three SH3 binding sites (23Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa J. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1379-1385PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid system to identify Arg-interacting proteins. A human brain cDNA library was used in the screen, because Arg is well expressed in brain (29Perego R. Ron D. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1899-1902PubMed Google Scholar) and genetic evidence in Drosophila suggests that Abl family kinases may play a role in central nervous system development (34Gertler F.B. Bennett R.L. Clark M.J. Hoffmann F.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Four clones that specifically interacted with the bait were identified. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that three of the clones contained overlapping sequences of a cDNA denoted ArgBP2 (Arg-binding protein 2). The largest ArgBP2 insert contained a 250-amino acid open reading frame, followed by a stop codon and 250 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequences. Additional cDNA clones were isolated from a human heart cDNA library by plaque hybridization using an ArgBP2 cDNA insert as the radiolabeled probe. Several cDNA clones were characterized and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that they represented two distinct classes of ArgBP2 cDNAs (Fig.1). Analysis of one class of cDNAs (five clones), designated ArgBP2A, indicated that they spanned a total of 5.6 kb. The ArgBP2A sequence encoded a predicted protein of 666 amino acids bordered by in-frame stop codons, indicating that it represented a full-length open reading frame. A second class of cDNAs (two clones), designated ArgBP2B, encoded a partial open reading frame of 618 amino acids followed by a stop codon and 257 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequence. The partial ArgBP2B predicted protein, which began at the 27th codon of ArgBP2A, was identical to the latter predicted protein over most of its sequences, but differed at its midportion and COOH terminus. To obtain additional 5′ sequences of ArgBP2B, a reverse transcription PCR approach was employed using a primer located 5′ of the upstream in-frame stop codon of ArgBP2A and two nested primers located in the unique ArgBP2B midregion. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the PCR product indicated that the amino-terminal sequence of ArgBP2B was identical to that of ArgBP2A. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of ArgBP2A revealed several interesting structural features (Fig. 1, A andB). The COOH-terminal region of the protein contains three SH3 domains (amino acids 436–484, 511–561, and 614–664), separated by spacers of 26 and 52 amino acids, respectively. Sequences high in proline content are located within the two spacers (PARPPPP and PDPPIP, respectively). These sequences could potentially form turns in the secondary structure of the protein that might function to permit simultaneous binding of distinct proteins to individual SH3 domains. Comparison of the SH3 domains with each other revealed that the first and second domains were highly related, sharing 61% amino acid identity. In contrast, the third SH3 domain shared only 29% and 33% amino acid identity with the first and second SH3 domains, respectively. Comparison of the ArgBP2 SH3 domains with those of other proteins proved quite interesting (Table I). Among the most highly related SH3 domains were those of proteins with functions associated with the cytoskeleton. These proteins included Vav (35Hobert O. Schilling J.W. Beckerle M.C. Ullrich A.

The ArgBP2 SH3 domains were also closely related to SH3 domains that we had found previously to bind to the Arg proline-rich sequences, including the SH3 domain of ArgBP1/Abi-2, a protein isolated with the same bait used in the present study (30Wang B.

Mysliwiec T. Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa J. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1379-1385PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that ArgBP2 might have a cytoskeletal function, and that the Arg proline-rich sequences were specific for structurally related SH3 domains.Table ISimilarity of the ArgBP2 SH3 domains to those of other proteinsArgBP2 SH3 domainProteinIdentity%SH3–1Vav (COOH-terminal)55Grb2 (NH2-terminal SH3)51Myosin IC heavy chain46ArgBP1/Abi-244Lasp-144Nebulin43p40 phox42Grb2 (COOH-terminal SH3)41SH3–2Vav (COOH-terminal)51Vav (NH2-terminal)46Grb2 (NH2-terminal SH3)41ArgBP1/Abi-239Myosin IC heavy chain37p40 phox37Nebulin35ABP134SH3–3Vav (COOH-terminal)51ArgBP1/Abi-247Myosin IC heavy chain45HS145Abi-143Lasp-141ABP140Cortactin39 Open table in a new tab Several other structural features were identified in ArgBP2.

Hemin dissociation rates were also measured for native isolated α and β chains and for recombinant hemoglobin tetramers stabilized by α subunit fusion. The rate constant for hemin dissociation from β subunits in native hemoglobin increases from 1.5 h−1in tetramers at high protein concentration to 15 h−1 in dimers at low concentrations. The rate of hemin dissociation from α subunits in native hemoglobin is significantly smaller (0.3–0.6 h−1) and shows little dependence on protein concentration. Recombinant hemoglobins containing a fused di-α subunit remain tetrameric under all concentrations and show rates of hemin loss similar to those observed for wild-type and native hemoglobin at high protein concentration. Rates of hemin dissociation from monomeric α and β chains are much greater, 12 and 40 h−1, respectively, at pH 7, 37 °C. Aggregation of monomers to form α1β1 dimers greatly stabilizes bound hemin in α chains, decreasing its rate of hemin loss ∼20-fold. In contrast, dimer formation has little stabilizing effect on hemin binding to β subunits. A significant reduction in the rate of hemin loss from β subunits does occur after formation of the α1β2 interface in tetrameric hemoglobin. These results suggest that native human hemoglobin may have evolved to lose heme rapidly after red cell lysis, allowing the prosthetic group to be removed by serum albumin and apohemopexin. Rate constants for hemin dissociation from the α and β subunits of native and recombinant human hemoglobins were measured as a function of protein concentration at pH 7.0, 37 °C, using H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin as a hemin acceptor reagent. Hemin dissociation rates were also measured for native isolated α and β chains and for recombinant hemoglobin tetramers stabilized by α subunit fusion.

Human hemoglobin is protected against denaturation by encapsulation in red blood cells. The iron atoms are kept in the ferrous state by intracellular methemoglobin reductases, and O·̄2 generated by spontaneous autooxidation is rapidly transformed into H2O and O2 by superoxide dismutase and catalase (1Gibson Q.H.

Heme loss is inhibited by maintenance of the reduced state, the high concentration of cytoplasmic hemoglobin, and the presence of a cell membrane which prevents dispersal and precipitation of any dissociated prosthetic group. When hemoglobin is released by a small amount of red cell lysis, it is diluted significantly in plasma. In the case of human hemoglobin, this dilution leads to formation of noncooperative, α1β1dimers which display epitopes that are recognized by circulating haptoglobin molecules (2Bunn, H.

Rapid hemin loss from dilute, extracellular hemoglobin may be advantageous since the resulting free heme in plasma is readily taken up by serum albumin and apohemopexin and transported to the liver for recycling. Thus, we felt that it would be important to measure quantitatively how the state of aggregation affects the rate of hemin loss from the α and β subunits of human hemoglobin.Roughly 30 years ago, Bunn and Jandl (7Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) measured time courses for59Fe-labeled hemin exchange between human adult and fetal hemoglobins and between adult hemoglobin and human serum albumin. Quantitative analysis suggested that the rate of hemin exchange with β subunits was 5–10-fold greater than with α subunits. Benesch and Kwong (5Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that partial hemin exchange between methemoglobin and human serum albumin can be followed spectrophotometrically at pH values ≥8. They measured rates of hemin dissociation from β subunits in a variety of native and mutant human hemoglobins. However, even at extremely high concentrations, human serum albumin is unable to extract significant amounts of hemin from α subunits within intact hemoglobin. To overcome this problem, we developed a genetically engineered apoglobin for use as a colorimetric reagent to measure complete time courses of hemin dissociation from both myoglobins and hemoglobins (8Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Mathews A.J. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol.

The phenolate side chain coordinates to the iron atom giving the ferric form of the mutant holoprotein a “green” color and an absorbance spectrum very different from those of native metmyoglobins and methemoglobins which appear “brown.” In addition, Val-68(E11) was replaced with Phe to enhance the stability of the apoprotein and to increase its affinity for hemin. When methemoglobin Ao is mixed with an excess of the H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin reagent, complete hemin exchange occurs and the observed time course is markedly biphasic (see Fig. 2). Using valence and mutant hybrid hemoglobins, we were able to confirm that the faster phase represents hemin loss from ferric β subunits and the slower phase hemin loss from α subunits (8Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Mathews A.J. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol.

Hemin dissociation from 1 μm hemoglobin was measured in 0.2 m Bis-Tris, 0.45 m sucrose, pH 7.0, ± 0.2 mm inositol hexaphosphate. The rate of hemin dissociation from β subunits was 16 h−1 in the absence of inositol hexaphosphate and 3 h−1 in the presence of 0.2 mm inositol hexaphosphate. The decrease in k −H for β subunits is due to inositol hexaphosphate-induced aggregation to tetramers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our rate constants for hemin loss, which were measured at low hemoglobin concentrations (1–10 μm), were significantly larger than those reported by Bunn and Jandl (7Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which were measured at high protein concentration. We speculated that the differences were due to more rapid hemin dissociation from methemoglobin dimers that were present at the low concentrations used in our experiments. Benesch and Kwong (6Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) confirmed this idea directly by measuring the dependence of the rate of hemin dissociation from β subunits on hemoglobin concentration. However, since Benesch and Kwong (6Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13785-13786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were using the human serum albumin assay, they were unable to examine the effects of dimer formation on hemin dissociation from α subunits.In this work, we have measured the rate constants for hemin loss from isolated α and β subunits, α1β1 dimers, native tetramers, and recombinant tetramers stabilized by α gene fusion. The rate constants for hemin dissociation from native dimers and tetramers were obtained by analyzing the protein concentration dependence of the observed time courses. The results provide a quantitative description of the linkage between quaternary structure and hemin binding in the α and β subunits. These data also explain why it is so difficult to prepare the aquomet forms of isolated chains. Finally, the high rates of hemin dissociation observed in dimers and monomers support the view that human hemoglobin has evolved to fall apart rapidly in dilute solution.DISCUSSIONThe quaternary structure of methemoglobin has a profound effect on the rate of hemin dissociation (Table I). The monomeric forms of the isolated α and β chains lose hemin 30–40 times more rapidly than the corresponding subunits in a tetramer. Hargrove et al.(19Hargrove M.S. Barrick D. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11293-11299Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) have shown that the association rate constant for the binding of monomeric heme to apoglobins is always ∼1 × 108m−1 s−1 regardless of the exact protein structure. Thus, the equilibrium constant for hemin dissociation can be computed as K −H =k −H/(1 × 108m−1 s−1) wherek −H is converted from units of h−1to s−1. Equilibrium dissociation constants for hemin binding to monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric native hemoglobin are listed in Table II and compared with the value for sperm whale myoglobin under the same conditions.Table IIComparison of the equilibrium dissociation constants for hemin binding to the α and β subunits of native human hemoglobin and sperm whale myoglobin at pH 7.0, 37 °CProteinK −HmonomerK −H dimerK −HtetramerpmSperm whale myoglobin0.03α (native)331.70.8β (native)110 424.2The K −H values in picomolar were calculated using the dissociation rate constants in Table I and assuming that the association rate constant is ∼1 × 108m−1s−1 for all three apoproteins, regardless of quaternary state (24Hargrove M.S. Wilkinson A.J. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11300-11309Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab The results in Tables I and II provide a quantitative explanation for why the aquomet forms of isolated α and β chains are so unstable. The half-times for hemin dissociation are 1–3 min at 37 °C, and although the equilibrium constants are still ∼10−10m, rebinding has to compete with irreversible hemin aggregation and precipitation. In addition, the apoprotein forms of the isolated subunits are very unstable at 37 °C and precipitate almost immediately after heme removal.The instability of apoglobin monomers and their low affinity for hemin may explain why it is difficult to express the α and β subunits of human hemoglobin separately as soluble holoproteins in E. coli. In contrast, co-expression of the subunits yields high levels of soluble hemoglobin (11Looker D. Abbot-Brown D. Cozant P. Durfee S. Hoffman S. Mathews A.J. Miller-Roehrich J. Shoemaker S. Trimble S.

In contrast apomyoglobin is much more stable and has an affinity for hemin which is 1,000–3,000-fold greater than that of the isolated subunits of hemoglobin. This result accounts for the ease of expression of sperm whale holomyoglobin in bacteria (21Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11310-11318Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Formation of α1β1 dimers from monomers causes a 30-fold increase in the affinity of α subunits for hemin, whereas only a 2-fold increase is observed for β subunits. The structural cause of this selectivity is not clear since the α1β1 interface involves mostly hydrophobic contacts between the B, G, and H helices of the two subunits, regions which are far removed from the heme pocket in both proteins. Presumably, formation of these contacts stabilizes the overall, tertiary structure of α but not β subunits. Association of dimers into tetramers is driven primarily by formation of the α1β2 interface which involves more polar contacts between the C and N termini and the C-helices and FG corners of both subunits. The C-helix is near the heme group and the FG corner serves to position the proximal His(F8) for direct coordination to the iron atom. These interactions are required for strong hemin binding to β subunits. A more detailed structural interpretation will require systematic mutagenesis studies analogous to those carried out for sperm whale myoglobin (24Hargrove M.S. Wilkinson A.J. Olson J.S.

In contrast apomyoglobin is much more stable and has an affinity for hemin which is 1,000–3,000-fold greater than that of the isolated subunits of hemoglobin. This result accounts for the ease of expression of sperm whale holomyoglobin in bacteria (21Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Formation of α1β1 dimers from monomers causes a 30-fold increase in the affinity of α subunits for hemin, whereas only a 2-fold increase is observed for β subunits. The structural cause of this selectivity is not clear since the α1β1 interface involves mostly hydrophobic contacts between the B, G, and H helices of the two subunits, regions which are far removed from the heme pocket in both proteins. Presumably, formation of these contacts stabilizes the overall, tertiary structure of α but not β subunits. Association of dimers into tetramers is driven primarily by formation of the α1β2 interface which involves more polar contacts between the C and N termini and the C-helices and FG corners of both subunits. The C-helix is near the heme group and the FG corner serves to position the proximal His(F8) for direct coordination to the iron atom. These interactions are required for strong hemin binding to β subunits. A more detailed structural interpretation will require systematic mutagenesis studies analogous to those carried out for sperm whale myoglobin (24Hargrove M.S. Wilkinson A.J. Olson J.S.

Quaternary structure regulates hemin dissociation from human hemoglobin.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 272Issue 38PreviewChiancone and co-workers (1) published studies of hemin loss from immobilized αβ dimers and isolated α and β subunits of human hemoglobin that we failed to read and to take into account. Their conclusions were the same as ours but were reported 1 year earlier: “... in human hemoglobin the heme-globin linkage in the α chains is stabilized by interactions between unlike chains at the α1β1 interface, whereas heme binding to the β chains is stabilized by interactions at the α1β2interface” (1). As they noted, the rate constants for hemin dissociation from proteins attached to Sepharose 4B are 3 to 10 times greater than those for hemin loss in solution. Full-Text PDF Open Access"

The vertebrate enzyme is an α2β2tetramer, the β subunit of which is identical to protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI, EC 5.3.4.1). We report here on cloning of the recently discovered α(II) subunit from human sources. The mRNA for the α(II) subunit was found to be expressed in a variety of human tissues, and the presence of the corresponding polypeptide and the (α(II))2β2 tetramer was demonstrated in cultured human WI-38 and HT-1080 cells. The type II tetramer was found to represent about 30% of the total prolyl 4-hydroxylase in these cells and about 5–15% in various chick embryo tissues. The results of coexpression in insect cells argued strongly against the formation of a mixed α(I)α(II)β2 tetramer. PDI/β polypeptide containing a histidine tag in its N terminus was found to form prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramers as readily as the wild-type PDI/β polypeptide, and histidine-tagged forms of prolyl 4-hydroxylase appear to offer an excellent source for a simple large scale purification of the recombinant enzyme. The properties of the purified human type II enzyme were very similar to those of the type I enzyme, but theK i of the former for poly(l-proline) was about 200–1000 times that of the latter. In agreement with this, a minor difference, about 3–6-fold, was found between the two enzymes in the K m values for three peptide substrates. The existence of two forms of prolyl 4-hydroxylase in human cells raises the possibility that mutations in one enzyme form may not be lethal despite the central role of this enzyme in the synthesis of all collagens.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (proline hydroxylase, EC 1.14.11.2) catalyzes the hydroxylation of proline in -Xaa-Pro-Gly- triplets in collagens and other proteins with collagen-like sequences. The enzyme plays a central role in the synthesis of all collagens, as the 4-hydroxyproline residues formed in the reaction are essential for the folding of the newly synthesized collagen polypeptide chains into triple helical molecules. The vertebrate enzyme is an α2β2tetramer in which the α subunits contribute to most parts of the two catalytic sites (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T.

MacNeil I.A. Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4427-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the previously known α subunit is now called the α(I) subunit. The α(II) subunit was found to form an (α(II))2β2 tetramer with the PDI/β subunit when the two polypeptides were coexpressed in insect cells. The properties of the new type II enzyme were found to be very similar to those of the type I tetramer, with the distinct difference that it was inhibited by poly(l-proline) only at very high concentrations (9Helaakoski T. Annunen P. MacNeil I.A. Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4427-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The α subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase cloned from the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans (10Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been found to have features of both types of mouse α subunit, suggesting that C. elegans may have only one type of α subunit (9Helaakoski T. Annunen P. MacNeil I.A. Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4427-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This forms active prolyl 4-hydroxylase in insect cell coexpression experiments with either the C. elegans or the human PDI/β polypeptide, but surprisingly, the enzymes containing the C. elegans α subunit are αβ dimers (10Veijola J.

We report here that the existence of α(II) subunit mRNA is not limited to the mouse, as a corresponding mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues. All the data so far available on the existence of the type II prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer are based on insect cell coexpression experiments, but we now demonstrate that this enzyme is indeed present in cultured human fibroblasts and represents about 30% of their total prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity. We also studied whether the α(I) and α(II) subunits can form a mixed α(I)α(II)β2 tetramer, and whether any differences are found between the type I and II enzymes in their K m values for various peptide substrates, as the two mouse enzymes differ so markedly from each other with respect to inhibition by poly(l-proline). A new affinity purification procedure was developed that is based on the use of a histidine tag in the N terminus of the PDI/β polypeptide, and this makes it possible to obtain large amounts of any form of the recombinant enzyme by very simple steps. Screening of a human lung λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH) with BT 14.1, a cDNA clone for the mouse α(II) subunit (9Helaakoski T. Annunen P. MacNeil I.A. Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4427-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), as a probe yielded one positive clone, H9, among 600,000 recombinants. Rescreening of the same library with H9 as a probe gave 8 positive clones out of 600,000 recombinants. Four of them, L121, L142, L21, and L22, were characterized further. The nucleotide sequences were obtained by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (12Sanger K. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52671) Google Scholar) with T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia). Vector-specific or sequence-specific 17-mer primers synthesized in an Applied Biosystems DNA Synthesizer (Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Oulu) were used, and the sequences were determined for both strands. DNASIS and PROSIS version 6.00 sequence analysis software (Pharmacia) was used to compile the sequence data. A human multitissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per sample isolated from various human tissues was hybridized under the stringent conditions suggested in the manufacturer's instructions. The probes used were32P-labeled cDNA clones encoding either the whole human α(II) subunit or PA-58 and PA-59 (13Helaakoski T. Vuori K. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4392-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) encoding almost all of the human α(I) subunit. The autoradiography time was 3 days. To construct a baculovirus transfer vector for the human α(II) subunit, a 5′ fragment was amplified from the λ-DNA of L142. The cDNA-specific primers used were αIIiN5′ (5′-TCAGGCGGCCGCGACAGCCAGACACTTCCCTC-3′), containing an artificialNotI site, and αIIiE3′ (5′-GGTGAAGAATTCGGCCTGCAC-3′), containing a natural EcoRI site. Polymerase chain reaction was performed under the conditions recommended by the supplier of theTaq polymerase (Promega), and the reactions were cycled 27 times as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 62 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The product was digested with NotI and EcoRI restriction enzymes to give a fragment that extended from nucleotide 166 to 251. The next fragment was prepared by digesting L142 with EcoRI and SacI. The resulting EcoRI-SacI fragment, covering nucleotides 252–873, was ligated together with the above NotI-EcoRI fragment to theNotI-SacI site of the pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and termed HuNS-BS. Clone H9 was digested withSacI and PstI to give a fragment encompassing nucleotides 874–1426. Clone L21 was digested with PstI, and the resulting fragment, covering nucleotides 1427–2021, was ligated together with the SacI-PstI fragment to theSacI-PstI site of pBluescript, and the construct was termed I3′SPP-BS. The NotI-SacI fragment from HuNS-BS, and the SacI-PstI fragment from I3′SPP-BS were then ligated to the NotI-PstI site of pBluescript, and the construct was termed α(II)human-BS. Finally, the α(II)human-BS was digested with NotI andEcoRV, and the resulting fragment was ligated to theNotI-SmaI site of the transfer vector pVL1392 (14Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A histidine affinity tag was generated in the N terminus of the human PDI/β polypeptide. Six histidine codons were created by polymerase chain reaction downstream of the codon coding for the last amino acid of the signal peptide in a full-length cDNA for the human PDI/β polypeptide (4Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Myllylä R. Huhtala M.-L. Koivu J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The cDNA was digested with EcoRI andBamHI and ligated to pVL1392. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) at 27 °C, either as monolayers or in suspension in spinner flasks (Techne Laboratories, Princeton, NJ). The pVL constructs were cotransfected into Sf9 insect cells with a modifiedAutographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA using the BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen). The resultant viral pools were collected 4 days later, amplified, and plaque-purified (15Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Procedures & Methods Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar). The recombinant viruses were termed α(II) and His-PDI. The viruses human α59(I), coding for the α(I) subunit, and human PDI/β, coding for the PDI/β polypeptide, have been described previously (16Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells were cultured as above. To produce an enzyme tetramer, the α59(I) or α(II) virus and the PDI/β or His-PDI virus were used in a ratio of 1:1 or 2:1, and when attempting to produce an α(I)α(II)β2 tetramer, the α59(I), α(II), and PDI/β viruses were used in the ratio 1:1:2 or 1:1:1. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a solution of 0.1 m glycine, 0.1m NaCl, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.8, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatants were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE or nondenaturing 7.5% PAGE and assayed for enzyme activity. The cell pellets were further solubilized in 1% SDS and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed with a monoclonal antibody L7B to the human α(I) subunit or a monoclonal antibody K4 to the mouse α(II) subunit. These monoclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing mice with denatured recombinant α(I) or α(II) polypeptides that had been purified by SDS-PAGE. The antibodies recognize the α(I) and α(II) subunit isoforms, respectively, both as native and denatured proteins from man, mouse, and chicken, but show no cross-reactivity between isoforms. Human lung fibroblasts (WI-38, ATCC CCL 75) and fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080, ATCC CCL 121) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C as monolayers. The cells of confluent cultures were harvested, washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a solution of 0.1 m glycine, 0.2m NaCl, 50 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 20 mmTris-HCl, pH adjusted to 7.5 at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatants were analyzed by nondenaturing 8% PAGE followed by Western blotting using ECL. Total prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity was measured in aliquots of the supernatants, and the type II enzyme activity in aliquots of the supernatants that had been passed through small poly(l-proline) columns. Calvaria, sternum, tendon, and liver tissues from 17-day-old chick embryos and whole chick embryos were homogenized in a solution of 0.1 m glycine, 0.2m NaCl, 50 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH adjusted to 7.5 at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Aliquots of the supernatants were then used to assay the enzyme activities as above. The type II prolyl 4-hydroxylase resulting from coinfection with the viruses α(II) and PDI/β was first purified by a procedure consisting of anion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column (DE52 Whatman) and two gel filtrations. Sf9 insect cells harvested 72 h after infection were washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a solution of 0.1 m glycine, 0.1m NaCl, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.8, supplemented with 22 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 2.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged. The supernatant was diluted 1:3 with a solution of 0.1 m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.8, and applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (20 ml) equilibrated with 0.1m glycine, 0.05 m NaCl, 10 μmdithiothreitol, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.8 (buffer A). Unbound material was washed off with the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with an increasing salt concentration generated by mixing 75 ml of buffer A and 75 ml of a solution of 0.1 m glycine, 0.4 m NaCl, 10 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.05m Tris, pH 7.8 (buffer B). The 3-ml fractions containing most of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore), and applied to a 1.5 × 90-cm Ultrogel AcA34 (Serva) column, equilibrated, and eluted with a solution of 0.1 m glycine, 0.25 m NaCl, 10 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.8. Fractions of 3.5 ml were collected, and their absorbance at 280 nm was measured. Several fractions were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and assayed for prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity, and a sample pool was combined and concentrated as above for a second gel filtration on a 2.5 × 95-cm Bio-Gel A-0.5m fine (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated and eluted as above. Fractions of 2.5 ml were collected, analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE, and assayed for prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity. The type I and II prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramers and the PDI/β polypeptide containing the histidine affinity tag were also purified by a procedure consisting of a metal chelate affinity chromatography and a gel filtration step. Insect cells expressing type I or type II prolyl 4-hydroxylase or the His-PDI polypeptide were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02m phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a 0.3 mNaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01m Tris buffer, pH 7.8, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant was applied to a ProBond column (Invitrogen) equilibrated with a 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1m glycine, and 0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8. Unbound material was washed off with the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with a 100 mm imidazole, 0.3m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 10 μmdithiothreitol, and 0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8. Fractions containing the eluted proteins were pooled and applied to a 2.5 × 95-cm Bio-Gel A-0.5m fine (Bio-Rad) gel filtration column, equilibrated, and eluted with a 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.01m Tris buffer, pH 7.8. Fractions of 3 ml were collected, their absorbance at 230 and 280 nm was measured, and they were analyzed by 8% PAGE under nondenaturing conditions. Fractions containing the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer or the PDI/β dimer/monomer were pooled and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and 7.5% nondenaturing PAGE. Protein concentrations were estimated with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the N-terminal sequencing the type II prolyl 4-hydroxylase was run on 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie R-250 in 50% methanol, and the band corresponding to the α(II) subunit was cut off. The N-terminal sequence was determined using an Applied Biosystems model 477A on-line 120 liquid pulse protein sequencer. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity was assayed by a method based either on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate or on the formation of hydroxy[14C]proline in protocollagen, a biologically prepared, [14C]proline-labeled protein substrate consisting of nonhydroxylated pro-α chains of chick type I procollagen (17Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). K m values were determined by varying the concentration of one substrate in the presence of fixed concentrations of the second while the concentrations of the other substrates were held constant (18Myllylä R. Tuderman L. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The pure type II prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer was used as an enzyme source for theK m determinations. To isolate cDNA clones for the human α(II) subunit, a human lung cDNA library was screened using BT14.1, a cDNA for the mouse α(II) subunit (9Helaakoski T. Annunen P. MacNeil I.A. Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4427-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), as a probe. One positive clone, H9, which codes for the central region of the cDNA, was obtained. Rescreening of the same library with H9 as a probe gave 8 positive clones, 4 of which were characterized further. The cDNA clones cover 2194 nucleotides of the corresponding mRNA (these cDNA sequences are not shown, but have been deposited in the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank with accession number U90441) and encode a 535-amino acid polypeptide, including a putative signal peptide of 21 residues (Fig. 1). Sequencing of the N terminus of the polypeptide indicated that its first amino acid is glutamate (Fig. 1). The first amino acid of the mouse α(II) subunit was previously thought to be tryptophan (9Helaakoski T. Annunen P. MacNeil I.A. Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4427-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), based on the computational parameters of von Hejne (19von Hejne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar), but it now seems more likely that this is likewise glutamate, as such a result would also be compatible with the computational parameters. The human α(II), human α(I), and mouse α(II) polypeptides are very similar in size, α(I) being three amino acids longer (Fig. 1). All three polypeptides contain two potential attachment sites for asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, but the position of the C-terminal site in the α(II) and α(I) subunits differs by 4 residues (Fig. 1). The five cysteine residues present in the human, mouse, and chick α(I) and the C. elegans α subunit are all conserved in the human α(II) subunit, but the latter contains an additional cysteine, which is also present in the mouse α(II) subunit (Fig.1). The derived amino acid sequence of the human α(II) subunit shows 64% identity and 81% similarity to the sequence of the human α(I) subunit and 93% identity and 96% similarity to the sequence of the mouse α(II) subunit. The identity of the subunits is not distributed equally, being highest within the C-terminal domains (Fig. 1). Expression of the two types of α subunit mRNA in various human tissues was studied by Northern hybridization. The sizes of the mRNAs for the human α(II) and α(I) subunits are 2.3 and 3.0 kilobases, respectively (Fig. 2). The mRNA for the α(II) subunit was found to be expressed in a variety of tissues, but distinct differences were found relative to the expression pattern of that for the α(I) subunit, in that the relative expression level of the latter was much higher in the skeletal muscle, liver and kidney (Fig. 2). To study whether the α(I) and α(II) subunits can form α(I)α(II)β2mixed tetramers in addition to the (α(I))2β2 type I and (α(II))2β2 type II tetramers (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T.

The (α(I))2β2tetramer is effectively inhibited by poly(l-proline) (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2Kivirikko K.I.

Biochem. 1975; 52: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The (α(II))2β2 tetramer differs distinctly from the type I enzyme in that it is inhibited by poly(l-proline) only at very high concentrations (9Helaakoski T. Annunen P. MacNeil I.A. Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4427-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It thus can be expected that the type II enzyme will not become bound to poly(l-proline) columns. If a mixed α(I)α(II)β2 enzyme existed, it could be expected either to become bound to poly(l-proline), due to the presence of the α(I) subunit, or to remain unbound. Sf9 insect cells were coinfected with baculoviruses coding for either the α(I) subunit or the α(II) subunit together with viruses coding for the PDI/β polypeptide, and a third set of cells was infected with all three viruses. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, and Triton X-100-soluble proteins were analyzed by PAGE performed under nondenaturing conditions. When the cells were coinfected with viruses coding for either the α(I) subunit or the α(II) subunit together with a virus coding for the PDI/β polypeptide, a type I or type II enzyme tetramer was formed, the mobilities of these two types of tetramer being essentially identical (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and 4). An enzyme tetramer was likewise formed when the cells were infected with all three viruses (Fig. 3 A, lane 7). Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies specific to the isolated α(I) and α(II) subunits was used to distinguish between the types of tetramer. The antibody to the α(I) subunit stained the type I tetramer (Fig. 3 B, lane 1) but not the type II tetramer (Fig. 3 B, lane 4), whereas the antibody to the α(II) subunit stained the type II tetramer (Fig.3 C, lane 4) but not the type I tetramer (Fig.3 C, lane 1). The type I tetramer became efficiently bound to a poly(l-proline) affinity column, as no enzyme could be detected in the column effluent (Fig. 3, A and B,lanes 2), and could be eluted with poly(l-proline) (Fig. 3, A and B,lanes 3). The type II tetramer was found in the column effluent (Fig. 3, A and C, lanes 5), and no additional amounts could be eluted from the column with poly(l-proline) (Fig. 3, A and C,lanes 6). When the tetramer formed during infection with viruses coding for both types of α subunit was studied as above, a Coomassie-stained enzyme band was seen in both the column effluent (Fig. 3 A, lane 8) and the eluate (Fig.3 A, lane 9). The band in the column effluent could be stained by the antibody to the α(II) subunit (Fig.3 C, lane 8) but not that to α(I) (Fig.3 B, lane 8), thus ruling out the presence of α(I)α(II)β2 in the effluent. The band in the column eluate could be stained by the antibody to the α(I) subunit (Fig.3 B, lane 9) but not to α(II) (Fig.3 C, lane 9) thus ruling out the presence of α(I)α(II)β2 in the eluate. The absence of the α(I)α(II)β2 tetramer cannot be due to the low level of infection of Sf9 cells by three viruses simultaneously, as we have recently shown that these cells can be efficiently infected by three viruses (21Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures of human lung fibroblasts (WI-38) and fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080) were homogenized, and Triton X-100-soluble proteins were analyzed by PAGE performed under nondenaturing conditions followed by Western blotting using ECL with monoclonal antibodies specific to the α(II) and α(I) subunits (as demonstrated above). Bands corresponding to both types of enzyme tetramer were found in extracts from both cell types (Fig.4). Quantification of the Western blots using ECL which had been standardized against known amounts of both types of enzyme tetramer indicated that the amount of type II enzyme is lower than that of type I enzyme in both cell types, being about 30% of total prolyl 4-hydroxylase (details not shown). Total prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity,i.e. the sum of the type I and type II enzyme activities, was measured in Triton X-100 extracts from cell or tissue homogenates using proline-labeled protocollagen as a substrate.

Since ARNT was isolated as a factor required for the nuclear translocation of AhR from the cytoplasm in response to xenobiotics, the subcellular localization of ARNT has been of great interest. In this investigation, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of ARNT using transient expression of a fusion gene with β-galactosidase and microinjection of recombinant proteins containing various fragments of ARNT in the linker region of glutathioneS-transferase/green fluorescent protein. We found a clear nuclear localization of ARNT in the absence of exogenous ligands to AhR, and identified the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of amino acid residues 39–61. The characterized NLS consists of 23 amino acids, and can be classified as a novel variant of the bipartite type on the basis of having two separate regions responsible for efficient nuclear translocation activity, but considerable deviation of the sequence from the consensus of the classical bipartite type NLSs. Like the well characterized NLS of the SV40 T-antigen, this variant bipartite type of ARNT NLS was also mediated by the two components of nuclear pore targeting complex, PTAC58 and PTAC97, to target to the nuclear rim in an in vitro nuclear transport assay.

(also called TCDD receptor) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor, which regulates the expression of various genes via binding to its cognate binding sequence named XRE (xenobiotics responsive element) (1Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ema M. Sogawa K. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1994; 11: 65-75PubMed Google Scholar, 2Poellinger L. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.-A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 241-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1993; 3: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). CYP1A1, one of the target genes of AhR, plays an important role in the metabolism of procarcinogens, such as benzo(a)pyrene in cigarette smoke, resulting in formation of activated DNA binding derivatives (4Kawajiri K. Hayashi S.-I. Ioannides C. Cytochrome P450: Metabolic and Toxicological Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 77-97Google Scholar). Among various classes of ligands for AhR, the most potent is a well known environmental pollutant, tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Using an animal model system, the toxicity of TCDD has been found to cause wasting syndrome, immunodeficiency, tumor promotion, and teratogenesis (5Landers J.P. Bunce N.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 6Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) was identified as a factor that rescues the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in response to xenobiotics in Hepa-1 c4 mutant cells (7Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Since the ligand binding subunit of AhR is present in the cytoplasm of Hepa-1 c4 mutant cells, this led to the notion that ARNT is required for ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of AhR. Sequence analysis showed that ARNT is a 90-kDa protein possessing the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain as well as the PAS domain, showing similarity with two Drosophila proteins called Per (for period) important for circadian rhythms and Sim (single-minded) required for the formation of the central nervous system (7Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Subsequent cloning of the ligand-binding subunit of AhR also showed structural similarities with ARNT in the bHLH and PAS domains (8Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8139-8185Crossref Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 9Ema M. Sogawa K. Watanabe N. Chujo Y. Matsusita N. Gotoh O. Funae Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Various mutational analyses revealed that the formation of heteromeric complex of ARNT and AhR mediated by bHLH and PAS domains is required for it to have DNA binding activity (10Bacsi S.G.

Recently, ARNT has also been identified as a component of another transcription factor called HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1). HIF-1 consists of two subunits called HIF-1α and HIF-1β (15Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar); the former is a new member of the bHLH/PAS protein family, while the latter was found to be identical to ARNT (16Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4926) Google Scholar). Physiologically, HIF-1 responds to a low O2concentration and transactivates many genes, including erythropoietin (17Semenza G. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar) and vascular endothelial growth factor (18Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.-H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar). Since ARNT was first cloned as a factor required for the nuclear translocation of AhR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, the subcellular localization of ARNT was believed to be cytoplasmic. In fact, most of ARNT were recovered in the cytosolic fraction by cell fractionation. However, recent immunohistochemical analysis has shown that ARNT is localized predominantly in the nucleus, regardless of the presence or absence of ligands (19Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 618-626PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 428-438PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that overexpressed ARNT is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the insect cell system (21Chan W.K. Chu R. Jain S. Reddy J.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26464-26471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led to the notion that ARNT is localized mainly in the nucleus, but some fractions might also be localized in the cytoplasm under certain circumstances. The increasing importance of the physiological role of ARNT in the regulation of gene transcription in response to various signals, such as oxygen (22Wood S.W. Gleadle J.M. Pugh C.W. Hankinson O. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15117-15123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), prompted us to investigate its subcellular localization in detail. Active transport of protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus requires the presence of a short amino acid moiety named nuclear localization signal (NLS) in any part of the protein (23Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar). NLSs of various proteins identified so far can be classified mainly into two classes: 1) a single cluster of basic amino acids represented by the SV40 large T antigen NLS, and 2) a bipartite type in which two sets of adjacent basic amino acids are separated by a stretch of approximately 10 amino acids (24Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The NLS-dependent nuclear translocation process depends on the cytosolic fractions and can be separated mainly into two steps: energy-independent targeting to the nuclear pore and the energy-dependent entrance to the nucleus. Recently, four soluble factors have been purified and implicated in nuclear protein import (24Görlich D. Mattaj I.W.

The first step in the selection of protein targeting the nuclear pore is thought to be recognition of the NLS by the 58-kDa cellular protein importin-α, which associates with the 97-kDa cellular factor importin β (39Görlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 40Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Yoneda Y. J. Biol.

Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and subsequently is translocated through the pore by an energy-dependent, Ran-dependent mechanism (37Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Although the association of importin-α (PTAC58) and importin-β (PTAC97) with SV40 T NLS has been investigated extensively, not much is known about other NLSs of nucleoproteins, including transcription factors (42Vandromme M. Gauther-Rouviére C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the subcellular localization of ARNT using a transient expression of chimeric constructs of ARNT and β-galactosidase (β-Gal), clarifying nuclear localization of the ARNT protein. Subsequent analysis of various portions of ARNT using β-Gal fusions as well as fusion protein with GST-GFP gave the minimum NLS consisting of amino acids 39–61 of ARNT. The identified region differed from the classical type of NLS reported so far, which prompted us to analyze interaction with PTAC58 and PTAC97. Cell lines used for the study were mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 clone Hepa1c1c7, Hepa-1 c4 mutant which lacks ARNT expression (generously provided by Dr. O. Hankinson, UCLA), and HeLa cells. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The human ARNT cDNA was prepared by PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed products of total RNA from HepG2 cells using specific primers and Pfu DNA polymerase (CLONTECH), and was inserted in the pGEM-7Zf(+) vector (Promega). The sequence of the construct was confirmed by sequencing using fluorescein-labeled SP6 and T7 primers, AutoRead Sequencing kits, and A.L.F. II DNA sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For subsequent cloning into the β-Gal expression vector, theNcoI site at the initiation codon of ARNT was modified to the BglII site using pBglII linker (Takara), and another BglII site was created in front of the stop codon by PCR-mediated mutation. To construct the expression vectors of β-Gal fusion proteins with various portions of ARNT, an artificialBglII site was created in front of the stop codon of β-galactosidase gene of pSVβ-Gal vector (Promega) by PCR-mediated mutation. The BglII-BglII fragment of the ARNT cDNA was ligated to the BglII site of the modified β-Gal control vector to generate β-Gal/ARNT-(1–789) vector. Various portions of ARNT cDNA were amplified by PCR using β-Gal/ARNT-(1–789) vector as a template and Pfu DNA polymerase with specific sets of primers to generate artificialBglII sites at both ends. Sequences of the primers used for the preparation of fragments of ARNT were as follows: F1 (GTC TGG TGT CAA AAA CAG ATC TGC ATG) and R2 (TTC AGA TCTACC TAG TTG TGG CCT CTG GAT) for ARNT-(1–485); F1 and R1 (TTCAGA TCT TTT CAG TTC CTG ATC AGT GAG) for ARNT-(1–165); F1 and R7 (TTC AGA TCT TCT CTC TTT ATC CGC AGA GCT) for ARNT-(1–88); F1 and R22 (TTC AGA TCT CCT CAA AAA TTT ACT GTT CCC) for ARNT-(1–61); F2 (TAT AAG ATC TGC CAT TTG ATC TTG GAG GCA) and R2 for ARNT-(166–485); F3 (TAT AAG ATC TGC CCC ACA GCT AAT TTA CCC) and R3 (CCT GCC CGG TTA TTA TTAAGA TCT TTC) for ARNT-(486–789); F6 (TAT AAG ATC TGC CTT GCC AGG GAA AAT CAC) and R1 for ARNT-(89–165); F25 (TAT AAG ATC TGC AGG GCT ATT AAG CGG CGA) and HR01 (TTCAGA TCT CCT CCC TTC TCC ATC ATC ATC A) for ARNT-(39–55); F25 and R22 for ARNT-(39–61); F25 and R28 (TTC AGA TCT CCT CAA AAA TTT AGT GTT CCC) for ARNT-(39–61)/S57T; F25 and R29 (TTCAGA TCT CCT CAA AAA TTT AGC GTT CCC) for ARNT-(39–61)/S57A; F25 and R35 (TTC AGA TCT CGC CAA AAA TTT ACT GTT CCC) for ARNT-(39–61)/R61A; F25 and R36 (TTC AGA TCT CCT CAA AAA TGC ACT GTT CCC) for ARNT-(39–61)/K58A; F25 and R37 (TTC AGA TCT CGC CAA AAA TGC ACT GTT CCC TTC TCC ATC ATC ATC) for ARNT-(39–61)/K58A/R61A; F29 (TAT AAG ATC TGC AGG GCT ATT AAG CGG CGA CCA GGG CTG AAT TTT) and R32 (TTC AGA TCT CCT CAA AAA TTT ACT GTT CCC TTG TCC ATT ATC ATC) for ARNT-(39–61)/D48N/D52N/E54Q. After cleavage with BglII, the fragments were ligated to the BglII site of the β-Gal control vector to give in-frame fusion genes. To obtain the fragment of ARNT-(39–45), two oligonucleotides, F7 (GAT CTC TAG GGC TAT TAA GCG GCG ACC AA) and R8 (GAT CTT GGT CGC CGC TTA ATA GCC CTA GA), were annealed and phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The resultant fragments were ligated at the BglII site of the β-Gal control vector. To generate the fragment ARNT-(1–88;Δ39–45), two fragments named A and B were synthesized by PCR. The sequence of the primers used are as follows: F1 and AR50 (AAT CTA GAC CCT GGA CAA TGG CTC CTC C) for fragment A; AR51 (GGT CTA GAT TTT GAT GAT GAT GGA GAA GGG) and R7 for fragment B. These fragments were digested with XbaI and ligated to generate ARNT-(1–88;Δ39–45). For the preparation of ARNT-(39–61;Δ48–54), two oligonucleotides, F32 (GAT CTC TAG GGC TAT TAA GCG GCG ACC AGG GCT GGG GAA CAG TAA ATT TTT GAG GA) and R39 (GAT CTC CTC AAA AAT TTA CTG TTC CCC AGC CCT GGT CGC CGC TTA ATA GCC CTA GA), were annealed and phosphorylated. To construct GST-ARNT-GFP fusion genes, the GST-GFP cassette vector was prepared as follows. After PCR amplification of the GFP cDNA (a gift of Dr. Roger Y. Tsien, University of California, San Diego) to generate SmaI and EcoRI sites at its 5′ and 3′ flanks, the resulting fragments were subcloned into the pGEM-7Zf(+) vector. The vector was cleaved with SmaI and XhoI and subcloned into pGEX-5X-2 vector (Pharmacia). For construction of in-frame fusion proteins, the resultant vector was cleaved withXmaI, treated with Klenow fragment (Takara) in the presence of 0.1 mm dNTPs to blunt the ends, followed by re-ligation and transformation to generate the GST-GFP vector. Various portions of ARNT cDNA described above were inserted at the BamHI site of the GST-GFP2 vector. The direction of inserts was determined by sequencing. To construct GST-NLSc-GFP vector, the core sequence of NLS of SV40 large T antigen generously provided by Dr. Tsuneoka (Kurume University, Fukuoka, Japan), the coding sequence of which was 5′-AAG CTT GCC ATG GGG TGG CCC ACT CCT CCA AAA AAG AGA AAG GTA GAA GAC CCC GGG-3′, was ligated with GFP cDNA at the SmaI site and subcloned into the pGEM-7Zf(+) vector. TheBamHI-EcoRI fragment of the resultant was ligated to the pGEX 2T (Pharmacia) vector to give the GST-NLSc-GFP vector. Electroporation was carried out using 15 μg each of β-Gal fusion protein expression vectors and cells (3.5 × 106) in 400 μl of K-PBS buffer at 960 microfarads/450 V with Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The electroporated cells were seeded onto a 10-cm plastic dish and incubated at 37 °C under an atmosphere with a 5% CO2 content for 48 h. In situ staining of β-Gal was carried out as follows; the cells were washed twice with PBS, followed by fixation with 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mmMgCl2 for 15 min; they were stained with 0.2% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 3.3 mm each of potassium ferrocyanide and ferricyanide at 37 °C overnight. The GST-ARNT-GFP vectors described above were introduced into theEscherichia coli strain BL21. A single colony was picked and cultured in LB broth/Amp until A 600 reached 1.2, then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm and incubated at 20 °C for 14 h with vigorous shaking. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 15 min, washed with saline, and resuspended in a lysis buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing 500 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. These cells were lysed by two rounds of freeze/thaw treatment, then subjected to sonication. The resultant samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min, and the soluble fractions were collected and subjected to batch purification procedures using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Pharmacia). The purified protein was dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 100 mmpotassium acetate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Microinjection experiments were performed essentially as described previously (43Yoneda Y. Imamoto-Sonobe N. Yamaizumi M. Uchida T. Exp. Cell. Res. 1987; 173: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). After microinjection of samples into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde. Localization of injected GST-ARNT-GFP fusion proteins was examined by fluorescent microscopy. Recombinant PTAC58 and PTAC97 were expressed in BL21 as GST fusion protein as described previously (28Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Kose S. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3617-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Finally, recombinant proteins of PTAC58 and PTAC97 were obtained by cleavage with thrombin to release the GST portion. Preparation of total cytosol of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was conducted as described previously (40Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8559-8565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Digitonin-permeabilized MDBK cells were prepared based on the method of Adam et al. (44Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) as described previously (45Okuno Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell. Res. 1993; 206: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The testing solution (10 μl) consisted of GST-ARNT-(39–61)-GFP and transport buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Transport assay was performed in the presence or absence of cytosol with 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase at 37 °C for 30 min. For the nuclear-binding assay, recombinant PTAC58 and PTAC97 proteins were added and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were fixed and the location of GST-ARNT-GFP fusion proteins was examined. To determine the subcellular localization of human ARNT, we constructed the fusion genes β-Gal and ARNT under the control of the SV40 enhancer/promoter. Since the molecular mass of the β-Gal is large enough (120 kDa) to prevent passage through the nuclear pore by diffusion, bacterial β-Gal has been widely used as a reporter gene for the determination of subcellular localization of expressed protein. The expression vector of β-Gal/ARNT-(1–789) was transfected to three cell lines, including HeLa, Hepa-1, and ARNT-deficient Hepa-1 c4 mutant cells, by means of electroporation. Representative profiles of expressed fusion proteins visualized by in situ staining of β-Gal with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside are shown in Fig. 1. As expected, no staining of the nucleus was observed for the expressed β-Gal alone (Fig. 1 A), while the fusion of β-Gal with the NLS of SV40 large T antigen (β-Gal/SV40 NLS) gave strong nuclear localization in transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). When the chimeric gene of β-Gal/ARNT-(1–789) was expressed, the fused product was clearly localized in the nucleus of all three cell lines tested (Fig. 1 C), which agreed well with the results obtained by immunohistochemical analysis (19Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 618-626PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 428-438PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the region of ARNT required for nuclear localization, various portions of cDNA for ARNT were synthesized using PCR and ligated to the modified β-Gal vector as described above. The chimeric constructs were introduced into HeLa cells, and their localization was examined (Fig. 2). Deletion of the transactivation domain located in the C-terminal portion (Fig.2 B) and/or PAS domain (Fig. 2 C) did not affect the nuclear localization of β-Gal/ARNT fusion proteins. In contrast, fusion proteins of either β-Gal/ARNT-(166–485) (Fig. 2 D) or β-Gal/ARNT-(486–789) (Fig. 2 E) showed cytoplasmic localization, confirming the absence of NLS in these regions. On the other hand, the fusion protein containing the bHLH region of the ARNT-(1–165) showed strong nuclear staining, suggesting the presence of NLS in this region (Fig. 2 C). Since the NLS identified so far contained a cluster(s) of basic amino acids, two candidates of NLS of ARNT can be estimated, one of which is located between 39 and 45 (Arg-Ala-Ile-Lys-Arg-Arg-Pro), while the other is between 99 and 104 (Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Asn-Lys) in the bHLH domain. To identify which segments are involved in the NLS activity of ARNT, we further divided ARNT-(1–165) into two fragments, ARNT-(1–88) (Fig. 2 F) and ARNT-(89–165) (Fig. 2 G). Fusion protein containing the former fragment gave intense nuclear staining, while those containing the latter fragment did not. Finally, ARNT NLS was identified as a region between the 39- and 61-amino acid residues (Figs. 2 Iand 3 A).Figure 1Subcellular localization of β-Gal/ARNT-(1–789) fusion protein in HeLa, Hepa-1, and Hepa-1 c4 mutant cells. An expression vector of β-Gal/ARNT-(1–789) fusion gene was delivered into the indicated cells by means of electroporation. After a 48-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were fixed and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside solution.

https://openalex.org/W2170100728,"Simple epithelia express keratins 8 (K8) and 18 (K18) as their major intermediate filament proteins. We previously showed that several types of cell stress such as heat and virus infection result in a distinct hyperphosphorylated form of K8 (termed HK8). To better characterize K8/18 phosphorylation, we generated monoclonal antibodies by immunizing mice with hyperphosphorylated keratins that were purified from colonic cultured human HT29 cells pretreated with okadaic acid. One antibody specifically recognized HK8, and the epitope was identified as 71LLpSPL which corresponds to K8 phosphorylation at Ser-73. Generation of HK8 occurs in mitotic HT29 cells, basal crypt mitotic cells in normal mouse intestine, and in regenerating mouse hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy. Prominent levels of HK8 were also generated in HT29 cells that were induced to undergo apoptosis using anisomycin or etoposide. In addition, mouse hepatotoxicity that is induced by chronic feeding with griseofulvin resulted in HK8 formation in the liver. Our results demonstrate that a “reverse immunological” approach, coupled with enhancing in vivo phosphorylation using phosphatase inhibitors, can result in the identification of physiologic phosphorylation states. As such, K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation generates a distinct HK8 species under a variety of in vivo conditions including mitosis, apoptosis, and cell stress. The low steady state levels of HK8 during mitosis, in contrast to stress and apoptosis, suggest that accumulation of HK8 may represent a physiologic stress marker for simple epithelia. Simple epithelia express keratins 8 (K8) and 18 (K18) as their major intermediate filament proteins.

Epithelial cells express the keratin subfamily of intermediate filament (IF) 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament(s); K, keratin; GF, griseofulvin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; OA, okadaic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. proteins in a cell-type preferential manner (1Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4541) Google Scholar). More than 20 unique keratin gene products (K1–K20) are characterized and classified into type I (K9–K20) and type II (K1–K8) IFs. This classification has biologic relevance since epithelial cells express in a tissue preferential manner at least one type I and one type II keratins that form noncovalent obligate heteropolymers in a soluble tetrameric form or a more complex filamentous cytoskeletal form (2Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 3Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). For example, glandular simple type epithelia express K8 and K18 (K8/18) with variable levels of K19 and K20, and stratified epithelia express K5/14 basally and K1/10 suprabasally. Although the function of IF proteins, including keratins, remains poorly understood, their importance in human disease is accumulating. For example, mutations in epidermal type keratins (e.g. K5/14, K1/10) result in several blistering and scaling skin diseases (4Fuchs E. Coulombe P.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 899-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Steinert P.M. Bale S.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 280-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6McLean W.H.I. Lane E.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). More recently, a mutation in K18 that is associated with an in vitro assembly defect was identified in a patient with chronic liver disease of “unknown etiology” (7Ku N.-O. Wright T.L. Terrault N.A. Gish R. Omary M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting a predisposition or cause of the patient's cryptogenic cirrhosis (8Omary M.B. Ku N.-O. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although IF protein functions remain poorly understood, characterization of the dynamic and regulatory modification of phosphorylation is beginning to provide important functional clues (9Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. BioEssays. 1996; 6: 481-487Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar,10Ku N.-O. Liao J. Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A functional and regulatory role for IF protein phosphorylation is supported by the location of this modification within the N-terminal “head” and C-terminal “tail” domains of IF proteins which are the domains that impart most of the structural heterogeneity and hence tissue-specific expression of these proteins. In the case of K8/18, phosphorylation regulates filament reorganization in vivo, enhances keratin solubility, plays a role in dictating the localization of K8/18 with specific cellular compartments, regulates the association with the 14-3-3 protein family, and is associated with a variety of physiologic stresses (10Ku N.-O. Liao J. Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). With regard to cell stress, several stress modalities have been associated with hyperphosphorylation of K8/18 including heat stress and virus infection (11Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Omary M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and mitotic arrest (which can be considered a form of stress) of several cultured cell lines (12Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1833-1843PubMed Google Scholar). Also, drug-induced hepatotoxic stress, induced in mice by feeding with a griseofulvin-supplemented diet, resulted in dramatic K8/18 hyperphosphorylation (13Ku N.-O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M. Resurreccion E.Z. Broome R.L. Oshima R.G. Omary M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1034-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Of note, stress-induced K8 hyperphosphorylation is associated with generation of a distinct K8 species, termed HK8 (11Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Omary M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1833-1843PubMed Google Scholar), that migrates slightly slower than K8 after one-dimensional gel analysis. To date, two in vivo K8 phosphorylation sites have been described (14Ku N.-O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7556-7564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). One site, Ser-431, is located in the tail domain of K8 and is phosphorylated after stimulation of cells by epidermal growth factor and is likely to be phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The second site, Ser-23, is located in the head domain of K8 and is a conserved site in all type II keratins. This latter site is also phosphorylated in K6 and hence is likely to be a conserved phosphorylation site that serves a common function in all type II keratins. Other in vitro phosphorylation sites of K8 that were phosphorylated by purified cAMP-dependent protein kinase have also been described (15Ando S. Tokui T. Yano T. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this report we used a “reverse immunological” approach, which entailed utilizing several existing strategies, to identify physiologic K8/18 phosphorylation sites. This approach involves generating monoclonal antibodies that selectively recognize phosphorylated K8 or K18, by immunizing mice with keratins that were purified from cultured human cells that were treated with okadaic acid to generate hyperphosphorylated K8/18. One such characterized antibody (LJ4) selectively recognized HK8, and the epitope of the antibody was identified as Ser(P)-73 of K8. The antibody was then used to demonstrate that formation of HK8 occurs in association with several physiologic events including cell stress, apoptosis, and mitosis. The biologic implications of these findings are discussed. HT29 (human colon) and baby hamster kidney cultured cells and the cDNA for human K8 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Transgenic mice that express wild-type human keratin 18 (termed TG2) have been described previously (16Abe M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Ku N.-O. Michie S. Oshima R.G. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) L2A1 (18Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rabbit anti-human K8/18 antibody 8592 (17Ku N.-O. Michie S. Oshima R.G. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and Troma I rat anti-mouse K8 mAb (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). The LJ4 and LJ5 antibodies are described below. Other reagents/supplies were okadaic acid (LC Services, Woburn, MA), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), Freund's adjuvant, griseofulvin, aphidicolin, and protein kinase A (Sigma), immobilized protein A and BCA protein determination kit (Pierce), enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Corp.), protein kinase Cα (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI), calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, p34 cdc2 and MAPK (New England Biolabs, Cambridge, MA), anisomycin (Calbiochem), and etoposide (Bristol-Myers, Princeton, NJ). For okadaic acid (OA) treatment, HT29 cells were incubated with culture medium containing 1 μg/ml OA for 2 h at 37 °C. Heat stress was done by culturing cells (∼50% confluent and in log phase) at 42 °C for 24 h. To induce apoptosis, cells were treated with 10 μmanisomycin (16 h) or with 200 μm etoposide for 4 h followed by switching to normal culture medium without drug for 48 h. Cell cycle G2/M stage enriched HT29 cells were generated by arresting cells at G1/S using aphidicolin and then washing off the drug and culturing for 10 h (19Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Fernandez R. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This synchronization typically resulted in 70–90% G2/M enriched cells (not shown). Cell cycle analysis was done as described (19Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Fernandez R. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Griseofulvin (GF) feeding (1.25% w/w) or control diet feeding was done for 17 days exactly as described using Balb/c or TG2 transgenic mice (13Ku N.-O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M. Resurreccion E.Z. Broome R.L. Oshima R.G. Omary M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1034-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Partial hepatectomy was carried out as described (13Ku N.-O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M. Resurreccion E.Z. Broome R.L. Oshima R.G. Omary M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1034-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) followed by harvesting of the livers for immunoprecipitation and immunostaining. Sham hepatectomies were done in a manner identical to the experimental hepatectomy (i.e. anesthesia, abdominal wall and peritoneal incision, exposure of the liver, and closure of the incisions) except that liver tissue was not resected. Hyperphosphorylated keratins (K8/18/19) were purified by immunoprecipitation, using mAb L2A1-Sepharose-protein A beads, from cultured HT29 cells that were treated with okadaic acid (1 μg/ml, 2 h). The keratins were eluted from the covalently coupled antibody beads using 9 m urea followed by dialysis in PBS. Balb/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally using 20 μg of purified keratins mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant. The immunizations were repeated four times using incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 4–6-week intervals. Three days before fusion (20Kohler G. Milstein C.

Hybridoma culture supernatants were screened by Western blotting using detergent lysates of HT29 cells that were cultured in the presence or absence of OA. One hybridoma clone (LJ4) reacted preferentially with OA-treated HT29 cell lysates as compared with non-OA-treated HT29 cells. Cells from hybridoma clones of interest were cloned by limiting dilution. mAb LJ5, which reacted equally with phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated K8, K18, and K19 (not shown), was also selected and cloned. The isotypes of mAbs LJ4 and LJ5 were determined as IgG1. Washed cells were solubilized using 1% Nonidet P-40 or 1% Empigen BB (21Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Liao J. Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml OA (45 min, 4 °C). After spinning (16,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation (6 h, 4 °C) with antibodies that are covalently conjugated to protein A-Sepharose. To test the blocking effect of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated synthetic peptides, antibody beads were first incubated with 100 μg of individual peptides in 200 μl of PBS for 1 h followed by the addition of cell lysates (500 μl) and then immunoprecipitation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) was performed using 10% polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out as described (23Liao J. Ku N.-O. Omary M.B. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, tissue or cell lysates, immunoprecipitates, or purified keratin proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. Western blotting was done as described (19Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Fernandez R. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Dot blots were performed using a nitrocellulose membrane. Peptides (0.5 μg in 1 μl) were spotted on the nitrocellulose membrane followed by immunoblotting as done for the Western blotting except that the blocking buffer consisted of 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS (instead of 5% non-fat milk powder in PBS). Peptide synthesis was carried out as described (19Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Fernandez R. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using an automated 9050 Milligen Peptide Synthesizer. The ELISA was done by coating microtiter plates overnight (22 °C) with serial 2-fold dilutions of peptides (0.125 to 4 μg in 100 μl/well) in 100 mm sodium carbonate (pH 9.6). The plates were then rinsed twice with washing buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.05% Tween 20). Blocking was performed for 2 h (22 °C) using 200 μl/well of the coating buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After washing, 100 μl/well of mAb (cell culture supernatant diluted 1:5 in washing buffer) were added in the presence or absence of peptides and incubated for 1 h, following by washing four times. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (100 μl/well, 1:1000 dilution in washing buffer) was added (1 h). Wells were then washed four times followed by the addition of 100 μl/well of the peroxidase substrate (30 min) and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. K8/18 immunoprecipitates, which contain minimally phosphorylated K8/18, were obtained from HT29 cells (24Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This was done by solubilization with 1% Nonidet P-40, spinning, and then solubilization of the pellet with 1% Empigen followed by immunoprecipitation. After heating (95 °C, 1 min) to destroy any associated kinase activity, precipitates were phosphorylated using the following kinases: cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase Cα, calcium/calmodulin-dependeent kinase, p34 cdc2, or MAPK (Erk2) (2 h, 30 °C). The buffers used for each kinase reaction were those recommended by the kinase supplier. For phosphorylation of the synthetic peptides, equal amounts of individual peptides (200 μg in 400 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) were incubated in MAPK buffer (containing 200 μm ATP) with 100 units of MAPK for 2 h at 30 °C. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out exactly as described (19Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Fernandez R. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A Ser-73 to Ala K8 mutant was generated using a Transformer™ kit (Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA for human K8 was used as a template as described (25Ku N.-O. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mutation was confirmed by sequencing followed by subcloning into the pMRB101 mammalian expression vector with an hCMV promoter-directed expression. Transfection was done in baby hamster kidney cells using LipofectAMINE as recommended by the manufacturer. The initial purpose of our study was (i) to generate mAbs that specifically recognize phosphorylated K8 or K18 using a strategy of immunizing mice with hyperphosphorylated keratins, and (ii) to identify the phosphorylation sites that are recognized by such antibodies and study the biologic context of their phosphorylation. Hyperphosphorylated keratins were purified from human colonic cultured HT29 cells that were pretreated with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. This antigen source should enrich for physiologically relevant phosphorylation sites given that treatment of HT29 cells with okadaic acid results in massive hyperphosphorylation of K8/18 (19Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Fernandez R. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Using this approach, a mAb termed LJ4 was generated that preferentially immunoblotted a single species upon inducing hyperphosphorylation of keratins in cultured cells using heat stress or okadaic acid treatment (Fig. 1 B). The increased reactivity of the antibody was not related to keratin protein levels since an independent antibody (LJ5) that recognizes phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated keratins (not shown) afforded similar levels of reactivity (Fig. 1 B). Using immunoprecipitation, mAb LJ4 recognizes the K8/18/19 complex that is also immunoprecipitated by mAb L2A1 (Fig. 1 A), which in turn recognizes the total keratin pool (18Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When compared with L2A1 precipitates, LJ4 preferentially precipitates a species that migrates slightly slower than K8 (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes a–c with d–e). This slower migrating species is similar to what we previously termed HK8 (i.e.hyperphosphorylated K8; Ref. 11Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Omary M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In fact, in some experiments only HK8-like and K18 species are noted after precipitation with the LJ4 antibody (e.g. Fig. 3 D, lane a), and the preferential binding of LJ4 with the HK8-like species is also prominent in cells grown at 37 °C (Fig. 1 A, lane d) in contrast with a barely discernible HK8 using the L2A1 antibody (Fig. 1 A, lane a). Selectivity of the LJ4 antibody to the HK8 species was confirmed by immunoblotting individually purified keratins from cells grown at 37 or 42 °C (Fig. 2 A, note the intense signal with less efficiently transferred HK8). The slight reactivity of the antibody with individually purified K8, K18, and K19 from heat-stressed cells is likely to be primarily related to slight degradation of the HK8 species during the purification process since immunoblotting of minimally manipulated total cell lysates (e.g. Fig. 1 B) shows minimal cross-reactivity. Analysis of the phosphorylated isoforms of K8 and HK8 that are isolated from 42 °C stressed cells showed a shift by one phospho-isoform (i.e. phospho-isoforms of K8 and HK8 begin withisoforms 2 and 3, respectively, Fig. 2 B, panels a–d). The assignment of the phospho-isoforms (versus the non-phosphorylated isoform 1) is based on metabolic labeling with 32PO4 as described in several studies (18Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ku N.-O. Fernandez R. Omary M.B. J.

Of note, dephosphorylation of HK8 using alkaline phosphatase generates K8 (11Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Omary M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1833-1843PubMed Google Scholar), thereby indicating that HK8 formation occurs via a phosphorylation event.Figure 2The LJ4 antibody recognizes HK8, a distinct hyperphosphorylated form of K8. A, individual HK8, K8, K18, and K19 were purified from HT29 cells that were cultured at 37 and 42 °C as described under “Materials and Methods.” 1 μg of each purified keratin was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel followed by transfer to a PVDF membrane and then immunoblotted using mAb LJ4. After blotting, the membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue. Note that although equal amounts of keratin were loaded onto the gel (not shown), a relatively small fraction of HK8 and K8 (that were purified from the 42 °C treated cells) transferred to the membrane. B,individually purified K8 and HK8 (isolated from 42 °C treated cells as in A) were mixed with K18 (isolated from cells grown at 37 °C and used as an internal standard). Samples were subjected to isoelectric focusing in the horizontal dimension and SDS-PAGE in the vertical dimension, followed by Coomassie staining. A duplicate sample to that in panel b was transferred to a PVDF membrane followed by immunoblotting using mAb LJ4 (membrane staining after immunoblotting is similar to that in panel b, not shown). Inpanels a–d, the numbers 1-7correspond to K8 and HK8 isoforms, and the letters a andb correspond to K18 isoforms. The schematic in panel d shows a representation of the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated K8 and HK8 isoforms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the phosphorylation site recognized by mAb LJ4, we tested several kinases for their ability to phosphorylate K8 with subsequent formation of HK8. Of several kinases tested (Fig.3 A), only MAPK resulted in substoichiometric formation of HK8 (Fig. 3 A, lane f, faint band indicated by asmall arrow). Since MAPK is a proline-directed kinase with preferential phosphorylation of serines adjacent to prolines (27Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inspection of the K8 amino acid sequence (not shown) suggested one likely candidate region with the sequence, 67VNQSLLSPLVLE. A second candidate K8 region, 428GLTSPGL, corresponds to Ser-431 which becomes phosphorylated after epidermal growth factor stimulation but does not generate an HK8-like species (not shown). Several peptides were synthesized that corresponded to altering the two potential phosphorylation sites Ser-70 and Ser-73 (Fig. 3 B). Dot blot analysis of these peptides, before and after phosphorylation by MAPK, showed that only phosphopeptides 1 and 2 (Fig. 3 B) bound with mAb LJ4, and phosphopeptide 2 showed a slightly higher LJ4 binding by ELISA (Fig. 3 C). In addition, phosphopeptide 2 completely abrogates the ability of mAb LJ4 to immunoprecipitate HK8/K18, whereas phosphopeptide 1 shows partial inhibition (Fig.3 D). One possible explanation for the preferential binding of LJ4 to phosphopeptide 2 versus 1 is that in vitro phosphorylation at Ser-70 either interferes with binding of the LJ4 antibody and/or with phosphorylation at Ser-73. Further confirmation that Ser(P)-73 is the HK8 phosphorylation site that is recognized by mAb LJ4 was obtained by generating a Ser-73 to Ala (S73A) K8 mutation. As shown in Fig. 3 E, LJ4 binds to HK8 after immunoblotting of K8/18 precipitates obtained from transfected wild-type K8 and K18 but does not bind to K8/18 precipitates obtained from wild-type K18 and S73A K8 co-transfectants. In addition, mAb LJ4 reactivity is not affected upon immunoblotting of an S431A K8 mutant that is co-transfected with wild-type K18 (not shown). Taken together, the data in Figs. 1, 2, 3 indicate that K8 is phosphorylated in vivo on Ser-73 with resultant formation of HK8 and that 71LLpSPLVLE of K8 contains the epitope that is recognized by the LJ4 antibody. The possibility of constitutive K8 Ser-73 phosphorylation that is coupled to Ser-70 dephosphorylation, with subsequent mAb LJ4 reactivity, can be excluded since HK8 formation depends on a phosphorylation event (of Ser-73) (e.g. Fig.3 A), and because of the two-dimensional results of Fig. 2and our previous data that demonstrate K8 hyperphosphorylation upon mitotic arrest and cell stress (11Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Omary M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1833-1843PubMed Google Scholar). We used mAb LJ4 to examine K8/18 filament organization in HT29 cells and in intact animals that are subjected to heat- or drug-induced stress, respectively. In the case of HT29 cells that were cultured at 42 °C, reactivity with the LJ4 antibody was patchy in that some cells reacted intensely with the antibody with surrounding cells showing absent staining (Fig. 4, panels a and d). The majority of cells that bound to the antibody manifested a reorganized dot-like staining pattern (Fig. 4,panel a), which overlapped with the staining pattern observed with a rabbit antibody to K8/18 (not shown). In addition, some cells manifested a filamentous staining pattern after heat stress that was not reorganized in any obvious fashion (not shown). The effect of stress was also tested in mice, in the form of hepatotoxic stress that is induced after feeding mice the hepatotoxic drug griseofulvin (GF) (13Ku N.-O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M. Resurreccion E.Z. Broome R.L. Oshima R.G. Omary M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1034-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Using that model, we previously showed that GF feeding of normal mice (e.g. Balb/c) or transgenic mice that overexpress wild-type human K18 (termed TG2) resulted in liver toxicity in association with marked hyperphosphorylation of K8/18. We used this animal model to investigate if GF-induced hepatotoxicity is associated with phosphorylation of mouse K8 since the motif surrounding human K8 Ser-73 (67VNQSLLSPLVL) is very similar to Ser-79 of mouse K8 (73VNQSLLSPLKL) (TableI). As shown in Fig. 5 A, GF feeding results in phosphorylation of mouse K8 as determined by immunoblotting of equivalent fractions of liver homogenates with mAb LJ4. Immunoblotting of the identical homogenates with a polyclonal antibody, which recognizes human K8/18 and also cross-reacts with mouse keratins, showed an increase in the protein level of K8/18 in some of the GF-fed mice (Fig. 5 A) as described previously (28Hutter H. Zatloukal K. Winter G. Stumptner C. Denk H. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 576-582PubMed Google Scholar). However, any increase in K8/18 levels does not account for the observed reactivity with the LJ4 antibody after GF feeding. Confirmation that mAb LJ4 recognizes mouse K8 was obtained by immunoprecipitation, which results in co-precipitation of HK8/K18 only after GF feeding (Fig.5 B). Double immunofluorescent staining of liver sections showed absent LJ4 staining in livers obtained from control diet-fed mice which become strongly positive in a patchy pattern after GF feeding (Fig. 5 C, panels e–h). In contrast, the anti-mouse K8 Troma I antibody manifests a typical filamentous pa"

We used the mutant apoA-I forms to establish nine stable cell lines, and developed strategies for the large scale production and purification of the mutated apoA-I proteins from conditioned media.HDL and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine binding assays using the variant apoA-I forms have shown that replacement of specific carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic residues Leu222, Phe225, and Phe229 with lysines, as well as replacement of Leu211, Leu214, Leu218, and Leu219 with valines, diminished the ability of apoA-I to bind to HDL and to lyse dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The findings indicate that Leu222, and Phe225, Phe229 located in the putative random coil region, and Leu211, Leu214, Leu218, and Leu219 located in the putative helix 8, are important for lipid binding. In contrast, substitutions of alanines for specific charged residues in putative helices 7, 8, or 9 as well as various point mutations in other regions of apoA-I, did not affect the ability of the variant apoA-I forms to bind to HDL or to lyse dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes. Cross-linking experiments confirmed that the carboxyl-terminal domain of apoA-I participates in the self-association of the protein, as demonstrated by the inability of the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants Δ185–243 and Δ209–243 to form higher order aggregates in solution. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase analysis, using reconstituted HDL particles prepared by the sodium cholate dialysis method, has shown that mutants (Pro165 → Ala,Gln173 → Glu) (Leu311 → Val,Leu214 → Val,Leu318 → Val,Leu319 → Val), Leu222 → Lys,Phe255 → Lys,Phe290 → Lys) and Δ209–243 reduced LCAT activation (38–68%). Mutant (Glu191 → Ala,His195 → Ala,Lys196 → Ala) enhanced LCAT activation (131%), and mutant (Ala162 → Leu,Leu189 → Trp) exhibited normal LCAT activation as compared with the wild type proapoA-I and plasma apoA-I forms. The apparent catalytic efficiency (V max(app)/K m (app)) of the apoA-I mutants ranged from 17.8 to 107.2% of the control and was the result of variations in both the K m and theV max in the different mutants. These findings indicate that putative helices 6 and 7, and the carboxyl-terminal helices 8 and 9 contribute to the optimum activation of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. In addition to their use in the present study, the variant apoA-I forms generated will serve as valuable reagents for the identification of the domains and residues of apoA-I involved in binding the scavenger receptor BI, and facilitating cholesterol efflux from cells as well as aid in the structural analysis of apoA-I.

Kardassis D. Zanni E.E. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1993; 21: 145-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As a component of HDL, apoA-I is the principal physiological activator of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), particularly with physiological lecithins (2Fielding C.J. Shore V.G.

Reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles, formed in vitro by mixing apoA-I with phospholipid-cholesterol vesicles, serve as substrates of LCAT and are converted into cholesteryl ester containing spheres upon incubation with LCAT (4Fielding C.J. Esfahani M. Swaney J.B. Advances in Cholesterol Research. Telford Press, 1990: 271-314Google Scholar). It was shown that rHDL particles have different sizes and that their LCAT activation ability correlates with the conformation of apoA-I on these particles (5Jonas A. Kezdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol.

These domains contain the putative helices 6 and 7 and the hinged domain, which includes the putative helices 4 and 5. The carboxyl-terminal region of apoA-I (residues 190–243) has been shown to be important for lipid and HDL binding as well as for binding to cell membranes (12Allan C.M. Fidge N.H. Morrison J.R.

Although the data obtained with the carboxyl-terminal apoA-I mutants are informative, mapping of the apoA-I domains that are functionally important requires more precise point mutagenesis that disturbs minimally the three-dimensional structure of apoA-I. In the present study we describe the generation and characterization of novel apoA-I variants. Functional analysis established that specific hydrophobic residues in the putative loop region (223–231) and within putative helix 8 (187–223) are important for binding to HDL and for the initial association of apoA-I with multilamellar phospholipid vesicles. A relatively small reduction in LCAT activation was observed for several point mutants as a result of variations in both the apparentK m and V max. The Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, T4 ligase, polynucleotide kinase, and restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). [35S]Methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) and [14C]cholesterol (45–60 mCi/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. The Sequenase sequencing kit was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Materials for the polymerase chain reaction were from Perkin-Elmer. Bactotryptone and Bacto-yeast extract were from VWR (Pittsburgh, PA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and methionine-free DMEM were from Life Technologies, Inc. Materials for the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were described previously (36Zannis V.I. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 823-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). IgSorb was from the Enzyme Center (Boston, MA). BSA, POPC, DMPC, sodium cholate, aprotinin, and benzamidine were from Sigma. Materials for oligonucleotide synthesis were from Applied Biosystems. The oligonucleotides utilized as primers for the in vitro mutagenesis of the apoA-I gene were synthesized by the solid-phase phosphate triester method using an Automated Oligonucleotide Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, model 380-B), according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. The PstI-PstI fragment of the apoA-I gene was ligated to SalI linkers and inserted into theSalI polylinker site of the pUC19 vector. This new plasmid designated pUCA-IN (37Roghani A. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was mutagenized by polymerase chain reaction to introduce two new restriction sites, in intron 3 and at the 3′ end of the apoA-I gene: a NotI site was introduced at nucleotides 1166–1173, and an XhoI site was introduced at nucleotides 2191–2196 of the pUCA-IN plasmid, creating plasmid pUCA-IN*. The SalI-SalI fragment encompassing the apoA-I gene was excised from the pUCA-IN* plasmid and inserted into the unique XhoI site of the pBMT3X vector, thus placing the apoA-I gene under the control of the mouse metallothionine I promoter. This new vector, designated pBMT3X-AI, was digested withNotI and XhoI and was used to replace the normal with the corresponding mutated apoA-I segment, as described below. The fourth exon of the human apoA-I gene was amplified and mutagenized by polymerase chain reaction, using a set of specific mutagenesis primers, containing the mutation of interest, and a set of flanking universal primers, containing the restriction sites NotI andXhoI, using the pUCA-IN* vector as a template (38Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment containing the mutation of interest, was digested with NotI and SalI and cloned into theNotI and XhoI sites of the pBMT3X-AI vector. The variant apoA-I sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. The C127 cell line (ATCC CRC 1616) was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), and grown at 37 °C, in 5% CO2. This cell line is a suitable host for transfection with the bovine papilloma virus-containing plasmids, described above. To generate stable cell lines expressing the apoA-I variants, cells were transfected by the calcium chloride co-precipitation method (39Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar). After selection for 10–15 days in media containing 10 μmCdCl2, surviving colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders. For protein labeling, 60-mm diameter cell cultures were rinsed twice with methionine-free DMEM containing 2 mmglutamine and 10 μm CdCl2, and preincubated in the same media for 2 h. After two additional rinses, the cells were labeled overnight with 0.25 mCi of [35S]methionine. Media were collected, immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-human apoA-I antibodies, and analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described (40Zannis V.I. Breslow J.L. Katz A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8612-8617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell clones overproducing the variant apoA-I forms were grown for 5–7 days in two T-75 flasks, containing DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μm CdCl2. Confluent flasks were trypsinized, and the cells were placed into 850-cm2 roller bottles. The bottles were rotated at 1 rpm, to allow the cells to attach to the surface of the bottle. When the cells had grown to 80–85% confluence, 10 ml of packed Verax microcarriers were added and the speed of rotation was increased to 7 rpm. Prior to use the microspheres were autoclaved in phosphate-buffered saline solution, and subsequently incubated in media containing 1% fetal calf serum. In the roller bottle system, the cells grow on 100-μm diameter collagen-coated porous lead microspheres. The cells attach to the collagen matrix and grow both on the surface and inside the beads. The porous nature of the microspheres greatly increases the surface area available to the cells allowing very high cell density. The constant rotation of the bottles, combined with the increase in the surface area, allows gas exchange to take place at an increased rate. The cells were fed twice a week with 300 ml of DMEM medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 10 μm CdCl2. For protein purification, the cells were rinsed twice with serum-free medium, and preincubated in the same medium for 2 h. After one additional rinse, the cells were incubated overnight in serum-free media. The conditioned medium was collected and stored in 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% NaN3, 10 μmaprotinin, and 10 μm benzamidine. Collection of media was repeated every 3–4 days. Medium (1 liter) collected from the roller bottles was concentrated down to 50 ml using an Amicon Ultrafiltration Cell and membranes with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off. The concentrated medium was then dialyzed against 0.01m Tris, pH 8, filtered, and passed through a DEAE HiTrapQ column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was then eluted with a step gradient (5% → 20% → 50% → 100%) of 1 mNH4CO3 in the Tris buffer. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing the apoA-I protein were pooled and further concentrated down to 2 ml, using a Centricon concentrator (Amicon) with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000. The concentrated sample was applied to a gel filtration column, HiPrep Sephacryl S-200 (Pharmacia), at a rate of 0.1 ml/min, and eluted with one column volume (320 ml) of 0.15 mNH4CO3, 0.02% NaN3 buffer at a rate of 0.1–0.5 ml/min. The purity of the apoA-I preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions greater than 95% pure were recovered. The concentration of the apolipoprotein was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm and an extinction coefficient of 1.15 mg−1 cm2. Cell cultures expressing the variant apoA-I proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine in methionine-free medium as described (41Redgrave T.G. Roberts D.C. West C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 42-49Crossref Scopus (863) Google Scholar). A 2-ml aliquot of the culture medium was adjusted to a density of 1.21 g/ml with 0.65 g of potassium bromide, placed in a cellulose nitrate tube, mixed with 100 μg of human HDL, and overlaid sequentially with 1.75 ml of a potassium bromide solution ofd = 1.15 g/ml, 3 ml of each of potassium bromide solutions of d = 1.063 g/ml and d = 1.019 g/ml, followed by normal saline. The tubes were then centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 22 h. After centrifugation, 12 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the tube using a Haake/Buchler fraction collector. The samples were then extensively dialyzed against a 1 mmsolution of cold methionine, dried up in a Speed-Vac, resuspended in one-dimensional SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To quantify the 35S-labeled apolipoproteins, the protein bands of the one-dimensional gels were excised and solubilized in 2.5 ml of 30% (w/v) H2O2, at 60 °C in scintillation vials. The solubilized acrylamide was then mixed with 15 ml of scintillation fluid and counted in an LKB scintillation counter. The binding of the wild type and the various mutant forms of apoA-I to DMPC multilamellar liposomes was studied by kinetic-turbidimetric methods (42Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Kusserow S.K. Gotto A.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). DMPC, dissolved in a glass-distilled chloroform:methanol (2:1) solution, was placed in a glass tube. The sample was dried under nitrogen, and the appropriate amount of a 5 mg/ml solution of apoA-I in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, 0.01% EDTA) was added to it, to give a final DMPC:apoA-I ratio of 2.5:1 (w/w) at a final protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The experiment was performed at 24 °C, and the absorbance at 325 nm was monitored at 5-min intervals using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3A spectrophotometer. The optimal concentration for cross-linking lipid-free apoA-I was 1.2–2.0 mg/ml. Prior to cross-linking the sample was dialyzed overnight in phosphate buffer (0.02 m sodium phosphate, 0.9% NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4) using dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut-off of 3,500. An aliquot of 100 μl of each sample was placed into Eppendorf tubes and 50 μl of 10 mmbis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) solution was added. The solution was vortexed, covered loosely, and incubated at 4 °C, for 3.5 h. At the end of the incubation time, 10 μl of 250 mm ethanolamine quenching solution was added to the reaction mixture. The solution was then concentrated to 1/4 of its original volume, using a Speed-Vac, and run on an 8–25% gradient Phast gel apparatus (Pharmacia) using SDS buffer strips, and electrophoresed for 76 V-h. The rHDL complexes were prepared by the original sodium cholate dialysis method (43Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a molar ratio of 100:10:1:100 of POPC:cholesterol:apoA-I:sodium cholate. In a typical experiment, 0.14 mg of cholesterol (5,000–7,000 cpm of14C-labeled cholesterol/nmol of cold cholesterol) and 2.71 mg of POPC were placed in glass tubes, vortexed gently, and dried under nitrogen. The dried lipid was dissolved in a 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNaN3, and 0.01% EDTA buffer by repeated vortexing. The suspension was stored on ice for 1 h, sodium cholate was added, and the solution was kept on ice for 1 h more. Finally the apoA-I was added, and the incubation was continued for another 1 h. Sodium cholate was removed by dialysis at 4 °C against 5–6 liters of the 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, and 0.01% EDTA buffer, using membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 12,000–14,000. The rHDL particles were analyzed on a native 8–25% acrylamide gradient gel at 15 °C on a Pharmacia Phast-gel system. The rHDL particles were stored at 4 °C in nitrogen to prevent the oxidation of lipids. rHDL particles prepared with different variant apoA-I forms were negatively stained with potassium phosphotungstate using carbon-coated grids, and photographed with a Philips CM12 electron microscope (Philips Electron Optics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). The human LCAT enzyme was purified from normal plasma by ultracentrifugal flotation, followed by chromatography on Affi-Gel Blue, DEAE-Sepharose, and Phenyl-Sepharose columns as described (44Albers J.J. Chen C.H. Lacko A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 763-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For LCAT analysis, the substrate rHDL particle was diluted in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm NaN3, and 0.01% EDTA), to give final apoA-I concentrations ranging from 10−7 to 10−6m. Each reaction mixture contained 50 μl of a 40 mg/ml BSA, 20 μl of 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μl of a 1–2 μg/ml LCAT solution. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. To characterize the mutant apoA-I forms, cell clones expressing the mutant apoA-I genes (Table I) were labeled with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE and autoradiography, using the plasma wild type apoA-I as an internal marker. The Coomassie-stained gel obtained from this analysis shows the position of the plasma apoA-I isoforms that were included in the sample, and the autoradiogram shows the position of the newly synthesized apoA-I. Superimposition of the gel on the autoradiogram establishes the charge and size differences between the plasma apoA-I and the newly synthesized variant apoA-I forms (37Roghani A. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, using this analysis, mutants with charge or size differences from the wild type can be distinguished unequivocally.Table IList of the variant apoA-I forms and rationale for their selectionHelix no.RepeatMutations66Ala152→ Leu,Leu159 → Trp1-aAlter the putative bundle structure of apoA-I in solution.77Pro165 → Ala,Gln172 → Glu1-bAlter the relative orientation of helices 6 and 7.88Glu191 → Ala,His193 → Ala,Lys195 → Ala1-cInvestigate the role of charged residues in inter or intrahelical ionic interactions.88 and 9Glu212 → Ala,Asp213 → Ala,Arg215→ Ala1-cInvestigate the role of charged residues in inter or intrahelical ionic interactions.Leu211 → Val,Leu214 → Val,Leu218 → Val/Leu219 → Val1-dInvestigate the role of specific domains and residues of apoA-I in lipid binding and LCAT activation.910Leu222→ Lys,Phe225 → Lys,Phe229 → Lys1-dInvestigate the role of specific domains and residues of apoA-I in lipid binding and LCAT activation.Glu234 → Ala,Glu235 → Ala,Lys238"
https://openalex.org/W2138864014,"N ε-(Carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) is a stable chemical modification of proteins formed from both carbohydrates and lipids during autoxidation reactions. We hypothesized that carboxymethyl lipids such as (carboxymethyl)phosphatidylethanolamine (carboxymethyl-PE) would also be formed in these reactions, and we therefore developed a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay for quantification of carboxymethylethanolamine (CME) following hydrolysis of phospholipids.In vitro, CME was formed during glycation of dioleoyl-PE under air and from linoleoylpalmitoyl-PE, but not from dioleoyl-PE, in the absence of glucose. In vivo, CME was detected in lipid extracts of red blood cell membranes, ∼0.14 mmol of CME/mol of ethanolamine, from control and diabetic subjects, (n = 22, p > 0.5). Levels of CML in erythrocyte membrane proteins were ∼0.2 mmol/mol of lysine for both control and diabetic subjects (p > 0.5). For this group of diabetic subjects there was no indication of increased oxidative modification of either lipid or protein components of red cell membranes. CME was also detected in fasting urine at 2–3 nmol/mg of creatinine in control and diabetic subjects (p = 0.085). CME inhibited detection of advanced glycation end product (AGE)-modified protein in a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an anti-AGE antibody previously shown to recognize CML, suggesting that carboxymethyl-PE may be a component of AGE lipids detected in AGE low density lipoprotein. Measurement of levels of CME in blood, tissues, and urine should be useful for assessing oxidative damage to membrane lipids during aging and in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2013985904,"The mechanism by which long chain acyl-CoA (LC-CoA) esters affect the ATP-regulated potassium channel (KATP channel) was studied in inside-out patches isolated from mouse pancreatic beta cells. Addition of LC-CoA esters dramatically increased KATP channel activity. The stimulatory effect of the esters could be explained by the induction of a prolonged open state of the channel and did not involve alterations in single channel unitary conductance. Under control conditions, absence of adenine nucleotides, the distribution of KATPchannel open time could be described by a single exponential, with a time constant of about 25 ms. Exposing the same patch to LC-CoA esters resulted in the appearance of an additional component with a time constant of >150 ms, indicating a conformational change of the channel protein. LC-CoA esters were also able to potently activate channel activity at different ratios of ATP/ADP. Simultaneous additions of MgADP and LC-CoA esters resulted in a supra-additive effect on channel mean open time, characterized by openings of very long duration. Following modification of the KATP channel by a short exposure of the patch to the protease trypsin, the stimulatory effect of ADP on channel activity was lost while activation by LC-CoA esters still persisted. This indicates that LC-CoA esters and MgADP do not bind to the same site. We conclude that LC-CoA esters may play an important role in the physiological regulation of the KATPchannel in the pancreatic beta cell by binding to a unique site and thereby inducing repolarization of the beta cell-membrane potential.

Potassium channels that are ATP-sensitive (KATP) 1The abbreviations used are: KATPchannel, ATP-regulated K+ channel; LC-CoA, long chain acyl coenzyme A; NBF, nucleotide binding fold. are found in many types of cells and serve to couple metabolic state to electrical activity. In the pancreatic beta cell the KATP channel provide a critical link between changes in blood glucose concentration and insulin secretion (1Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 2Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. Experientia. 1984; 40: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The initial step in the stimulus-secretion-coupling in the beta cell is closure of the KATP channel subsequent to a rise in the ATP/ADP ratio, resulting in depolarization, activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and thereby triggering of insulin secretion (3Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the beta cell with intermediate glucose concentrations results in a characteristic pattern of slow oscillations in membrane potential on which bursts of action potentials are superimposed (4Dean P.M. Matthews E.K. Nature. 1968; 219: 389-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Intracellular free Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+] i ) oscillates in synchrony with electrical activity (5Santos R.M. Rosario L.M. Nadal A. Garcia-Sancho J. Soria B. Valdeolmillos M. Pflügers. Arch. 1991; 418: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We recently showed that fluctuations in the activity of the KATP channel underlie the oscillations in electrical activity and [Ca2+] i in single pancreatic beta cells (6Larsson O. Kindmark H. Bränström R. Fredholm B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5161-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism underlying such oscillations in KATP channel activity could be metabolism-driven oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio (7Nilsson T. Schultz V. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because of the close relation between KATP channel activity and beta cell electrical activity, it is essential to study mechanisms which control or modulate the activity of this channel. We have recently shown that long-term exposure to free fatty acid increases cellular levels of LC-CoA esters in the beta cell and that these esters are able to directly stimulate KATP channel activity (8Larsson O.

This indicates that increased steady-state content of cytosolic LC-CoA esters could affect glucose-induced closure of the KATP channel. In the present study, we have investigated in detail the mechanisms by which LC-CoA esters exert their stimulatory action and to what extent they interact with ATP and ADP in modulating KATP channel activity in the pancreatic beta cell. These findings show that LC-CoA induces a distinct open state leading to increased channel activity, characterized by openings of long duration which does not require the presence of Mg2+. Thus, binding of LC-CoA induces a conformational change of the KATPchannel protein. A potent stimulatory effect of LC-CoA esters also occurred in the presence of different ratios of ATP/ADP, indicating that the esters may play an important role in modulating the channel under physiological conditions. Adult obese mice (geneob/ob) of both sexes were obtained from a local noninbred colony (9Hellman B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1965; 131: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The mice were fasted for 24 h and then killed by decapitation. The islets of these mice contain more than 90% beta cells (10Nilsson T. Arkhammar P. Hallberg A. Hellman B. Berggren P.O. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Dispersed islets were isolated by a collagenase technique (11Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Collagenase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Germany. A cell suspension was prepared and washed essentially as described previously (12Lernmark A. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Flow Laboratories, Scotland, UK), containing 11 mmglucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 60 μg/ml gentamycin. The cell suspension was seeded into Petri dishes (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1–3 days. The standard extracellular solution contained (in mm): 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES-NaOH at pH 7.4. The intracellular solution (i.e. the bath solution) consisted of (in mm): 125 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 25 KOH, and 5 HEPES-KOH at pH 7.15. ATP was added as the Mg2+ salt to the intracellular solution as shown in the text and figures.Cis-9-monounsaturated oleoyl-CoA (C18:1), myristoyl-CoA (C14:0), and malonyl-CoA (C3:0) were prepared as stock solutions with a concentration ranging from 1 to 5 mm in deionized water (Millipore) and then added to the intracellular solution with final concentrations as indicated in the figures. Nucleotides and CoA esters were all from Sigma. All reagents were of analytical grade. LC-CoA esters reach their target site by partitioning into the lipid phase of the cell membrane. However, the CoA moiety is hydrophilic and not able to flip across the membrane (13Boylan J.G. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Like other endogenous modulators of KATP channel activity, such as adenine nucleotides, the CoA esters are not effective when applied to the extracellular face of the cell membrane (14Ordway R.W. Singer J.J. Walsh Jr., J.V. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Therefore, excised inside-out patches from pancreatic beta cells were used to study the effects of the CoA esters on KATP channel activity (15Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers. Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15169) Google Scholar). This type of recording mode allows free access to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, making it easy to vary the intracellular composition. Pipettes were pulled from alumina- or borosilicate glass (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany), coated with Sylgard near the tips to reduce electrical noise and then fire-polished. The electrodes had resistances between 3–5 mΩ, when filled with standard extracellular solution. Recordings were made using an Axon patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200, Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). During the experiment the current signal was stored on magnetic tape using a VCR (Sony-200, Sony, Tokyo, Japan). Recordings of KATP channel activity were made with the membrane potential (V m ) of the patches clamped at 0 mV. With the solutions used, K+ currents are outward (i.e.into the pipette) and channel records are displayed according to the convention with upward deflections denoting outward ion current. The KATP channel activity was identified based on the unitary amplitude (1.5–2 pA) and the sensitivity to ATP. The experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–24 °C). The zero current potential of the pipette was adjusted with the electrode in the bath, before establishment of the seal. Patches were excised into nucleotide-free solution and 0.1 mm ATP was first applied to test for channel inhibition. After channel inhibition, ATP was removed and the patch was subsequently exposed to the test solutions indicated in text and figures. Records were filtered at 200 Hz (−3 db value, 8-pole Bessel filter, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA), digitized at 800 Hz using an Axon Instrument analogue digital converter (TL-1) and stored in a computer. For trace figures, digitized recordings were exported into CorelDraw (Corel Inc., Ontario, Canada) for final layout. Digitized segments of current records (30–40 s long) were also used to determine channel activity using in-house software. The mean current (i X ) was calculated according to the equation iX=∑j=iN(Ij−IB)/NEquation 1 where N is the number of samples,I j is the current registered in sample j, and I B is the value of a user-defined base line. Unless otherwise indicated, each experimental condition was tested with identical results in at least five (usually more) different patches. The analysis of KATP channel open time was restricted to segments of the experimental records containing a maximum of three active channels. Using the method of maximum likelihood (16Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1983: 191-263Crossref Google Scholar), the kinetic constants were derived by approximation of the data to exponential functions. Channel activities were compared using Student's t test. Recently, we discovered that a new group of substances, LC-CoA esters, can act as potent KATP channel openers and even counteract the blocking effect of ATP (8Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Another important finding is that the esters appear to specifically affect the KATPchannel, in that channel activity of at least two other K+channels present in the beta cell are unaltered by the esters, namely the large conductance K+ channel (KBK) and the 8-pS K+ channel (8Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the stimulatory action of these esters or how LC-CoA esters interact with ADP, which also stimulates channel activity. The present study therefore focuses on effects of LC-CoA esters on single channel kinetics and on the interaction between the esters and adenine nucleotides. Fig. 1, A and B, show channel activity following administration of a 3-carbon (malonyl), 14-carbon (myristoyl), and 18-carbon (oleoyl) CoA ester to inside-out patches shortly after isolation. It is clear that KATPchannel activity, in the presence of myristoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA, was increased compared with the activity under control conditions or with malonyl-CoA containing solutions. In Fig. 1, C–F, we have quantified this effect by analyzing the distribution of channel open time during exposure of the patches to oleoyl-, myristoyl-, and malonyl-CoA. In control solution, channel activity consisted of short openings (Fig. 1, C, inset). The distribution of the openings was best described by a single exponential with a time constant (τ) of 19.8 ms. Mean open time was estimated to be 29.3 ± 4.5 ms (n = 5). In the presence of oleoyl-CoA, there were two types of channel openings, short openings, similar to those observed under control conditions, and long openings, occasionally lasting several hundred milliseconds (Fig. 1 D). The distribution of the openings was best described as the sum of two exponentials with τ values of 49.6 and 260.4 ms, respectively. The slow component comprised 27.6% of the events and the mean open time was increased approximately 3-fold to 84.6 ± 29.0 ms (n = 5). Similar results were obtained when adding myristoyl-CoA to the patch (Fig. 1 E), resulting in τ values of 46.1 and 219.1 ms, respectively, with 19.4% belonging to the slow component. However, when applying malonyl-CoA (Fig.1 F), channel activity did not differ from control conditions with a mean open time of 34.0 ± 9.4 ms (n = 5). The distribution could be described by a single exponential with a time constant of 28.9 ms. We have previously reported comparable effects on KATPchannel open time induced by ADP and diazoxide (17Larsson O. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Fredholm B. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, ADP and diazoxide increase channel activity by promoting a similar long lasting open state. We now demonstrate that, when measured under physiological ionic conditions, LC-CoA esters also induced a conformational change of the KATP channel, leading to a prolonged open state. Another possibility could be that LC-CoA esters affect single channel unitary conductance. We therefore estimated KATP channel conductance in the absence and presence of LC-CoA esters. Under control conditions, the channel conductance was 18.0 ± 0.97 pS (n = 6). The conductance was not significantly changed in the presence of oleoyl- and myristoyl-CoA, 17.7 ± 0.73 pS (n = 7) and 18.1 ± 0.22 pS (n = 4), respectively. Exposing patches to malonyl-CoA was also without effect on channel conductance (17.9 ± 1.2 pS; n = 4). Thus, the stimulatory effect of LC-CoA esters on KATPchannel mean current can not be explained by effects on single channel unitary conductance. In many respects, the LC-CoA esters seem to affect KATP channel activity in a manner similar to ADP. Thus, the ability to counteract the blocking effect of ATP, prevent channel run down (8Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and increase channel open time without affecting single channel conductance are characteristics shared by the two compounds. In this context it should be noted that the CoA moity has a close structural resemblance to ADP, suggesting the possibility of competition for a common binding site. However, on a molar basis, LC-CoA esters are considerably more potent than ADP, and the esters also induce a significantly higher degree of channel stimulation. To what extent this difference between ADP and LC-CoA esters can be accounted for by an additional 3′-phosphate group on the CoA moity is not clear. Nevertheless, this may indicate that LC-CoA esters interact at a site different from that of ADP on the KATP channel complex. In Fig. 2 A, perifusions with 1 μm oleoyl-CoA enhanced channel activity 5-fold. An addition of 0.1 mm MgADP, in the continuous presence of oleoyl-CoA, further increased mean current by 720 ± 220% (n = 4; p < 0.001). Noteworthy is that channel openings were characterized by long openings. As MgADP was withdrawn, the long openings of the channel disappeared. In trace B, addition of 0.1 mmMgADP led to an increase in mean current of 320 ± 100% (n = 3). Channel activity declined significantly as the MgADP concentration was increased to 0.5 mm. Inhibition of KATP channel activity at higher concentrations (>0.3 mm) of MgADP is a well documented effect (18Ghosh A. Ronner P. Cheong E. Khalid P. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22887-22892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ohta M. Nelson D. Nelson J. Meglasson M.D. Erecinska M. Biochem.

Biol. 1992; 129: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Exposing the same patch to oleoyl-CoA, in the continuous presence of MgADP, induced a dramatic augmentation in channel activity with a mean current increase of 690 ± 140% (n = 4). In C, we have quantified the effects by making amplitude-histograms under the different conditions tested in the recording of trace B. Compiled data on mean open time clearly show that a combination of MgADP and LC-CoA ester led to a supra additive effect (Fig.3).Figure 3The effects of ADP and LC-CoA on channel open time.

In an attempt to obtain more information on this matter, we have tried modifying the KATP channel by applying a short pulse of trypsin. This approach was used earlier in studies of various types of ion channels including Na+ (21Armstrong C.M. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 644-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), Ca2+ (22Hescheler J. Trautwein W. J. Physiol. 1988; 404: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and K+ channels (23Trube G. Hescheler J. Schröter K. Secretion and Its Control. The Rockefeller Press, New York1989: 83-95Google Scholar). Although the technique seems crude, it modifies the KATP channel in very specific ways (24Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 424: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). There is a resulting complete loss of the stimulatory effect of ADP as well as of the inhibitory effect of sulfonylurea on channel activity. However, inhibition of channel activity by ATP remains intact, although with slightly decreased sensitivity (24Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 424: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One interpretation is that the binding sites for ADP and sulfonylurea are lost due to alterations of the channel proteins as a result of proteolytic effects of trypsin, which has a primary affinity for arginine and lysine residues (25Benyon R.J. Boyd J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes—A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). Interestingly, in trypsin modified patches, where ADP was totally ineffective in altering channel activity, addition of LC-CoA esters induced a pronounced increase in channel activity. LC-CoA esters were also able to potently counteract ATP-induced inhibition of channel activity in modified patches (Fig. 4). A possible explanation for these results is that trypsin alters or removes the site to which ADP binds to exert activation, whereas the site involved in LC-CoA-induced stimulation remains. These data further support the notion that LC-CoA esters interact at a unique binding site, separate from that of ADP. To further study the interaction between LC-CoA esters and ADP, we performed a series of experiments under Mg2+-free conditions, since the ability of ADP to open channels requires Mg2+. As shown in Fig. 5 A, LC-CoA activated the KATP channel in the absence of Mg2+, whereas ADP3− not only failed to activate but had an inhibitory effect on KATP channel activity (Fig. 5 B) (17Larsson O. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Fredholm B. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This blocking effect of ADP3− is well documented and it has been proposed that ADP3− binds to the ATP site thereby explaining the inhibitory effect on the channel (20Hopkins W.F. Fatherazi S. Peter-Riesch B. Corkey B.E. Cook D.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 129: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Addition of oleoyl-CoA to the patch, in the continuous presence of ADP3−, still evoked a dramatic elevation in channel activity (Fig. 5 B). Analyzing the effects of simultaneous additions of oleoyl-CoA and ADP3− in the absence of Mg2+ in five patches showed an increase of 590 ± 280% in mean currents (p < 0.01). Inclusion of Mg2+ in the perifusion medium caused the KATP channel activity to display openings of long duration. Together these observations lend strong support to the idea that simultaneous exposure of the KATP channel to a combination of LC-CoA esters and MgADP, results in a unique activity pattern with extremely long open times, not previously observed with either substance alone. All effects of the LC-CoA esters were fully reversible upon withdrawal. Due to the extreme pattern and the resulting high number of open channels in the patches, a precise determination of channel open time was not possible. Earlier studies suggested that the physiological regulation of the KATP channel results from changes in the ATP/ADP ratio (3Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), changes in ADP exerting the major influence (1Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). This implies that ATP-induced blockade of the channel is potently counteracted by intracellular ADP. We therefore assessed the extent to which LC-CoA esters were able to further activate channel activity in the presence of fixed ATP/ADP ratios. Fig. 6 A shows the effect of 100 μm ATP and ADP on channel activity, a ratio which has been reported to give maximal stimulation of KATPcurrents. Subsequent addition of 1 μm oleoyl-CoA, in the continuous presence of nucleotides, resulted in an augmentation of the KATP currents. In six out of six patches we found that addition of oleoyl-CoA, in the presence of 100 μm ATP and ADP, increased mean currents significantly (380 ± 140%p < 0.01; n = 5). Adding LC-CoA esters to 500 μm ATP and ADP also induced an increase in KATP channel activity (Fig. 6 B). It should, however, be pointed out that the most dramatic effects were seen when the nucleotides and CoA ester were washed out. Thus, just after withdrawal of the substances, we repeatedly observed the same channel activity pattern as following the combination of MgADP and LC-CoA ester (see Fig. 3), characterized by channel activity with very long openings. A possible explanation for this phenomena is that ADP is washed-out more slowly than ATP (26Schwanstecher M. Loser S. Rietze I. Panten U. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmakol. 1991; 343: 83-89Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), leaving MgADP and LC-CoA at their binding sites. Even at an ATP/ADP ratio of 10, administration of 1 μm oleoyl-CoA potently increased channel activity (Fig.6 C). The recent cloning of the rat sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) (27Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement 4th, J.P. Boyd 3rd, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar) combined with the reconstitution of the KATP channel (28Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P., IV Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar) has elegantly shown that the beta cell KATP channel is encoded by the SUR1 and an inwardly rectified K+ channel (Kir6.2) (Fig. 7) with small intrinsic activity. The SUR1 belongs to a superfamily of ATP-binding cassette proteins and comprises a 13-membrane spanning segment and two cytosolic nucleotide binding folds (NBFs) (27Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement 4th, J.P. Boyd 3rd, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). It is not clear which physiological agonists interact with the two NBFs. Recent data indicate that NBF-2 is involved in ADP binding, since mutation of this site leads to a lack of stimulatory effect of ADP which is no longer able to counteract the blocking effect of ATP (29Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Bryan J. Science. 1996; 272: 1785-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). To what extent LC-CoA esters are interacting with the NBFs is at present not known. Although it is generally believed that the main physiological activator of the KATP channel in the pancreatic beta cell is ADP, we now confirm that LC-CoA esters are potent activators of the channel (8Larsson O.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and that the kinetic effects on channel activity is similar to those of ADP. Furthermore, the LC-CoA esters are able to activate the channel in the absence of nucleotides, at various concentrations of ATP and ADP as well as to counteract the blocking effect of ATP (8Larsson O.

The fact that a combination of ADP and LC-CoA ester resulted in supra-additive effects on mean channel open time and that trypsin fully eliminates the stimulatory effect of ADP, under conditions where CoA esters still stimulated the channel, strongly suggest that ADP and LC-COA esters do not bind to the same site. Thus, LC-CoA esters form a class of substances which with high potency activates the beta cell KATP channel. The fact that most of our results were obtained by CoA esters derived from oleate, which is one of the predominant free fatty acid components in rodent and man plasma, supports the notion that these esters may serve the function of important modulators of beta cell electrical activity and thereby insulin release under physiological conditions."

Biophysical studies and DNA sequences suggest that the heme environment and catalytic cycle of MnP are similar to those of other heme peroxidases, such as horseradish peroxidase and LiP (31Dunford H.B.

However, MnP is unique in its ability to catalyze the one-electron oxidation of MnII to MnIII (18Glenn J.K. Akileswaran L. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem.

Gold M.H. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32759-32767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These structures also confirm that the heme environments of LiP and MnP are similar to those of cytochromec peroxidase, plant, and fungal peroxidases (38Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H.

However, MnP has a unique cation binding site consisting of Glu-35, Glu-39, Asp-179, and one of the heme propionates, and this site has been proposed as the MnII binding site (39Sundaramoorthy M. Kishi K. Gold M.H. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32759-32767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Johnson F. Loew G.H. Du P. Welinder K.G. Rasmussen S.K. Penel C. Greppin H.

The recent characterization of MnP site-directed mutants at Asp-179, Glu-35, and Glu-39 (41Kusters-van Someren M. Kishi K. Lundell T. Gold M.H.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8986-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) suggests that these residues form the manganese binding site. In the present study, we have crystallized MnP in the presence of various amounts of MnII to further probe the MnII binding site of this protein. In addition, we have solved and refined the crystal structures of a single mutant (D179N) and a double mutant (E35Q,D179N) of amino acid ligands at the MnII binding site. Wild-type MnP isozyme 1 was purified from the extracellular medium of acetate-buffered, agitated cultures ofP. chrysosporium strain OGC101, a derivative of strain BKM-F-1767, as described (17Glenn J.K. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 242: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 21Wariishi H. Dunford H.B. MacDonald I.D. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3335-3340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration was determined at 406 nm using an extinction coefficient of 129 mm−1 cm−1 (17Glenn J.K. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 242: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In an attempt to remove the enzyme-bound MnII ion, MnP was applied to a Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) column (1.0 × 20 cm), equilibrated with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at room temperature, and eluted with the same buffer. The protein was desalted by ultrafiltration. The MnII and CaII content of the Chelex-treated MnP (MnP*) was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by overlap extension (43Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using the polymerase chain reaction as described (41Kusters-van Someren M. Kishi K. Lundell T. Gold M.H.

Genet. 1990; 17: 305-311Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Production and purification of variant proteins were as described previously (41Kusters-van Someren M. Kishi K. Lundell T. Gold M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10620-10627Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42Kishi K. Kusters-van Someren M. Mayfield M.B. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Gold M.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8986-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Crystals of MnP*, the D179N single mutant MnP and the E35Q,D179N double mutant MnP, were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method as described (45Sundaramoorthy M. Kishi K. Gold M.H. Poulos T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μl of the protein solution (9–19 mg/ml) were mixed with an equal volume of 30% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5) and equilibrated against 1 ml of the same buffer for 1–2 days. The protein solution drops were microseeded by first touching the crystals of native MnP crystals with a very thin metal wire and then touching the protein solution drops. For macroseeding, the small seed crystals grown by touch seeding were washed successively in solutions containing 35, 32.5, and 30% polyethylene glycol 8000. A washed seed crystal was added to a freshly pre-equilibrated protein solution drop, after which diffraction quality crystals grew to the required size in a few weeks. Co-crystallization of MnP* in the presence of MnII or EDTA was carried out by mixing the appropriate reagent with the protein solution drops. MnP* and MnII co-crystals [MnP*(Mn)] were grown with 2 mm MnSO4 in the protein solution. EDTA (2 mm) was included in the drops to grow crystals of MnP*(EDTA). During crystallization at ambient temperature, it was observed that either the protein denatured or the crystals bleached within 2 weeks, except in the case of MnP*(Mn); therefore, MnP*, MnP*(EDTA), E35Q,D179N, and D179N crystals were grown at 7–8 °C. The crystals were very stable at room temperature during data collection and diffracted to high resolution so that complete data sets could be collected with one crystal in each case. All data sets were collected on a Siemens area detector system using a rotating anode x-ray source equipped with focusing optics. The data were indexed in the C2 space group with the same unit cell as the native crystal (a = 163.24 Å, b = 45.97 Å, c = 53.57 Å and β = 97.16°) and processed using the XENGEN software package (46Howard A.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32759-32767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the starting model for refinement in all cases. With MnP*, MnP*(EDTA), and MnP*(Mn), a 50-cycle positional refinement with B factors set at 15 Å2 was carried out, followed by 10 cycles of group B factors and 20 cycles of individual B factors for all non-hydrogen atoms using X-PLOR (47Brünger, A. T. (1992) X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1, Yale University, New Haven, CT.Google Scholar) (Table II). Objective estimates of the relative occupancies of the MnII site were obtained by refining the models using the common reflections observed in all the data sets in the 8.0–2.3-Å resolution range with a F> 2ς(F) cutoff. F o −F c omit electron density maps were generated by removing MnII from the models, followed by 20 rounds of positional refinement. When MnII was included in the refinement, the B factor for MnII was set equal to the overall temperature factor obtained from the Wilson plot for the same set of reflections, and only the occupancy of MnII was refined in the last round of refinement. The refinements converged typically in 6–7 cycles. Alternatively, the occupancy for MnII was set to unity, and the B factor was refined for all the data sets. Various measurements of the relative occupancies of the MnII site, i.e. F o −F c electron density, B factor, and occupancy, are listed in Table III for all data sets.Table IICrystallographic refinement summaryCrystalMnP*MnP*(Mn)MnP*(EDTA)E35Q-D179ND179NResolution range (Å)8.0–2.38.0–2.08.0–2.28.0–2.08.0–2.0Reflections measured16,38425,56218,75325,11725,321Reflections used, F > 2 ς(F)14,51123,90716,49522,24823,362Rfactor2-aR = Σ‖‖F o ‖ − ‖F c ‖‖/Σ‖F o ‖.0.1820.2000.1820.1870.213RMS deviation of2-bThe RMS deviations of bond parameters represent the root mean square deviations from expected values.

Open table in a new tab In the refinement of the mutant structures, the MnII and its ligands, with the exception of the heme, were omitted from the refinement, and electron density maps were calculated. The changes around the MnII were discernible in the difference Fourier maps. The side chains and solvent structure around the mutated sites were rebuilt guided by the 2F o −F c and F o −F c maps using the TOM FRODO graphics software (48Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), followed by refinements of the model iteratively until the maps were fitted satisfactorily and R factors converged. At the final stage, omit maps were calculated excluding the remodeled side chains and solvent molecules from 25 cycles of positional refinement. The details of refinement are provided in Table II. The crystal structure of the native MnP was reported earlier, and the proposed MnII binding site was based on this structure (39Sundaramoorthy M. Kishi K. Gold M.H. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32759-32767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The obligatory substrate for the enzyme, MnII, binds to a heme propionate and is coordinated to five other ligands in an octahedral geometry (Fig. 1). Three of the MnII ligands are acidic amino acid side chains, Glu-35, Glu-39, and Asp-179, and the remaining two are oxygen atoms of water molecules. The site is at the surface of the protein and is accessible to the solvent. When grown at room temperature, the crystals of the Chelex-treated protein, MnP*, bleached before growing to a size suitable for diffraction. However, the crystals were stable at 7 °C and grew to full size, although at a slower rate. The data set for MnP* extended to a slightly lower resolution compared with the average resolution of the native MnP crystals previously obtained (Table I) (39Sundaramoorthy M. Kishi K. Gold M.H. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32759-32767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference Fourier map calculated with the MnIIexcluded from the structure showed a reduced, but significant, electron density peak at the MnII site indicating that MnII was not removed completely (Table III). Crystals grown in the presence of EDTA [MnP*(EDTA)] were similar to MnP* crystals but exhibited a much lower peak in the F o −F c electron density map, which was close to the average peak height of water (Fig. 2 A and Table III). However, there was no change in the orientation of the MnII ligands, suggesting that the MnP*(EDTA) crystal still might have a cation bound, either MnII with much lower occupancy or possibly another cation such as sodium. MnP* crystals grown in the presence of excess MnII[MnP*(Mn)] showed approximately the same peak height at the MnII binding site as observed in the initial MnP structure determination (Fig. 2 B and Table III) (39Sundaramoorthy M. Kishi K. Gold M.H. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32759-32767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the proposed MnII site in the enzyme was at least partially occupied by MnII ion throughout the purification process. Importantly, the addition of excess MnII to MnP* did not lead to a new electron density peak, strongly suggesting that there is no other major MnII binding site in MnP. To gain some insight into relative occupancies and disorder, we used two different refinement approaches, considering only the common reflections in the 8.0- to 2.3-Å resolution range for all of the crystals. First, the occupancies were held constant at 1.0 for all non-hydrogen atoms, including the MnII ion, and the crystallographic temperature or B factors were refined. TheB factor of the MnII ion refined to a value of 33.5 Å2 compared with 8.4 and 10.0 Å2 for the two calcium sites in the native data set. On the other hand, theB factor for the MnII site for MnP*(EDTA) data increased to 58.0 Å2. In the second set of refinements, the B factor of the MnII site was fixed at the value determined from Wilson statistics, and the occupancy of the MnII site was refined. The occupancy fell well below 1.0 in all cases, the lowest being 0.37 for MnP*(EDTA). These results suggest that the MnP*(Mn) and native MnP crystals were more fully occupied with MnII, whereas crystals grown in the absence of MnII or in the presence of EDTA were only partially occupied with MnII or possibly occupied with another cation such as sodium. The F o −F c maps for the D179N mutant data set, calculated using the native MnP coordinates, including and excluding the MnII and its ligands, suggested the absence of a cation in the MnII site (Fig. 3 A). The maps are very noisy in this region, indicating large changes in the structure as a result of the mutation. The mutated residue, Asn-179, undergoes very little conformational change from its native position, except a small rotation of ≈30° about the Cβ⎻Cγ bond. However, the other two MnII ligands, Glu-35 and Glu-39, undergo large changes (Fig. 4 A). Both Glu-35 and Glu-39 turn away from the MnII site and, consequently, the solvent structure in this region rearranges. The Glu-35 side chain rotates almost 110° about the Cβ⎻Cγ bond and becomes solvent-exposed. This leaves a void that fills with two solvent molecules (Wat-653 and Wat-441). Wat-653 is about 1.5 Å from the MnII site and still interacts with the side chains of Asn-179 and Glu-39 and with the propionate. Wat-520, bridging the two propionates and a ligand to MnII in the native structure, moves about 2.0 Å. In its new position, this water forms a hydrogen bond interaction with the side chain amide of Asn-179.Figure 4Stereo representations of refined structures and interactions around the MnII binding site in the D179N single mutant (A) and in the E35Q,D179N double mutant (B). In E35Q,D179N, Gln-35 is modeled in two conformations, and Wat-653 is present only in the open conformation of Gln-35. In D179N Wat-653 is fully occupied, and the extra space left by the movement of Glu-35 is occupied by Wat-441. Wat-653 forms hydrogen bond interaction with the heme propionate, Glu-39, Asn-179, and a solvent (Wat-441 in the single mutant and Wat-650 in the double mutant).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar to the single mutant, the difference Fourier map calculated using the E35Q,D179N double mutant data set and the coordinates of native MnP, including and excluding MnII and its non-heme ligands, do not show any significant positive density that can be interpreted as a cation in the vicinity of the MnII site. On the other hand, the difference map calculated using the complete set of native MnP coordinates showed a large negative peak in the MnII site (Fig. 3 B), indicating the absence of a cation or only partial occupancy of this site. The refined structure of the mutant around the MnII site is shown in Fig. 4 B. One of the mutated residues, Gln-35, is disordered and appears to be in multiple conformations. Gln-35 was modeled in two conformations, one pointing outward and the other pointing inward as in the native conformation, with 50% occupancy of each. In one of the two conformations, Gln-35 retains a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg-177. In the conformation pointing outward, the void is occupied by a water molecule (Wat-653) which is about 1.5 Å from the MnII site. This is similar to the single mutant structure (Fig. 4, A and B). The other mutated residue, Asn-179, undergoes little conformational change from the native position of Asp-179. There is a ≈30° rotation about the Cβ⎻Cγ bond, which does not alter its position or local interactions significantly. The side chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn-179 retains the hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Ala-187 and the side chain amino group hydrogen bonds with the invariant solvent molecule (Wat-459), analogous to the native structure. In the double mutant protein, Glu-39 undergoes a dramatic conformational change in the absence of a cation in the proposed MnII site, swinging out and away from the MnIIsite. One of the side chain carboxylate oxygens of Glu-39 in the mutant forms a weak hydrogen bond (3.2–3.3 Å) with both conformations of the Gln-35 side chain. In the absence of the cation in the double mutant, one of the solvent ligands, Wat-520, moves by 2.0 Å out of the plane formed by the heme propionates, while still bridging the heme propionates as was observed in the single mutant. Another feature of the mutant structure is the large movement of the distal Arg-42 toward the peroxide binding pocket, so as to form a hydrogen bond with the distal Wat-556. This Arg is invariant in non-mammalian heme peroxidases and has been implicated as an important residue"

The biologic actions of GM-CSF are mediated by binding to a specific receptor consisting of two chains designated as α and β subunits. We have demonstrated that the murine FDC-P1-derived cell line WT-19 transfected with the human GM-CSF receptor α and β subunits (GM-CSFRα and β) can be induced to differentiate by the addition of human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF). By expressing a series of GM-CSFRα mutants in WT19 cells, we have determined the amino acid domains of the GM-CSFRα cytoplasmic domain that regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. We found that the membrane proximal proline-rich domain and adjacent 16 residues are essential for both hGM-CSF-dependent cell proliferation and differentiation. In contrast, the C-terminal region of the GM-CSFRα cytoplasmic domain was not necessary for cell differentiation mediated by hGM-CSF, but the removal of this region severely impaired the ability of hGM-CSF to support cell survival. While the activation of JAK2, Shc, Erk, and STAT5 proteins correlated with hGM-CSF-mediated cell growth, cellular differentiation occurred in the absence of activation of these signal transduction pathways.

GM-CSF causes a major cytoskeletal reorganization in plasma cells and hairy cells, resulting in the inhibition of motility and loss of adhesion to cellular and matrix ligands (9Till K.J. Burthem J. Lopez A. Cowley J.C. Blood. 1996; 88: 479-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biologic actions of GM-CSF are mediated by binding to a specific receptor consisting of α and β subunits, both of which are members of the type-I cytokine receptor family (10Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 11Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai T. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). A soluble form of human GM-CSF receptor α subunit (GM-CSFRα) has also been identified, whose functionin vivo is unclear (12Ashworth A. Kraft A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Raines M.A. Liu L. Quan S.G. Joe Y. DiPersio J.F. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8203-8207Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). While the β subunit does not bind GM-CSF by itself, it forms a high affinity receptor in combination with the α subunit (11Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai T. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The β chain is called the common β chain (βc) because it is shared by interleukin 3 (IL3) and interleukin 5 (IL5) receptors (14Kitamura T. Sato N. Arai K. Miyajima A.

Although the cytoplasmic domain of GM-CSFRα is only 54 amino acids, we and others have demonstrated that the GM-CSFRα cytoplasmic domain is necessary for GM-CSF-induced cell proliferation (16Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.L. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth Diff. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar, 17Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

Several studies showed that the cytoplasmic domain of the human GM-CSF receptor β chain (GM-CSFRβ) is also essential for the mitogenic signal (18Weiss M. Yokoyama C. Shikama Y. Naugle C. Druker B. Sieff C.A. Blood. 1993; 82: 3298-3306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, because of the lack of adequate biologic model cell systems, the role of GM-CSFR α and β subunits in GM-CSF-induced cell differentiation has not been clearly demonstrated. The present study defines the role of GM-CSFRα in GM-CSF-mediated differentiation by studying WT19 cells, an FDC-P1-derived cell line that uniformly differentiates toward the monocytic lineage in response to murine GM-CSF (mGM-CSF), but grows and does not differentiate in the presence of murine IL3 (mIL3) (20Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Diff. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dexter T.M. Garland I. Scott D. Scolnick E. Metcalf D. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1026-1047Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar). We find that when the wild type human GM-CSFR α and β subunits are both transfected into WT19 cells, these cells respond to the addition of human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF) by undergoing differentiation. To identify the residues of GM-CSFRα cytoplasmic domain necessary for the induction of cell differentiation, WT19 cell lines were established which express mutated cytoplasmic domains of the α subunit along with the wild type β subunit. The ability of GM-CSF to support cell survival of WT19 correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, STAT5, Shc, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). However, the induction of differentiation in the cells containing the 18-amino acid deletion of the C-terminal region occurred without the detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of these four signaling molecules. Our results suggest that cell survival and differentiation are controlled by different signal transduction pathways regulated by varying portions of the GM-CSFRα. WT19 is a cell line established from a mouse factor-dependent myeloid cell line, FDC-P1 (a generous gift from Dr. Larry Rohrschneider, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). The cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium containing mIL3. Recombinant hGM-CSF was purchased from Immunex Corp. (Seattle, WA). Recombinant mGM-CSF and mIL3 were obtained from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). The human GM-CSFRβ cDNA was removed from the plasmid pKH97 (a gift from Dr. A. Miyajima, DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA), and the 2.9-kilobase pair fragment was ligated into pCEP4 (Invitrogen), which contains a hygromycin selection marker giving the plasmid pCEP4-GM-CSFRβ. The 1.3-kilobase pair human GM-CSF receptor α chain cDNA was removed from pCDM8 vector (12Ashworth A. Kraft A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and ligated into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) giving the plasmid pCMV-GM-CSFRα. To construct GM-CSFRα mutants, GM-CSFRα cDNA was cloned into M13 mp19. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a kit from Amersham, using oligonucleotides: GGGAACAGCCGTCATCACCTAAGGAAC (ter1), CTTTCCCTTCTCATCAGGTGAATTCCTC (ter3), CCTCATGGTTATCCCTAAGGAACCTT (del1), TCCCTTCCTCTGGATTCAGTTTGTCT (del2), GTCTTTGATCTGTATCCTAAGGAACC (del3), TGGAACTGGACCGAACAGC (P357G), TCTGTTCGTCAGTGTGAAGATCAGAGC (P358G), CTTTGATCTGACCAACTGGCGG (P360G). The mutated cDNAs were isolated and ligated into pcDNA3 vector. The structure of the constructs was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequence analysis. pCEP4-GM-CSFRβ was introduced into WT19 cells by electroporation at 260 V, 975 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser, and transfectants isolated using hygromycin (0.4 mg/ml). A clone termed WT19 β1 expressing GM-CSFRβ was used for the transfection of pCMV-GM-CSFRα wild-type or mutant subunits. Resistant clones containing the α subunit were then isolated using G418 selection (0.4 mg/ml). Resulting clones were screened by flow cytometry using anti-human GM-CSFRα monoclonal antibody, and three to five positive clones from each construct were expanded for further studies. 5,000 cells were incubated in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and various concentrations of hGM-CSF for 14 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. 20 μl of freshly prepared combined 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt/phenazine methosulfate (MTS/PMS) solution (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each sample. After an additional 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the conversion of MTS into the aqueous soluble formazan was measured at an absorbance of 490 nm. Polyclonal anti-human GM-CSFRβ anti-sera were prepared using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 47–93 of GM-CSFRβ (16Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.L. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth Diff. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-Shc polyclonal antibody and the anti-STAT1 polyclonal antibody were obtained from Signal Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-STAT3 and STAT5 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The STAT5 antibody (sc-835) is specific for both STAT5a and STAT5b. The anti-human GM-CSFRα monoclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. A. F. Lopez (Instiute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia). The anti-Mac1 and Mac3 rat monoclonal antibodies were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). The anti-F4/80 rat monoclonal antibody was purified from the culture supernatant of HB198 rat hybridoma cell line obtained from ATCC. Cells were lysed in PLC buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mmNaPPi, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin) at 108 cells/ml. The lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked for 2 h in 2% bovine serum albumin-TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with primary antibodies in TBST for 1 h, washed three times with TBST, and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham) diluted 1:10,000 in TBST. After three washes in TBST, the blot was developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for an additional 1 h. The beads were washed three times in PLC lysis buffer, and then suspended in SDS-sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The eluted proteins were applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and proteins detected by Western blotting. Total cellular RNAs were extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 15-μg aliquots of the total RNAs were fractioned on 1% agarose gel containing 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and 6% (v/v) formaldehyde, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV-cross-linking, membranes were soaked in prehybridization solution (6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide) for 3 h at 42 °C followed by incubation with 32P-labeled probe in hybridization solution (6 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide) for 14 h at 42 °C. The membranes were washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min twice at room temperature; in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min twice at 50 °C; and then exposed to Kodak XAR films. hGM-CSF binding assay was performed as described previously (22Park L.S. Friend D. Gillis S. Urdal D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4177-4183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 20 mm Hepes for 4 h at 37 °C, and incubated in binding buffer (RPMI 1640 + 2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes) containing varying concentrations of125I-hGM-CSF (NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min at 37 °C. To measure nonspecific binding, 100-fold excess of cold hGM-CSF was added. The cells were centrifuged through a phthalate oil layer (3:2, dioctyl phthalate/di-n-butyl phthalate). The radioactivity of the cell pellet was counted in a γ counter. The binding data were subjected to Scatchard analysis. Before lysis, cells were incubated for the indicated time periods in medium supplemented with hGM-CSF (10 ng/ml) followed by a wash in PBS. The cells were then incubated in cell lysis buffer (10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml Proteinase K) for 14 h at 50 °C. After an additional 3-h incubation with the addition of 0.25 mg/ml RNase, the genomic DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. DNA fragments were visualized after 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis by ethidium bromide staining. WT19 cells (20Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Diff. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar) growing in mIL-3 demonstrated a myeloblastic morphology including rounded nuclei, fine chromatin, and thin and basophilic cytoplasm. In response to mGM-CSF, the cells demonstrated monocytic characteristics: an indented nucleus with fine-stranded appearance, increased cytoplasm containing a variable number of vacuoles, and larger total cell size. Cells treated with mGM-CSF also became positive for nonspecific esterase and acid phosphatase (Table I). To quantitate the number of cells undergoing differentiation after the addition of mGM-CSF or mIL3, surface marker changes were evaluated by FACS analysis. WT19 cells growing in mIL3 showed weak surface expression of F4/80 and Mac3 (Fig. 1 A), both of which are monocytic specific markers (23Austyn J.M. Gordon S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 24Ho M.-K. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 636-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25McKnight A.J. Macfarlane A.J. Dri P. Turley L. Willis A.C. Gordon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 486-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). When the WT19 cells were incubated with mGM-CSF, the expression of both these markers was significantly increased, suggesting that the cells differentiated toward monocytic lineage (Fig. 1 A). As demonstrated by FACS analysis, cell size and granularity also increased as evidenced by an increase in both forward scattergram (FSC) and side scattergram (SSC) (Fig. 1 A). These characteristics were stable for at least 14 days (Fig. 1 A). Differentiated cells continued to divide, and the cell number increased. Increases in both F4/80 expression and cell granularity were evident within 1–2 days after the addition of mGM-CSF (Fig. 1 B). Washing out the mGM-CSF and replacing it with mIL3 caused the F4/80 expression to decrease to background levels within 3 days (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that mGM-CSF-induced monocyte/macrophage differentiation of WT19 cells is a reversible phenomenon. In addition, mGM-CSF induced cell differentiation of WT19 in the presence of mIL3, suggesting mGM-CSF-mediated differentiation signal is dominant over mIL3 (data not shown).Table IDifferentiation markers of WT19 cells after mIL3 and mGM-CSF stimulationMorphologySurface markersStainingCell sizeGranularityF4/80Mac1Mac3Nonspecific esteraseSpecific esteraseAcid phosphataseIL3+++−+−−−GM-CSF++++++++−++++−+ Open table in a new tab To examine the ability of hGM-CSF to mediate the differentiation of WT19 cells, cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding human GM-CSFR β subunit containing a hygromycin resistance selectable marker. A clone expressing high levels of GM-CSFR β, WT19 β clone 1, was then transfected with the G418-selectable expression plasmid encoding GM-CSFRα wild type subunit, and the cells were further selected in G418. Treatment of these doubly transfected cells with hGM-CSF induced differentiation of WT19 cells as measured by changes in F4/80 and Mac3 surface markers (Fig. 2). This hGM-CSF-induce differentiation was also found to be reversible upon removal of human hGM-CSF (data not shown). We have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of the α subunit regulates growth of factor-dependent hematopoietic cells (16Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.L. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth Diff. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar, 17Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14607-14613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific residues of the α subunit are highly conserved among growth factor receptors (Fig. 3 B). As hGM-CSF is capable of inducing the differentiation of WT19 cells, it is possible to evaluate the role of the cytoplasmic domain in GM-CSF-mediated cell growth, survival, and differentiation. A series of expression plasmids encoding deletion and substitution mutants of GM-CSFRα (Fig.3 A) were created; ter1 mutant lacks the entire cytoplasmic domain except for the membrane-proximal 5 amino acids; del1 has an internal deletion of 15 amino acid residues corresponding to the proline-rich box 1 region, which is well conserved among the type I cytokine receptor family; del2 has an internal 16-amino acid deletion adjacent to the box 1 region; del3 has an 8-amino acid deletion within the box 1 region removing the proline-rich domain (PPVP) (Fig.3 B); ter3 has a deletion of the C-terminal 18 amino acid residues; and three individual amino acid substitutions have mutations in the well conserved proline-rich domain: proline 357, 358, or 360 (Fig. 3A). These GM-CSFRα expression plasmids were transfected into WT19 β clone 1, and the G418-resistant clones were isolated. The levels of expression of these mutants were analyzed by staining with a specific anti-GM-CSFRα monoclonal antibody followed by flow cytometric analysis with a FACScan (Fig. 4). All these mutants were confirmed to express βc equally well by immunoblotting using specific anti-GM-CSFRβ antibody (data not shown). Each transfectant was examined for hGM-CSF binding using 125I-labeled hGM-CSF, and the results of high affinity binding profiles were shown in TableII. All mutant transfectants including ter1 clones bind hGM-CSF with high affinity and K d values suggesting that there are equivalent numbers of receptors with similar affinity. These results suggested that the mutations introduced in the cytoplasmic domain of GM-CSFRα did not affect the interactions of GM-CSFRα with the ligand or GM-CSFRβ.Table IIBinding profiles of GM-CSF on WT19 transfectantsHigh affinity receptorK dNo. of binding sites/cellpmWild type120930–1,600ter156600–1,100del1110500–1,850del2102500–1,600del367970–1,500ter3501,000–2,000P357G1051,200–1,600P358G87800–1,600P360G73400–900Two to four clones were analyzed for each mutant.

It is well established that tyrosine phosphorylation of an array of cytoplasmic proteins is critical for cytokine signal transduction. Accordingly, we analyzed the spectrum of substrates tyrosine-phosphorylated by addition of hGM-CSF to WT19 cells expressing various GM-CSFRα mutants. Several hematopoietic cytokines including GM-CSF induce p52 Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, which correlates with their ability to activate Ras (26Itoh T. Muto A. Watanabe S. Miyajima A. Yokota T.

GM-CSFRα transfectants were assayed for hGM-CSF-induced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation by anti-Shc immunoprecipitation followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5 A, increased p52 Shc tyrosine phosphorylation was detected only in wild type and P357G GM-CSFR α transfectants but not in the other mutants. Activated Ras through a cascade of protein kinases stimulates phosphorylation of ERKs (31Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). hGM-CSF induced phosphorylation of both p44ERK1 and p42ERK2 in wild type and P357G cells, but not in any other transfectants (data not shown). GM-CSF addition to cells activates JAK2, which leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT5 (32Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar, 33Mui A.L.-F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.-M. Harada N. Miyajima A.

On shorter exposure, tyrosine phosphorylation of two STAT5 isoforms (STAT5 a and b) was observed. A slight decrease in JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation seen in Fig. 5 in the P357G transfectants was not constantly reproducible. In the other GM-CSFRα mutant cell lines, GM-CSF did not induce detectable JAK2 or STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation. Activation of STAT5 in wild-type and P357G GM-CSFRα transfectants was also detected by gel shift assay using γ-interferon-activated site of the IRF-1 promoter and anti-STAT5 antibody (data not shown). These data indicated that the same regions of GM-CSFRα that are essential for GM-CSF-induced Shc-ERK phosphorylation are also essential for the induction of JAK2 and STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation. GM-CSF has been shown to induce rapid expression of a number of protooncogenes, including c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc (29Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 35Yokota, T., Watanabe, S., Mui, A. L., Muto, A., Mitajima, A., and Arai, K. (1993) Leukemia, 7, Suppl. 2, S102–S107.Google Scholar). In wild-type GM-CSFRα and the P357G transfectants, expression of c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc mRNAs was rapidly induced upon hGM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 6). In contrast, the expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA was not induced in the other α subunit mutants except ter3. In ter3 mutant receptor cell lines, hGM-CSF was capable of inducing c-jun but not c-fos mRNA. In contrast, induction of c-mycmRNA expression was repeatedly observed in both the wild type and all of the mutant clones, indicating that hGM-CSF is able to induce c-myc mRNA in the absence of GM-CSFRα cytoplasmic domain and that all of the mutant receptors are capable of signaling. We next examined hGM-CSF-induced cell proliferation of WT19 transfectants expressing α chain mutants. As shown in Fig. 7, both the wild type GM-CSFRα transfectant and the P357G mutant proliferated upon addition of hGM-CSF to the medium. ter1, del1, del2, del3, P358G, and P360G did not show any proliferative response to hGM-CSF, suggesting that some residues of the α chain cytoplasmic domain is indispensable for hGM-CSF-mediated growth signal transduction. These studies confirm our earlier findings about the role of GM-CSFRα cytoplasmic domain in promoting growth of BaF/3 cells (16Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.L. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth Diff. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of ter3 clones that lack the C-terminal 18 amino acid residues of α chain with hGM-CSF did not lead to an increase in the cell numbers. Instead, the cells died, but more slowly than ter1 clones (Fig. 7). In MTS cell proliferation assays, ter3 clones clearly showed hGM-CSF-mediated cell proliferation signal, although it was weaker than wild type or P357G clones (Fig. 8). Cell death in factor-dependent cells is known to occur through apoptotic mechanisms. To examine if apoptosis occurred in ter3 cell number in the presence of hGM-CSF, genomic DNA was isolated from α chain transfectants incubated with hGM-CSF and DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 9). ter3 showed detectable DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis by 9 h and showed pronounced apoptosis by 24 h after withdrawal of mIL3 and the addition of hGM-CSF. These results suggest that ter3 mutants that are able to transduce a cell proliferation signal by GM-CSF have severely impaired anti-apoptotic signaling.Figure 9The effects of C-terminal deletion on the anti-apoptotic function of hGM-CSF. Three WT19 transfectants were washed with factor-free medium and incubated in medium containing 10 ng/ml hGM-CSF for indicated time.

https://openalex.org/W2017617385,"Endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 (EP24.15) is a thermolysin-like metalloendopeptidase involved in the regulated metabolism of a number of neuropeptides. Unlike other thermolysin-like peptidases EP24.15 displays a unique thiol activation, a mechanism that is not clearly understood. In this study we show that both recombinant and tissue-derived EP24.15 are activated up to 8-fold by low concentrations (0.1 mm) of dithiothreitol. Additionally, under non-reducing conditions, recombinant and native EP24.15 forms multimers that can be returned to the monomeric form by reduction. We have also shown that competitive inhibitor binding occurs only to the monomeric form, which indicates that catalytic site access is restricted in the multimeric forms. Through systematic site-directed mutagenesis we have identified that cysteine residues 246, 253, and possibly 248 are involved in the formation of these multimers. Furthermore, both a double mutant (C246S/C253S) and a triple mutant (C246S/C248S/C253S) are fully active in the absence of reducing agents, as measured by both inhibitor binding and hydrolysis. The formation and disruption of disulfide bonds involving these cysteine residues may be a mechanism by which EP24.15 activity is regulated through changes in intra- and extracellular redox potential.

J. 1993; 294: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). EP24.15 is thought to be involved in the regulated metabolism of a number of neuropeptides including gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, bradykinin, and neurotensin and has more recently been implicated in the aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer's disease (3Papastoitsis G. Siman R. Scott R. Abraham C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 4McDermott J.R. Biggins J.A. Gibson A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). EP24.15 is widely distributed in cells and tissues throughout the body, predominantly as a soluble form constituting about 80% of the total activity and as a minor membrane-associated form accounting for the remainder of the activity (5Acker G.R. Molineaux C. Orlowski M. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). High levels of EP24.15 activity have been localized, both catalytically and immunohistochemically, primarily to the brain, pituitary, and testis with lower levels in other tissues such as the liver, kidney, spleen, and lung (6Chu T.G. Orlowski M. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).Typical of metalloendopeptidases EP24.15 is inhibited by metal ion chelators and can be reactivated by divalent cations such as Zn2+ or Mn2+. Like many of the thermolysin-like neutral metalloendopeptidases, the protein's active site contains a zinc ion, which participates in the catalytic process (7Chu T.G. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3598-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and has the classical HEXXH motif (8Pierotti A. Dong K.-W. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29 (; Correction (1994) Biochemistry 33, 622): 10323-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) typical of zinc metalloproteases (9Jongeneel C.V. Bouvier J. Bairoch A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, unlike the other thermolysin-like metallopeptidases such as angiotensin-converting enzyme, endothelin-converting enzyme, neutral endopeptidase, and the closely related endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.16(EP24.16), EP24.15 displays a unique thiol activation. EP24.15 is activated by low levels of thiol-containing reducing agents (<0.5 mm DTT) and inhibited by high concentrations (>5 mm DTT) (1Orlowski M. Michaud C. Chu T.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 10Orlowski M. Reznik S. Ayala J. Pierotti A. Biochem.

Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Smith A.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Inhibition has been attributed to the disruption of intramolecular disulfide bridges (13Morales T.I. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4855-4860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to the thiophilicity of the catalytic zinc ion (14Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Despite the thiol-induced increase in EP24.15 activity, studies examining inhibition by thiol-blocking agents are somewhat ambiguous. The specific and effective cysteine peptidase inhibitor E-64 was shown not to affect EP24.15 activity (12Lew R.A. Hey N.J. Tetaz T.J. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Smith A.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Tisljar U. Barrett A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and partial inhibition was only observed at relatively high concentrations in a yeast homologue of EP24.15 (16Hyrcyna C.A. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11293-11301Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Inhibition by thiol-modifying agents such as iodoacetate, iodoacetamide, and N-ethylmaleimide vary from virtually zero to 100%, and inhibition by these agents has been shown to be a time-dependent process (17Tisljar U. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus the precise mechanism(s) by which thiol-reactive agents modify the activity of EP24.15 remains unclear.The sequence of EP24.15 contains 14 cysteine residues, 7 of which are conserved in EP24.16, a closely related enzyme (18Dauch P. Vincent J.-P. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 27266-27271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that cysteine residue 483, which lies 5 residues from the catalytic center, is responsible for the thiol dependence of EP24.15 (8Pierotti A. Dong K.-W. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29 (; Correction (1994) Biochemistry 33, 622): 10323-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, this cysteine is also present in EP24.16, which is not activated by reducing agents, thus raising doubts as to its involvement. The present studies were undertaken to determine the mechanism(s) by which EP24.15 is activated by thiols and to define the precise cysteine residue(s) involved. We have employed size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering to examine EP24.15 in both a reduced and non-reduced state. We have also characterized the enzyme's ability to bind the specific inhibitorN-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate (cFP) in the presence and absence of thiol reductants. Finally, we have generated a series of EP24.15 mutant enzymes where each cysteine residue was systematically mutated to a serine and analyzed the properties of these mutants in the presence and absence of a reducing agent. Through these studies we have determined that EP24.15 forms intermolecular disulfide bridges involving Cys-246, Cys-248, and Cys-253 and that thiol activation of the enzyme occurs by the reduction of these low catalytic activity multimers to the more active monomeric form.RESULTSBoth recombinant and tissue-derived EP24.15 exhibited a marked activation (approximately 8-fold) in the presence of 0.1 mm DTT in comparison with the absence of reducing agent (Fig. 1).Under non-reducing conditions, fractionation of recombinant endopeptidase 24.15 by size exclusion chromatography revealed aggregates of approximately 150, 240, and >300 kDa in addition to the monomeric species of 75 kDa (Fig. 2 A). However, once subjected to reduction or reduction and alkylation, these aggregates dissociated, and EP24.15 eluted as a single species of 75 kDa (Fig. 2, C and D). If simply reduced prior to fractionation by size exclusion chromatography under non-reducing conditions, EP24.15 eluted in both the monomeric and an approximately 150-kDa aggregated form (Fig. 2 B) suggesting a rapid and dynamic formation of multimeric forms.Figure 2Size exclusion chromatography analysis of recombinant EP24.15. Recombinant EP24.15 was reduced using β-mercaptoethanol and/or alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine prior to fractionation on a TSK-GEL column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance of the emerging peaks was measured at 214 nm.

Size exclusion chromatography of the rat testes extract under non-reducing conditions showed that the vast majority of EP24.15 (determined following thiol activation of collected fractions) corresponded to a molecular mass much greater than 75 kDa (Fig. 3). However, when chromatographed under reducing conditions, the activity eluted as a single peak corresponding to the monomeric molecular mass of 75 kDa.Figure 3Rat testes EP24.15 activity chromatographed under reducing and non-reducing conditions.

Fractionation by size exclusion chromatography under either non-reducing (Fig.4 A) or reducing (Fig. 4 B) conditions showed that the inhibitor binds almost exclusively to the monomeric form with approximately a 5-fold increase in the amount of the radiolabeled cFP bound to EP24.15 in the presence of DTT. The increase in the amount of cFP bound under reducing conditions is consistent with increased amounts of monomer; hence thiol activation of EP24.15 likely reflects the conversion of an inactive multimer to an active monomer. The change in the degree of EP24.15 aggregation (reduced versus non-reduced) is also reflected in the UV trace of protein absorbance (214 nm).Figure 4Effect of 1 mm DTT on cFP binding to recEP24.15; analysis by size exclusion chromatography.Recombinant EP24.15 (20 μg) was incubated with125I-labeled cFP for 15 min at room temperature and fractionated (0.25-ml fractions) under both non-reducing (A) and reducing conditions (B). The collected fractions were counted, and the number of counts/min bound to EP24.15 in fractions is shown in the solid bars. The column effluent was monitored at 214 nm, and the resulting UV trace (0.5 absorbance unit at full scale) is shown above the bound cFP data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine which of the 14 cysteine residues in EP24.15 amino acid sequence (Fig. 5) may be involved in the formation of the multimers and hence the regulation of endopeptidase activity, a series of mutant enzymes were generated. The cysteine residues were converted systematically by site-directed mutagenesis to serine residues, and the activity and degree of thiol activation were analyzed using the QFS assay. The mutant enzymes of cysteine residues 246, 248, and 253 showed high activity in the absence of DTT, up to 8-fold greater than observed for the wild-type and other mutated enzymes (Fig.6 A). When assayed in the presence of 0.1 mm DTT, all three mutants showed only a modest activation in comparison with the substantial thiol activation observed for the wild-type and remaining mutant enzymes. Interestingly, cysteine residues 246 and 253 are unique to EP24.15 in contrast to EP24.16, which does not exhibit thiol activation, whereas cysteine residue 248 is conserved. Therefore, a double mutant (C246S/C253S) and a triple mutant (C246S/C248S/C253S) were generated in the same fashion. Activity assays demonstrated that both of these mutants have high intrinsic activity in the absence of a reductant and do not demonstrate enhanced activity in the presence of DTT (Fig. 6 B).Figure 5Amino acid sequence of EP24.15 (8Pierotti A.

In comparison the reduced form appears monomeric based on the radius size and the calculated molecular weight.

Open table in a new tab To assess the catalytic site availabilty, both C246S/C253S and C246S/C248S/C253S EP24.15 mutant enzymes as well as the wild type were incubated with 125I-cFP in the presence and absence of 0.1 mm DTT. The enzyme-inhibitor complex was precipitated using hydroxyapatite, and the bound cFP was compared with the free cFP. As shown in Fig. 7, there was a 10-fold increase in the amount of inhibitor bound to the wild-type enzyme in the presence of DTT. However, inhibitor binding to both mutant enzymes was the same in both reduced and non-reduced situations and similar to reduced wild-type EP24.15. This result indicates that the catalytic site of both the C246S/C253S and C246S/C248S/C253S mutants is available for binding regardless of the redox state of the environment.Figure 7Binding of cFP to recombinant EP24.15 in the presence and absence of DTT. 2 μg of wild-type (WT) double and triple mutants were incubated with 125I-labeled cFP for 30 min at 37 °C, and the enzyme-inhibitor complex was precipitated using hydroxyapatite.

We have also shown that both purified recombinant and tissue extracts of native EP24.15 form multimers of approximately 150, 240, and >300 kDa through intermolecular disulfide bridges, which upon reduction return EP24.15 to a monomeric form. The formation of these multimers is a rapid dynamic equilibrium process as can be seen by the rapid reformation of the multimers upon the removal of reducing agent. In addition we have used dynamic light scattering, a spectroscopic technique, to determine the distribution of reduced and non-reduced EP24.15 particle size in solution. The molecular weight is resolved from the hydrodynamic radius of the particle, and the range of dispersity is reflected in the standard deviation of the radius (24Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Structure ( Lond. ). 1994; 2: 357-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass of the reduced samples and the triple Cys mutant (−DTT) are within 20% of the apparent molecular mass of EP24.15 (75 kDa), and their radius sizes are almost identical. However, under non-reducing conditions the wild-type protein has a radius 2–3 times greater than that of the monomer and an increased calculated molecular weight confirming the formation of aggregates.Furthermore, we have demonstrated that inhibitor access to the catalytic site appears restricted when EP24.15 is multimerized in that inhibitor binding only occurs in the monomeric form. Thus, the observation that access to the particular cysteine residues involved may be restricted, along with the dynamic nature of these interactions, may help explain the ambiguous data obtained for the inhibition of EP24.15 by alkylating and other thiol-blocking agents.Through systematic site-directed mutagenesis we have shown that the closely located cysteine residues 246, 248, and 253 are likely involved in forming these intermolecular disulfide bridges and hence involved in the thiol activation of EP24.15. Although Cys-248 is conserved in EP24.16, a closely related but non-thiol-activated peptidase, it is presumably acting in a cooperative manner with the EP24.15 unique Cys-246 and Cys-253 to confer the thiol dependence. These results are in agreement with the suggestion of Barrett et al. (25Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Dando P.M. Knight C.G. McKie N. Rawlings N.D. Serizawa A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that Cys-246 and Cys-253 were likely candidates for a role in the thiol activation of EP24.15, reflecting both their close location and sole appearance in EP24.15 upon sequence comparison with mitochondrial oligopeptidase. Our findings, however, are not consistent with the hypothesis that the cysteine, which is 5 residues from the catalytic center (Cys-483) and also present in EP24.16, is involved in the thiol activation (8Pierotti A. Dong K.-W. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29 (; Correction (1994) Biochemistry 33, 622): 10323-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).We thus propose a mechanism for the thiol activation of EP24.15 where under oxidative conditions the enzyme aggregates through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges involving cysteine residues 246, 248, and 253. This multimeric form is inactive, suggesting that the disulfide bridging between one or more EP24.15 molecules blocks substrate access. The addition of a reductant disrupts the disulfide bridges by monomerizing the enzyme and thus removing the restriction on access of substrate to the catalytic site and therefore activating EP24.15. The formation of multimers through disulfide linkages involving other cysteines cannot be dismissed. However, only when the disulfide linkages involve Cys-246, -248, and -253 is the catalytic activity of EP24.15 affected. It is of interest to note that Cys-246, -248, and -253 lie within a region of charged residues (Fig.5) consistent with the concept that this part of the molecule may be located at or near the enzyme surface.To our knowledge, this is the first report of a peptidase being activated in such a manner, i.e. the reduction of multimers rather than their formation to promote activation. However, it is not the first report of thiol activation in which disulfides blocking the active site are reduced. Plant NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase has been shown to be activated through thiol/disulfide interchange with reduced thioredoxin such that disulfide reduction at the N terminus leads to a conformational change to the active site, whereas the C-terminal end, which shields access to the catalytic residues, is opened by this reduction (26Issakidis E. Lemaire M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J.-P. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The physiological significance of the thiol activation of EP24.15 both intra- and extracellularly is still to be elucidated. We have examined the catalytic activity of rat EP24.15 in testes extract on both reduced and non-reduced size exclusion chromatography and have found a single peak of activity under reducing conditions corresponding to the monomeric form, whereas the activity is eluted in a higher molecular mass form when non-reduced. In addition, we have examined the activation of EP24.15 over a range of protein concentrations and exclude the possibility that multimer formation only occurs at high concentrations of recombinant protein. Indeed, we find similar or even greater thiol activation at lower concentrations (<0.1 μm) of EP24.15, similar to those that we calculate exist, for example, in the cell nucleus. 2C. N. Shrimpton, M.

In the cell cytosol we would predict that EP24.15 is largely in the monomeric form, reflecting the general reductive environment of the cytosolic compartment. At the cell surface, however, which is generally oxidative, it is conceivable that enzymes such as the protein disulfide isomerase(s) or thioredoxin (30Yoshimori T. Semba T. Takemoto H. Akagi S.

This conversion reflects the disruption of intermolecular disulfide bridges involving a cluster of cysteine residues at positions 246, 253, and possibly 248 of EC 3.4.24.15.

EP24.15 is thought to be involved in the regulated metabolism of a number of neuropeptides including gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, bradykinin, and neurotensin and has more recently been implicated in the aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer's disease (3Papastoitsis G.

EP24.15 is widely distributed in cells and tissues throughout the body, predominantly as a soluble form constituting about 80% of the total activity and as a minor membrane-associated form accounting for the remainder of the activity (5Acker G.R. Molineaux C. Orlowski M. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). High levels of EP24.15 activity have been localized, both catalytically and immunohistochemically, primarily to the brain, pituitary, and testis with lower levels in other tissues such as the liver, kidney, spleen, and lung (6Chu T.G. Orlowski M. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Typical of metalloendopeptidases EP24.15 is inhibited by metal ion chelators and can be reactivated by divalent cations such as Zn2+ or Mn2+. Like many of the thermolysin-like neutral metalloendopeptidases, the protein's active site contains a zinc ion, which participates in the catalytic process (7Chu T.G. Orlowski M.

Pulmonary morphogenesis begins with the evagination of the foregut endoderm into the splanchnic mesenchyme. Thereafter, branching morphogenesis and differentiation of respiratory epithelial cells result in the generation of the conducting airways and alveolar gas exchange areas critical to perinatal adaptation to air breathing. Respiratory function depends upon surfactant lipids and proteins that are secreted into the alveolus by type II epithelial cells, reducing surface tension at the air/liquid interface and keeping the lung from collapsing at end-expiration. Various humoral factors influence the differentiation of respiratory epithelial cells and the production of surfactant proteins and lipids.

TTF-1 is a homeodomain-containing phosphoprotein of the Nkx family and is expressed in the developing brain, thyroid, and lung (11Lazzaro D. Price M. Felice M.D. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TTF-1 also plays a critical role in pulmonary morphogenesis. Gene-targeted deletion of the mouse TTF-1 gene (titf1) caused severe pulmonary hypoplasia (12Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J.

TTF-1 also plays a role in gene expression in the thyroid gland, activating thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin gene transcription (23Zannini M. Acebron A. De Felice M. Arnone M.I. Martin-Perez J.

Because of the role of TTF-1 in surfactant protein gene expression and previous studies supporting the role of cyclic AMP in lung epithelial differentiation and function, the present study was designed to assess the potential interactions between cAMP-dependent pathways and the activity of TTF-1. The action of cAMP is initiated by binding of hormones or other signaling molecules to cell surface receptors stimulating the activity of adenylyl cyclase in the plasma membrane, activating protein kinases that phosphorylate regulatory proteins, including nuclear transcription factors (13Taylor S.S.

A number of intracellular signaling pathways have been elucidated including protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, Rac/MEKK/SEK/JNK, JAK/STAT (for review, see Ref. 16Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). The potential role of these intracellular regulatory cascades in respiratory epithelial cell gene expression has not been discerned at present. The actions of PKA on gene transcription are mediated by phosphorylation of various transcription factors including CREBs, CREM, and other CRE binding proteins (ATFs) that influence gene transcription (for review, see Refs. 14Lalli E.

Although cAMP is known to stimulate respiratory epithelial cell differentiation and surfactant protein expression (6Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. Clark J.C. Sawtell N. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Hull W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15618-15623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the intracellular pathways mediating the effects of cAMP or gene transcription in the lung are unknown. In the present work, the PKA catalytic subunits Cat-α and Cat-β, but not CREB, strongly stimulated the human SP-B promoter in lung epithelial cells. Cat-β phosphorylated TTF-1 and synergistically stimulated human SP-B promoter when cotransfected with TTF-1, into H441 pulmonary adenocarcinoma and HeLa cells. Human SP-B gene promoter-luciferase reporter constructs SP-B-218 and SP-B-500 were generated as described previously (18Yan C. Tamm I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8859-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). PKA catalytic subunit expression vector Cat-α, Cat-β and inactive form Cat-βm were obtained from Dr. R. A.

Di Lauro, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Italy. CREB expression vector was obtained from Dr. M. R. Montminy, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA. pCR3 vector was purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego). Rc-HNF-3α, Rc-HNF-3β and Rc-HFH-8 expression vectors were obtained from Dr. R. H. Costa from University of Illinois at Chicago. The wild type TTF-1-flag expression construct (TTF-1 wt) was made as follows. Two primers were synthesized and used for polymerase chain reaction amplification using TTF-1 expression plasmid from Dr. R. Di Lauro as a template. The upstream primer (5′-GCCACCATGTCGATGAGTCCAAAGCACACGACT-3′) contains a Kozak sequence for efficient translation and 21-mer matching the 5′ end of TTF-1 cDNA sequence. The downstream primer (3′AACGAAATACCAGCCTGGACCCTGATGTTCCTGCTGCTACTGTTCACTATT5′) contains a 21-mer matching the 3′ end of TTF-1 cDNA sequence and a in-frame flag sequence (underlined sequence) before two stop codons. A mutant TTF-1-flag construct consists of a Thr9 → Ala substitution; TTF-1 Thr9 → Ala was made essentially the same except the upstream primer has the sequence 5′-GCCACCATGTCGATGAGTCCAAAGCACACGGCTCCGTTCTCAGTGTCTGAC-3′ (the underlined G changes Thr to Ala). The polymerase chain reaction product of TTF-1 with the Kozak and flag sequences was subcloned directly into the pCR3 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) to generate pCR3/TTF-1-flag expression construct. The orientation and DNA sequence of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. TTF-1-his-tag fusion protein construct for bacterial expression was made previously (21Holzinger A. Dingle S. Bejarano P.A. Miller M.-A. Weaver T.E. DiLauro R. Whitsett J.A. Hybridoma. 1996; 15: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The TTF-1 cDNA was directionally cloned into the pET 21b bacterial expression vector (pET System, Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli was transformed, and expression of recombinant TTF-1 was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 2 mm. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity purification was performed under denaturing conditions. H441 cell culture, DNA transfection, and luciferase assay were performed as described previously (18Yan C. Tamm I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8859-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Mean values and S.D. are presented except where described. Statistical differences were assessed using analysis of variance or paired t test where appropriate. H441 cells were seeded in a 25-mm flask at a density of 1 × 106 cells/flask. The next day, 2 μg of pCR3/TTF-1-flag and 2 μg of PKA catalytic subunit plasmid DNA (Cat-β) were added with Lipofectin and cultured overnight. The medium was then changed to RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum and the cells cultured for 2 days at 37 °C. Cells were washed once and incubated with serum-free, phosphate-free medium for 45 min. Two ml of phosphate-free medium containing 10% dialyzed calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.3 mCi of 32PO4/flask was then added. After a 3-h incubation, the radioactive medium was removed. Cells were rinsed and incubated for 5 min with 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing the phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium orthovanadate and 10 mm NaF) and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysed cells were disrupted further by aspiration through a 21-gauge needle. Supernatants were first incubated with 10 μl of mouse serum (Sigma) and 5 μl of 0.5 mg/μl of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, 30 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and the incubation continued for 90 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatants incubated overnight with 10 μl of flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak) or 5 μl of TTF-1 monoclonal antibody at 4 °C on a rotator. The next day, 20 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose was added and the incubation continued for 90 min. The supernatant was discarded and agarose complex centrifuged, washed three times with cell lysis buffer, and washed once with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 5 mm EDTA. Samples were boiled in sample loading buffer, centrifuged, and the supernatant proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis as described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The intensity of protein phosphorylation was visualized after exposure of the dried gels to x-ray film and quantitated by PhosphorImaging. Western blot analysis of nuclear protein extracts from TTF-1 wt and TTF-1 (Thr9 → Ala) transfected H441 cells was performed using the Phast Gel system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). TTF-1-his-tag protein (1 μg), TTF-1 homeodomain polypeptide (1 μg) obtained from Dr. Di Lauro, or synthetic TTF-1 peptides (30 μg) made by Genemed Inc. (San Francisco), were incubated with 1 μl (22 units) of purified PKA catalytic subunit (Calbiochem) in the presence of 40 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and reaction buffer (20 μmATP, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mmMgCl2, 4 mm Tris, pH 7.5). After incubation at 37 °C for 30–60 min, the phosphorylated products were either separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (protein) followed by autoradiography or spotted on a phosphocellular disc and counted by liquid scintillation. Transcription of the human SP-B gene is conferred bycis-acting elements located −500 to +41 from the start of transcription and is dependent upon the binding of TTF-1 to distinct sites within this region (7Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 9Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To assess the role of cAMP-dependent protein kinases on SP-B gene transcription, plasmid expression vectors expressing two forms of PKA catalytic subunit, Cat-α and Cat-β, were cotransfected into H441 cells with the SP-B promoter fragment, SP-B-500-luciferase. Cat-α and Cat-β stimulated SP-B gene transcription (Fig. 1 A). Activation of SP-B-500-luciferase was dose-dependent, and the inactive form of PKA catalytic subunit, Cat-βm, had no effect on the activity of SP-B-500-luciferase. Cat-β was consistently more active than Cat-α. The Cat-β construct was therefore utilized for subsequent studies. To define further the region of the SP-B promoter which was responsive to PKA, SP-B-218-luciferase (containing −218 to +41) was also tested. Activity of SP-B-218-luciferase was markedly stimulated by PKA Cat-β (Fig. 1 B), supporting the concept that DNA elements responding to Cat-β resided within −218 to +41 of the human SP-B gene, a region containing cis-acting elements activated by TTF-1 (7Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). When the mutant SP-B-218 promoter (SP-B-218 TT; Ref. 7Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) lacking TTF-1 binding activity was used, no stimulation was observed by PKA Cat-β (Fig. 1 B). DNA homology search revealed no CRE consensus elements within this region of the SP-B promoter, suggesting that the stimulatory effects of PKA Cat-β on SP-B-218-luciferase were not mediated by direct activation of CRE elements in the SP-B gene. Importantly, direct cotransfection of H441 cells with the expression plasmid RSV-CREB inhibited transcription of SP-B-500-luciferase in H441 cells (data not shown). To further identify transcription factors regulating the activity of the SP-B promoter, the effects of TTF-1, HNF-3α, HNF-3β, and HFH-8 expression vectors on the activity of SP-B-218-luciferase were assessed in H441 cells (Fig. 2). Cotransfection with a vector expressing TTF-1 consistently activated SP-B-218-luciferase (6–7-fold), whereas HNF-3 family members were less active in H441 cells. Stimulation of SP-B-218-luciferase by TTF-1 (∼6 fold) was similar to that observed after transfection with Cat-β (5-fold) in H441 cells. Addition of 8-bromo-cAMP to H441 cells increased SP-B-500-luciferase activity approximately 2-fold, 24 h after treatment (data not shown). To assess whether TTF-1 was phosphorylated by PKA catalytic subunit, a TTF-1-flag construct (pCR3/TTF-1-flag) was generated. A flag sequence (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) was inserted into the COOH terminus of the rat TTF-1 polypeptide producing a TTF-1 fusion peptide that was used to immunoprecipitate and distinguish endogenous TTF-1 from the flag-TTF-1 produced by the pCR3/TTF-1-flag construct. pCR3/TTF-1-flag transactivated SP-B-500-luciferase in H441 cells, demonstrating that the TTF-1-flag fusion peptide retained its biological activity (data not shown). To test whether PKA increased the phosphorylation of TTF-1, pCR3/TTF-1-flag was cotransfected with either Cat-β or Cat-βm into H441 cells (Fig. 3). After radiolabeling with 32Pi, TTF-1 from the cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with the flag antibody. Cat-β markedly increased the phosphorylation of TTF-1-flag, the protein migrating in approximately the same position as endogenous phosphorylated TTF-1. Cat-β enhanced TTF-1-flag phosphorylation approximately 6–7-fold compared with Cat-βm in H441 cells. Phospho-TTF-1-flag consisted of two bands (M r = 40,000–43,000), supporting the concept that TTF-1 was phosphorylated at multiple sites or that multiple forms of TTF-1 were present. Bacterial expressed TTF-1-his-tag protein was purified by Ni-column chromatography. Purified TTF-1-his-tag fusion protein and TTF-1 homeodomain polypeptide were incubated with the purified PKA catalytic subunit in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig.4, PKA catalytic subunit directly phosphorylated the TTF-1 fusion protein (Fig. 4, lane c), but not the TTF-1 homeodomain polypeptide, indicating that the PKA phosphorylation site resided outside the homeodomain of TTF-1. To identify the site of PKA phosphorylation, a set of synthetic peptides comprising TTF-1 phosphorylation sites was generated. Di Lauro and colleagues identified several phosphorylation sites on TTF-1 (23Zannini M. Acebron A. De Felice M. Arnone M.I. Martin-Perez J. Santisteban P. Di Lauro R. J. Biol.

The peptides were incubated with the purified PKA catalytic subunit in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Only peptide 1 (residues 1–17) was phosphorylated by the PKA catalytic subunit (Fig. 5 A). In competition experiments, peptide 1 abolished TTF-1-his-tag protein phosphorylation by PKA (Fig. 5 B, lane d). These results demonstrated that the PKA phosphorylation site was located near the NH2 terminus of TTF-1 in a region associated with transactivation activity (24De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Peptide 1 contains the sequence Arg-His-Thr-Thr-Pro consistent with a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by PKA (14Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A PKC consensus sequence Ser-Pro-Arg-His that shares Arg-His with the PKA site, is located immediately proximal to the NH2 terminus of the putative PKA site (Fig.6 A). A mutant peptide 1 (peptide 1m1), in which Thr9 was changed to Ala (Arg-His-Thr-Thr-Pro → Arg-His-Thr-Ala-Pro), was synthesized and tested as substrate for PKA and PKC in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the phosphorylation of mutant peptide 1m1 by PKA was completely abolished, indicating that TTF-1 Thr9 is phosphorylated by PKA. Phosphorylation of the mutant peptide 1m1 by PKC was fully retained. A mutant form of TTF-1 (Thr9 → Ala) was generated by mutation of the TTF-1 cDNA (see “Materials and Methods”). Whereas TTF-1 wt stimulated the activation of the SP-B promoter (SP-B-218), TTF-1 (Thr9 → Ala) was considerably less active in stimulating transcription of SP-B-218-luciferase (Fig.7). Differences in the activity of TTF-1 wt and TTF-1 (Thr9 → Ala) were not related to differences in the level of TTF-1 peptides produced by the constructs. Western blot analysis of TTF-1 wt and TTF-1 (Thr9 → Ala)-transfected H441 cells demonstrated equal amounts of TTF-1 fusion proteins (data not shown). Immunofluorescent staining by anti-flag monoclonal antibody showed that TTF-1 wt and TTF-1 (Thr9 → Ala) were nuclear localized and strongly expressed in the transfected cells (data not shown). To assess the role of phosphorylation of TTF-1 Thr9 on PKA-dependent activation of SP-B-218 promoter, the phosphorylation mutant TTF-1 (Thr9 → Ala) was transfected into H441 cells and failed to mediate Cat-β-dependent stimulation of SP-B-218-luciferase in H441 cells (TableI).Table IActivity of TTF-1 (Thr 9 → Ala) on PKA Cat → β-dependent activation of the SP-B-218-luciferase reporter vectorPlasmidsLuciferase activity ± S.D.TTF-1 wt + PKA Cat-βm4,880 ± 316TTF-1 wt + PKA Cat-β12,040 ± 1,550TTF-1 (Thr9 → Ala) + PKA Cat-βm2,320 ± 351TTF-1 (Thr9 → Ala) + PKA Cat-β3,100 ± 178H441 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA containing 1.6 μg of SP-B-218-luciferase reporter vector, 1.6 μg of TTF-1, and/or 1.6 μg of PKA Catβ. n = 3. Activity is measured in light units/OD of β-galactosidase.

Activity is measured in light units/OD of β-galactosidase. Respiratory adaptation at birth depends upon the regulated synthesis and secretion of surfactant lipids and proteins into the alveolar spaces, reducing surface tension at the air/liquid interface. The synthesis of surfactant lipids and proteins is developmentally regulated, increasing during advancing gestation and stimulated by a variety of humoral factors including glucocorticoids and cAMP. The present findings demonstrate that PKA activated both TTF-1 phosphorylation and TTF-1-dependent SP-B gene transcription, suggesting that the effects of cAMP on surfactant protein B gene expression may be mediated, at least in part, by the modulation of the activity of TTF-1 on the SP-B transcription, rather than by binding and activating CRE. TTF-1 is expressed throughout the conducting and peripheral respiratory tract during lung development (11Lazzaro D. Price M. Felice M.D. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ikeda K. Clark J.C. Shaw-White J.R. Stahlman M.T. Boutell C.J. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In human lung, after birth, TTF-1 is detected in nuclei of subsets of epithelial cells, both in the conducting airway and in type II epithelial cells (25Ikeda K. Clark J.C. Shaw-White J.R.

Cytochem. 1996; 44: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the lung, TTF-1 expression overlaps with that of SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and CCSP, but its distribution is more extensive than that of the surfactant proteins or CCSP (27Khoor A. Gray M.E. Hull W.M.

Cytochem. 1988; 36: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although TTF-1 strongly influences the transcription of each of these genes, each has a distinct temporal and spatial pattern of expression, supporting the concept the activity of TTF-1 may be further modified to confer the distinct regulatory features typical of each gene. The marked increase in surfactant protein synthesis occurring in late gestation is not directly related to changes in the level of TTF-1 mRNA (30Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), providing a strong inference that the activity of TTF-1 on its target genes may be further modulated. The present work supports the hypothesis that the stimulatory effects of cyclic AMP on surfactant homeostasis may be influenced, at least in part, by phosphorylation of TTF-1, which, in turn, enhances its activity on SP-B gene transcription. Effects of cAMP on gene transcription are mediated by the activation of PKAs; subsequent protein phosphorylation may alter the activity of regulatory proteins including nuclear transcription proteins. A variety of nuclear transcription proteins are targets of PKA. Some bind to CREs that are present in target genes. Many genes that are regulated by PKA contain the CRE consensus sequence TGACGTCA (17Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Wolfgang H.F. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). We were unable to identify CRE sequences fitting this consensus sequence in the 5′-flanking regions of mouse SP-A and human or mouse SP-B and SP-C genes. Likewise, expression of recombinant CREB failed to activate SP-B gene transcription from the SP-B-500-luciferase construct in H441 cells. SP-A gene expression is also enhanced by cAMP and is not mediated by CREB/ATF family members (31Michael L.F. Alcorn J.L. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 159-170PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, SP-B transcription was markedly stimulated by cotransfection with TTF-1, and this activity was further induced by cotransfection with Cat-α and -β, suggesting that the activation by the catalytic subunit of PKA may be mediated by enhancing the activity of TTF-1 on the SP-B promoter. TTF-1 phosphorylation was markedly stimulated by cotransfection with Cat-β, but not by the inactive form, Cat-βm. These findings are consistent with observations in thyroid carcinoma cells in which cAMP stimulated TTF-1 phosphorylation (32Francis-Lang H. Zannini M. Felice M.D. Berlingieri M.T. Fusco A. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5793-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In those studies, the binding activity of TTF-1 to the thyroglobulin promoter was enhanced by phosphorylation of TTF-1. Although a number of phosphorylation sites were identified in the TTF-1 polypeptide sequence, the phosphorylation sites involved in activation of gene transcription have not been identified, although phosphorylation of TTF-1 is not required for binding to DNA (23Zannini M.

In this report, peptide mapping and site-specific mutagenesis demonstrated that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of TTF-1 near the NH2 terminus (Thr9) mediates the activation of SP-B gene transcription in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells. cAMP influences a variety of cellular functions in the developing lung, stimulating surfactant synthesis and secretion, surfactant protein gene expression, and fluid secretion from respiratory epithelial cells. The numbers of β-adrenergic receptors and the activity of adenylate cyclase in the lung increase dramatically during late gestation (33Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. Bourbon J.R. Pulmonary Surfactant: Biochemical, Functional, Regulatory, and Clinical Concepts. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 77-104Google Scholar,34Whitsett J.A. Chernick V.C. Mellins R.B.

New Insights Cystic Fibrosis. 1995; 3: 1-5Google Scholar). In late gestation, the numbers of β-adrenergic receptors in the lung increase in association with the increased surfactant production and secretion required for perinatal respiratory adaptation. The present findings support the concept that the effects of cAMP on distal respiratory epithelial function may be mediated, at least in part, by the activity of TTF-1, which modulates surfactant protein gene transcription. Whether other effects of cAMP on respiratory epithelial cell function in the perinatal lung are mediated by cAMP-dependent activation of TTF-1 remains to be clarified. We thank Dr. Richard A.

A model has been suggested in which the degradation of chloroplast mRNA is initiated by endonucleolytic cleavage(s) followed by the addition of poly(A)-rich sequences and rapid exonucleolytic degradation. When in vitro transcribed RNAs were incubated with chloroplast protein extract, competition between polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNAs for degradation resulted in the rapid degradation of the polyadenylated molecules and stabilization of their non-polyadenylated counterparts. To elucidate the molecular mechanism governing this effect, we determined whether the chloroplast exoribonuclease 100RNP/polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) preferably degrades polyadenylated RNA. When separately incubated with each molecule, isolated 100RNP/PNPase degraded polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNAs at the same rate. However, when both molecules were mixed together, the polyadenylated RNA was degraded, whereas the non-polyadenylated RNA was stabilized. In RNA binding experiments, 100RNP/PNPase bound the poly(A) sequence with much higher affinity than other RNA molecules, thereby defining the poly(A)-rich RNA as a preferential substrate for the enzyme. 100RNP/PNPase may therefore be involved in a mechanism in which post-transcriptional addition of poly(A)-rich sequence targets the chloroplast RNA for rapid exonucleolytic degradation.

Photosynthesis and other essential biosynthetic plant cell activities occur in the chloroplast. The chloroplast structural proteins and enzymes are encoded by both nuclear and chloroplast genomes. During its development, chloroplast gene expression is tightly regulated at many levels, including that of mRNA accumulation (reviewed in Refs. 1Mullet J.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Academic Press, New York1993: 329-365Crossref Google Scholar). RNA metabolism involves a series of steps that are dependent on RNA secondary structures, nucleases, and regulatory RNA-binding proteins (5Belasco J.G. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, New York1993: 3-12Crossref Google Scholar, 6Brawerman G. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, New York1993: 149-159Crossref Google Scholar). Similar to bacterial mRNAs, most chloroplast mRNAs contain an inverted repeat sequence in their 3′-untranslated region that can fold into a stable stem-loop structure (7Stern D.B. Gruissem W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1145-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Unlike nuclear encoded mRNA, most of the chloroplast mRNAs are non-polyadenylated at the 3′-end in their steady-state condition. Several RNA-binding proteins that may be involved in the processing, maturation, and degradation of chloroplast RNAs have been characterized over the past few years. For example, a family of proteins with an RNA-binding recognition sequence motif has been described, of which spinach 28RNP was most prominently characterized. Immunodepletion of this protein from the chloroplast extract or the addition of recombinant protein interfered with the in vitro 3′-end processing of chloroplast RNAs (8Schuster G. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RNA binding properties of 28RNP have been studied in detail and show that phosphorylation changes the affinity of the protein for RNA (9Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G.

Biochem. 1995; 224: 603-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). 28RNP is not itself a ribonuclease. A search for such an enzyme, involved in the 3′-end processing of chloroplast mRNAs, yielded a 100-kDa RNA-binding protein (13Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The purified 100-kDa protein had biochemical properties very similar to one of the two exonucleases so far discovered in bacterial cells, the polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) 1The abbreviations used are: PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (14Littauer U.Z. Soreq H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 517-533Google Scholar). In addition, the deduced amino acid sequence of the chloroplast 100RNP cDNA disclosed high homology to the bacterial PNPase (13Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The chloroplast RNA processing and degradation system is therefore similar to recently discovered mechanisms in Escherichia coli (15Carpousis A.J. Van Houwe G. Ehretsmann C. Krisch H.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 16Py P. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). However, unlike bacteria, plastid mRNA metabolism and associated enzymes are controlled by the nucleus and may be regulated by both light and the redox state of the chloroplast (13Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Post-transcriptional addition of poly(A) tail to the 3′-end of mRNA has been best characterized in eukaryotic cells for nuclear encoded and viral mRNAs. The long poly(A) tail is an important determinant of mRNA stability and maturation as well as initiation of translation (17Jackson R.J. Standart N. Cell. 1990; 62: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 18Baker E.J. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of mRNA Stability.

Poly(A) tails have also been described for several bacterial mRNA 3′-ends and for endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic sites of the rpsO mRNA (20Cohen S.N.

In contrast to the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, where the poly(A) tail seems to stabilize the nuclear encoded mRNA, the addition of poly(A) tails to bacterial mRNAs promotes their degradation. Post-transcriptional addition of poly(A)-rich sequences to chloroplastpsbA mRNA has recently been described (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Kudla J. Hayes R. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7137-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Unlike eukaryotic nuclear encoded and bacterial RNAs, the poly(A) moiety in the chloroplast, which may be several hundred nucleotides long, was found not to be a ribohomopolymer of adenosine residues, but rather clusters of adenosines bounded mostly by guanosines and, on rare occasion, by cytidines and uridines (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When lysed chloroplasts were incubated in the presence of yeast tRNA, thereby inhibiting exonuclease activity, distinct endonucleolytic cleavage products accumulated (29Klaff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4885-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several of the endonuclease cleavage sites mapped by primer extension perfectly matched the poly(A)-rich addition sites that were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, suggesting a degradation pathway for psbA mRNA in the chloroplast. In this pathway, the degradation is initiated by endonucleolytic cleavage followed by the addition of poly(A)-rich sequence to the 3′-end of the proximal cleavage product. Once the poly(A)-rich sequence is added, this RNA molecule is rapidly degraded by exonuclease(s) (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Indeed, when synthetic polyadenylated RNA was incubated with a chloroplast soluble protein extract together with its non-polyadenylated counterpart, the polyadenylated RNA was rapidly degraded. In addition, blocking mRNA polyadenylation with cordycepin inhibitor inhibited exonucleolytic degradation, and endonucleolytic cleavage products accumulated. 2I. Lisitsky, P. Klaff, and G. Schuster, submitted for publication. In this study, we show that the chloroplast exoribonuclease 100RNP/PNPase exhibits preferential activity toward polyadenylated RNA. Purified 100RNP/PNPase degraded synthetic transcribed polyadenylated RNAs much faster than non-polyadenylated RNA. We also show this difference to be due to the high binding affinity of 100RNP/PNPase for the poly(A) sequence. These results suggest the preferential affinity of 100RNP/PNPase for poly(A)-rich sequences to be part of the mechanism in which post-transcriptional addition of poly(A)-rich sequence targets the chloroplast RNA for rapid exonucleolytic degradation. Chloroplasts were isolated on Percoll gradients from leaves of hydroponically grown spinach plants (Spinacia oleracea cv. Viroflay) under 10.5 h of light and 13.5 h of darkness as described previously (9Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A soluble protein extract capable of 3′-end processing of chloroplast RNAs was prepared from isolated intact chloroplasts as described (30Gruissem W. Greenberg B.M. Zurawski G. Hallick R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 253-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Chloroplast soluble protein extract was fractionated through a size-exclusion Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Fractions containing protein complexes of 550–650 kDa were pooled and applied to a 1-ml heparin column (Hi-Trap, Pharmacia) developed with a linear gradient of KCl in buffer E (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 17% glycerol). Proteins eluted at 0.2 m KCl were dialyzed against buffer E and applied to a Resource Q column (Pharmacia). The column was developed with a linear gradient of KCl in buffer E, and 100RNP/PNPase was eluted at 0.3m as a single silver-stained polypeptide (see Fig. 2). The plasmids used forin vitro transcription of parts of the mRNA from the spinach chloroplast genes psbA (encoding the D1 protein of photosystem II) and petDΔ24 (encoding subunit IV of the cytochrome b 6 f complex) have been described previously (9Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Stern D.B. Jones H. Gruissem W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18742-18750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate RNA containing thepsbA amino acid coding region (nucleotides 946–1028 according to Zurawski et al. (32Zurawski G. Bohnert H.J. Whitfeld P.R. Bottomley W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7699-7703Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar)) with an additional 14 adenosines at the 3′-end, the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction fragment described by Lisitsky et al. (see clone 5 in Fig. 1 of Ref. 27) was used. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into the pUC57-dT vector (MBI Inc.) and subcloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene) using BamHI and KpnI restriction sites. To generate the RNA with 14 adenosines at the 3′-end, the plasmid was linearized with BamHI and transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. The transcribed RNA was then hybridized to an adapter oligonucleotide (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and digested with RNase H as described previously (9Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To generate RNA without the additional 14 adenosines, the above-described RNA molecule was hybridized to an oligo(dT) adapter oligonucleotide (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and then digested with RNase H. To generate RNA with poly(A) sequence located within the molecule, the RNA transcribed from the plasmid linearized with BamHI was used. Therefore, this RNA contained 18 nucleotides derived from the oligo(dT) adapter oligonucleotide (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and 5 nucleotides derived from the pUC57 vector, 3′ to the 14 adenosines. RNAs were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase and radioactively labeled with [α-32P]UTP to a specific activity of 8–10 × 103 and 8–10 × 104 cpm/fmol for RNA degradation and UV cross-linking experiments, respectively (9Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The full-length transcription products were purified on 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. In vitro polyadenylation of RNA was performed by incubating thein vitro transcribed RNA with a chloroplast protein extract (1 mg/ml) in buffer E containing 0.5 mm ATP for 30 min (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The polyadenylated RNA was purified by denaturing PAGE. In vitro RNA degradation experiments were carried out as described previously (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro synthesized RNA (2 fmol) was incubated with the chloroplast soluble protein extract (1 mg/ml) or with isolated 100RNP/PNPase (0.4 μg/ml) for the times indicated in the figure legends. Following incubation, the RNA was isolated and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (9Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking of proteins to [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA was carried out as described previously (8Schuster G. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4719-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 fmol of RNA (240,000 cpm) were incubated with 20 μg of chloroplast proteins in 15 μl of buffer E. To avoid the poly(A) RNA degradation by 100RNP/PNPase observed in this work, the RNA/protein mixture was immediately exposed to UV light at 4 °C without preincubation at room temperature. Indeed, when UV cross-linking was performed with preincubation at room temperature, no differences were observed in the binding of 100RNP/PNPase to the different RNA molecules (data not shown) (33Li Q.-S. Gupta J.D. Hunt A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19831-19835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Following 1.8 J of UV irradiation in a UV cross-linking apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments), the RNA was digested with 5 μg of RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h, and the proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The label transferred from the RNA to the proteins was detected by autoradiography and quantified with a Fuji imaging analyzer. The 100RNP/PNPase cDNA (13Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was subcloned into a pMal-cR1 vector (Bio-Lab Inc.) using theBamHI/HindIII sites. The recombinant fusion protein was expressed and purified on amylose resin according to the manufacturer's protocol, with an additional purification step using a heparin column. Polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbit as described previously (8Schuster G. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Unlike the mature protein, the maltose-binding 100RNP/PNPase-fused recombinant protein exhibited neither RNA binding nor exonuclease activity (data not shown). SDS-PAGE fractionation and detection of 100RNP/PNPase on immunoblots probed with specific antibodies were performed as described previously (8Schuster G. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Chloroplast protein extract (1 mg) was applied to immobilized ribohomopolymer columns (0.1 ml; Sigma). Following extensive washing of the columns with buffer E, the bound proteins were successively eluted with 0.5, 1, and 2 m KCl in buffer E. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with specific antibodies to 100RNP/PNPase. Chloroplast soluble protein extract has been used to analyze transcription, 3′-end processing, and polyadenylation ofin vitro transcribed RNA corresponding to chloroplast genes (7Stern D.B. Gruissem W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1145-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 9Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G.

In vitro transcribed RNA without a stem-loop structure at the 3′-end is rapidly degraded in this extract (31Stern D.B. Jones H. Gruissem W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18742-18750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous work, we showed that when polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNAs were incubated in this extract, the polyadenylated RNA was rapidly degraded, whereas its non-polyadenylated counterpart was stabilized (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This may have been because the polyadenylated RNA had a higher affinity for the degradation enzyme(s), thereby excluding it from the non-polyadenylated RNA. To verify this hypothesis, the same experiment was performed with increasing amounts of chloroplast extract (and consequently, increasing amounts of RNA ribonucleases). When an RNA molecule corresponding to part of thepetD mRNA was incubated in the chloroplast extract at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml, it was rapidly degraded (Fig.1 A). The same RNA was then mixed with its polyadenylated counterpart in such a way that an identical number of molecules were incubated in each reaction mixture. As compared with the system including only non-polyadenylated RNA (Fig. 1 A), the polyadenylated RNA was degraded, whereas the non-polyadenylated RNA was stabilized (Fig. 1 B). Increasing protein concentrations resulted in accelerated degradation of the polyadenylated RNA, but no degradation of the non-polyadenylated RNA. Finally, at a concentration of 8 mg/ml, 20 times greater than that originally used, the polyadenylated RNA disappeared within 5 min, and the non-polyadenylated RNA was also degraded, albeit more slowly than when incubated alone at 0.4 mg/ml (Fig. 1, A and D). Variance in the stability of the RNAs was not due to the difference in their lengths since the addition of other nucleotides has no such effect (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Drager R.G. Zeidler M. Simpson C.L. Stern D.B. RNA. 1996; 2: 652-663PubMed Google Scholar). Since the two RNAs differed only in the presence or absence of a poly(A) tail, this result suggested that the poly(A)-tail has a higher affinity than non-polyadenylated RNA for the ribonucleases in the chloroplast protein extract. Because we had previously shown the poly(A) tail to be a target for exonucleolytic degradation of RNA (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar),2 we questioned whether a purified exoribonuclease would exhibit such a preference. A nuclear encoded chloroplast 100-kDa RNA-binding protein exhibiting exoribonuclease activity and amino acid sequence homologous to the bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase (100RNP/PNPase) has recently been described (13Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To analyze the activity of 100RNP/PNPase in degrading polyadenylated RNA and since we were unsuccessful in expressing a recombinant active 100RNP/PNPase in E. coli, the enzyme was purified to homogeneity from chloroplast protein extract (Fig.2 A). Purified 100RNP/PNPase consisted of one polypeptide (which sometimes appeared as a doublet) that reacted with specific antibodies generated against the recombinant maltose-binding protein fused to 100RNP/PNPase (Fig. 2 B). When the purified protein was incubated with in vitro transcribed RNA, the RNA was rapidly degraded (Fig. 2 C) (13Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition to exoribonuclease activity, the E. coli PNPase disclosed in vitro RNA polymerase activity when incubated in the presence of nucleosides (14Littauer U.Z. Soreq H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 517-533Google Scholar). The polymerase activity is activated when there are sufficient diphosphates and a very low concentration of inorganic phosphate (14Littauer U.Z. Soreq H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 517-533Google Scholar). Chloroplast 100RNP/PNPase also showed RNA polymerase activity when incubated with RNA in the presence of ADP (data not shown). This result suggested an interesting possibility: 100RNP/PNPase might also be involved in post-transcriptional addition of poly(A)-rich sequences to RNA in the chloroplast. However, we had previously shown that depletion of 100RNP/PNPase from the chloroplast protein extract did not interfere with in vitropolyadenylation activity (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, a poly(A) polymerase had been purified from spinach chloroplast extract (37Burkard G. Keller E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 3S. Yehudai, A. Anbussi, I. Lisitsky, and G. Schuster, manuscript in preparation. If the chloroplast 100RNP/PNPase activity is modulated similar to the E. coli PNPase, then the concentrations of inorganic phosphate and nucleotide diphosphate in the chloroplast would promote the degradation rather than the polymerization activity.2 Combined, these results show that additional experiments are required to clarify the in vivomode of action of 100RNP/PNPase. There are two possible ways of accounting for the observed competition of degradation enzymes for polyadenylated RNA in the presence of chloroplast protein extract (Fig. 1). The preferential activity toward polyadenylated RNA could be a phenomenon intrinsic to the exonuclease polypeptide(s) itself. Alternatively, additional auxiliary proteins that confer this preferential activity may be required. To determine which of these scenarios was valid, competition experiments were performed using the isolated enzyme.In vitro transcribed RNA corresponding to part of thepetD mRNA and the same RNA with the addition of 100 adenosines were incubated with purified 100RNP/PNPase, separately or in combination. As shown in Fig. 3, the RNAs were degraded at similar rates when incubated alone. However, when they were combined, the non-polyadenylated RNA was stabilized (Fig.3 B). Moreover, under our experimental conditions, the polyadenylated RNA was degraded at the same rate when incubated separately or with non-polyadenylated RNA (Fig. 3). Increasing the 100RNP/ PNPase concentration led to accelerated degradation of the RNA molecules, similar to the situation shown in Fig. 1 for the protein extract (data not shown) (compare with Fig. 4, where the protein/RNA ratio was 2.5 times higher than that in Fig. 3). These results demonstrated that the purified exonuclease 100RNP/PNPase preferentially degrades polyadenylated RNA and suggested that competition for degradation of polyadenylated RNA is due to the enzyme's intrinsic properties, rather than to auxiliary proteins.Figure 4Internal stretch of poly(A) does not trigger rapid degradation by 100RNP/PNPase. RNAs (0.2 fmol) corresponding to part of the psbA mRNA (as described under “Materials and Methods”) without poly(A) (designated A), with the addition of 14 adenosines (designated B), and with the addition of 14 adenosines and 23 other nucleotides (designatedC) were mixed and incubated with purified 100RNP/PNPase (0.4 μg/ml). At the time points indicated, the reaction was terminated, and RNAs were isolated and analyzed by denaturing PAGE and autoradiography. A schematic representation of the RNA molecules is shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 100RNP/PNPase, like the bacterial PNPase, is an exonuclease that processively degrades the RNA from the 3′-end (13Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Littauer U.Z. Soreq H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 517-533Google Scholar). Since the experiments described above suggested that chloroplast 100RNP/PNPase has a higher affinity for polyadenylated RNA, we questioned whether or not the poly(A) stretch needs to be located at the 3′-end of the RNA molecule. To this end, RNA molecules representing part of the psbA amino acid coding region with or without the addition of 14 adenosines as well as with the addition of 14 adenosines and 23 bases, including all four nucleotides, at the 3′-end were synthesized (see “Materials and Methods”) (markedA, B, and C in Fig. 4, respectively). These molecules were mixed and incubated with purified 100RNP/PNPase. The results presented in Fig. 4 show that the non-polyadenylated RNA and the RNA with the internal poly(A) stretch were degraded at a similar rate, whereas the RNA with the poly(A) at the 3′-end was much more rapidly degraded. Therefore, to compete for 100RNP/PNPase degradation activity, the poly(A) tail needs to be located at the 3′-end of the RNA molecule. Two possible mechanisms could explain the preferential degradation of polyadenylated RNA by 100RNP/PNPase. In the first, the enzyme discriminates between substrates because, once bound to the RNA molecule, it degrades polyadenylated RNA much faster than non-polyadenylated RNA. The second mechanism implies similar degradation rates, but higher binding affinity of 100RNP/PNPase for polyadenylated RNA. Therefore, a higher affinity for poly(A) sequence would result in preferential activity toward the polyadenylated molecules when the enzyme concentration is limited. The first potential mechanism can be excluded by the observation that polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNAs were degraded at a similar rate when incubated separately with isolated 100RNP/PNPase (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, we intended to determine whether or not this protein displays a higher affinity for poly(A). To measure the binding affinities of 100RNP/PNPase for different RNA molecules, it was fractionated through immobilized ribohomopolymer columns. Chloroplast protein extract was applied to a poly(A)- or poly(U)-agarose column, and the bound proteins were eluted with increasing salt concentrations. The amount of 100RNP/PNPase in both the unbound and bound fractions was detected by probing an immunoblot with specific antibodies. Fig. 5 shows that most of the 100RNP/PNPase was depleted from the extract by the poly(A) column, whereas a much smaller amount was depleted by the poly(U) column. In addition, 100RNP/PNPase was eluted from the poly(A) column with 1m KCl, whereas a concentration of only 0.5 meluted the protein from the poly(U) column. No binding activity of 100RNP/PNPase on the poly(G) or poly(C) column was observed under these conditions (data not shown). To define the binding activities of 100RNP/PNPase for different RNA molecules in an additional system, we carried out UV cross-linking competition experiments (9Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4719-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Chloroplast protein extract was incubated with [32P]UTP-labeled RNA corresponding to the psbA3′-end. 100RNP/PNPase is strongly labeled in this UV cross-linking binding assay (13Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of a competitor were used to define a quantitative I50 number, defined as the concentration of competitor required to reduce the UV cross-linking signal to 50% (9Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Lisitsky I. Liveanu V. Schuster G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4719-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Due to the preferential activity of 100RNP/PNPase toward polyadenylated RNA, these experiments were performed as rapidly as possible and at a low temperature. Nevertheless, the results obtained with poly(A) should be taken as a minimum value because the concentration of poly(A) in the mixture was lower than that added to the system due to degradation. The results presented in Fig. 6 concurred with the column binding studies, showing the higher binding affinity of 100RNP/PNPase for poly(A). The affinity for poly(U) was about three to four times lower, and that for poly(G) and for RNA corresponding to the 3′-end ofpsbA was 15–20 times lower compared with the values obtained with poly(A). Taking the poly(A) binding affinity as a minimum value and because maximal competition had already been obtained with a 4-fold excess of poly(A) (Fig. 6), the actual differences in binding affinities are assumed to be even greater. Taken together, these results demonstrated that 100RNP/ PNPase binds poly(A) with much higher affinity than any other RNA sequence. Therefore, it competes for the degradation of polyadenylated RNA molecules by binding to poly(A) and by being excluded from the non-polyadenylated RNA molecules.Figure 6100RNP/PNPase preferentially binds to poly(A) RNA. A, [32P]UTP-labeled RNA corresponding to the psbA 3′-end was mixed with increasing amounts of the competitors poly(G), poly(A), poly(U), and psbA 3′-end (same RNA as the radioactive one) and 20 μg of chloroplast protein extract. The competitor/psbA 3′-end ratios (mol/mol) were as follows: none (lane −), 4-fold excess (lane 1), 20-fold excess (lane 2), 40-fold excess (lane 3), and 200-fold excess (lane 4). The mixture was immediately UV-cross-linked on ice and digested with RNase A, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The radioactive signals of 100RNP/PNPase and the group of 24–33-kDa ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are indicated on the right. B, shown is a graphical representation of the competition experiment presented inA. The amount of psbA RNA 3′-end cross-linked to 100RNP/PNPase was quantified by a Fuji imaging analyzer and plotted as a function of the competitor excess. White squares, poly(G);black squares, poly(A); black triangles, poly(U);inverted white triangles, psbA 3′-end. I50, defined as the concentration of competitor that inhibits binding of 100RNP/ PNPase to the psbA RNA 3′-end by 50% under our experimental conditions, was 2-, 5-, 28-, and 30-fold for poly(A), poly(U), psbA, and poly(G), respectively. However, the value for poly(A) was even smaller since >90% inhibition was obtained at the first point and due to rapid degradation of poly(A) in the chloroplast extract (see “Results”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A possible pathway for the degradation of mRNA in the chloroplast has recently been suggested (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Kudla J. Hayes R. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7137-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).2 The first event is endonucleolytic cleavage(s), which produces RNA with no stem-loop structure at the 3′-end. Following these cleavages, the proximal fragments are polyadenylated at their 3′-end by the addition of poly(A)-rich sequences. The polyadenylated RNAs are then rapidly digested by the exonuclease(s), possibly due to the higher enzyme affinity for the poly(A)-rich sequence. Indeed, blocking the polyadenylation of RNA in an RNA degradation assay based on lysed chloroplasts had the same effect as the addition of yeast tRNA, an exonuclease inhibitor (29Klaff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4885-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar): RNA degradation was inhibited, and endonucleolytic cleavage products accumulated.2 Moreover, polyadenylated RNA was specifically degraded in a chloroplast protein extract and competed with non-polyadenylated RNA for the degradation machinery (Fig. 1) (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this work, we provide a more profound understanding of the last step of this degradation mechanism. We show that an exonuclease isolated from spinach chloroplasts, 100RNP/PNPase, uses RNA with a poly(A) tail as the preferred substrate, suggesting that specific degradation of polyadenylated RNA is a phenomenon intrinsic to the exonuclease and that other proteins are not required. Thus, polyadenylation of RNA degradation products at their 3′-end increases their binding affinity for the exonuclease 100RNP/PNPase, rendering these RNAs more susceptible to the enzyme's activity. Analysis of the proteins involved in the processing of the 3′-end of the RNA in the chloroplast revealed a high molecular mass complex harboring 100RNP/PNPase and an endonuclease that cross-reacted with antibodies prepared against the E. coli endonuclease RNase E (13Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). RNA maturation and degradation in the chloroplast may therefore resemble the prokaryotic process, preserving its ancestral origin. Indeed, recent studies have confirmed the important role played by polyadenylation in the decay of E. coli transcripts. These poly(A) tails are added to at least some transcripts at multiple sites, rendering them extremely susceptible to degradation by an as yet undefined mechanism (20Cohen S.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 829-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1800-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Cao G.

Regnier P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3144-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A significant proportion of this polyadenylation occurs at endonucleolytic cleavages sites within the coding and 3′-ends of the transcripts (26Haugel-Nielsen J. Hajnsdorf E. Regnier P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3144-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the mechanism of polyadenylation-dependent exonucleolytic RNA degradation may be similar in bacteria and chloroplasts. To date, two exonucleases have been identified in bacteria, both working in the 3′ to 5′ direction (5Belasco J.G. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, New York1993: 3-12Crossref Google Scholar, 38Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13011-13014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolation of a chloroplast exonuclease homologous to the bacterial PNPase and the similarity of their RNA degradation systems suggest that the situation in the chloroplast is similar to that in the bacterial cell. In this work, we show that purified 100RNP/PNPase preferably degrades polyadenylated RNA, similar to the situation in the chloroplast extract. However, the identification and characterization of other chloroplast exonucleases are required to determine whether the preferred poly(A) RNA degradation phenomenon is also shared by the other exonucleases. Indeed, higher in vitro degradation activity of bacterial RNase II for polyadenylated RNA was recently detected (39Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15776-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In that direction, a potential RNase II homologue from spinach chloroplast is under purification. 4A. Kotler and G. Schuster, unpublished data. Isolated 100RNP/PNPase was active as a poly(A) polymerase (data not shown). However, depletion of 100RNP/PNPase from the chloroplast extract by heparin or single-stranded DNA columns did not interfere with in vitro polyadenylation activity (27Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, a poly(A) polymerase has been isolated from chloroplast extract (37Burkard G. Keller E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).3 A similar situation of in vitropolymerase activity of the PNPase and the existence of poly(A) polymerases was reported for bacteria (14Littauer U.Z. Soreq H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 517-533Google Scholar). RNA polyadenylation was even enhanced in bacteria cells where the PNPase was inactivated (26Haugel-Nielsen J. Hajnsdorf E. Regnier P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3144-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Combined, these results suggest that in vivo, 100RNP/PNPase might be active only as an exonuclease, probably by inhibition of its polyadenylation activity by an as yet unknown mechanism. Another possibility is that the degradation as opposed to the polymerization activity is modulated by the concentration of phosphate ions. The polymerization activity of the bacterial PNPase and chloroplast 100RNP/PNPase is highly inhibited by a relatively low concentration of inorganic phosphate (13Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Littauer U.Z. Soreq H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 517-533Google Scholar, 15Carpousis A.J. Van Houwe G. Ehretsmann C. Krisch H.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Taking into account the concentrations of inorganic phosphate and nucleoside diphosphates in the chloroplast, the degradative reaction is highly favored. Therefore, detailed biochemical characterization of the 100RNP/PNPase action in the high molecular mass complex and the factors that modulate its activity will probably help to resolve this issue. 100RNP/PNPase, like the bacterial PNPase, is a processive exoribonuclease that binds to the 3′-end and digests the RNA nucleotide by nucleotide, without disconnecting from the molecule (13Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Competition experiments showed high binding affinity of 100RNP/PNPase for poly(A) (Figs. 5 and 6). The experiment presented in Fig. 4 shows that in order for the non-polyadenylated RNA to compete for 100RNP/PNPase, the poly(A) stretch must be located at the 3′-end. Taken together, these results suggest that the high affinity of 100RNP/PNPase for the poly(A) stretch directs the enzyme to the poly(A) part of the RNA, and only if this part is at the 3′-end of the molecule can the enzyme start digesting the RNA. Since 100RNP/ PNPase works processively along the RNA, it remains bound to it and is thereby excluded from the non-polyadenylated molecules. We thank Ruth Haddar for excellent technical assistance."

The RT of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of a p66 and a p51 subunit that share a common amino terminus. The smaller subunit is a cleavage product of p66 and lacks the RNase H domain (1Di Marzo Veronese F. Copeland T.D. DeVico A.L. Rahman R. Oroszlan S. Gallo R.C. Sarngadharan M.G.

Virol. 1986; 60: 771-775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RT is a multifunctional enzyme that possesses a DNA-dependent and an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity and an RNase H activity that cleaves RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids. In addition to these activities it uses a host-derived tRNA3Lys molecule as a primer for the first round of polymerization. Furthermore, it has been shown that HIV RT is only active as a dimeric enzyme and that the monomeric subunits show no catalytic activities (3Restle T. Müller B. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8986-8988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Restle T. Müller B. Goody R.S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For HIV-1 RT and for other DNA polymerases, a polymerization mechanism has been proposed where the binding of primer-template precedes the binding and incorporation of the first dNTP (5Rittinger K. Divita G. Goody R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8046-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A model for the mechanism of RT polymerization is shown in Scheme 1. In this model, the first step of the reaction is thought to be the formation of a collision complex of RT and DNA that is concentration-dependent. This is succeeded by a conformational change to form a tight complex, which in turn is a prerequisite for dNTP binding. A second conformational change is necessary after the initial binding of the dNTP to form a tight ternary complex. This was identified as the rate-limiting step prior to nucleotide incorporation (6Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RT+pn/tk+1⇄k−1RT·pn/tk+2⇄k−2RT*·pn/t RT*·pn/t+ dNTPK3⇆RT*·pn/t·dNTPK4⇄*RT*·pn/t·dNTPK5⇆*RT*·pn+1/t+PPi Scheme 1. Model for the kinetic mechanism of polymerization by RT. The asterisks indicate different conformational states of the RT. One of the highly conserved motifs in retroviral RTs spans the region from residue 220 to 243 (7Xiong Y. Eickbush T.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3353-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Part of this region in p66 constitutes the “primer grip” and forms a hairpin structure that ranges from residue 227 to 235 (β12-β13 hairpin, adopting the nomenclature of Ref. 8Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1993; 1: 129-150Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the RT/DNA cocrystal the primer grip is located in close vicinity to the polymerase active site and was therefore proposed to be important for maintaining the 3′-OH end of the primer in the appropriate orientation for nucleophilic attack on an incoming dNTP (8Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Des. 1993; 1: 129-150Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Especially the amino acids in the loop connecting β12 and β13 (Met230 and Gly231) and the residues adjacent to the loop, namely Trp229 at the end of β12 and Tyr232 at the beginning of β13, are close to the nucleic acid and could play a role in orienting the DNA primer. The analysis of regions that are necessary for RT function may contribute to the design of more efficient inhibitors targeting essential residues. To investigate the importance of the primer grip region for RT function, mutant RTs were used that contain single alanine substitutions of residues Trp229, Met230, Gly231, and Tyr232 only in p66. The mutant p66 polypeptides were reconstituted into heterodimer in vitrowith a wild type p51 subunit (10Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Howard K.J. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol.

Pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetic methods were used to analyze tRNA and primer-template binding, as well as nucleotide binding and incorporation of the mutant enzymes. Selectively mutated p66/51 HIV-1 RT and WT RT were prepared by in vitro reconstitution as described previously (10Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Howard K.J. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1388-1393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Ottmann M. Darlix J.-L. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, biomass from Escherichia colicultures expressing the mutant p66 polypeptide was mixed with that of a strain expressing His6-p51 and co-homogenized. The high speed supernatant was loaded on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen) column and eluted with a 0–0.5 mimidazole gradient. RT-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and applied on a DEAE-Sepharose column. The flow-through of the column was then applied onto a HiTrap SP column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to separate the dimeric fraction from excess His6-p51 and eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. Samples were dialyzed against a buffer containing 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. The purified RTs were free of nuclease contamination. RT buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Annealing buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl. Reaction buffer contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmKCl, and 1 mm dithioerythritol. HPLC buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm KCl. Urea-loading buffer contained 7 m urea in Tris borate/EDTA buffer with 0.1% xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue. RT polymerase activity on poly(rA)/oligo(dT)12–18 substrates was measured by a standard assay (30 μl reaction volume) described previously (11Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Ottmann M. Darlix J.-L. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26472-26478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 5–10 ng of enzyme in RT buffer. Under these conditions, 1 unit of RT activity catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of dTTP into poly(rA)/oligo(dT)12–18 in 10 min. HPLC gel filtration analysis was performed using a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column. 5–30 μg of enzyme were loaded onto the column. The column was eluted with HPLC buffer at 0.5 ml/min. In vitro transcription and purification of tRNA3Lys was performed as described previously (14Thrall S.H. Reinstein J. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). E. colitRNA2Trp was purchased from Sigma. Fluorescence titrations were performed using an SLM Smart 8100 spectrofluorometer equipped with a PH-PC 9635 photomultiplier. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements using the tryptophan fluorescence of the enzymes were performed in reaction buffer in a total volume of 0.7 ml or 1 ml as described previously at an excitation wave length of 295 nm. The emission intensity was measured at 340 nm (slit widths of 1 and 16 nm for excitation and emission, respectively) (14Thrall S.H. Reinstein J. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Values for the dissociation constant (K d ) were determined as described previously (15Müller B. Restle T. Reinstein J. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3709-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using the data-fitting program Grafit (Erithacus Software). A quadratic equation analogous to the one given by Müller et al. (15Müller B. Restle T. Reinstein J. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3709-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was used for the fitting procedure. Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380 B DNA synthesizer and purified by HPLC on a reversed phase column by standard procedures (15Müller B. Restle T. Reinstein J. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3709-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide, 7m urea) and elution of the desired DNA band. The sequence of the 18-mer primer oligonucleotide was 5′-TCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCAC, and that of the corresponding 36-mer template oligonucleotide was 5′-TGTGGAAAATCTCATGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGA. The complementary regions are equivalent to the primer binding site sequence from HIV-1. The sequence of the fluorescently labeled primer oligodeoxynucleotide was identical to the one above with the fluorescent label at the 5′-end. It was synthesized by coupling the phosphoramidite dye 6-FAM, a fluorescein derivative, directly to the 5′-end of the oligodeoxynucleotide during DNA synthesis according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). For the fluorescently labeled primer oligonucleotide, 5′-TGTGGAAAATCTCTAGATGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGA was used as a template. Primer and template oligonucleotides were annealed by heating equimolar amounts in annealing buffer for 2 min at 90 °C, followed by cooling to room temperature over 1 h in a water bath. Experiments with the 5′-fluorescently labeled FAM-primer-template (p/t) were performed and evaluated as described above. The excitation was at 492 nm, and the emission intensity was measured at 516 nm (slit widths set at 1 and 8 nm for excitation and emission, respectively). For displacement titrations, a preformed complex of 30 nm RT and 30 nm of fluorescently labeled p/t DNA was titrated with unlabeled p/t in reaction buffer. The increase in fluorescence was used as a signal for displacement of labeled p/t. Data were analyzed by using the fitting program Scientist to determine the K d values for the unlabeled p/t. Primer oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) using 7 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig) per 100 pmol of DNA for 1 h at 37 °C. The primer was separated from nucleotides by purification over a NucTrap Probe Purification Column (Stratagene) according to the procedure described by the manufacturer. Concentrations were determined by thin layer chromatography using a phosphor imaging device (Bio-Rad) for quantification. Rapid quench experiments were carried out in a rapid quench apparatus built by KinTek Instruments (University Park, PA) in reaction buffer. 15 μl of a preformed complex of 100 nm RT or higher concentrations as indicated for the mutants in the figures and p/t DNA (200 nm) were rapidly mixed with 15 μl of dTTP (up to concentrations of 5 mm). Reactions were quenched at various time points with 0.6% trifluoroacetic acid. The products were analyzed on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels with 7 m urea. Quantification of the data was achieved by phosphor imaging. All concentrations reported are final concentrations after mixing in the rapid quench apparatus. Data were fitted to a burst equation (single exponential plus slope) using the program Grafit. The pre-steady-state rate is given by the exponential (6Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The burst amplitude corresponds to the amount of RT bound to p/t at the beginning of the reaction (t = 0). Affinities for dTTP were determined by the dependence of the pre-steady-state burst rate on the dTTP concentration. The RT-p/t complex (200 nm p/t with RT as indicated in Fig. 5 for the various enzymes) was rapidly mixed with increasing concentrations of nucleotide and quenched after t½ of the maximal pre-steady-state rate. The corresponding rates were calculated from the elongated fraction of the primer by converting the single exponential equation into k = −ln((1 − fraction of elongated primer/burst amplitude))/t½. The observed rates were then plotted against the nucleotide concentration, and theK d for dTTP was calculated by fitting the data to a hyperbola using the program Grafit. primer extension assays were performed with 200 nm radioactively labeled p/t and 100 or 450 nm dimeric RT enzyme at 25 °C in reaction buffer in a total reaction volume of 10 μl. Reactions were started by adding dNTPs as indicated in Fig. 6 and were stopped after 5 min by the addition of 10 μl of urea-loading buffer. To obtain a first impression of whether the introduction of mutations into the primer grip region has an impact on RT function, we assayed the RNA-dependent DNA-polymerase activity of the reconstituted wild type and mutant enzymes on the homopolymeric substrate poly(rA)/oligo(dT)12–18. Table I shows that the RT activity of all mutants is reduced. The most severe reduction of RT polymerase activity can be detected with p66W229A/51. Previous primer extension experiments with a synthetic 36/71-mer p/t DNA had already indicated that this mutant is strongly impaired in polymerase activity (11Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Ottmann M. Darlix J.-L. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26472-26478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no detailed kinetic analyses of the polymerase function of the mutants were available.Table IQuantitative comparison of polymerase activity on a homopolymeric substrateEnzymePercentage of Wild type activity%WT p66/51100p66W229A/510.1p66M230A/5111p66G231A/5121p66Y232A/5134 Open table in a new tab The reduction of RT activity of the mutants may derive from different mechanisms. First, the mutation can have an effect on the dimer stability of p66/51. Second, the binding affinity to the nucleic acid substrate can be reduced; and third, the mutant enzyme can have a defect in nucleotide binding and incorporation (see Scheme 1). In the following sections we describe the analysis of these possibilities. Since monomeric HIV-1 RT subunits do not show catalytic activity (3Restle T. Müller B. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8986-8988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is important to determine the dimer content of the purified enzymes, especially since the enzymes used were reconstituted from subunits expressed separately. N-terminal tagging of the p51 subunit with six additional histidines allows purification by metal chelate chromatography. The wild type or mutated p66 subunit, which in our case does not have a histidine extension, can only be retained on the column if it interacts with p51 (10Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Howard K.J. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1388-1393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although metal chelate chromatography (16Hochuli E. Bannwarth W. Döbeli H. Gentz R. Stüber D. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1321-1325Crossref Scopus (962) Google Scholar) of the in vitro reconstituted HIV-1 RT mutants is a powerful method that permits purification of the dimer fraction of an enzyme, it does not give much information on the stability of the purified dimer. If the dimer is not stable, a dimer/monomer equilibrium will be reestablished after purification of the dimeric enzyme fraction. To investigate this possibility, we determined the dimer content of the RT enzymes by HPLC size exclusion gel filtration (Fig. 1) after the proteins had been purified and dialyzed against storage buffer. The results, shown in Table II, indicate that the mutants p66W229A/51 and p66G231A/51 are not completely dimerized. p66W229A/51 is only about 35% dimeric, and the dimer content of p66G231A/51 is about 60%. Therefore, the low polymerase activity of mutants p66W229A/51 and p66G231A/51 is partly due to the low dimer content of the purified stock solutions. This result indicates that the dimer, due to its instability, tends to monomerize during the purification procedure. To account for this result, for all the analyses shown below only the dimer content of the enzymes was considered for calculations. The dimer interface of the mutants p66M230A/51 and p66Y232A/51 appears to be intact, since we could not detect appreciable amounts of monomer.Table IIDimer content of RT preparations usedEnzymePercentage of dimer%WT p66/51>95p66W229A/5135p66M230A/51>90p66G231A/5160p66Y232A/51>95 Open table in a new tab To examine whether the enzymes p66W229A/51 and p66G231A/51 are stable under the conditions used in our kinetic experiments (25 °C for up to 1.0 h) we isolated the dimer fraction of mutants p66W229A/51 and p66G231A/51 by separation on an HPLC gel filtration column. This is shown in Fig. 1, C and D, for p66W229A/51. Immediately after collection, an aliquot of the collected dimer fraction was loaded again on the HPLC gel filtration column to show the dimer content of the isolated peak fraction (Fig. 1 C). Another aliquot was incubated for 1.0 h at 25 °C and then analyzed again by HPLC gel filtration (Fig. 1 D). The mutant enzymes remained dimeric for up to 4.5 h of incubation at 25 °C (data not shown). This suggests that the proteins do not dissociate to a great extent under the conditions in which our experiments were performed. However, the wild type and mutant enzymes started to dissociate appreciably after 15 min at 37 °C, a temperature that in general is used for many enzyme assays with RT (data not shown). tRNA3Lys is the natural replication primer of HIV-RT. We have shown recently that the intrinsic fluorescence of RT can be used to monitor p/t and tRNA binding (14Thrall S.H. Reinstein J. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,17Divita G. Müller B. Immendörfer U. Gautel M. Rittinger K. Restle T. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Heterodimeric RT possesses 37 tryptophan residues. Binding of tRNA or p/t to RT leads to a quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence of the protein that can be used to determine the dissociation constant (K d ). However, comparison of binding affinities for WT RT to various tRNA species showed that RT does not bind tRNA3Lys specifically; instead, for all tRNA species tested, similar K d values were determined (14Thrall S.H. Reinstein J. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether the mutant RTs are still able to bind tRNA we used E. colitRNA2Tyr for the intrinsic fluorescence titrations (Fig. 2). The results presented in TableIII indicate that mutations in the primer grip do not affect tRNA binding. This was confirmed by titration of wild type and mutant RT p66W229A/51 with synthetic tRNA3Lys. The K d values obtained for synthetic tRNA3Lyswere 11 nm for the wild type and 7 nm for p66W229A/51. Our results demonstrate that the primer grip region is not essential for tRNA binding.Table IIIDissociation constants for tRNA and p/t DNAEnzymeK d of tRNAK d of p/tnmwt p66/51111.8p66W229A/513-aCorrected for dimer content.1748p66M230A/51162.1p66G231A/513-aCorrected for dimer content.2442p66Y232A/51ND3-bNot determined.153-a Corrected for dimer content.3-b Not determined. Open table in a new tab The affinity of the mutant RTs for p/t DNA was determined by equilibrium fluorescence titrations using a 18/36-mer p/t DNA substrate labeled at the 5′-end of the primer with the fluorescein derivative FAM. TheK d values obtained for the wild type enzyme with this method are similar to those obtained by intrinsic fluorescence measurements (K d = 1.8 nm; Ref. 17Divita G. Müller B. Immendörfer U. Gautel M. Rittinger K. Restle T. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since some of the mutants have rather high K d values for p/t, for practical reasons we used the extrinsic fluorescence determination for standard procedures because the signal change is larger and more stable (Fig. 3). The binding affinities for p66W229A/51 and p66G231A/51 were about 23–27-fold lower than for wild type, whereas the binding affinity for mutant p66Y232A/51, which possessed the highest RT polymerase activity (Table I), was only about 8-fold lower. Interestingly, the mutation of p66M230A/51 does not appear to have an effect on p/t binding. This result indicates that this mutant, which retains only 11% of the WT RT polymerase activity must be impaired in one of the steps following p/t binding. However, to exclude the possibility that the fluorescence label has an influence on the affinity of the mutant for p/t, we performed displacement titrations. A preformed complex between RT and the fluorescent p/t was titrated with the unlabeled 18/36-mer DNA. Displacement of the labeled p/t is dependent on the K d of both p/t DNAs. Analysis of the displacement data for the wild type and p66M230A/51 leads to K d values for the unlabeled p/t species of 5.2 and 5.3 nm, respectively, which indicates that the label does not influence the binding affinities of the mutant and confirms that the affinity of wild type and p66M230A/51 for p/t is unchanged. To analyze the kinetics of nucleotide binding and incorporation we used quench flow methods (6Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elongation of the 18/36-mer DNA to the 19/36-mer product was achieved by rapid mixing of the preformed enzyme-DNA complex with various concentrations of the next correct deoxynucleotide dTTP in a quench flow apparatus. Fig. 4 shows a typical time dependence of dTTP incorporation at a concentration of 1 mm. All enzymes incorporated dTTP rapidly in a burst of polymerization followed by a slower steady state reaction (slope of the fitted curves), which is dependent on the off-rate of p/t binding. The burst amplitude corresponds to the amount of RT bound to p/t at the beginning of the reaction. Both the burst amplitude and the burst rate are, among other things, dependent on the affinity of the enzyme for p/t. Mutants having high K d values for p/t DNA (p66W229A/51, p66G231A/51, and p66Y232A/51) showed smaller burst amplitudes and reduced burst rates. For p66W229A/51 and p66G231A/51, the enzyme concentration had to be increased to detect the burst (Fig.4 B). To reach the maximal pre-steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation (maximal burst rate,k pol), elevated dTTP concentrations of up to 5 mm had to be used for mutants p66W229A/51, p66M230A/51, and p66G231A/51, indicating a lower affinity for nucleotides (see below). With WT RT, the maximal rate is already achieved at a dTTP concentration of 150 μm. The k pol values obtained for dTTP incorporation for all enzymes are shown in TableIV.Table IVParameters for incorporation of dTTP into p/t DNAEnzymekpolK dkpol /K ds −1μmμm −1 s −1wt p66/512692.88p66W229A/514-aCorrected for dimer content.0.961845.22 × 10−3p66M230A/515.16407.97 × 10−3p66G231A/514-aCorrected for dimer content.0.373251.14 × 10−3p66Y232A/514.7150.314-a Corrected for dimer content. Open table in a new tab The method described here for the determination ofk pol can also be applied to determine the apparent affinities of dTTP to the RT-DNA complex by measuring the dependence of the pre-steady-state burst rate on the concentration of dTTP (6Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rates increase with increasing dTTP concentrations used. The observed rates at different dTTP concentrations were plotted against the dTTP concentration, and the dissociation constant (K d ) for dTTP was calculated by fitting the data to a hyperbola (6Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Again, mutant p66Y232A/51 was the least impaired. In addition to their low affinity for p/t DNA, the affinity of mutants p66W229A/51 and p66G231A/51 for dTTP was reduced 20- and 36-fold, respectively. Our data clearly show that the major effect of the mutation in p66M230A/51 is a severe increase (71-fold) in the K d for dTTP. A summary of the results is given in Table IV. Fig.6 demonstrates that the results of the equilibrium titration and single turnover experiments can be confirmed in a polymerization assay. A primer extension assay was performed using the same radioactively labeled p/t (200 nm) as substrate as applied in the quench flow experiments and increasing amounts of dNTPs and RT. In this experiment, p66Y232A/51 was only slightly less active than the wild type enzyme even when low dNTP concentrations of 50 μm were used. p66M230A/51 needs higher dNTP concentrations to perform efficient polymerization to the end of the template. With mutants p66W229A/51 and p66G231A/51, as expected from the results shown above, both an increase in the enzyme and dNTP concentrations is necessary for proficient polymerization. The aim of this work was to characterize the importance of the primer grip of HIV-1 RT by kinetic analyses of four mutant RT enzymes. Comparison of the primer grip region of HIV-1 RT with RTs from other retroviruses possessing a p66/51 structure (feline immunodeficiency virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, equine infectious anemia virus, and HIV-2) shows that Pro225, Pro226, Trp229, Gly231, and Leu234 are invariant, indicating an important role of these residues for enzyme function (7Xiong Y. Eickbush T.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3353-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Residues Trp229 and Leu234 of HIV-1 p66 also participate in the binding of non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNIs).

In brain and many other cells, type I InsP3 5-phosphatase is the major phosphatase that dephosphorylates InsP3 andd-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. The type I 5-phosphatase appears to be associated with the particulate fraction of cell homogenates. Molecular cloning of the human brain enzyme identifies a C-terminal farnesylation site CVVQ. Post-translational modification of this enzyme promotes membrane interactions and changes in specific activity. We have now compared the cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+] i ) responses induced by ATP, thapsigargin, and ionomycin in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells transfected with the intact InsP35-phosphatase and with a mutant in which the C-terminal cysteine cannot be farnesylated. [Ca2+] i was also measured in cells transfected with an InsP3 3-kinase construct encoding the A isoform. The Ca2+ oscillations detected in the presence of 1 μm ATP in control cells were totally lost in 87.5% of intact (farnesylated) InsP35-phosphatase-transfected cells, while such a loss occurred in only 1.1% of the mutant InsP3 5-phosphatase-transfected cells. All cells overexpressing the InsP3 3-kinase also responded with an oscillatory pattern. However, in contrast to control cells, the [Ca2+] i returned to base-line levels in between a couple of oscillations. The [Ca2+] i responses to thapsigargin and ionomycin were identical for all cells. The four cell clones compared in this study also behaved similarly with respect to capacitative Ca2+ entry. In permeabilized cells, no differences in extent of InsP3-induced Ca2+release nor in the threshold for InsP3 action were observed among the four clones and no differences in the expression levels of the various InsP3 receptor isoforms could be shown between the clones. Our data support the contention that the ATP-induced increase in InsP3 concentration in transfected CHO-K1 cells is essentially restricted to the site of its production near the plasma membrane, where it can be metabolized by the type I InsP35-phosphatase.

Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C produces the second messengersd-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3,d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PI, phosphoinositides; InsP3R, InsP3 receptor; InsP4, d-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; [Ca2+] i, intracellular calcium level. and diacylglycerol, which function in mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C, respectively (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar). InsP3 is metabolized by an InsP3 5-phosphatase to produce inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, which is inactive in Ca2+ mobilization (2Downes C.P. Mussat M.C. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 203: 169-177Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In addition, InsP3 can be phosphorylated tod-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) by an InsP3 3-kinase (3Irvine R.F. Letcher A.J. Heslop J.P. Berridge M.J. Nature. 1986; 320: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type, different effects of InsP4 have been reported, some of which are directly or indirectly related to Ca2+ homeostasis (reviewed in Refs. 4Irvine R.F. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 161-185PubMed Google Scholar and 5Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G. St J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In sea urchin eggs, in perfused lacrimal cells, and in permeabilized mouse lymphoma cells, synergistic effects of InsP4 on InsP3-stimulated Ca2+ release have been reported (6Irvine R.F. Moor R.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 917-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 7Morris A.P. Gallacher D.V. Irvine R.F. Petersen O.H.

However, in mouse lacrimal acinar cells, high concentrations of InsP4 were reported to inhibit the inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ entry (9Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6766-6770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In mouse exocrine pancreatic acinar cells, InsP4 is effective in mobilizing Ca2+ and promoting Ca2+ influx in conditions where phospholipase A2 activity, and thus arachidonic acid production, is inhibited (10Rowles S.J. Gallacher D.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recently, a high affinity InsP4-binding protein has been purified from pig platelets (11Cullen P.J. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding this putative receptor encoded a GTPase-activating protein. In vitro, it shows GTPase-activating protein activity against Ras that is inhibited by phospholipids and specifically stimulated by InsP4(12Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Both the InsP3 3-kinase and the 5-phosphatase consist of a family of multiple isoenzymes. In particular, the various 5-phosphatases dephosphorylate InsP3, InsP4, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate with different specificities,K m, and V max (13Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 14Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 15Drayer A.L. Pesesse X.

Commun. 1996; 225: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based upon kinetic analysis (K m for InsP3 andV max values compared with other 5-phosphatases), this enzyme is generally considered as a signal-terminating enzyme for InsP3, analogous to the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases for cyclic AMP (21Beavo J.A. Reifsnyder D.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 150-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The type I 5-phosphatase has a higher affinity but lowerV max for InsP4 as compared with InsP3, suggesting that it could be rapidly saturated with InsP4, particularly in brain, which produces more InsP4 than any other tissue (22Batty I.R. Nahorski S.R. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In most tissues, particularly in brain, total InsP3 5-phosphatase activity measured in homogenates is associated with the particulate fraction (13Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 23Erneux C. Delvaux A. Moreau C. Dumont J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This activity is predominantly due to type I, as shown by Western blot analysis and by immunoprecipitation of the activity in particulate fractions of various tissues by using specific antibodies (18Laxminarayan K.M. Matzaris M. Speed C.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4968-4974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Verjans B. Hollande F. Moreau C. Lejeune C. Erneux C. Cell Signalling. 1990; 2: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of the dog and human type I InsP3 5-phosphatase identifies a 412-amino acid protein and a C-terminal farnesylation site, CVVQ (25Verjans B. De Smedt F. Lecocq R. Vanweyenberg V.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17305-17310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of this isoprenylation site shifted the protein from largely particulate to soluble, and immunofluorescence analysis with confocal microscopy showed a shift from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. This was evidenced by generating and using two different mutants in the isoprenylation motif and transfecting them in COS-7 cells (28De Smedt F. Boom A. Pesesse X. Schiffmann S.N. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10419-10424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Different cells show a different activity ratio between the InsP3 5-phosphatase and 3-kinase activities,e.g. high levels of InsP3 3-kinase A are found in the rat or human hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, while no detectable InsP3 3-kinase activity (and therefore intracellular InsP4 formation) could be shown in ram sperm (29Mailleux P. Takazawa K. Erneux C. Vanderhaeghen J.J. Brain Res. 1991; 539: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Harrison R.A.P. Roldan E.R.S. Lander D.J. Irvine R.F. Cell Signalling. 1990; 2: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In rat AR4–2J pancreatoma cells, InsP3 3-kinase activity could only be seen in high speed supernatants of cellular homogenates, and these cells may actually overexpress InsP35-phosphatase activity as compared with non-tumoral acinar cells (31Mennitti F.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 622-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Finally, InsP3 3-kinase activity is modulated by the Ca2+-calmodulin complex; the extent of this modulation varies between the various isoenzymes in different cell types (32Biden T.J. Comte M.

Many cell types respond to agonists acting via the phosphoinositide signaling pathway by the generation of Ca2+ oscillations (38Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although InsP3 plays a key role in the various models that have been proposed to explain this behavior, the influence of the InsP3-metabolizing activities on the oscillatory cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+] i ) response in single cells is largely unknown. Does the InsP3 3-kinase or the 5-phosphatase control the [Ca2+] i oscillations generated in response to an agonist in intact cells? Could isoprenylation of the type I InsP3 5-phosphatase and its targeting to the cell surface influence the [Ca2+] i response? These questions were addressed in the present study by comparing, for the first time, the [Ca2+] i responses induced by ATP in CHO-K1 cells transfected with the intact InsP35-phosphatase and with a mutant in which the C-terminal cysteine cannot be isoprenylated. The data have been compared with CHO-K1 cells transfected with an InsP3 3-kinase construct encoding the human brain A isoform. pcDNA3 vector is an expression vector developed by Invitrogen. Radioactive products, including [3H]InsP3 (40–60 Ci/mmol for binding assays), [3H]InsP4 (15–30 Ci/mmol), and [32P]InsP4 were obtained or prepared as described previously (20Drayer A.L. Pesesse X.

ATP, UTP, Pefabloc, and leupeptin were from Sigma. Cell culture medium and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Inc. Stable CHO-K1 cell lines overexpressing the InsP3-metabolizing enzymes were generated as described previously (28De Smedt F. Boom A. Pesesse X. Schiffmann S.N. Erneux C. J. Biol.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was subcloned using theBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pcDNA3 expression vector for transfection into CHO-K1 cells. The DNA corresponding to the InsP3 3-kinase was transfected into CHO-K1 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (41Gottesman B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 151: 3-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected in 6-cm diameter culture dishes. Two days after transfection, selection of transfected cells was started by addition of fresh complete medium (Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% fungizone, and 2% penicillin/streptomycin) containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin G418. After death of all non-transfected cells, 16 G418-resistant clones were isolated and transferred into 9-cm diameter culture dishes. Medium was changed every 48 h. The CHO-K1 cells were maintained in complete medium containing Geneticin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Out of 16 clones tested, 4 were positive with high InsP33-kinase activity. One of these clones was clone A4. A construct in pcDNA3 encoding a C-terminal mutant InsP3 5-phosphatase with a serine replacing a cysteine at position 409 of the wild type enzyme (C409S) has been described (28De Smedt F. Boom A.

The pcDNA3 vector alone, as well as the intact and the mutant InsP3 5-phosphatases were transfected in CHO-K1 cells as described above. CHO-K1 (10 × 106) cells were resuspended in 400 μl of homogenization buffer A containing 15 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 μm leupeptin, and 0.4 mm Pefabloc (pH 7.5). The cells were homogenized by passage through a 26-gauge needle (approximately 10 times). For the subcellular distribution of activities, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 80,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and the pellet resuspended in the same volume as the original homogenate (17Erneux C.

Delvaux A. Moreau C. Dumont J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). InsP3 3-kinase was determined in the presence of 0.1 μm calmodulin and either 1 mmEGTA or 10 μm free Ca2+ (34Takazawa K. Passareiro H. Dumont J.E. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 632-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To label the phosphoinositides, the CHO-K1 cells were incubated for 24 h in inositol-depleted medium supplemented withmyo-[3H]inositol (10 μCi/ml). When the medium was removed, the cells were washed twice in KRH solution (4.97 mm KCl, 1.24 mmMgSO4.7H2O, 124 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, 8.1 mm glucose, 1.3 mmKH2PO4, and 1.5 mmCaCl2.2H2O, pH 7.5). This was followed by the addition of fresh medium containing the agonist for 10 s to 1 min. The incubation was stopped by removal of the medium, followed by the addition of 2 ml of perchloric acid (3%). The cells were scrapped and the dishes rinsed with 2 ml of perchloric acid (1%). After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the solution containing the inositol phosphates was neutralized with 1 ml of Hepes (0.375 mm) and about 1.3 ml of KOH (0.765 m) to a final pH of 7.7–7.8. After 30 min on ice, the supernatant was collected and added to Na2B4O7 (5 mm) and EDTA (0.5 mm) (42Pirotton S. Raspe E. Demolle D. Erneux C. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17461-17466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The separation of inositol phosphates was achieved by chromatography on Dowex AG 1-X8 (formate form, 100–200-μm mesh) column. By this method, we do not separate the various inositol phosphate isomers in each fraction. Inositol, glycerophosphoinositol, InsP1, InsP2, InsP3, and InsP4 were eluted sequentially with: 20 ml of water; 8 ml of 60 mm ammonium formate, 5 mm Na2B4O7; 20 ml of 150 mm ammonium formate, 5 mmNa2B4O7; 18 ml of 400 mm ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid; 12 ml of 700 mm ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid; and 24 ml of 1.5 m ammonium formate, 0.1 mformic acid. The radioactivity of each fraction was estimated by liquid scintillation. The cell debris in the bottom of the dishes were dissolved in 1 m NaOH and counted as phosphoinositides (PI). The radioactivity associated to each fraction was normalized to the radioactivity present in the PI fraction (43Van Sande J. Massart C. Costagliola S. Allgeier A. Cetani F. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 119: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unidirectional45Ca2+ fluxes on confluent monolayers of permeabilized CHO-K1 cells were performed on a thermostated plate at 25 °C, basically as described previously for smooth muscle cells (44Missiaen L.

Casteels R. Nature. 1992; 357: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In brief, the culture medium was aspirated and replaced by 1 ml of permeabilization medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 μg ml−1 saponin. The saponin-containing solution was removed after 10 min, and the cells were washed once with a similar saponin-free solution. 45Ca2+ uptake into the non-mitochondrial Ca2+ stores was accomplished by incubation for 45 min in 1 ml of loading medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.44 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaN3, and 100 nm free 45Ca2+. After this phase of45Ca2+ accumulation, the monolayers were incubated in 1 ml of efflux medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 1 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 μm thapsigargin. The efflux medium was replaced at fixed time intervals (6 s or 2 min). Replacing the medium each 6 s has the advantage that it permits rapid changing of the InsP3 concentration. This allows the accurate measurement of the threshold for InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (46Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12287-12293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment, the45Ca2+ remaining in the stores was released by incubation in 1 ml of a 2% SDS solution for 30 min. Wild-type and transfected cells were cultured up to confluence in Doubletray Units (1200 cm2, Nunc). From each unit, 200–250 × 106 cells were harvested by mild trypsinization. A total microsomal fraction was prepared as described previously for several other cell lines (40Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Bootman M.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This particulate fraction from CHO-K1 cells contained 25 ± 1% (n = 11) of the cellular proteins. This amounted to 43 ± 2 (n = 14) mg protein/109 cells. No differences between the clones were observed. [3H]InsP3 binding was measured with a rapid filtration assay using 4 nm[3H]InsP3 and 200 μg of protein/filter, as published previously (40Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Bootman M.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Specific binding amounted for all samples to more than 95% of the total binding activity. InsP3R isoform determination was performed after SDS-PAGE (3–12% gradient gels) and Western blotting. Previously characterized isoform-specific antibodies against InsP3R-I (40Parys J.B. De Smedt H.

Detection was performed using secondary antibodies coupled to either horseradish peroxidase and using 3,3′ diaminobenzidine as substrate or coupled to alkaline phosphatase and using Vistra ECF as substrate. The latter was used according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the signal was quantified using the Storm 840 FluorImager equipped with the ImageQuant NT4.2 software (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). Statistical analysis of the results was performed using the paired or unpaired Student's t test, as applicable. Single-cell [Ca2+] i measurements were performed with a laser-scanning MRC-1000 system (Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK) attached to an inverted Nikon Diaphot 300 epifluorescence microscope with a CF Fluor 40 × (NA = 1.3) oil immersion objective (48Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Oike M. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5817-5823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after removing the culture medium and washing the cells, they were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm Indo-1-AM dissolved in a modified Krebs solution of the following composition: 135 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11.6 mm Hepes, and 11.5 mm glucose (pH 7.3). The cells were then further incubated for at least 1 h in the absence of Indo-1. During the experiment, the cells were continuously superfused from a pipette placed on top of the cell. In the experiments where Ca2+ was omitted from the medium, 2 mmEGTA was added. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Results were always expressed as ratios of emitted fluorescence. Scanning was done each 0.25 s, with a scanning box containing 384 × 256 lines. The signals were not averaged. CHO-K1 cell lines overexpressing the intact type I InsP3 5-phosphatase (clone C1), the C-terminal cysteine mutant of the type I InsP35-phosphatase (clone 61), or the InsP3 3-kinase A (clone A4) were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Table I shows the enzymatic activities that were measured in the different cell lines: the InsP35-phosphatase activity was increased by 15–25-fold in InsP3 5-phosphatase-overexpressing cells as compared with control (wild type CHO-K1) cells. The InsP3 3-kinase activity was increased by 9-fold in CHO-K1 cells overexpressing the InsP3 3-kinase. Since the type I InsP35-phosphatase could use either InsP3 or InsP4as substrates, cells transfected with the 5-phosphatase constructs also showed increased InsP4 5-phosphatase activity as compared with wild type cells (Table I). In the two clones transfected with InsP3 5-phosphatase constructs, the InsP33-kinase activity was not detectable because either the substrate or the product of the InsP3 3-kinase reaction were dephosphorylated despite the presence of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (an InsP3 5-phosphatase inhibitor; Ref. 35Takazawa K.

These responses can be blocked by a specific ligand of αMβ2, neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF). The molecular basis of αMβ2-NIF interactions was studied. The single chain αM subunit, expressed on the surface of human 293 cells, bound NIF with an affinity equivalent to that of αMβ2 heterodimer. This observation, coupled with previous data showing that the αMI domain alone supported high affinity NIF binding, indicated that the binding site for NIF is restricted to the I domain. Guided by the crystal structure of the αMI domain, 16 segments corresponding to the entire outer hydrated surface of αMI domain were switched to their counterparts sequences in αL, which does not bind NIF. Surface expression and heterodimer formation were achieved for all mutants, and correct folding was confirmed. Of the 16 switches, only 5 affected NIF binding substantially, reducing affinity by 8–300-fold. These data confined the NIF-binding site to a narrow region composed of Pro147-Arg152, Pro201-Lys217, and Asp248-Arg261 of αM. Verifying this localization, when these segments were introduced into the αXI-domain, the resulting chimeric receptor was converted into a high affinity NIF-binding protein.

These integrins share a common β subunit of 95 kDa which is noncovalently linked to distinct but homologous α subunits (1Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5845) Google Scholar, 2Arnaout M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological functions of αMβ2 include roles in adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes through endothelium (3Smith C.W. Marlin S.D. Rothlein R. Toman C. Anderson D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 2008-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), phagocytosis of foreign materials (4Anderson D.C. Miller L.J. Schmalstieg F.C. Rothlein R. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 15-27PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of neutrophils and monocytes (5Shappell S.B. Toman C. Anderson D.C. Taylor A.A. Entman M.L. Smith C.W. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2702-2711PubMed Google Scholar). Excessive activation of αMβ2 contributes to sustained inflammation, reperfusion injury, and tissue damage (6von Asmuth E.J. van der Linden C.J. Leeuwenberg J.F. Buurman W.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3869-3875PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the β2 integrin subfamily is underscored by the severe phenotype of individuals with congenital deficiencies of these integrins (7Schmalstieg F.C. Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 1988; 867: 872Google Scholar). NIF (neutrophil inhibitory factor), a novel glycoprotein isolated from canine hookworms, was originally identified as an inhibitor of a number of neutrophil functions, such as adhesion to endothelial cells and adhesion-dependent release of hydrogen peroxide (8Moyle M. Foster D.L. McGrath D.E. Brown S.M. Laroche Y. De Meutter J. Stanssens P. Bogowitz C.A. Fried V.A. Ely J.A. Soule H.R. Vlasuk G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10008-10015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These functional effects resulted from its specific binding to αMβ2 but not to other β2integrins. Subsequently, we and others have reported that NIF completely blocked αMβ2-mediated binding of C3bi (9Ueda T. Rieu P. Brayer J. Arnaout M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10680-10684Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), ICAM-1(10), and adhesion to protein-coated surfaces (11Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and partially blocked fibrinogen binding (12Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26419-26423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to αMβ2-bearing cells. As an antagonist, NIF has been shown effective in attenuating the deleterious effects of excessive neutrophil activation, such as tissue damage and ischemia-reperfusion injury in animal models (13Barnard J.W. Biro M.G. Lo S.K. Ohno S. Carozza M.A. Moyle M. Soule H.R. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4876-4881PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bauer C. Siaplaouras S. Soule H.R. Moyle M. Marzi I. Shock. 1995; 4: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The I domain, an inserted region of ∼200 amino acids in the αM subunit (αMI-domain), contributes to NIF binding to αMβ2 (10Rieu P. Ueda T. Haruta I. Sharma C.P. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2081-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26419-26423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). I domains with highly conserved amino acid sequences are also found in several other integrin α-subunits as well as in other proteins, such as vWF, and mediate a variety of protein-protein interactions, including ligand binding to integrins (15Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Using blocking mAbs which map to the I domain or recombinant αMI domain itself, this region has been implicated in the binding of ICAM-1, fibrinogen (16Zhou L. Lee D.H. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and C3bi (9Ueda T. Rieu P. Brayer J. Arnaout M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10680-10684Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), as well as NIF, to αMβ2. Collectively, these data suggest that the αMI domain is an independent structural unit, capable of interacting with many different proteins. Nevertheless, the ligand binding functions of αMβ2 are not solely a property of its I domain. We (11Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and Bajt et al. (17Bajt M.L. Goodman T. McGuire S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 94-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that mutations of Asp134, Ser136, or Ser138 in β2 subunit abrogated the binding of αMβ2 to C3bi and adhesion to protein-coated surfaces, suggesting that, in addition to I domain, the β subunit also is involved in the recognition of certain ligands by αMβ2. In this study, we have utilized NIF as a model αMβ2 ligand and have sought to delineate the molecular basis for its interaction with αMβ2. Homolog-scanning mutagenesis (18Cunningham B.C. Jhurani P. Ng P. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) in which sequences within the αMI domain have been switched to the homologous sequences within the αLI domain has been used to map the NIF-binding site in αMβ2. The NIF-binding site identified through the loss-of-function mutations was confirmed by a gain-in-function experiment, whereby the I domain of αXwas converted into a NIF-binding protein. Given the ability of NIF to inhibit the binding of many ligands to αMβ2and the structural similarities among I domains, the molecular details of NIF-αMβ2 interactions may also apply to other ligands of αMβ2 and to other I domain containing intergrins. Human kidney 293 cells and the expression vector, pCIS2M, were generous gifts from Dr. F. J. Castellino (Notre Dame, IN). The cDNA of CD11b and CD18 were obtained from Dr. B. Karan-Tamir (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). NIF was a gift from Corvas Int., San Diego, CA. TS1/18, OKM1, M1/70, IB4, 44a, 904, and LM2/1 were from ATCC (ATCC, Rockville, MD). G418, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, HBSS (Hank's balanced solution), DH5α cell, and restriction enzymes were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). All other reagents were the highest grade available from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Stretches of 7–12 amino acids within the αMI domain were switched to the corresponding sequences in αL. All such segment switches were created by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using uracil-containing single stranded M13mp18 DNA (19Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10828-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To facilitate the mutagenesis, two unique restriction sites, ClaI at position 535 (Ile139), and NheI, at position 1141 (Ala342), flanking the I domain of αM, have been introduced into αM previously (11Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To switch a segment of 7–11 amino acids from αM to αL, the mutagenic primer was designed to contain the corresponding mutations and 15 additional unchanged bases at each end. The length of the primer was typically 54 bases. The site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to our published procedure using T7 DNA polymerase (19Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10828-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mutant was identified by DNA sequencing of 5 randomly picked plaques. DNA sequencing of the entire I domain was conducted, confirming the presence of the desired mutations and the correctness of the rest of the I domain. The mutated I domain was transferred back to the expression vector pCIS2M-αM using the uniqueClaI and NheI restriction sites. The cDNA of αM and β2 were inserted separately in the pCIS2M expression vector employing XbaI and XhoI sites; and expression of αM or β2 was under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter and enhancer. To generate the chimeric molecule, αM(I/αX)β2, where the αMI domain was replaced with αXI domain, the fragment of the αXI-domain (Ile137 to Val340) containing ClaI and NheI restriction sites was prepared by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction using total RNA from polymorphonuclear cells and the following two primers: 5′-CCCAAGACAGGAGCAGGACATTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTGAAGCTAGCGCTGAAGCCCTC-3′ (reverse). The reverse primer contains a NheI site (GCTAGC), and a naturally occurringClaI site exists in the αX cDNA at nucleotide position 530. To graft the NIF-binding site in the αXI domain, five segments of αMI domain (I142PHDFRR, K200PITQLLG207, R208THTATGI, D248PLGY, and E253DVIP) were substituted sequentially for their counterparts (SSRNFAT, ASVHQLQG, FTYTATAI, DSLDY, and KDVIP, respectively) in αXI domain using M13mp19 vector and the following primers: 5′-GATGGCTCAGGCAGCATTATCCCCCTGACTTTCGCAGAATGATGAACTTCGTG-3′, 5′-CCCCTCAGCCTGTTGAAGCCTATCACACAGCTGCAAGGGTTT-3′, 5′-CCTATCACACAGCTGCTGGGACGCACACACACGGCCACCGCCATC-3′, and 5′-AAGAAAGAAGGCGACCCACTTGGCTACGAAGATGTCATCCCCATG-3′. The modified αXI domain was sequenced, confirming not only the intended switches but also the correctness of the entire I domain. The new chimera containing the grafted I domain, αM(I′/αX)β2, was created by transferring the modified αXI-domain back into the chimeric integrin αM(I/αX)β2employing the ClaI and NheI sites identified above. The expression vectors containing wild-type and mutated αM (pCIS2M-αM) and β2(pCIS2M-β2) were purified using CsCl gradients and transfected, together with pRSVneo (neomycin-resistant gene), into 293 cells according to our established procedures (19Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10828-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). G418 (600 μg/ml)-resistant colonies were pooled and αMβ2-expressing cells were sorted by FACS (FACStar, Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA), using αM-specific mAb, OKM1, which recognizes an epitope outside of the I domain (20Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbı́ A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Approximately 106 cells in HBSS containing 1 mm Mg2+ were incubated with 5 μg of mAb for 30 min at 4 °C. A subtype-matched mouse IgG served as a control. After 3 washes with PBS (10 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), cells were mixed with fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) F(ab′)2 fragment (1:20 dilution) (Zymed Laboratory, San Francisco, CA), kept at 4 °C for another 30 min, washed with PBS, and then resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. The FACS analysis was performed using FACScan, counting 10,000 events. For dual color FACS analysis, the cells (106) were stained with OKM1 (5 μg) and biotinylated NIF (0.5 μg) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by three washes with PBS. These cells were then mixed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin conjugate and phycoerythrin goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) F(ab′)2 fragment (1:20 dilution) (Zymed Laboratory), kept at 4 °C for another 30 min, washed with PBS, and then resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. FACS analyses was performed as described above. The same procedure was used for mAb 24 staining, except that 1 mm Mn2+ was substituted for the 1 mm Mg2+ and incubations were at 37 °C. The procedures used for NIF binding, and surface labeling and immunoprecipitation of cells have been described (11Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, different concentration of NIF (0–20 μg) were incubated with 2 × 106αMβ2-expressing cells at 4 °C for 30 min. The bound NIF was separated from the free NIF by centrifugation through a 20% sucrose solution and counted with a γ-counter. The NIF titration data were fitted to a single site binding model using the equation: [NIF]bound =B max*[NIF]/(K d + [NIF]), where B max is the maximal NIF binding andK d is the dissociation constant, using a program in SigmaPlot (Jandel Co., San Rafael, CA). When introduced into human kidney 293 cells in the absence of transfected β2, the αM subunit was expressed on the cell surface, albeit at low levels relative to the heterodimer. Immunoprecipitation of surface-labeled cells with OKM1 yielded a band of 165 kDa on polyacrylamide gels in SDS under both reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig.1 A). No bands in the vicinity of 95 (β2) or 120 (β1) kDa were observed, suggesting that the surface-expressed αM is not complexed with its natural partner, β2, or with other typical integrin β subunits. No bands were observed for mock transfection with either OKM1 or TS1/18 (Fig. 1 B), verifying the specificity of the immunoprecipitation. The presence of αM was confirmed by FACS analysis. The transfected cells were positive with OKM1, LM2/1, 2LPM19c, 44a, and 904, mAbs to the α subunit, whereas mAbs to the β2 subunit, TS1/18, IB4, or MHM23 were unreactive. Bilsland et al. (21Bilsland C.A. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4582-4589PubMed Google Scholar) also detected surface expression of the αM subunit in the absence of β2 in COS cells. The ability of the αMsubunit to interact with soluble 125I-NIF was assessed. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the αM-expressing cells bound NIF in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion. The specificity of this binding was verified by addition of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled NIF or 1 mm EDTA: in both cases,125I-NIF binding was reduced by more than 99%. Scatchard plots of the NIF binding isotherms were consistent with a single class of binding sites with respect to affinity and yielded a dissociation constant (K d ) of 2.1 nm. This value is very similar to the K d of 7 nm for NIF binding to heterodimeric αMβ2. To determine the nature of the molecule on the cell surface that binds NIF, lysate of surface-labeled αM-transfected cells were incubated with biotinylated NIF. The NIF-receptor complex was captured with avidin-agarose resin and analyzed on 7% SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.1 B, only one band of 165 kDa was present. In contrast, two bands (165 and 95 kDa) were observed for the αMβ2-expressing cells. The specificity of this assay was demonstrated by the absence of any band for the mock transfectant. These data indicate that, unlike other αMβ2 ligands (C3bi and adhesion (11Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)), all major contributing elements of the binding site for NIF reside in the α subunit of αMβ2. Consistent with this conclusion, we also found that: 1) mutations in the β2subunit, which abrogated binding of other ligands, did not affect NIF binding of αMβ2 complex (11Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); and 2) replacement of the αM with the αXI domain in the context of the αMβ2 heterodimer completely abrogated NIF binding (see below, Fig. 5).Figure 5The chimeric αM(I′/αX)/β2 receptor, created by grafting of the identified NIF-binding site into αXI domain, acquires the ability to interact with NIF with high affinity. Cells (2 × 106) expressing the chimeric receptor, αM(I/αX)/β2, containing the wild-type αXI (○) or the five segments implicated in NIF binding (•) were incubated with different concentrations of125I-NIF in HBSS containing 2.5 mmCa2+ for 30 min at 22 °C. Bound and free ligands were separated by centrifugation through 20% sucrose, and the cell associated radioactivity was measured. The data are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rieu et al. (10Rieu P. Ueda T. Haruta I. Sharma C.P. Arnaout M.A. J.

Ueda T. Haruta I. Sharma C.P. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2081-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To test the role of this sequence in NIF binding, we created two switch mutants in which the amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions of this peptide were changed individually to the corresponding sequences in αL(αLβ2 does not bind NIF (8Moyle M.

Thus, the first mutant, αM(K231NAF), changed the amino-terminal non-conserved KNAF to PDAT, and the second mutant, αM(K245FG), changed to non-conserved KFG to ATD. The hydrophobic cluster in the center of the peptide sequence is well conserved and was not altered. The mutant αM vectors were transfected together with β2 into 293 cells. Both mutants were expressed well on the cell surface as judged by FACS analysis, and surface labeling and immunoprecipitation with OKM1 (data not shown). When stained with LM2/1 mAb, the mean fluorescence for the αM(K231NAF)β2 mutant was 392.0, compared with 398.4 for wild-type. A similar result was obtained for the αM(K245FG)β2 mutant. When stained with OKM1, the mean fluorescence was 377.2 for the mutant and 380.1 for the wild-type. Both mutants also bound NIF with high affinity (Fig. 2, and Table II), indicating that this peptide is not centrally involved in NIF binding when placed in the context of the intact receptor.Table IIK d values for binding of NIF to the wild-type and mutant αMβ2 receptorsMutantSegment switchedK dnmS.D.1WT7.01.62P147-R152PHDFRR232.463.33M153-T159MKEFVST11.50.54E162-L170EQLKKSKTL5.02.75E178-T185EEFRIHFT28.911.06Q190-S197QNNPNPRS14.38.07P201-G207PITQLLG2153.47238R208-K217RTHTATGIRK1451.13789K231-NAFKNAF11.80.910K245FGKFG5.41.311ΔD248-Y252DPLGY89.52.412E253-R261EDVIPEADR55.98.513ΔE262GEG21.02.714D273-K279DAFRSEK15.35.415R281-I287RQELNTI22.55.116F297-T307FQVNNFEALKT12.24.617Q309-E314QNQLRE14.34.918αM2.10.5 Open table in a new tab To systematically define the NIF-binding site in αM, a homolog-scanning mutagenesis (18Cunningham B.C.

Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.

To apply this approach to the I domain of αM (∼200 amino acids), 16 segments were switched. The primers used are listed in Table I. The efficiency of mutagenesis was typically 60%, with the 7-amino acid segment switches having substantially higher efficiency (>90%) than the longer 10-amino acid segment switches (∼30%). The appropriate DNA sequence of the entire I domain (from Ile139 to Ala332) was confirmed for each mutant before transferring back into the αM subunit cDNA.Table IMutagenic primers used in the homolog-scanning mutagenesis of the αMI domainMutant namePositionFromToMutagenic primer (from 5′ to 3′)1P147-R152147 –152PHDFRRIEDFEL GACAAACTCCTTCATGAGCTCAAAGTCCTCGATGATGATGCTACCAGA2M153-T159153 –159MKEFVSTILDFMKD TAATTGCTCCATCACGTCTTTCATGAAGTCCAGGATCCGCCGAAAGTCATG3E162-L170162 –170EQLKKSKTLKKLSNTSYQ CTGCATCAAAGAGAACTGGTAGCTGGTGTTGCTTAATTTCTTCATCACAGTTGAGAC4E178-T185178 –185EEFRIHFTTSYKTEFD CTGGAACTCTTTGAAGTCGAACTCGGTTTTGTAGCTGGTAGAGTACTGCATCAA5Q190-S197190 –197QNNPNPRSVKWKDPDA TATTGGCTTCACCAGTGCGTCGGGGTCTTTCCATTTAACGAACTCTTTGAAGGT6P201-G207201 –207PITQLLGHVKHMLL GGCCGTGTGTGTCCGCAGAAGCATGTGTTTGACGTGTTTCACCAGTGATCTT7R208-K217208 –217RTHTATGIRKLTNTFGAINY CAGCTCTCGTACCACGTAGTTGATGGCCCCGAACGTGTTTGTCAGCCCAAGCAGCTGCGT8K231NAF231 –234KNAFPDAT ACTAGGATCTTAGTGGCATCAGGTCGGGCTCCGTT9K245FG245 –247KFGATD ATATCCCAAGGGATCGTCTGTGGCTTCTCCATCCGTGAT10ΔD248-Y252248 –252DPLGY AGGGATGACATCCTCGCCAAACTTTTCTCC11E253-R261253 –261EDVIPEADRSGNIDAAKD GCGAATGACTCCCTCGTCTTTTGCAGCATCGATGTTGCCGCTATATCCCAAGGGATC12ΔE262G262 –263EG GACGTAGCGAATGACTCTGTCTGCCTCAGG13D273-K279273 –279DAFRSEKKHFQTKE AGCTCTTGGCGGGATTCCTTAGTCTGAAAGTGCTTGCCCACCCCAATGACG14R281-I287281 –287RQELNTIQETLHKF AGGCGGCTTGGATGCGAATTTGTGAAGTGTTTCCTGGGATTTCTCACTGCG15F297-T307297 –307FQVNNFEALKTKILDTFEKLKDAAGCTGGTTCTGAATGTCCTTGAGTTTTTCGAATGTATCCAGGATTTTCACGTGATCACGAGG16Q309-E314309 –314QNQLREFTELQK GATCGCAAAGATCTTCTTCTGCAGCTCGGTAAAAATGGTCTTCAGAGC Open table in a new tab The functional consequences of these segment switches were initially investigated by transient expression in 293 cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection of αM, together with β2subunit, the cells were detached from tissue culture dish and double stained with OKM1 and biotinylated NIF. A representative dual-color FACS analysis is shown in Fig. 3. With wild-type αMβ2 transfectant, 1.83% of the cells were positive with both OKM1 and NIF, whereas less than 0.02% of mock transfected cells were positive. Two distinct patterns were observed for the mutants. One, represented by αM(E178-T185) in Fig. 3, in which a similar percentage (1.12%) of the cells were positive for both markers, i.e. exhibiting a pattern similar to the wild-type αMβ2 cells. The second pattern is represent by αM(ΔD248-Y252), in which a substantial percentage of cells were positive with OKM1 (22.5%) but negative with NIF (<0.05%), indicating a loss in NIF-binding function. The following mutants belonged to the first category: αM(M153-T159), αM(E162-L170), αM(E178-T185), αM(Q190-S197), αM(K231NAF), αM(K245FG), αM(ΔE262G), αM(D273-K279), αM(R281-I287), αM(F297-T307), and αM(Q309-E314). Belonging to the second category were: αM(P147-R152), αM(P201-G207), αM(R208-K217), αM(ΔD248-Y252), and αM(E253-R261). To quantitate the binding affinities of each mutant receptor for NIF, stable cell lines were established. All 16 αMβ2 mutants were cell surface expressed as heterodimers: immunoprecipitations of125I-surface-labeled cells with OKM1 yielded α subunits of 165 kDa and β subunits of 95 kDa on 7% SDS-PAGE (a representative gel is shown in Fig. 4 A), similar to the patterns obtained with that of recombinant wild-type and naturally-occurring αMβ2 (11Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Identical patterns were obtained when the immunoprecipitations were performed with TS1/18, a mAb to the β2 subunit (data not shown). The specificity of this assay was verified by the absence of any band when 125I-surface-labeled mock transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with either OKM1 or TS1/18 (Fig. 1 B), or when wild-type αMβ2-expressing cells were immunoprecipitated with IV.3, an irrelevant mAb (11Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). NIF binding was measured as a function of ligand concentrations, and representative binding isotherms are presented in Fig. 4 B. With all mutants, dose-dependent and saturable binding of125I-NIF was observed, which could be inhibited by unlabeled NIF and EDTA. The binding isotherms could be fitted to a one-site model as described under “Experimental Procedures.” TheK d values calculated from these binding data are summarized in Table II. The K d of 7 nm for wild-type αMβ2 was nearly identical to the K d of 5 nmreported for naturally-occurring αMβ2 on neutrophils (8Moyle M. Foster D.L. McGrath D.E. Brown S.M. Laroche Y. De Meutter J. Stanssens P. Bogowitz C.A. Fried V.A. Ely J.A. Soule H.R. Vlasuk G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10008-10015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression levels, reflected by the maximal NIF binding, were similar for all mutants, differing by less than 4-fold. The following mutants had similar K d values (<4-fold different than wild-type αMβ2): αM(M153-T159), αM(E162-L170), αM(E178-T185), αM(Q190-S197), αM(K231NAF), αM(K245FG), αM(ΔE262G), αM(D273-K279), αM(R281-I287), αM(F297-T307), and αM(Q309-E314). The most dramatic increases in K d values were found for five mutants: αM(P147-R152) (33-fold), αM(P201-G207) (305-fold), αM(R208-K217) (206-fold), αM(ΔD248-Y252) (13-fold), and αM(E253-R261) (8-fold). Given the similarities in the three-dimensional structures of αMI and αLI domains (15Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 22Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the defects in NIF binding of the five identified mutants arise from incorrect folding of their αMI domain. This assertion was supported by a series of additional experiments. First, FACS analyses were performed for all 16 mutants with a panel of mAbs against αMβ2, including OKM1, LM2/1, M1/70, TS1/18, and MHM23. The former three are αM-specific, and the latter two are β2-specific. In all cases, the mAbs reacted well with wild-type and all five mutant receptors.

Genetic analyses indicate that NK-4 resides downstream of the mesodermal determinant twist, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix-type transcription factor. However, the regulation ofNK-4 by twist remains poorly understood. Using expression assays in cultured cells and transgenic flies, we show that two distinct clusters of E-box regulatory sequences, present upstream of the NK-4 gene, mediate NK-4 expression in the visceral mesoderm. These elements are conserved between the Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis NK-4 genes and serve as binding sites for Twist (E1 cluster) and NK-4 (E2 cluster) proteins. In cultured cells, Twist and NK-4 binding results in activation of NK-4 gene expression. In transgenic animals, the E1 and E2 clusters are functionally connected, and both elements are required for NK-4 activation in cells of the visceral mesoderm and also for NK-4 repression in cells of the somatic musculature. These results demonstrate that NK-4 is a direct transcriptional target for Twist and its own gene product in visceral mesodermal cells, supporting the idea that twistand NK-4 function in the subdivision of the mesoderm duringDrosophila embryogenesis.

In Drosophila, the mesoderm develops from cells in the ventral-most part of the embryo at the cellular blastoderm stage (reviewed in Ref. 1Bate M. Bate M. Martinez-Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 1013-1090Google Scholar). After gastrulation, the mesoderm is further subdivided into three different mesodermal layers including the somatic mesoderm, visceral mesoderm, and progenitors of the heart. Although the mechanism of mesoderm partitioning into more specialized cells is unclear, it is generally believed that a cascade of transcriptional regulators and inductive signals from other germ layers are involved (2St Johnston D.

Recently, it was demonstrated that Twist also functions in the subdivision of the mesoderm, presumably selecting different targets in mesodermal derivatives depending on its concentration (27Baylies M.K. Bate M. Science. 1996; 272: 1481-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although it was suggested that Twist is required for the activation of those mesodermally expressed genes, little evidence of their direct activation by Twist in specialized mesodermal cells has been published to date. NK-4, also named msh-2 and tinman, is a mesodermal gene that belongs to the cluster of homeobox genes (lbe, lbl (nkch4), NK-4(msh-2, tinman), NK-3 (bagpipe),93Bal, and NK-1 (S59)) that are located in the 93D/E region of Drosophila chromosome III (28Kim Y.

As revealed by the analysis of the tinman mutant embryos, the gene is required for visceral mesodermal cell differentiation and development of the dorsal vessel that is functionally comparable to the mammalian heart (30Azpiazu N. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 31Bodmer R. Development. 1993; 118: 719-729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Gajewski and co-workers (35Gajewski K. Kim Y. Lee Y.M. Olson E.N. Schulz R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) showed thatNK-4 activates the D-mef2 transcription factor gene in cardial cells during heart morphogenesis. These studies demonstrated that D-mef2 resides directly downstream ofNK-4 in the genetic hierarchy controlling heart formation inDrosophila. NK-4-related genes have been identified in vertebrates, and their patterns of expression were shown to be confined to the developing heart and gut tissue (36Komuro I. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Furthermore, targeted disruption of the mouse Nkx-2.5 gene results in abnormal heart formation during embryogenesis, suggesting thatNkx-2.5 is essential for normal heart morphogenesis (43Lyons I. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Li R. Andrews J.E. Robb L. Harvey R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that the genetic pathways required for heart morphogenesis may be conserved among different species (44Scott M.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 45Bodmer R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 46Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). As an initial effort to understand the molecular mechanism by whichNK-4 functions in specifying the regional subdivision of mesoderm and heart development, we have investigated the transcriptional control of NK-4 in cultured cells and transgenic flies. We show that NK-4 is a direct target for Twist in visceral mesodermal cells. Moreover, we show that this regulation is mediated by two distinct clusters of E-box regulatory elements and involves autoregulation by the NK-4 protein. A Drosophila melanogaster genomic DNA library (cosmid library,CLONTECH) was screened with a 2.3-kbEcoRI-BamHI fragment corresponding to the NK-4 first exon and part of the first intron (clone 9 from Ref. 28Kim Y. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7716-7720Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) to isolate clones containing the 5′ upstream region of the NK-4 promoter. One of the cosmid clones obtained (CL 3; 23-kb insert) was used for subcloning and restriction mapping. For sequencing, two subclones (1.62-kb EcoRI insert and 2.3-kbEcoRI-BamHI insert) were serially deleted with ExoIII-S1 nuclease (Promega), and serial deletion mutant plasmids were used as template DNA for DNA sequencing with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). By aligning the overlapping sequences, the total 3.92-kb sequence was obtained. For cloning of the twistcDNA, we synthesized oligonucleotides (primer I, 5′ CTGGAATTCCACAAATTCTAACGTGAAGAAGG 3′ primer II, 5′ GGCTTAGACATCTTAGAATCATCT 3′) based on the published sequence (11Thisse B. Stoetzel C. Gorostiza-Thisse C. Perrin-Schmitt F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2175-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and used them for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C) withDrosophila embryonic (3–12 h) cDNA templates. Amplified DNA was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into the pBluescript KSII vector (Stratagene). Cloned cDNAs (pKS-Twist, 1.6-kb EcoRI insert from nucleotide 108 to 1823 without intron) were confirmed by sequencing and used for construction of the expression vectors. For the cloning of the DvNK-4 homeobox gene, an lEXlox Drosophila virilis genomic DNA library (Novagen) was screened with a 32P-labeled-NK-4 cDNA. A 0.97-kb EcoRItwist cDNA fragment (encoding amino acids 169–490) was excised from pGBT-TwiQ 3K. Chung and Y. Kim, unpublished results. and inserted into the EcoRI site of pGEX5X-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For the GST:NK4 fusion protein, plasmid pGAL4:NK4A2 4Y. M. Lee and Y. Kim, manuscript in preparation. was digested withEcoRI, and the 0.73-kb DNA fragment (encoding amino acids 188–416) was eluted from a gel and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX5X-1. Resulting plasmids (pGEX:TwiQ and pGEX:NK4-A2) were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (Novagen). Cells were grown at 37 °C (up to A 600 = 0.7), and expression of fusion proteins was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside treatment (final concentration, 0.2 mm). Fusion proteins were prepared according to the method of Ip et al. (47Ip Y.T. Park R.E. Kosman D. Bier E. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), with three cycles of freezing and thawing in the lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin) followed by affinity purification with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). Fusion proteins were eluted from the beads, dialyzed against 300 volumes of buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, and the protein was stored at −70 °C. For constructions of F-series reporter plasmids, DNA fragments (F23, −1186 to −887; F33, −1036 to −737; F43, −888 to −587; F53, −738 to −438; F3, −888 to −737) containing various 5′ upstream regions of NK-4 were amplified by PCR (30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C) with specific primers. For the constructions of the F23E1m and F33E2m, P1E1mE2m plasmid DNA (see below) was used for PCR as template. Primers (27-mer including restriction site) for the 5′ to 3′ direction have a HindIII site in addition to the corresponding sequence, and those for the 3′ to 5′ direction have aBamHI site at the end. Amplified DNA fragments were cut withHindIII and BamHI and subcloned into the pBLCAT2 (48Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). To construct the P-series reporters (P1, P3, and P5) containing the NK-4 promoter and upstream region, a common primer for the 3′ to 5′ direction containing the SalI restriction site at the end (primer 750 from −137 to −154, 5′ CTGGTCGACAACCGTTAGCGCAACCGT 3′) and specific primers containingHindIII sites at the end (primer 711 for P1, 5′ CTAAAGCTTGAATTCATTATAACTCTG 3′ primer 713 for P3, 5′ CTAAAGCTTATTATTAAAAATGTTGCT 3′ primer 715 for P5, 5′ CTAAAGCTTTCAAGTAGCGAAACAAAA 3′) were synthesized and used for PCR. Amplified DNA fragments were digested with HindIII andSalI and subcloned into the pCAT-basic vector (Promega) cut with HindIII and SalI. To construct E-series reporters (E1, E1m, E2, and E2m), oligonucleotides were synthesized, annealed, and subcloned into pBLCAT2. Correct clones were selected by DNA sequencing. Oligonucleotides used were as follows: for the E1 construct, primer E153 (5′ AGCTTTATGTACATATGCACTACATATGCAATTATATACATATGTGAACAG 3′) and primer E135 (5′ GATCCTGTTCACATATGTATATAATTGCATATGTAGTGCATATGTACATAA 3′); and for the E1m construct, primer E1m53 (5′ AGCTTGTAGATATCCACTAGATATCCAATAACCT-3′) and primer E1m35 (5′-CTAGAGGTTATTGGATATCTAGTGGATATCTACA-3′); and for the E2 construct, primer E253 (5′ GATCCTTAAAATCAAGTGTGCGAAAATCTGCACTTGAGCGCCACTTGACAACAG 3′) and primer E235 (5′ GATCCTGTTGTCAAGTGGCGCTCAAGTGCAGATTTTCGCACACTTGATTTTAAG 3′); and For the E2m construct, primer E2m53 (5′ GATCCTTAAAATGAAGTCTGCGAAAATCTGGACTTCAGCGCGACTTCACAACAG 3′) and primer E2 m35 (5′ GATCCTGTTGTGAAGTCGCGCTGAAGTCCAGATTTTCGCAGACTTCATTTTAAG 3′). For the construction of the twist expression vector pRC/CMV-Twist, pKS-Twist was digested with NotI andApaI, and the gel-eluted DNA fragment (1.6 kb) was subcloned into the pRC/CMV vector (Invitrogen). To construct the truncated form of the twist expression vector CMV-TwiH, twistcDNA (0.57-kb EcoRI DNA fragment; amino acids 324 −490) was obtained from pGBT-TwiH3 and subcloned into theEcoRI site of the NK-4N expression vector4 that contains 109 bp of 5′-untranslated region of NK-4 and the initiator codon. To construct the NK-4 expression vector pRC/CMV-NK4, specific primers were synthesized (primer 466, 5′ ACGGCGGCCGCCGAGATTCCAATTCAAGT 3′ primer 465, 5′ CTGGGGCCCTTAATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAGCCATGTGCTGCATCTGTTGC 3′) and used for PCR. Primer 465 has a coding sequence for the Flag peptide (IBI) so that the expressed NK-4 protein can be tagged with the Flag peptide. Amplified DNA fragments were digested with NotI andApaI, and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pRC/CMV. A PCR-based method was used to generate mutations within the E1 or E2 cluster for the construction of P1E1m, P1E2m, and P1E1mE2m (all of the three E-box sequences are mutated). For the P1E1m construct, two separate DNA fragments (223 bp, from −1336 to −1114; 986 bp, from −1122 to −137) were amplified by PCR with specific primers (primer 711; primer 921, 5′ TTGCTCGAGTAGTGCGTACGTACATACAGTACACA 3′ primer 923, 5′ CTACTCGAGCAATTATATACGTACGTGAACACGTTTTTGGT 3′ primer 724, 5′ TAGGGATCCAACCGTTAGCGCTTCCGT 3′). Amplified DNAs were digested withHindIII-XhoI andXhoI-BamHI, respectively, and ligated into the pBluescript vector cut with HindIII-BamHI. Subclones were sequenced, and selected plasmids containing the mutated E-box sequences within the E1 cluster were digested withHindIII-XbaI. DNA fragments were eluted from an agarose gel and subcloned into the HindIII-XbaI sites of the pCAT-basic vector. To construct P1E2m and P1E1mE2m reporters, the pKS-P4E2m plasmid containing mutations within the E2 cluster was constructed first. To construct the pKS-P4E2m, primers were synthesized (primer 925, 5′ GGTAAGCTTGCTTAGTACACTCTTAAAATGAAGGTCTGCGAAAATCTGGACTTCAGCGCGACTTCACAACCGTTTAATACACA 3′ primer 724, 5′ CAGGGATCCAACCGTTAGCGCAACCGT 3′) and used for PCR. Amplified DNA fragments were digested with HindIII andBamHI and subcloned into a pBluescript vector. Mutations within the E2 cluster were confirmed by DNA sequencing. From this construct fragment C (771 bp, from −907 to −137) containing mutations within the E2 cluster was amplified with specific primers (primer 927, 5′ CCACGATTTATTTATTTGTTAGCTTAGTACACTCTTAAAATG 3′ primer 750). Two additional DNA fragments (471 bp, from −1336 to −866) containing either the wild type (fragment A, from P1 template DNA) or the mutated E-box sequence (fragment B, from P1E1m DNA) within the E1 cluster were amplified from different template DNAs with specific primers (primer 711 and primer 928, 5′ CATTTTAAGAGTGTACTAAGCTAACAAATAAATAAATCGTGG 3′). Mixed DNA fragments (A and C for P1E2m; B and C for P1E1mE2m) were denatured and re-annealed. DNAs (41 nucleotide overlap) were gap-filled with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolab). Gap-filled DNAs were subjected to PCR (30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C) with primers 711 and 724 to generate full-length DNA fragments (1.2 kb, from −1336 to −137). Amplified DNAs were gel-eluted and subcloned into pBluescript vector. Mutated regions of subclones were sequenced again with specific primers. Selected clones were digested with HindIII and XbaI, and gel-eluted DNA fragments were subcloned into the pCAT-basic vector. Gel-shift assays were performed with partially purified fusion proteins (155 ng) and32P-labeled probes (5 × 104 cpm, 5–10 fmol) in binding buffer A containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)]. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 × Tris borate buffer. To prepare oligonucleotides probes, equimolar amount of oligonucleotides were annealed and end-labeled with T4 kinase or Klenow fragment. To make the F35 probe, DNA amplified by PCR with specific primers was subcloned into the HindIII-BamHI sites of the pBLCAT2 vector. From this construct the F35 DNA fragment (78 bp from −886 to −809) was gel-eluted, dephosphorylated, and end-labeled by T4 kinase. Footprinting assays were performed as described previously (49Hoey T. Warrior R. Manak J. Levine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4598-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The F23 (for Twist footprinting) or F33 (for NK-4 footprinting) plasmid DNA was digested with HindIII (in the case of minus-strand labeling, BamHI was used), and digested DNAs were dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase. Dephosphorylated DNAs were redigested with BamHI (in the case of minus-strand labeling,HindIII was used). DNA fragments were eluted from a gel, and the concentration of DNA was measured. End labeling was done by T4 kinase. Binding reactions were performed with fusion proteins and labeled DNA (12.5 fmol) in 20 μl of binding buffer A. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, CaCl2 (final 0.5 mm) and DNase I (0.05 unit) were added to the binding reactions for DNase I digestion. Reactions were stopped after 1 min incubation by adding stop buffer and were analyzed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. CV-1 cells were grown in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and Drosophila S2 cells were grown in M-3 medium (Quality Biologicals Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (2 × 105 per 60-mm dish) were transfected with plasmid DNAs (total 12 μg per dish; amount of DNA was adjusted with salmon sperm DNA) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Usually, 3 μg of reporter plasmid, 1 μg of expression vector, and 1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCMVβ CLONTECH) were used unless indicated. For cotransfections with two different expression vectors, the pRC/CMV empty vector was used to adjust the total amount of expression vector. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, washed, and finally solubilized in 60 μl of lysis buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)). Cells were lysed with three cycles of freezing and thawing, and cell extracts (supernatants) were collected after centrifugation and used for β-galactosidase activity and CAT assays. Twenty μl of the extracts were used to measure CAT activities with a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay KIT (Boehringer Mannheim) according to manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiencies were normalized with β-galactosidase activity. Standard procedures were used for P-element-mediated germ line transformation (50Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar). The y w 67c23 strain was used for embryo injections with P-elements P1LacZ (wild type), P1E1mLacZ (E1 mutation), P1E1E2mLacZ (E2 mutation), and P1E1mE2mLacZ (E1 and E2 mutations), respectively. P-elements were constructed by inserting corresponding NK-4 promoter and upstream regions (EcoRI andBamHI double-digested DNA fragments) from P1, P1E1m, P1E2m, and P1E1mE2m reporters that were used for transient expression assays in cultured cells into CaSpeR β-galactosidase vector. A minimum of four lines was established for each construct. For the characterization of reporter gene expressions in transgenic flies, embryos from each fly stock were collected, dechorionated, and fixed as described previously (51Patel N.H. Snow P.M. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1987; 48: 975-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and subjected to incubation with the anti-β-galactosidase primary antibody (Cappel; 1:5000 dilution). Signals (brown precipitate) were developed with peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) and diaminobenzidine. Because the potential hierarchical relationship betweentwist and NK-4 was suggested previously (19Bodmer R. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Development. 1990; 110: 661-669PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taylor M.V. Beatty K.E. Hunter H.K. Baylies M.K. Mech. Dev. 1995; 50: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the 5′ upstream region of the NK-4 promoter was sequenced and found to contain nucleotide motifs such as E-boxes. Using two subcloned plasmids (a 1.62-kb EcoRI insert and a 2.3-kbEcoRI-BamHI insert, respectively) which contain the 5′ upstream region, the first exon, and part of the first intron, serial deletion mutant plasmids were generated and used as template DNAs for DNA sequencing. A total of 3 kb of sequence from the upstream region was obtained by aligning the overlapping sequences. The portion of the upstream sequence that was determined is shown in Fig.1 A. We reasoned that this region might contain functionally important regulatory sequences for the expression of NK-4, since two deletion alleles within this region result in lethality (30Azpiazu N. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In the proximal region (from −337 to −137) to the initiator codon, we detected the basal promoter activity by an analysis of transient expression of reporter constructs inDrosophila S2 cells (data not shown). In addition to many putative regulatory sites, we found 11 E-box (CANNTG) sequences that are putative binding sites for the bHLH type transcription factors such as MyoD and Twist. Of interest are two clusters of E-box sequences (see Fig. 1 A; E1 cluster, 3 copies of ACATATG from −1134 to −1101; E2 cluster, 3 copies of CACTTGA from −868 to −831). If these two clusters of E-box sequences have a regulatory function inNK-4 expression, then they may be conserved in other species during evolution. To test this, we cloned the NK-4 homologue of D. virilis (DvNK-4). Interestingly, several clones contained both the NK-4 and NK-3 homeobox genes, suggesting that the D. virilis genome also has the same homeobox gene cluster as D. melanogaster (28Kim Y. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7716-7720Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of the DvNK-4 andDvNK-3 homeodomains are nearly identical to those ofD. melanogaster, and the gene structure is also similar.4 In addition, we found that the E-box clusters are also conserved in D. virilis (Fig. 1 B). Conservation of the E-box clusters during evolution suggests that these sequences may have an important regulatory function for NK-4expression. Various bHLH transcription factors can bind to the E-box sequence as homo- or heterodimers (52Murre C. McCow P.S. Vassin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 53Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). We observed that nuclear extracts from the Drosophila embryos contain DNA binding proteins for both E1 and E2 cluster DNA, indicating that regulatory proteins such as bHLH transcription factors might bind to these E-box clusters during embryogenesis (data not shown). If the homodimer of the Twist protein is functional in DNA binding, we should be able to detect binding activity of the Twist protein to the E-box sequence. As an initial step toward determining whether Twist activates NK-4directly, we first examined whether Twist could bind to the E-box clusters located in the 5′ upstream region of the NK-4promoter. The Twist protein used in the DNA binding studies was prepared by expressing twist cDNA in E. colias a GST:Twist fusion protein, wh"
https://openalex.org/W2039134432,"Binding of ligands to the maltose-binding protein (MBP) of Escherichia coli often causes a global conformational change involving the closure of its two lobes. We have introduced a cysteine residue onto each of these lobes by site-directed mutagenesis and modified these residues with spin labels. Using EPR spectroscopy, we examined the changes, caused by the ligand binding, in distance between the two spin labels, hence between the two lobes. The binding of both maltose and maltotetraose induced a considerable closure of the N- and C-terminal lobes of MBP. Little closure occurred upon the binding of maltotetraitol or β-cyclodextrin. Previous study by fluorescence and UV differential absorbance spectroscopy (Hall, J. A., Gehring, K., and Nikaido, H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 17605–17609) showed that maltose and a large portion of maltotetraose bound to MBP via one mode (R mode or “end-on” mode), which is physiologically active and leads to the subsequent transport of the ligands across the cytoplasmic membrane. In contrast, maltotetraitol and β-cyclodextrin bound to MBP via a different mode (B mode or “middle” mode), which is physiologically inactive. The present work suggests that the B mode is nonproductive because ligands binding in this manner prevent the closure of the two domains of MBP, and, as a result, the resulting ligand-MBP complex is incapable of interacting properly with the inner membrane-associated transporter complex.

Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and references therein). Various ligands bind tightly to MBP. However, the specific binding to MBP does not necessarily lead to the subsequent transport of the ligand via the inner membrane-associated transporter complex, which is composed of one copy of MalF, one copy of MalG, and two copies of MalK (2Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the preceding paper (1Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) we used fluorescence and UV differential absorbance spectroscopy to characterize the modes of binding of various ligands to MBP. Maltose bound exclusively via one mode that involved a red shift of the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum of MBP as well as other characteristic changes in UV absorption spectrum (R mode, for red shift). Maltodextrins were also shown to bind largely through the R mode when added in excess. In contrast, β-cyclodextrin as well as reduced or oxidized maltodextrins bound to MBP exclusively through another mode, which caused a blue shift of the fluorescence emission spectrum and other signature alterations in UV absorption spectrum (B mode, forblue shift). A mutant MBP, MalE254, bound even unmodified maltodextrins exclusively via the B mode. We found that whenever a ligand was bound to MBP via the R mode, it was transported. In contrast, when it bound to MBP purely through the B mode, it failed to be transported through a wild type transporter complex, even when the binding to MBP occurred with very high affinity. We have also argued (1Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that the R and B modes most likely correspond to the “end-on” and “middle” modes of binding, previously defined on the basis of NMR chemical shift of the 3H atom on the anomeric carbon of the ligand molecules (3Gehring K. Williams P.G. Pelton J.G. Morimoto H. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The binding of R mode ligands, such as maltose and maltotriose, was earlier shown to produce a large scale conformational change in MBP (4Zukin R.S. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2139-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) involving the closing of its two lobes (5Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10553-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In contrast, one of the B mode ligands, β-cyclodextrin, binds to MBP without causing the closing (6Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10553-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This correlation suggests that the R and B modes may produce closing and nonclosing of the two lobes of MBP, respectively. However, because fluorescence, UV absorption, and chemical shift of the anomeric 3H are all influenced mainly by the local environment surrounding the ligand, these results did not provide concrete data on the global conformation of MBP. In the present work we have used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to examine the global conformational changes of MBP, caused by the R and B modes of binding. EPR spectroscopy is a sensitive method for examining protein structure and dynamics and has become widely applicable due to the development of site-directed spin labeling (for reviews see Refs. 7Millhauser G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 448-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 8Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 566-573Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Spin labeling EPR has previously been used to estimate interspin separations in proteins (9Anthony-Cahill S.J. Benfield P.A. Fairman R. Wasserman Z.R. Brenner S.L. Stafford W.F. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1992; 55: 979-983Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10Beth A.H. Robinson B.H. Cobb C.E. Dalton L.R. Trommer W.E. Birktoft J.J. Park J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9717-9728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, this approach has been systematically extended to measure distances between two site-specifically placed spin labels and calibrated using well known α-helical peptides (11Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we have spin-labeled two residues of MBP, one in the N-terminal lobe and one in the C-terminal lobe, and examined the extent of closure of these lobes occurring upon the binding of various ligands. Our results indicated that those ligands that bind to MBP solely by the B mode caused little change in the global conformation of MBP upon binding. In contrast, those ligands that complex with MBP primarily via the R mode caused the two domains of MBP to come together considerably. Strain XL1-Blue MRF′ (Δ(mcrA)183 Δ(mcrCB-hsdSMR-mrr)173 endA1 supE44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA96 relA1 lac [F′ proAB lacI q ZΔM15 Tn10]) (Stratagene Cloning Systems) was used for all cloning steps, and plasmid pLWY (malE + bla) was utilized as the template for all mutagenesis reactions. This plasmid was constructed by ligating the EcoRI-NdeI fragment ofmalE + allele from the plasmid pPD1 (malE + bla) (12Duplay P. Bedouelle H. Fowler A. Zabin I. Saurin W. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10606-10613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the largeEcoRI-NdeI fragment of plasmid pUC19. The ligated DNA was transformed into strain XL1-Blue MRF′. DNA from these transformants was analyzed, and a plasmid that could be cut with bothHindIII and BglII was retained as pLWY. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using sequential PCR steps (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Morton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar). To produce the S211C mutation the mutant primer 5′-GATTACTGCATCGCAGAAGCT-3′ and an external primer immediately outside the BlpI site unique to pLWY, and the mutant primer 5′-TGCGATGCAGTAATCGGTGTC-3′ and an external primer immediately outside the BglII site unique to pLWY were used in the first PCR amplification. The resulting blunt-end fragments were isolated on a 0.8% agarose gel, purified using the GenecleanII kit (BIO 101), and used in the second PCR amplification. The two blunt-ended fragments were here amplified with the two aforementioned external primers to generate the full-length fragment containing the S211C mutation. This full-length product was then digested with both BlpI and BglII. The resultant fragment was isolated and purified as above and finally ligated intoBlpI- and BglII-digested pLWY to produce pJH1. This procedure was also used to produce the D41C mutation except that, in the first PCR amplification, the mutant primers 5′-CATCCGTGTAAACTGGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-CAGTTTACACGGATGCTCAAC-3′ were used with external primers immediately outside the unique BsiWI and PvuII sites, respectively. The full-length product was digested withBsiWI and PvuII, and the resultant fragment ligated into pLWY to produce plasmid pJH2. Both pJH1 and pJH2 were sequenced across their respective PCR-amplified regions using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) to ensure that no other mutations occurred. A plasmid that contains both the S211C and D41C mutations in themalE gene was constructed by ligating the small fragment derived from digestion of pJH2 with BglII andEcoRI with the large fragment derived from digestion of pJH1 with the same two restriction enzymes. After ligation, and subsequent transformation of strain XL1-Blue MRF′, plasmid DNA was isolated, and was digested with both BglII and EcoRI to ensure that they exhibited the correct restriction patterns. The plasmid DNA was further sequenced across both mutated regions. One plasmid, pJH3, was used for subsequent expression of D41C/S211C MBP. These were described in the preceding paper (1Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Wild type MBP and D41C, S211C, and D41C/S211C mutant MBPs were prepared from strain HS2019 (K-12 F− araD139 ΔlacU169 rpsL thi ΔmalE444) (14Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5455-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the appropriate plasmid and purified as described (1Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), except for the following changes. All mutant MBP proteins were eluted from cross-linked amylose column with 100 mm maltose, and bound maltose was removed from all MBP proteins by denaturation in 6m guanidine HCl followed by renaturation through dialysis. Purified MBP proteins were shown to be at least 95% pure by staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The binding of various ligands to wild type and mutant MBP proteins, unlabeled or labeled with spin label, was determined using fluorescence emission spectroscopy (1Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the determination of the mode of binding, ligand was added to MBP such that greater than 90% of all MBP present would be in the ligand-complexed form. The inner membrane transport complex (MalFGK2) was prepared from strain HN741 (K-12 argH his rplL1 malTc ΔmalB13 ΔuncBC ilv::Tn10/F′ lacI qTn5) (15Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) containing pMR11 (malK cat) and pFG23 (malF malG bla) (16Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4254-4260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown, and envelope fraction was prepared as described (15Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were reconstituted by using octyl β-d-glucoside extract of cell envelope fraction by dilution into a buffer (2Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the ability of MBP to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by the MalFGK2 complex, this dilution was made into a buffer containing MBP and ligand (15Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), which were added to give a final concentration of 0.15 and 500 μm, respectively, after dilution. Based on the K d values of wild type and mutant MBP, this ensures that >90% of all MBP inside the proteoliposomes is in the ligand-complexed form. The hydrolysis of ATP by the MalFGK2 transport complex was measured as described (15Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), except that all reactions were stopped after 5 min. All values were corrected by subtracting ATP hydrolysis by liposomes prepared without the MalFGK2 transport complex, MBP, and ligand. When the transport of maltose into proteoliposomes was examined, the dilution mixture contained 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.2, 5 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT. The proteoliposomes were resuspended to a final concentration of 0.45 mg/ml protein in 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.2, 3 mmMgCl2 with or without 1.0 μm MBP, and incubated with 10 μm [14C]maltose at room temperature for 5 min. The mixture was then diluted 1:10 with 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.2, 3 mmMgCl2, filtered through a Millipore filter (0.22-μm GSWP), and washed with 5 ml of 50 mm LiCl. Filters were then air-dried and counted in a liquid scintillation counter using Ecolume (ICN) as scintillant. MBPs were labeled with (1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidin-3-yl) methyl methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSSL), obtained from Renal (Budapest, Hungary). MBP (15 μm) was first incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 20 mm DTT, 10 mm KPO4, pH 8.0. DTT was then removed via extensive dialysis against 10 mmKPO4, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. Spin labeling of MBPs was accomplished by incubating 15 μm protein with 150 μm MTSSL (for D41C and S211C mutants) or 300 μm MTSSL (for D41C/S211C and wild type MBP proteins) for 2 h at room temperature in 10 mm KPO4, pH 8.0. Wild type MBP was “mock” spin-labeled to ensure that the spin labeling procedure had no significant effect on the activity of the MBP. After the MTSSL labeling, the solutions were dialyzed extensively against 10 mm KPO4, pH 8.0, to remove excess free MTSSL. After dialysis, MBP proteins were placed in 10 mm KPO4, pH 8.0, 15% glycerol, concentrated using Microcon 10 filter units (Amicon, Inc.), and used immediately for EPR experiments or substrate uptake assays. Final protein concentrations were calculated using the UV extinction coefficient of MBP of 1.7 (ε1 cm0.1%) at 280 nm (3Gehring K. Williams P.G. Pelton J.G. Morimoto H. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and were between 250 and 400 μm. EPR spectra were collected using a Bruker ESP 300 E spectrometer equipped with a loop-gap resonator (Medical Advances, Milwaukee, WI) and a low noise amplifier (Miteq, Hauppauge, NY). Room temperature spectra were collected using 1-milliwatt microwave power and a modulation amplitude of 1 gauss. Low temperature spectra were collected at 140 K using 8-milliwatt microwave power and a modulation amplitude of 2 gauss. Spin concentrations were determined by comparing doubly integrated spectra to that of a TEMPO standard solution. The labeling percentages were 90 ± 10% for both of the single mutants and 80 ± 10% for the double mutant. Electron spin-spin interactions between two spin labels lead to EPR spectral broadening in the case of interspin distances less than about 25 Å. However, quantitative analysis of data is difficult. Alternatively, use of motionally frozen, unoriented samples near liquid nitrogen temperature allows us to obtain interspin distances directly from spectral analysis (11Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This technique provides accurate estimates for interspin distances in the range of 8–25 Å, and its application to a model system (a series of spin-labeled α-helical peptides) has been described (11Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Our objective was to examine the global conformational change that MBP undergoes upon binding various ligands, through alteration of the distance between its N- and C-terminal domains. We constructed a MBP double mutant that had both Asp41 and Ser211 mutated to Cys. These two residues were chosen for the following reasons. The Asp41and Ser211 residues are located on the N- and C-terminal lobes of MBP, respectively, and both are in close proximity of the ligand binding site (Fig. 1). These residues are also on the surface of MBP and, therefore, are presumably more accessible to the labeling agent, MTSSL. The distance between these residues changes from 24 to 15 Å (measured between α-carbons) when MBP binds maltose (Fig. 1). Finally, neither of these two residues interact directly with maltose or β-cyclodextrin, as judged from the crystal structures of MBP complexed with these ligands (5Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10553-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The properties of MTSSL-modified D41C, S211C, and D41C/S211C mutant MBP proteins were examined to make certain that the site-directed mutations and the introduction of spin labels did not lead to functional alterations. Table I shows that neither the mock labeling of the wild type MBP nor MTSSL modification of mutant MBPs caused a large decrease of affinity when compared with the unmodified, wild type MBP. All MTSSL-modified MBPs were also capable of stimulating maltose transport into proteoliposomes containing the MalFGK2 maltose transport complex. Thus, unmodified wild type MBP, labeled D41C MBP, labeled S211C MBP, and labeled D41C/S211C MBP allowed the accumulation of 3.5, 4.8, 2.1, and 2.6 nmol of maltose in 5 min, under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Background accumulation by proteoliposomes in the absence of either ATP or MBP was around 0.1 nmol in 5 min.Table ILigand binding to wild-type and mutant MBP preparationsK dMaltoseMaltotetraoseMaltotetraitolβ-CyclodextrinμmWild type11.67.61D41C/S211C44205Wild type (MTSSL)1-aTreated with MTSSL.1ND1-bND, not determined.NDNDD41C (MTSSL)1NDNDNDS211C (MTSSL)1NDNDNDD41C/S211C (MTSSL)1ND15<10K d values were determined by the fluorescence quenching assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a Treated with MTSSL.1-b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab K d values were determined by the fluorescence quenching assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We also examined binding and transport activities of the mutant MBPs without MTSSL modification. The D41C/S211C double mutant MBP seemed to have slightly decreased affinity for all ligands tested (Table I). However, the mutant MBP bound these ligands in the same manner as did the wild type protein; maltose and maltotetraose bound via the R mode, while maltotetraitol and β-cyclodextrin bound by the B mode (data not shown). We also examined the ability of this mutant MBP, when bound to various ligands, to stimulate ATP hydrolysis and substrate transport activities of MalFGK2 transport complex. Maltose, when complexed with wild type or the double mutant MBP, stimulated ATP hydrolysis activity in reconstituted proteoliposomes to 14 and 4 nmol/mg of protein/5 min, and maltotetraose produced somewhat higher levels of stimulation with both types of binding proteins. Maltotetraitol, which binds to both of these MBPs by the B mode, did not stimulate ATP hydrolysis. The double mutant MBP was also able to produce maltose transport in proteoliposomes, although the transport rate was somewhat lower (1.8 nmol/mg of protein/5 min) in comparison with that obtained by the addition of the wild type MBP (4.2 nmol/mg of protein/5 min). Finally, strain HS2019 expressing either wild type or D41C/S211C MBP grew on both maltose and maltotetraose at approximately the same rate, but neither strain grew on maltotetraitol (data not shown). Fig. 2 (left column) shows the EPR spectra, normalized to spin concentration, for unliganded and various liganded forms of spin-labeled D41C/S211C double mutant MBP. The increased spin-spin interactions in maltose- or maltotetraose-liganded MBP are seen to have broadened EPR lines, resulting in a reduction in the amplitudes of the first derivative spectra in comparison with that of the unliganded MBP (Fig. 2,a and c). This spectral broadening is more clearly seen in the integrated spectra, which are shown in theright column of Fig. 2 (see a and c). In contrast, the addition of β-cyclodextrin produced little effect (Fig. 2 b), and maltotetraitol produced an almost identical spectra (Fig. 2 d). All of the spectra contained a fast motional component that was less than 5% of the total spin population and was most likely caused by nonspecific spin labeling of impurities in the MBP protein preparation. Ligand binding did not affect mobilities of the nitroxide side chains, since the addition of maltose, maltotetraose, β-cyclodextrin, or maltotetraitol produced no changes in the EPR spectra for either of the spin-labeled single mutant MBPs (not shown). Therefore, the spectral broadening that occurred upon the addition of maltose and maltotetraose to the spin-labeled double mutant MBP must be the result of an increase in spin-spin interactions. At room temperature, broadening due to spin-spin interactions is the result of a complex interplay of exchange interactions, dynamic and static magnetic dipolar interactions, and molecular tumbling and is difficult to analyze quantitatively, although several methods aimed at estimating interspin distances at ambient temperatures have been proposed (10Beth A.H.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 589-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19McHaourab H.S. Oh K.J. Fang C.J. Hubell W.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Analysis of the room temperature EPR spectra was also made difficult by the fact that labeling of the MBP was not quite quantitative. The spin-labeled double mutant MBP contained 1.6 ± 0.1 spin labels/protein, and the observed changes in the EPR spectra were due to changes in spin-spin interactions in the fraction (approximately 60%) that was labeled at both sites. Because of these complications, we did not attempt to analyze the room temperature spectra in a quantitative manner, but the data of Fig. 2nevertheless suggest the following: 1) binding of maltose and maltotetraose produces an identical EPR change consistent with a significant reduction in interspin distance; 2) binding of maltotetraitol and β-cyclodextrin produces EPR changes of a different type, consistent with little reduction in interspin distance. To determine quantitatively the change in distance between the nitroxides attached to two sites in the D41C/S211C mutant MBP, the EPR spectra at low temperature (140 K) were measured and analyzed using a Fourier deconvolution technique described previously (11Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Recording the spectra in frozen solutions eliminates effects resulting from molecular tumbling, and the dipolar interaction becomes the dominant source of spectral broadening, allowing a convenient determination of interspin distances in the range of 8–25 Å. Furthermore, the analysis does not require completely quantitative labeling, and it can be applied in the presence of monoradical impurities. Fig. 3 shows EPR spectra recorded at 140 K. Comparison of the spectrum of the spin-labeled double mutant MBP with the average of the spectra for the singly labeled MBPs revealed dipolar broadening that is increased upon the addition of maltose (Fig. 3 a). The effects of the various ligands upon the EPR spectra follow the same pattern as observed in the room temperature spectra; maltose and maltotetraose produced the same effect (Fig. 3 b), and the addition of either maltotetraitol or β-cyclodextrin yielded little or no additional broadening. Fourier deconvolution analysis (11Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) showed that the interspin distance changed from 16.5 ± 1 Å in the unliganded form to 10.5 ± 1 Å in the maltose-MBP complex, a substantial decrease. The spectra in Fig. 3 all have a significant monoradical component, but in the Fourier analysis this fraction is accounted for, since it results in a constanty axis offset in the ratio of the concentrations of interacting species to that of noninteracting species att = 0 in the Fourier space (Fig. 4). The monoradical fraction was determined to be 40% by the Fourier analysis, in good agreement with the spin labeling ratio determined by comparing the spin count at room temperature to the protein concentration from UV measurements. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra of MBP suggested the possibility that the conformation of MBP is altered in different ways by different ligands (1Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Szmelcman S. Schwartz M. Silhavy T.J. Boos W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This possibility is supported also by UV differential absorbance spectroscopic studies (1Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Gehring K. Bao K. Nikaido H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It has thus become clear that maltose and excess linear maltodextrins bind in a way that produce a significant red shift of fluorescence emission spectra and other signature changes in UV absorbance spectra (R mode), whereas reduced, oxidized, or cyclic maltodextrins bind exclusively in a way that produces large blue shifts in fluorescence emission spectra (B mode) (1Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Previous 3H NMR study, using maltose and maltodextrins3H-labeled on the anomeric carbon of the reducing glucose moiety (3Gehring K. Williams P.G. Pelton J.G. Morimoto H. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), showed the existence of two ligand binding modes, “end-on” and “middle,” and we have indicated already the reasons why these two modes are likely to correspond to the R and B modes, respectively (1Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus the end-on mode, which involves a tight interaction of the anomeric hydrogen with the binding site (3Gehring K. Williams P.G. Pelton J.G. Morimoto H. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), is utilized only by ligands with the reducing glucose moiety. In contrast, ligands without reducing glucose residue, and therefore without anomeric hydrogen, such as reduced, oxidized, or cyclic maltodextrins, must use an alternative, middle (or B) binding mode. These spectroscopic studies clearly showed that ligands can complex with MBP in different ways, but they could not provide any information on the global conformation of MBP. On the other hand, x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that maltose binding causes the N- and C-terminal domains of MBP to come closer together (5Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). β-Cyclodextrin, in contrast, does not cause this conformational change (6Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10553-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As described in the preceding paper (1Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we can hypothesize that R and B modes of binding may generate global conformational alterations of the type seen with the binding of maltose and β-cyclodextrin, respectively, a hypothesis substantiated by the present study using EPR spectroscopy. We measured the distance between the two lobes of MBP. Using a doubly MTSSL-modified D41C/S211C MBP, which was spin-labeled in both the N- and C-terminal domains, we have found that only those ligands that complexed via the physiologically active R mode caused a marked broadening in the EPR spectra (Figs. 2 and 3). This broadening effect is most likely due to stronger spin-spin interactions between the two spin labels and indicates that the two spin labels come closer to each other when MBP binds ligands by this mode. Low temperature EPR measured the change in distance to be from 16.5 to 10.5 Å. Although the crystal structures predict the distance to change from 24 to 15 Å, much of the difference between these two sets of figures is likely to be caused by the fact that the crystallographic distance was measured between α-carbons, whereas the EPR method measured the distance between paramagnetic centers of the spin label, which is located several angstroms away from the α-carbon. We note that in both sets of numbers the maltose-induced decrease was of a similar relative magnitude (36 and 38%). One could argue that the observed broadening and the speculated change in distance are due only to physical perturbation of the spin labels due to ligand binding. However, the fact that neither of the singly MTSSL-labeled MBPs (D41C and S211C) exhibited broadening upon maltose binding argues against this interpretation. It should also be emphasized that the doubly spin-labeled MBP exhibited binding and transport properties very similar to those of the wild type MBP (see Table I and “Results”). Ligands that bound solely via the physiologically inactive B mode (maltotetraitol and β-cyclodextrin) caused little additional broadening in the EPR spectra of the doubly labeled MBPs (Figs. 2 and3), a result suggesting that they did not cause the two spin labels and, therefore, the two domains of MBP to close together. In other words, maltotetraitol-bound MBP is in a global conformation similar to the β-cyclodextrin-bound MBP, whose structure has been defined by x-ray crystallography (6Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10553-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, maltotetraitol appeared to cause a very slight broadening in the EPR spectra in comparison with β-cyclodextrin (Fig. 3 c); it may therefore cause the two lobes of MBP to come together a little. This is consistent with the observation that maltotetraitol alters the fluorescence emission and UV differential spectra of MBP in a direction caused by β-cyclodextrin, but not as extensively (1Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these slight changes observed were due to the presence of small amounts of unmodified maltotetraose in the maltotetraitol preparation. This study has made it possible to explain why certain ligands, although they bind to MBP with high affinity, are incapable of being transported across the cytoplasmic membrane. Ligands that bind exclusively by the B or middle mode do not induce the closing of the two lobes of MBP. Possibly only the MBP in the closed conformation can induce, when interacting with the periplasmic surface of the MalFGK2 transporter complex, the signals that allow the MalK ATPase to become active and hydrolyze ATP (15Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This possibility is examined in the following paper (23Hall J.A. Ganesan A.K. Chen J. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17615-17622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The knowledge that the middle mode binding does not cause the closing of the lobes of MBP explains much of the difference observed by fluorescence and UV differential absorbance spectroscopy between various ligands. X-ray crystallographic studies (5Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Quiocho F.A.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) showed that several Trp and Tyr residues enter into stacking interactions with pyranose rings of the ligands. Both β-cyclodextrin and maltose interact almost identically with Trp340 and Tyr155 residues of MBP (6Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10553-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Szmelcman S. Hofnung M. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, Trp62and Trp230 interact very differently with ligands, depending on whether the closure of the two lobes takes place. It therefore seems likely that differences in fluorescence emission and UV absorption between the two binding modes are ultimately caused by the different degrees of quenching of these two Trp residues. Why does the middle mode binding result in MBP remaining in an “open” conformation? Decisive answers to this question obviously require crystallographic studies. However, a possible scenario can be proposed. In the β-cyclodextrin-MBP complex, three consecutive glucose residues of the ligand, labeled as g1, g2, and g3 in Fig. 1 of Ref. 5, interact tightly with the binding site of MBP. It is thus clear that there are at least three monosaccharide-binding sites, which we may call sites 1–3. Maltotetraitol, for example, may be expected to bind so that the three glucose residues of this ligand bind, respectively, to sites 1–3 to maximize the stabilization. This, however, will leave the linear, glucitol moiety unbound at the head, which may produce steric hindrance for the closing of the two lobes, just as the rest of the β-cyclodextrin molecule, including the g7 residue presumably at the position corresponding to glucitol in maltotetraitol, may act in preventing the closing of the lobes (6Sharff A.J.

https://openalex.org/W1979336226,"The Drosophila ribosomal protein S3 has been previously demonstrated to cleave DNA containing 8-oxoguanine residues and has also been found to contain an associated apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activity that cleaves phosphodiester bonds via a β, δ-elimination reaction. The activity of this protein on DNA substrates containing incised AP sites was examined. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of S3 was found to efficiently remove sugar-phosphate residues from DNA substrates containing 5′-incised AP sites as well as from DNA substrates containing 3′-incised sites. Removal of 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate as 4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate from a substrate containing 5′-incised AP sites occurred via a β-elimination reaction, as indicated by reaction of the released sugar-phosphate products with sodium thioglycolate. The reaction for the removal of 4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate from the substrate containing 3′-incised AP sites was dependent on the presence of the Mg2+ cation. These findings suggest that the S3 ribosomal protein may function in several steps of the DNA base excision repair pathway in eukaryotes and may represent an important DNA repair function for the repair of oxidative and ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage.

These findings suggest that the S3 ribosomal protein may function in several steps of the DNA base excision repair pathway in eukaryotes and may represent an important DNA repair function for the repair of oxidative and ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. Cellular DNA is constantly exposed to both exogenous and endogenous agents that can produce oxidative base damage (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4342) Google Scholar). To remove this damage and restore the integrity of the DNA, specific DNA repair pathways have evolved (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4342) Google Scholar, 2Freidberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). The major pathway for the removal of oxidative base damage is the DNA base excision repair pathway, found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (3Wallace S.S. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this pathway, oxidized DNA bases are removed by specific DNA glycosylases, leaving apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; GST, glutathione S-transferase; dRpase, deoxyribophosphodiesterase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. sites in the DNA (1Lindahl T.

These AP sites are then acted on by either a lyase activity that cleaves the DNA via a β-elimination reaction leaving a 3′ unsaturated sugar-phosphate product (4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate) or an endonuclease that leaves a 5′ deoxyribose-phosphate product (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4342) Google Scholar, 4Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The sugar-phosphate products are removed by deoxyribophosphodiesterase (dRpase) activities that have been identified in bacteria (5Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A.

Removal of the sugar-phosphate products allows the subsequent restoration of nucleotides by DNA polymerases and the re-formation of intact phosphodiester bonds by DNA ligases. Several of the enzymes involved in DNA base excision repair have been found to be multifunctional proteins. For example, theEscherichia coli Fpg protein, the product of themutM gene, is a DNA glycosylase that removes 8-oxoguanine and formamidopyrimidines from DNA and also has an associated AP lyase activity as well as an activity that excises 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate at 5′-incised AP sites via a β-elimination reaction (7Graves R.J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 3916-3922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the Drosphila ribosomal protein S3 has been shown to have an enzymatic activity that cleaves DNA containing 8-oxoguanine residues and an associated AP lyase activity that cleaves phosphodiester bonds via a β, δ-elimination reaction (11Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This protein was able to rescue the H2O2 sensitivity of an E. coli mutM strain and completely abolish the mutator phenotype of mutM caused by 8-oxoguanine-mediated G→T transversions (11Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The similarity in DNA repair activities of the E. coli Fpg protein and the Drosophila S3 protein suggested the possibility that the S3 protein may contain an integral dRpase activity. We investigated the dRpase activities of a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein of S3 (GST-S3) on DNA substrates containing either 5′- or 3′-incised AP sites. The GST-S3 fusion protein, and not GST alone, was able to remove sugar-phosphate products from both types of substrates. An unsaturated sugar-phosphate product is released from the substrate containing 5′-incised AP sites by β-elimination. The removal oftrans-4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate from the substrate containing 3′-incised AP sites is via a hydrolytic reaction requiring Mg2+. These S3-associated dRpase activities suggest that this ribosomal protein may be active in several steps of the DNA base excision repair pathway. Bacteriophage M13mp18 single-stranded DNA and a M13 24-mer sequencing primer (−47) were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The large fragment (Klenow) of DNA polymerase I was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase was purchased from Epicentre Technologies, and endonuclease IV was prepared as described previously (12Ljungquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2808-2814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endonuclease III was a generous gift of Dr. Richard Cunningham (State University of New York, Albany, NY). Sodium thioglycolate and spermidine were obtained from Sigma. Drosophila ribosomal gene S3 was overexpressed as a GST fusion construct in a bacterial strain (mutM::mini-tet) (13Michaels M.L. Pham L.

The conditions for overexpression and purification of GST and GST-S3 were identical to those reported previously (11Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A M13 DNA substrate containing 33P-labeled AP sites was prepared essentially as described previously (7Graves R.J.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3616-3622Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and incorporated into DNA in a reaction (100 μl) containing 1 μg of single-stranded M13mp18 DNA, 30 ng of 24-mer primer, 2.5 nmol of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.25 nmol of dTTP, 0.15 nmol of dUTP, 15 μCi of [α-33P]dUTP, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 3 units of large fragment (Klenow) of DNA polymerase I. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reaction was supplemented with an additional 2.5 nmol of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP and 3 units of large fragment (Klenow) of DNA polymerase I, and incubation was continued for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 μl of 0.5 m Na2EDTA, followed by incubation at 65 °C for 5 min. The DNA was purified from unincorporated nucleotides on a 1-ml Sephadex G-50 column, precipitated with ethanol, and then lyophilized. The [33P]dUMP-containing M13 DNA was treated with uracil-DNA glycosylase and subsequently treated with either endonuclease IV to create a substrate containing 5′-incised AP sites or with endonuclease III to create a substrate containing 3′-incised AP sites as described previously (5Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4699-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). DNA dRpase activity was assayed in a reaction measuring either the release of 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate from a M13mp18 DNA substrate containing 5′-incised AP sites or 4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate from a M13mp18 DNA substrate containing 3′-incised AP sites. A typical reaction (50 μl) contained 220 fmol of M13mp18 DNA substrate containing incised AP sites, 100 ng of GST-S3 enzyme, 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mmNa2EDTA. Some reactions were supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2. Release of sugar-phosphate products was determined either by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid in the presence of Norit charcoal or by anion exchange HPLC, as described previously (5Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4699-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Sandigursky M. Mendez F. Bases R.E. Matsumoto T. Franklin W.A. Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 623-629Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). M13mp18 double-stranded DNA substrate containing 5′-incised AP sites (220 fmol; 50,000 cpm) was incubated with either 100 ng of GST-S3 enzyme or 2 mmspermidine in the absence of enzyme in a 50-μl reaction containing 100 mm sodium thioglycolate, 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm Na2EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then injected onto a Brownlee MPLC AX cartridge column (4.6 mm × 3 cm), which was eluted with 6 ml of 25 mmKH2PO4, pH 4.5, followed by a 1-ml linear gradient to 250 mm KH2PO4, pH 4.5, followed by 15 ml of 250 mm KH2PO4, pH 4.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and the radioactivity contained in each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To examine dRpase activities associated with the Drosophila ribosomal protein S3, the protein was purified as a GST fusion product. The purity of this enzyme was >95%. To eliminate any possible contamination with the E. coli Fpg protein, the GST-S3 was isolated from anE. coli mutM strain (11Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Michaels M.L. Pham L. Cruz C. Miller J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3629-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To determine whether GST-S3 was capable of removing a 5′-terminal deoxyribose-phosphate product, the enzyme was incubated with a M13mp18 DNA substrate containing 5′-incised AP sites produced by treatment of a [33P]dUMP-containing substrate with uracil-DNA glycosylase and E. coli endonuclease IV. As shown in Fig.1 A, a dRpase activity acting on a 5′-incised AP site will release either 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate by a hydrolytic mechanism or trans-4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate by a β-elimination reaction. As seen in the time course in Fig.2, efficient release of sugar-phosphate was catalyzed by GST-S3. This reaction was not dependent on the addition of 5 mm MgCl2. Reaction of 0.2 pmol of substrate with 100 ng of purified GST did not result in the release of sugar-phosphate (data not shown). The apparent K m for the release of sugar-phosphate was determined by Lineweaver-Burk analysis, as shown in Fig. 3, and found to have a value of 0.07 μm; the value of V max is 0.015 pmol/min. The turnover number (k cat) was calculated to be 0.13/min using an enzyme preparation that was 36 h old. It has been previously demonstrated that GST-S3 loses activity rapidly upon storage (15-fold decrease within 72 h after purification) (11Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A.

The E. coli Fpg protein removes 5′-terminal deoxyribose phosphate groups by such a mechanism (7Graves R.J. Felzenswalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the release of sugar-phosphate occurred via β-elimination, GST-S3 was incubated with the M13 DNA substrate containing 5′-incised AP sites in the presence of sodium thioglycolate. It has been shown previously that this reagent will react with an unsaturated sugar-phosphate product, resulting in the formation of products with altered mobilities on anion exchange chromatography (7Graves R.J. Felzenswalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Price A. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8631-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When the M13 DNA substrate containing 5′-incised AP sites was incubated with sodium thioglycolate and the β-elimination catalyst spermidine (2 mm), the unsaturated sugar-phosphate product released by spermidine treatment formed products that reacted with sodium thioglycolate, as seen in Fig. 4 A. When the DNA substrate was incubated with sodium thioglycolate and GST-S3, the released products co-migrated with the products produced by spermidine treatment, as seen in Fig. 4 B. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of release of the 5′-terminal deoxyribose-phosphate by GST-S3 is via a β-elimination reaction. To determine whether GST-S3 was capable of removing a 3′-terminal sugar-phosphate product (trans-4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate) as shown in Fig.1 B, the enzyme was incubated with a M13mp18 DNA substrate containing 3′-incised AP sites produced by treatment of a [33P]dUMP-containing substrate with uracil-DNA glycosylase and E. coli endonuclease III, a known β-elimination catalyst (AP lyase). As seen in the time course in Fig.5, the producttrans-4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate was released from the substrate by GST-S3. Product identity was verified by anion exchange HPLC as shown in Fig. 6. This reaction was absolutely dependent on the addition of 5 mm MgCl2. Reaction of 0.2 pmol of substrate with 100 ng of purified GST alone did not result in the release of sugar-phosphate product (data not shown). The apparent K m for the release oftrans-4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate was determined by Lineweaver-Burk analysis, as shown in Fig. 7, and found to have a value of 0.075 μm; the value ofV max is 0.012 pmol/min. The turnover number (k cat) was calculated to be 0.08/min using an enzyme preparation that was 36 h old.Figure 6Enzymatic release oftrans-4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate from a M13mp18 double-stranded DNA substrate containing 3′-incised AP sites.

Similar to the Fpg protein (7Graves R.J. Felzenswalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not to other dRpase-like activities in E. coli (5Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4699-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Dianov G. Sedgwick B. Daly G. Olsson M. Lovett S. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), S3 is shown to remove incised 5′ AP sites by a β-elimination reaction. Interestingly, Fpg is the only other purified activity that also shares with S3 the ability of S3 to act on 8-oxoguanine residues in DNA that is subsequently followed in vitro by the formation of a β, δ-elimination product. Unlike Fpg, however, is the ability of S3 to also remove 3′-incised AP sites through a Mg2+- dependent hydrolytic mechanism. Whereas Fpg lacks this activity, 2M. Sandigursky and W. A. Franklin, unpublished observations. the removal of 3′ AP sites nevertheless has been observed for another dRpase that exists inE. coli (5Sandigursky M. Franklin W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4699-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that has a K m value (0.06 μm) for the release of this product very close to that determined for S3 (0.075 μm). The in vitroability of S3 to liberate an AP site existing at a 3′ terminus is also shared by 5′-acting AP endonucleases present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (17Warner H.R. Demple B.F. Deutsch W.A. Kane C.M. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4602-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Mosbaugh D.W. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11743-11752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That S3 is able to carry this reaction outin vivo as well as in vitro comes from studies examining the rescue of the methyl methane sulfonate sensitivity of a bacterial strain lacking the major 5′-acting AP endonucleases (RPC501), where Drosophila S3 was able to significantly protect RPC501 from cell killing (11Yacoub A.

As an explanation of this result, it was noted that once S3 catalyzed a β-elimination reaction at an AP site formed by methyl methane sulfonate damage to DNA, the ribosomal protein dissociated from the DNA and on a second encounter cleaved 5′ to the abasic site by δ-elimination, thus leaving a 3′ phosphoryl group that was hypothesized to be less deleterious to the cell than a 3′-modified deoxyribose produced by β-elimination. However, based on the results presented here, it is conceivable that in the presence of endogenous Mg2+, on the second encounter S3 completely released the existing 4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate, thus leaving a one-nucleotide gap and an efficient 3′ terminus for DNA polymerase I to fill. In eukaryotic organisms, recent results indicate that rat DNA polymerase β can catalyze the release of 5′-incised AP sites (9Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether the same is true for the Drosophila β polymerase, but if so, it would suggest that S3 would only act in a back-up role for the removal of 5′ deoxyribose-phosphate, or it is possible that S3 has a more important role in the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent abasic site repair using DNA polymerase δ (19Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We have been examining another Drosophila ribosomal protein, PO, that also contains DNase activity, but unlike S3, possesses only modest AP endonuclease activity. However, similar to S3 is the ability of PO to significantly reverse the sensitivity of E. coliRPC501 to MMS (20Yacoub A. Kelley M.R. Deutsch W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4298-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, both ribosomal proteins are capable of acting as DNA repair proteins in vivo although it remains to be seen whether, in fact, this is the case in Drosophila. It should be noted that both PO (20Yacoub A. Kelley M.R. Deutsch W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4298-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and S3 (21Wilson III, D.M. Deutsch W.A. Kelley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25359-25364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are associated with the nuclear matrix in Drosophila cells, therefore suggesting roles that are distinct from protein translation. In conclusion, it seems that Drosophila S3 has a broader substrate specificity toward the removal of an AP site than any eukaryotic protein thus far characterized. Additionally,Drosophila S3 is capable of acting on DNA containing formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua) and 8-oxoguanine residues. Taken together, the combination of these activities could result in a one-nucleotide gap by processing oxidatively damaged bases by a concerted N-glycosylase/AP lyase activity, followed by S3 dissociating from the substrate, and, in the presence of Mg2+, subsequently removing the remaining 4-hydroxy-2-pentenal-5-phosphate. The combination of these activities would suggest a more efficient means for preparing the DNA for gap filling, as opposed to recruiting a 5′-acting AP endonuclease to remove the blocked 3′ termini in preparation for polymerase β."

E., Liu, J., Shin, Y.-E., and Nikaido, H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 17610–17614), we showed that ligands that bind to theEscherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) without producing the closure of its two lobes are not transported into the cytoplasm. Here, we examine various combinations of ligands, MBPs, and membrane-associated transporters, by utilizing reconstituted proteoliposomes, right side-out membrane vesicles, and intact cells. Closed forms of wild type MBP, complexed with maltose or maltodextrins, interacted with wild type transporter complex to stimulate the hydrolysis of ATP by MalK ATPase located on the other side of the membrane, as shown earlier for the maltose-MBP complex (Davidson, A. L., Shuman, H. A., and Nikaido, H. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 2360–2364). In contrast, open forms of liganded MBPs, such as the complex containing wild type MBP and reduced, oxidized, or cyclic maltodextrins or the complex containing the mutant MBP MalE254 and unmodified maltodextrins, did not stimulate ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that the proper interaction between the ligand-MBP complex and the external surface of the transporter requires the former to be in the closed conformation. However, when a mutant transporter containing MalG511 was used, the already significant basal level of ATP hydrolysis was further stimulated not only by ligand MBPs in the closed form but also by those in the open form (except that containing β-cyclodextrin), data suggesting that the mutant transporter does not always require the closed MBP complex presumably because of its exceptionally strong affinity to MBP, described earlier (Dean, D. A., Hor, L.-I., Shuman, H. A., and Nikaido, H. (1992)Mol. Microbiol. 6, 2033–2040). Furthermore, this mutant transporter was able to transport reduced maltodextrin, and cells expressing the transporter were able to grow by using reduced maltodextrin, if the periplasmic concentrations of MBP were kept low so as not to inhibit the transport process. In the preceding two papers (Hall, J. A., Gehring, K., and Nikaido, H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 17605–17609; Hall, J. A., Thorgeirson, T. E., Liu, J., Shin, Y.-E., and Nikaido, H. (1997) J. Biol.

Maltose and maltodextrins are transported in Escherichia coli by an ATP-dependent process, which requires the interaction between soluble, liganded maltose-binding protein (MBP) 1The abbreviations used are: MBP, maltose-binding protein; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-galactoside. 1The abbreviations used are: MBP, maltose-binding protein; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-galactoside. and a membrane-associated transporter (MalFGK2) composed of one copy each of MalF and MalG channel proteins and two copies of MalK ATPase (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The participation of MBP is absolutely needed for this transport process, and one of the reasons may be that the liganded MBP, by binding to the external surface of the transporter, sends a transmembrane signal so that the MalK ATPase can become activated on the opposite, internal surface of the membrane (3Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The requirement for MBP, however, can be circumvented in “MBP-independent” transporter mutants, such as the one containing mutant MalG511 (MalFG511K2) (4Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 654-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which constitutively hydrolyze ATP even in the absence of the liganded MBP (3Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We have shown in the preceding papers (5Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Hall J.A. Thorgeirson T.E. Liu J. Shin Y.-E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17610-17614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that MBP can bind its ligands in two different ways. Maltose and linear maltodextrins bind to MBP in a way that produces a slight red shift of the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum of the protein (called R mode (forred shift)) (5Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Szmelcman S. Schwartz M. Silhavy T.J. Boos W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and a characteristic hypochromatic trend in the <265-nm region of UV absorbance spectrum (5Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Gehring K. Bao K. Nikaido H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). An earlier study showed that the binding of maltose and α-anomers of maltodextrins produced a large upfield shift of the NMR resonance of3H on the anomeric carbon of the reducing glucose residue (“end-on” mode) (9Gehring K. Williams P.G. Pelton J.G. Morimoto H. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the R and end-on modes appear to refer to the same manner of ligand binding. In contrast, when the MBP binds β-cyclodextrin, or reduced or oxidized derivatives of maltodextrins, the fluorescence emission spectrum is blue-shifted (B mode (forblue shift)), and the UV absorbance differential spectra show no hypochromatic trend in the <265-nm region (5Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Gehring K. Bao K. Nikaido H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Since β-cyclodextrin and the modified dextrins just mentioned do not contain a reducing sugar residue with its anomeric carbon, we hypothesize that this mode corresponds to the binding mode that does not involve the tight interaction of the hydrogen on the anomeric carbon with the binding site of MBP, i.e. the middle mode, earlier observed by 3H NMR for β-anomers of maltodextrins (9Gehring K. Williams P.G. Pelton J.G. Morimoto H. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a mutant MalE254 MBP, which allows the transport of maltose but not of maltodextrins (10Wandersman C. Schwartz M. Ferenci T. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), binds unaltered maltodextrins exclusively via the B mode (5Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By using representative ligands, we showed further that the two lobes of MBP become closed when the R mode binding occurs, whereas there is little or no closing of the lobes when the binding occurs through the B mode (6Hall J.A. Thorgeirson T.E. Liu J. Shin Y.-E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17610-17614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There are some hints that the B mode binding may not lead to the successful transport of ligands through the MalFGK2complex. For example, maltodextrin derivatives that are reduced, oxidized, or substituted at their reducing glucose units bind to wild type MBP exclusively via the B mode as described above, and are not transported by the wild type E. coli (11Ferenci T. Muir M. Lee K.-S. Maris D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mutant MalE254 MBP, which binds unmodified maltodextrins exclusively via the B mode (see above), does not allow the transport of these ligands (10Wandersman C. Schwartz M. Ferenci T. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The failure to be transported can result either because the B mode complex fails to stimulate the ATPase activity of the transporter or because the B mode complex cannot deliver the ligand into the transport channel. The present paper examines this question and shows that the stimulation of ATP hydrolytic functions of the wild type MalFGK2 transporter is not induced by B mode ligand-MBP complex. We also show that ligands bound via the B mode to MBP are transported nevertheless through the mutant MalFG511K2complex and that these mutant cells are indeed able to grow by using reduced maltodextrins as their carbon and energy source. These are shown in TableI. Strains HN889, HN892, HN924, and HN930 were constructed by transferring the F′ factor carrying thelacI q mutation and Tn5 (kanamycinr) from HN596 to HN933, NT411 containing pLH16, NT229 containing pLH16, and HN931, respectively, using standard mating technique (17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 82-85Google Scholar). High affinity lac repressor in these strains was necessary to decrease the level of transcription of malE alleles under control of the lacUV5 promoter (18Rasmussen B.A. MacGregor C.H. Ray P.H.

[14C]Maltose was purchased from either Amersham Corp. or ICN Biomedicals, Inc. [3H]Maltotetraose was prepared at the National Tritium Labeling Facility from maltotetraose by exchange with tritium gas in the presence of palladium on BaSO4 (9Gehring K. Williams P.G. Pelton J.G. Morimoto H. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The specific activity of [3H]maltotetraose was estimated by assuming complete recovery of the sugar from the labeling reaction as well as by NMR. [3H]Maltotetraitol was made by reducing [3H]maltotetraose with sodium borohydride as described (5Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Wild type MBP and malE254 MBP were prepared as described (5Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), except that malE254 MBP was exclusively from strain HS2019 containing pEH1. Bound maltose was removed from malE254 MBP by extensive dialysis as described by Silhavy et al. (19Silhavy T.J. Szmelcman S. Boos W. Schwartz M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fluorescence emission spectroscopy was used to show that both the mutant and wild type MBPs were free of maltose and active (5Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The transporter complex (MalFGK2 or MalFG511K2) was prepared from strain HN741 containing pMR11 and either pFG23 or pLH33. Cells were grown, induced, and harvested as described (3Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Total membrane fractions were prepared as described (2Davidson A.L Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were solubilized by keeping vesicles on ice for 30 min in 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.2, 20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.1% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (membrane protein:octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside ratio was about 3:1). This mixture was centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use. Membrane vesicles containing the MalG511 transporter that were destined for use in the proteoliposome substrate uptake assay were solubilized as above except that sonicated E. coli acetone/ether-washed total lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) were added to a final concentration of 8–9 mg/ml. This mixture was then processed as above, and the supernatant fraction was used immediately. The affinities were determined from the concentration dependence of the quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence (7Szmelcman S. Schwartz M. Silhavy T.J. Boos W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), measured on a Perkin-Elmer MPF-44B spectrofluorometer. The MBPs (0.2 μm) were dissolved in 10 mm KPO4, pH 7.0. Excitation was at 280 nm with a bandwidth of 7 nm, and emission was recorded at 348 and 346 nm for wild type and malE254 MBPs, respectively, with a bandwidth of 7 nm. Solubilized membrane proteins were reconstituted into liposomes via a detergent dilution method (13Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4254-4260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments 4.5 mg of sonicated E. coliacetone/ether-washed total lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) in 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.2, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol was mixed with 90 μg of solubilized proteins, and octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1.1%. This mixture (0.54 ml) was then incubated on ice for 30 min, diluted into 14 ml of 20 mmKPO4, pH 6.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to isolate the proteoliposomes. MBP was added prior to dilution to give a final concentration of 1.5 μm (for assays using wild type MBP) or 0.15 μm (for assays using malE254 MBP) after dilution. In these experiments, the weight ratio of E. coli phospholipids, MBP, and solubilized protein was 50:8:1 when wild type MBP was used and 50:1:1 when MalE254 MBP was used. Also, transport substrate was added prior to dilution to give a final concentration after dilution such that >90% of the MBP would be in the liganded form. ATP hydrolysis by the MalFGK2 transporter was measured as described (3Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were resuspended in 20 mmKPO4, pH 6.2, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 μm sugar substrate (if added when preparing proteoliposomes) to a final concentration of 0.45 μg of protein/ml and incubated with 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (50 mCi/mmol) at room temperature, and released Pi was determined at various time points. Strains HS3368 and NT411 were grown at 37 °C overnight in medium 63 containing 0.4% glycerol and l μg/ml thiamine. The culture was diluted 1:20 into 200 ml of the same medium and grown to a cell density of 2 × 109 cells. Membrane vesicles were prepared by a modification (20Dean D.A. Fikes J.D. Gehring K. Bassford P.J. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 503-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the Kaback procedure (21Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), except that vesicles were separated from unlysed spheroplasts and whole cells by two centrifugations at 2000 × g for 10 min and then collected by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 15 min. Vesicles were resuspended in 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.2, 3 mm MgCl2 to a final concentration of 1.5–2.0 mg of protein/ml, electron donors (10 mmascorbate, 100 μm phenazine methosulfate) were then added as indicated, and the preparation was used immediately. [14C]Maltose (150 μCi/μmol), [3H]maltotetraose (150 μCi/μmol), or [3H]maltotetraitol (120 μCi/μmol) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm, and 25-μl aliquots were removed at specified time points, diluted 1:10 with cold 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.2, 3 mmMgCl2, and passed through a 0.22-μm Millipore GSTF filter. Filters were then washed with 5 ml of cold 50 mmLiCl, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation using Ecolume (ICN) as scintillant. The accumulation of maltose and maltotetraose inside proteoliposomes was measured as described (13Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4254-4260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were prepared as above (see “ATP Hydrolysis in Proteoliposomes”) except that neither MBP nor substrate was added. Instead, ATP was added prior to dilution to give a final concentration of 5 mm after dilution. Proteoliposomes were resuspended to a final concentration of 0.45 μg of protein/ml in 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.2, 3 mmMgCl2 with or without 1 μm MBP and incubated with 10 μm [14C]maltose (150 μCi/μmol), 10 μm [3H]maltotetraose (150 μCi/μmol), or 10 μm [3H]maltotetraitol (120 μCi/μmol) at room temperature. At specified times, 25–40 μl of the reaction mixture was diluted 1:10 with 20 mmKPO4, pH 6.2, 3 mm MgCl2, filtered through a Millipore filter (0.22-μm GTSF), and washed with 5 ml of 50 mm LiCl. Filters were dried and counted as described above. Cells were grown in M63 medium containing 1 μg/ml thiamine, 0.4% glycerol, any necessary antibiotics, and 250 μm IPTG (if required), at 37 °C to a density between 2 × 108 and 5 × 108 cells/ml. Cells were then harvested and osmotically shocked as described above. The shock fluid containing periplasmic proteins was cleared of cells and cellular debris by passage through Whatman 1 filter paper. Proteins were then separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2Davidson A.L Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and either visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot analysis. The latter procedure was carried out by using an anti-MBP rabbit antiserum and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 505Google Scholar). The total amount of MBP loaded in each lane was quantified by comparison with serial dilutions of a pure MBP standard. Periplasmic MBP concentrations were then estimated, based on the total dry weight per cell of 2.7 × 10−12 g (23Neidhardt F.C. Umbarger H.E. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B.

Chem. 1977; 252: 7850-7861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strains to be used in all experiments were grown overnight at 37 °C in M63 medium (17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 82-85Google Scholar) containing 1 μg/ml thiamine, 0.4% glycerol, and any necessary antibiotics. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:20 into fresh medium of the same composition, except for the addition of 250 μm IPTG (if required), and grown at 37 °C to a density of approximately 5 × 108 cells/ml. Cells were washed twice with M63 and then resuspended in the same medium at a density of 2 × 109 cells/ml. The assay was initiated by the addition of labeled substrate ([14C]maltose (75–150 μCi/μmol), [3H]maltotetraose (200 μCi/μmol), or [3H]maltotetraitol (200 μCi/μmol)) to a final concentration of 10 μm. Portions of 50 μl each were removed, diluted 1:10 with cold M63, and filtered through a 0.45-μm HAWP Millipore filter. Filters were then washed with 5 ml of 50 mm LiCl, dried, and counted as described above. All values were corrected for background counts on filters. To assay the ability of strains to transport and metabolize various substrates, overnight cultures were diluted 1:200 into 2.0 ml of fresh M63 media containing 1 μg/μl thiamine, any necessary antibiotics, 250 μm IPTG (if required), and maltose, maltotetraose, or maltotetraitol at the indicated concentration. Cultures were grown at 37 °C with continuous shaking, and growth was scored at various times. Either the BCA protein assay (Pierce) or the method of Brown et al. (25Brown R.E. Jarvis K.L. Hyland K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) was used. The wild type complex, MalFGK2, required the presence of both maltose and MBP inside the vesicles to hydrolyze, rapidly, ATP added from the outside, as noted earlier (3Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) (data not shown). When MBP and various ligands were added inside proteoliposomes at concentrations that would make MBP more than 95% liganded, only those ligands that bound to MBP via the R mode stimulated ATP hydrolysis by the MalFGK2complex (Table II). Interestingly, maltotriose and maltotetraose both stimulated the transporter to a slightly higher degree than did maltose and maltohexaose. In contrast, ligands that bound to MBP exclusively via the B mode, such as reduced, oxidized, or cyclic maltodextrin derivatives, caused little stimulation (Table II). A marginal stimulation seen with maltotriitol and maltotetraitol could have been caused by traces of unmodified maltodextrins remaining in these preparations.Table IIBinding of ligands to wild-type MBP and the stimulation of ATP hydrolysisLigandBinding to MBPATP hydrolysisK dBinding modeBy MalFGK2By MalFG511K21 min10 min1 min10 minμmnmol/mg proteinNone3.84.64.613Maltose1.0R15409.434Maltitol50B3.23.37.931Maltotriose0.2R22531150Malotriitol75B4.34.2ND2-aND, not determined.NDMaltotetraose1.6R27601259Maltotetraitol7.6B4.8101448Maltohexaose2.8R14418.044Maltohexaitol2.9B4.36.66.727Maltohexaonic acid3.3B1.80.99.036β-Cyclodextrin1.0B2.21.93.29.82-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Transport by the wild type MalFGK2 transporter was examined in various systems. Fig. 1 A shows the accumulation of various substrates into proteoliposomes. In these experiments, ATP was trapped inside the proteoliposomes, and wild type MBP and substrate were added to the outside. Clearly, both maltose and maltotetraose (binding to MBP via the R mode) were transported quite well, but maltotetraitol (binding via the B mode) was not accumulated to a significant level. Similar results were obtained when right side-out membrane vesicles from HS3368 (containing the wild type transporter) were used; the addition of maltose, maltotetraose, and maltotetraitol (in addition to MBP) resulted in the uptake of 0.38, 0.18, and 0.02 nmol of substrate/mg of protein/min, respectively. Without MBP, the addition of these sugars produced a residual uptake value of 0.02–0.03 nmol/mg of protein/min. There were some differences between the membrane vesicles and proteoliposomes. First, the uptake rates of maltose and maltotetraose were much higher in proteoliposomes; this is most likely due to the partial purification of the transporter via selective solubilization. Second, maltotetraose was transported into proteoliposomes better than maltose, whereas in membrane vesicles the opposite was true. A possible explanation is that many of the inner membrane vesicles were surrounded by residual outer membranes, which could have hindered the access of maltotetraose. We also assayed substrate accumulation in whole cells of strain HS3368 (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, maltose was transported approximately 25 times more rapidly than maltotetraose. Maltodextrin transport in whole cells is most likely limited by diffusion through the LamB channel (26Luckey M. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 27Freundlieb S. Ehmann U. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 314-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Maltotetraitol accumulation was close to the base-line level. The malE254 allele was isolated by Wandersman et al. (10Wandersman C. Schwartz M. Ferenci T. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is a member of a class of “maltodextrin-negative” malE mutants, which are unable to utilize maltodextrins although their MBPs have good affinity for these substrates. The MalE254 MBP, unlike wild type MBP, binds both maltodextrins and their nonreducing derivatives exclusively by the B or open mode (5Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, it binds maltose (at high concentrations) by the R mode (5Hall J.A. Gehring K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17605-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The MalE254 MBP was trapped inside proteoliposomes containing the wild type MalFGK2 complex together with various ligands (at concentrations that would assure at least 90% saturation of MalE254 MBP), and ATP hydrolysis was measured. We found that this mutant MBP could stimulate ATP hydrolysis only with maltose (Fig. 2). The maltotetraose-MalE254 complex showed no stimulation of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2), in contrast to the strong stimulatory activity of maltotetraose-wild type MBP complex (TableII). ThemalG511 allele is a member of a class of mutantmalF and malG alleles that allow a cell to transport maltose in the a"
https://openalex.org/W2074080745,"Several genetic factors have been proven to contribute to the specification of the metencephalic-mesencephalic territory, a process that sets the developmental foundation for prospective morphogenesis of the cerebellum and mesencephalon. However, evidence stemming from genetic and developmental studies performed in man and various model organisms suggests the contribution of many additional factors in determining the fine subdivision and differentiation of these central nervous system regions. In man, the cerebellar ataxias/aplasias represent a large and heterogeneous family of genetic disorders. Here, we describe the identification by differential screening and the characterization of Mmot1, a new gene encoding a DNA-binding protein strikingly similar to the helix-loop-helix factor Ebf/Olf1. Throughout midgestation embryogenesis, Mmot1 is expressed at high levels in the metencephalon, mesencephalon, and sensory neurons of the nasal cavity. In vitro DNA binding data suggest some functional equivalence of Mmot1 and Ebf/Olf1, possibly accounting for the reported lack of olfactory or neural defects in Ebf-/- knockout mutants. The isolation of Mmot1 and of an additional homolog in the mouse genome defines a novel, phylogenetically conserved mammalian family of transcription factor genes of potential relevance in studies of neural development and its aberrations."

The inhibitory γ-subunit of PDE (Pγ), an unidentified membrane factor and a retinal specific member of the RGS family of proteins have been shown to accelerate GTP hydrolysis by transducin. We have expressed a human homologue of murine retinal specific RGS (hRGSr) in Escherichia coli and investigated its role in the regulation of transducin GTPase activity. As other RGS proteins, hRGSr interacted preferentially with a transitional conformation of the transducin α-subunit, Gtα GDPAlF 4 −, while its binding to GtαGTPγS or GtαGDP was weak. hRGSr and Pγ did not compete for the interaction with Gtα GDPAlF 4 − . Affinity of the Pγ-Gtα GDPAlF 4−interaction was modestly enhanced by addition of hRGSr, as measured by a fluorescence assay of Gtα GDPAlF 4−binding to Pγ labeled with 3-(bromoacetyl)-7-diethylaminocoumarin (PγBC). Binding of hRGSr to Gtα GDPAlF 4−complexed with PγBC resulted in a maximal ∼40% reduction of BC fluorescence allowing estimation of the hRGSr affinity for Gtα GDPAlF 4−(K d 35 nm). In a single turnover assay, hRGSr accelerated GTPase activity of transducin reconstituted with the urea-stripped rod outer segment (ROS) membranes by more than 10-fold to a rate of 0.23 s−1. Addition of Pγ to the reconstituted system reduced the GTPase level accelerated by hRGSr (k cat 0.085 s−1). The GTPase activity of transducin and the PDE inactivation rates in native ROS membranes in the presence of hRGSr were elevated 3-fold or more regardless of the membrane concentrations. In ROS suspensions containing 30 μm rhodopsin these rates exceeded 0.7 s−1. Our data suggest that effects of hRGSr on transducin's GTPase activity are attenuated by Pγ but independent of a putative membrane GTPase activating protein factor. The rate of transducin GTPase activity in the presence of hRGSr is sufficient to correlate it with in vivo turnoff kinetics of the visual cascade.

The GTP-bound α-subunit of transducin (GtαGTP) relieves the inhibition imposed by two inhibitory PDE γ-subunits (Pγ) on the enzyme catalytic αβ subunits (Pαβ). Activation of PDE leads to a closure of cGMP-gated channels in the photoreceptor plasma membranes (1Chabre M. Deterre P. Eur. J.

This inactivation is controlled by the intrinsic GTPase activity of transducin which hydrolyzes GTP to GDP.

A recent study has shown that a retinal specific member of the RGS family, RGSr, serves as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for transducin, providing an additional dimension to an already complex picture of the regulation of transducin GTPase activity (15Chen C.K.

Functional relationships between RGSr, the γ-subunit of PDE, and a putative membrane GAP factor are currently not understood. Here, we study the interaction between transducin and a human retinal specific RGS (hRGSr), and regulation of transducin GTPase activity by hRGSr. We examine the effects of Pγ and photoreceptor membrane concentration on modulation of the GTPase activity by hRGSr. GTP and GTPγS were products of Boehringer Mannheim.

A BLAST search at NCBI (Bethesda, MD) to compare the mouse mRGSr cDNA sequence against DNA sequence data bases revealed a human homologue, A28-RGS14p (the GenBank accession number U70426), which is 85% identical to mRGSr. DNA prepared from the amplified human retinal cDNA λgt10 library (kindly provided by J. Nathans, Johns Hopkins University) was used as a template for the polymerase chain reaction amplification with primers that were synthesized based on the A28-RGS14p sequence. The polymerase chain reaction was performed in 30 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 ng of the template DNA and 0.5 μm of the following primers: ATACTCTAGACATGTGCCGCACCCTGGC (5′) and ATGCCTCGAGACTCAGGTGTGTGAGG (3′). The polymerase chain reaction product (620 bp) was digested with XbaI andXhoI (the restriction sites are underlined) and subcloned into the pGEX-KG vector (21Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal.

The DNA sequence was verified by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility using the 3′-pGEX sequencing primer (Pharmacia) and the 5′-primer shown above. The subcloned sequence was different from A28-RGS14p at two nucleotide positions of the open reading frame (C125 → T and A160 → G), leading to substitutions of amino acid residues Ser42→ Phe and Asn54 → Asp. Typically, expression hostE. coli DH5α cells were grown on 2 × TY medium and induced at OD600 = 0.5 by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm final concentration). After a 4-h induction at 37 °C, cells were harvested and sonicated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol (buffer A). The supernatant (100,000 × g, 1 h) was loaded on a glutathione-agarose column. GST-hRGSr was eluted from the column using 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm glutathione. GST-hRGSr was then passed through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia) to separate glutathione and digested with thrombin (0.25 NIH units/mg) for 90 min at room temperature. hRGSr was reapplied on a glutathione-agarose column to remove GST. GtαGDP or GtαGTPγS (6 μm final concentration) were mixed with glutathione-agarose retaining ∼10 μg of hRGSr in 40 μl of 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 (buffer B). Where indicated, the buffer contained 30 μm AlCl3, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10–30 μm Pγ. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the agarose beads were spun down, washed with 1 ml of buffer B, and the bound proteins were eluted with a sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Typically, hRGSr was added to PγBC prior to addition of transducin. The assays were carried out at equilibrium which was reached in less than 3 s after mixing of the components except when GtαGDP and AlF4− were used. In the latter experiments the equilibrium due to GtαGDP activation by AlF4− was reached in less than 15 s. Fluorescence of PγBC was monitored with excitation at 445 nm and emission at 495 nm. Concentration of PγBC was determined using ε445 = 53,000. Single turnover GTPase activity measurements were carried out essentially as described in Ref. 22Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Bownds M.D. J.

The reaction was initiated by mixing bleached ROS membranes with 200 nm [γ-32P]GTP (∼5 × 104dpm/pmol) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was quenched by addition of 100 μl of 7% perchloric acid. Nucleotides were then precipitated using charcoal, and 32Pi formation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Concentrations of transducin in different preparations of ROS membranes were determined using the [35S]GTPγS binding assay. ROS membranes were incubated with 2 μm GTPγS (105 dpm/pmol) for 10 min at room temperature in 20 μl of buffer B, and the mixture was applied onto GF/B filters (Millipore). The filters were washed with 3 ml of 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl and 4 mm MgCl2 and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. To determine if hRGSr or Pγ may affect the nucleotide binding to Gtαβγ, 200 nm [35S]GTPγS was added to uROS membranes (5 μm rhodopsin) reconstituted with 0.4 μmGtαβγ and 1 μm hRGSr (and/or 1 μm Pγ) in 20 μl of buffer B. The mixture was immediately (<2 s) diluted into 3 ml of cold 40 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 2 μm GTPγS. The GTPγS binding was then measured as described above.

GST-hRGSr migrated on SDS gels with the expected mobility of a 52-kDa protein. Appearance of an additional doublet at ∼28–30 kDa, which most likely contains GST polypeptide, is typical for the GST fusion expression system (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

Green Publishing Associates and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). hRGSr, purified after cleavage of the fusion protein GST-hRGSr with thrombin, migrated as a 25-kDa protein (Fig. 1, lane 3). The yield of hRGSr was ∼6 mg/liter of culture. A number of RGS proteins (RGS1, RGS4, and mouse RGSr) have been shown to interact preferentially with a transitional GαGDPAlF4−conformation of Gα subunits (15Chen C.K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of GST-hRGSr bound to glutathione-agarose to co-precipitate Gtα in different conformations. Fig.2 A shows that GST-hRGSr precipitated stoichiometric amounts of GtαGDPAlF4−, while amounts of GtαGTPγS and GtαGDP that co-precipitated with GST-hRGSr were significantly lower. In control experiments, GtαGDPAlF4−, GtαGTPγS, and GtαGDP did not co-precipitate with glutathione-agarose that contained no bound GST-hRGSr (not shown). The results suggest that the affinity of hRGSr for the Gtα conformations decreases in the following order: GtαGDPAlF4−≫ GtαGTPγS > GtαGDP. To determine if Pγ can compete with hRGSr for the interaction with GtαGDPAlF4−, we initially tested effects of Pγ on GtαGDPAlF4−binding to GST-hRGSr. Even at high concentrations (up to 30 μm) Pγ did not affect binding of GtαGDPAlF4− to GST-hRGSr immobilized on glutathione-agarose (Fig. 2 B). We next investigated effects of hRGSr on the interaction between Pγ and GtαGDPAlF4− or GtαGTPγS using a fluorescence assay. Addition of GtαGDPAlF4− to a fluorescently labeled Pγ, PγBC, produced an approximately 7.5-fold maximal increase in the BC fluorescence (Fig.3 A), while GtαGTPγS enhanced the fluorescence of PγBC by more than 6-fold (not shown). TheK d values for the GtαGDPAlF4− and GtαGTPγS binding to PγBC were 2.8 ± 0.1 and 2.1 ± 0.1 nm, respectively. The affinity of GtαGDPAlF4−binding to PγBC was somewhat higher in the presence of 100 nm hRGSr (K d 1.2 ± 0.1 nm), suggesting that hRGSr and Pγ bind to GtαGDPAlF4−noncompetitively (Fig. 3 A). Addition of hRGSr had no effect on the fluorescence of PγBC alone (not shown), but resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the fluorescence enhancement of PγBC caused by the latter binding to GtαGDPAlF4− (Fig.3 B). The fluorescence was decreased maximally by ∼40% with an IC50 of ∼35 nm. Since hRGSr and Pγ interact with GtαGDPAlF4−noncompetitively, this IC50 value may serve as an estimate for the affinity of hRGSr interaction with GtαGDPAlF4−. In control experiments, hRGSr did not affect the fluorescence of the GtαGTPγS·PγBC complex (not shown). Single turnover measurements of GTPase activity were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under these conditions ([GTP] < [Gt]) the GTPase reaction can be analyzed using an exponential function: % GTP hydrolyzed = 100(1-e -kt ), where k is a rate constant for GTP hydrolysis. First, transducin GTPase activity was measured in the reconstituted system with uROS membranes. According to previous reports, uROS membranes lack the GAP activity of a membrane factor, and the Pγ subunit did not affect the GTPase activity of transducin when uROS membranes were used (14Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calculated rate of GTP hydrolysis by transducin (0.4 μm) reconstituted with uROS containing 5 μmrhodopsin was 0.022 ± 0.001 s−1 (Fig.4 A). Addition of 1 μm hRGSr resulted in acceleration of the GTPase activity by more than 10-fold (k = 0.23 ± 0.01 s−1). The basal GTPase activity of transducin was not significantly altered in the presence of 1 μm Pγ (k = 0.019 ± 0.003 s−1). However, Pγ substantially reduced the accelerated GTPase activity of the Gtα·hRGSr complex (k = 0.085 ± 0.005 s−1). In control experiments, hRGSr, Pγ, or the two proteins combined had no notable effect on the binding of [35S]GTPγS to transducin under similar conditions (not shown). The reaction was complete in less than 2 s. The basal GTPase activity of transducin in the suspension of untreated native ROS membranes containing 5 μm rhodopsin and 0.41 μm transducin was higher (k = 0.052 ± 0.002 s−1) than in the reconstituted system with uROS (Fig. 4 B). However, the elevation of transducin GTPase activity by hRGSr was only ∼3.3-fold (k = 0.17 ± 0.01 s−1). Perhaps, the presence of PDE containing the Pγ subunit in native ROS preparations prevented a larger enhancement of the GTPase activity by hRGSr as seen using uROS. To test this idea we have prepared hypotonically washed dROS membranes depleted of PDE. The GTPase activity in suspensions of dROS containing 5 μm rhodopsin and 0.38 μm transducin (k = 0.031 ± 0.001 s−1) was accelerated by ∼7.5-fold (k = 0.23 ± 0.02 s−1) with addition of hRGSr (Fig. 4 C). The Pγ subunit increased transducin's GTPase activity by more than 2-fold to a rate of 0.075 ± 0.003 s−1. Effects of hRGSr and Pγ on transducin were not additive. Moreover, the GTPase activity of transducin was lower in the presence of both hRGSr and Pγ (k = 0.18 ± 0.01 s−1) than in the presence of hRGSr alone. Interestingly, hRGSr enhanced the GTPase rates in suspensions of untreated ROS to levels similar to those in suspensions of dROS membranes reconstituted with Pγ. The GTPase activity of transducin has been shown to elevate with increasing concentrations of ROS membranes presumably due to the action of a putative membrane GAP factor (11Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 12Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol.

At low concentrations of ROS membranes the GtαGTP·Pγ complex dissociates from Pαβ and is mainly soluble (30Deterre P. Bigay J. Robert M. Pfister C. Kuhn H. Chabre M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Fung B.K-K. Griswold-Prenner I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3133-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Increasing the membrane concentration shifts the equilibrium toward the membrane bound complex (GtαGTP)2Pαβγ2 (32Clerc A. Bennet N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6620-6627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Catty P. Pfister C. Bruckert F. Deterre P. J. Biol.

Wensel T.G Biochemisry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) allowing the interaction of GtαGTP with a putative GAP factor. The calculated rate for the GTP hydrolysis in the suspension of native ROS membranes containing 30 μm rhodopsin was ∼3-fold higher (k = 0.16 ± 0.02 s−1) than that seen using 5 μm rhodopsin (Fig. 4 D). hRGSr was at least as effective at higher concentrations of ROS membranes as it was in diluted ROS suspensions. We estimate that the rate of GTP hydrolysis in ROS suspensions containing 30 μm rhodopsin in the presence of 1 μm hRGSr is >0.7 s−1. We measured PDE inactivation in suspensions of bleached native ROS membranes using the proton evolution assay (23Liebman P.A. Evanczuk A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The activation and inactivation of PDE was monitored after addition of GTP under single turnover conditions using a pH microelectrode. The PDE activity was maximal in less than 1 s after addition of GTP. Therefore, we were unable to resolve the activation phase. As shown earlier, the rate of PDE inactivation can be well approximated by fitting the inactivation phase with a single exponential decay function (14Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PDE activity in the assay is proportional to the concentration of active GtαGTP. The change of pH due to hydrolysis of cGMP under single GTP turnover conditions can be described using an exponential function: pH = ΔpHmax(1-e -kt ) or [cGMP]hydrolyzed = Δ[cGMP]max(1-e -kt ). The PDE activity represents a derivative of this function, and it decays with the inactivation constant k from the equation above. In diluted suspensions of native ROS (5 μm rhodopsin), PDE was inactivated with a rate of 0.096 s−1. In the presence of hRGSr, PDE inactivation was enhanced to a rate of 0.31 s−1 (Fig.5 A). The increase ink inact (>3-fold) correlated well with the decrease in maximal amounts of cGMP hydrolyzed in the presence of hRGSr (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, the acceleration of PDE inactivation caused by hRGSr was proportional to the elevation of transducin GTPase activity. We next tested effects of ROS membrane concentration on the modulation of PDE inactivation by hRGSr. The PDE inactivation rate (0.26 s−1) was significantly higher in suspensions of ROS membranes containing 30 μm rhodopsin than in diluted ROS suspensions (Fig. 5 B). However, this enhanced rate was not accompanied by an equivalent decrease in the maximal amount of hydrolyzed cGMP because the initial PDE activity after addition of GTP was higher. It has been shown previously that PDE activation by transducin is more efficient at higher concentrations of photoreceptor membranes (32Clerc A. Bennet N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6620-6627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Catty P. Pfister C. Bruckert F. Deterre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19489-19493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G Biochemisry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Addition of 1 μm hRGSr to ROS membranes containing 30 μm rhodopsin resulted in ∼3-fold increase in the PDE inactivation rate. The PDE inactivation rate was as high as 0.75 s−1 and correlated well with the GTPase rate (>0.7 s−1) measured under the same conditions. To determine if hGRSr can serve as an antagonist for PDE and block the enzyme activation, we have measured effects of hRGSr on GTPγS-induced PDE activity in suspensions of ROS membranes containing 5 μm rhodopsin. The rates of the GTPγS-induced cGMP hydrolysis were not significantly affected by hRGSr. In the presence of relatively high concentrations of hRGSr (5 μm) PDE activity was suppressed by only ∼15% (not shown). Recent findings have established that members of a new family of RGS proteins serve as GAPs for heterotrimeric G-proteins and attenuate G-protein-mediated signal transduction (28Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 35Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that RGS proteins accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gα subunits but do not affect GDP/GTP exchange induced by activated G-protein-coupled receptors (35Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Precise mechanisms of RGS GAP activity are not yet clear. It has been demonstrated that at least some RGS proteins (RGS1, RGS4, GAIP, and mRGSr) interact preferentially with the AlF4− bound conformation of Gα subunits and thus may accelerate GTP hydrolysis through stabilization of the transitional state of G-proteins (15Chen C.K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In several signaling systems the GTPase activity of G-proteins is enhanced by their effector enzymes (11Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 37Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Regulation of the visual G-protein appears to be even more complicated. The γ subunit of PDE in concert with an unidentified membrane factor accelerate GTPase activity of transducin (11Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 12Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol.

The mouse retinal specific RGS (mRGSr) protein has been recently identified and preliminarily characterized. mRGSr was shown to enhance GTPase activity under steady-state conditions (15Chen C.K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We have investigated the regulation of transducin GTPase activity by human RGSr and examined effects of Pγ and photoreceptor membrane concentration on the functional activity of hRGSr. Our results support the data that retinal RGS binds tightly to the transitional conformation of transducin, GtαGDPAlF4− (15Chen C.K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and extend this observation by showing that it also weakly interacts with GtαGTPγS and GtαGDP. Using a fluorescence assay of interaction between PγBC and GtαGDPAlF4−, we demonstrated that Pγ and hRGSr interact with GtαGDPAlF4−noncompetitively. Furthermore, the affinity of the Pγ/GtαGDPAlF4−interaction was modestly enhanced in the presence of hRGSr. This increase in affinity may reflect a stabilization of the GtαGDPAlF4−conformation which interacts with Pγ with high affinity. Binding of hRGSr to GtαGDPAlF4−affected the Gtα conformation resulting in a decrease of the maximal fluorescence enhancement caused by GtαGDPAlF4− binding to PγBC. We used this effect to estimate the affinity of the hRGSr/GtαGDPAlF4−interaction (∼35 nm). Interestingly, GtαGTPγS and GtαGDPAlF4− had similar high affinities for Pγ and significantly different affinities for hRGSr, supporting the conclusion that GtαGDPAlF4− has distinct interfaces for interaction with Pγ and hRGSr. Comparison of the crystal structures of GtαGTPγS and GtαGDPAlF4− shows limited conformational differences in the switch I and II regions of transducin (38Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This suggests that hRGSr interacts with the switch I and/or switch II regions of GtαGDPAlF4−. Indeed, a crystal structure of RGS4 bound to Giα1AlF4−, that has been published during the review of this paper, shows that the RGS4-binding site is formed by the three switch regions of Giα1 (39Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The switch III, α3/β5, and α4/β6 regions of transducin have been earlier implicated in Gtαinteraction with Pγ (5Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 40Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26900-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Pγ and hRGSr-binding sites on Gtα may possibly overlap, particularly, at the switch III region. Because the interactions between the switch III region and RGS protein are not extensive (39Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), such potential overlap would not cause a significant effect of hRGSr on apparent affinity of Pγ binding to Gtα. Binding of RGS proteins to the switch regions of G-proteins supports the idea that RGS proteins may serve as antagonists for some effectors (39Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). RGS4 has been shown to block activation of phospholipase Cβ by GqαGTPγS (44Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In our experiments, initial rates of cGMP hydrolysis in suspensions of ROS membranes after addition of GTP were unaffected in the presence of hRGSr (Fig. 5). Likewise, hRGSr has little effect on PDE activity in ROS membranes stimulated by GTPγS. It appears that the main mode of RGS action in the transducin/PDE signaling system is to accelerate G-protein and effector inactivation rather than to block effector activation. Measurements of GTPase activity under single turnover conditions presented in this study demonstrate that hRGSr can dramatically increase the k cat of GTP hydrolysis by transducin. Effects of hRGSr on transducin's GTPase activity were attenuated but not eliminated by Pγ. Even in the presence of Pγ, hRGSr accelerated the GTPase activity by ∼3-fold. Similar inhibitory effects of Pγ on stimulation of transducin GTPase activity by mouse RGSr have just been reported (45Wieland T. Chen C.-K. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8853-8856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that Pγ attenuates effects of RGSr allosterically rather than competitively as suggested by Wieland et al. (45Wieland T. Chen C.-K. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8853-8856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In agreement with earlier observations, the rates of GTP hydrolysis were significantly higher in more concentrated suspensions of photoreceptor membranes (11Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 12Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). hRGSr was equally potent as a GAP for transducin regardless of the membrane concentration, indicating that: (a) a putative membrane GAP factor for transducin represents a distinct non-RGS-like protein, and (b) the membrane factor does not compete with hRGS for binding to transducin. A newly discovered second retina-specific RGS protein (RET-RGS1) is a membrane-bound protein and therefore is a potential candidate for a putative GAP factor (46Faurobert E. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 2945-2950Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our study indicates that RET-RGS1 and an unidentified GAP factor are likely to be different proteins. The PDE inactivation rates were increased by hRGSr proportionally to the acceleration of the GTPase rates. The evidence that transducin's GTPase activity represents a major mechanism for inactivation of PDE in the turnoff of visual signals (11Arshavsky V.Y.

Our data support the conclusion that transducin's GTPase activity controls PDE inactivation. The rates of GTP hydrolysis and PDE inactivation (>0.7 s−1) observed at relatively high concentrations of photoreceptor membranes in the presence of RGS are adequate to explain fast turnoff kinetics in the visual transduction cascade in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2069418933,"We previously described a 1,000-fold pyrimethamine-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line (PyrR100) which retains parental dihydrofolate reductase activity and methotrexate (MTX) sensitivity. This study characterizes the basis for the 14-fold decrease in folic acid and leucovorin concentrations required for clonogenic growth of PyrR100 cells relative to parental AA8 cells. Under conditions in which folic acid reduction was blocked by trimetrexate, PyrR100 cells displayed relative to parental AA8 cells a: 1) 17- and 5-fold increase in the net transport of folic acid and MTX, respectively; 2) 23- and 5-fold decrease in the efflux rate constant for folic acid and MTX, respectively; and 3) 2-fold increase in folic acid influx with no significant change in MTX influx. The markedly increased net folic acid transport in PyrR100 cells could not be explained by cellular folic acid binding, mitochondrial sequestration, polyglutamylation, nor by a decreased membrane potential.The effect of energy deprivation on folic acid and MTX transport in both cell lines was quite different. Glucose and pyruvate deprivation nearly abolished the increase in net folic acid transport in PyrR100 cells. In contrast, energy deprivation increased net MTX transport in AA8 cells, whereas no change was seen with PyrR100 cells. Furthermore, while folic acid influx in PyrR100 and AA8 cells was markedly reduced with energy deprivation, MTX influx was not affected. Provision of glucose and pyruvate to energy-deprived cells resulted in a rapid onset of MTX efflux from parental AA8 cells but not from PyrR100 cells. Taken together these results indicate that the markedly enhanced net transport of folic acid and MTX in PyrR100 cells is largely due to the complete loss of exit pump activity. Furthermore, the energy source that sustains the augmented levels of folic acid appears linked to the influx process and is distinct from the energy source that sustains MTX gradients under these conditions. We conclude that the loss of folic acid efflux is an efficient means of augmenting cellular uptake of folate cofactors and subsequent survival on picomolar folate concentrations. This constitutes the first demonstration of the loss of folic acid exporter activity in mammalian cells as a response to lipophilic antifolate selective pressure.

This constitutes the first demonstration of the loss of folic acid exporter activity in mammalian cells as a response to lipophilic antifolate selective pressure. Folic acid cofactors play a key role in one-carbon metabolism and are essential for the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine precursors of nucleic acids, for the metabolism of certain amino acids, as well as for initiation of macromolecular synthesis in mitochondria (1Blakely R.D. Benkovics S.J. Folates and Pterins: Chemistry and Biochemistry of Pterins.2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985Google Scholar, 2Blakely R.D. Whitehead V.M. Folates and Pterins: Nutritional, Pharmacological, and Physiological Aspects.3. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Google Scholar). However, mammalian cells cannot synthesize folates and therefore must rely on their uptake from exogenous sources. Several plasma membrane routes have been described in mammalian cells that can accommodate transport of folates and their 4-amino analogs including methotrexate (MTX). 1The abbreviations used are: MTX, methotrexate; RFC, reduced folate carrier; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; TMQ, trimetrexate; MOAT, multispecific organic anion transporter; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium; HBS, Hepes-buffered saline; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: MTX, methotrexate; RFC, reduced folate carrier; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; TMQ, trimetrexate; MOAT, multispecific organic anion transporter; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium; HBS, Hepes-buffered saline; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1) The reduced folate carrier (RFC), a major folate uptake route which is a bidirectional anion exchanger (3Goldman I.D.

However, although folates can be taken up efficiently by mammalian cells via these systems (and possibly by additional yet unidentified transport routes), they can be rapidly lost by efflux through RFC as well as ATP-dependent efflux pumps (13Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3779-3785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) such as the multispecific organic anion transporters (MOATs) (14Saxena M. Henderson G.B. J. Biol.

Thus, intracellular levels of free monoglutamate reflect the net contributions of these multiple bidirectional processes. Furthermore, another element of cellular folate retention is the extent of folylpolyglutamylation (18Rosenblatt D.S. Whitehead V.M. Vera N. Pottier A. Dupont M. Vuchich M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 1143-1147PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fry D.W. Yallowich J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1890-1896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as compartmentation in organelles including mitochondria (20Horne D.W. Holloway R.S. Said H.M. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study we characterized the mechanism(s) underlying the extraordinary decrease in the folate growth requirement of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) PyrR100 cells that display high level resistance to lipophilic antifolates including 2,4-diaminopyrimidines (e.g. pyrimethamine and metoprine), trimetrexate (TMQ), and piritrexim (21Assaraf Y.G. Slotky J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4556-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We find that these cells have markedly augmented folic acid accumulation and provide evidence that this is due predominantly to the loss of folic acid exporter activity. This constitutes the first demonstration of the loss of folic acid efflux activity in mammalian cells as a mechanism of adaptation to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition with a lipophilic antifolate. [3′,5′,7′,9-3H]folic acid, [carboxyl-14C]inulin, and [3H]tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) were obtained from Amersham Corp., and [3′,5′,7′-3H]MTX was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Radiolabeled and unlabeled folic acid and MTX were purified prior to use by high performance liquid chromatography (19Fry D.W. Yallowich J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1890-1896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trimetrexate was a generous gift from Dr. D. Fry (Warner-Lambert, Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, MI). Folic acid, leucovorin (calcium salt), MTX, and pyrimethamine were obtained from Sigma. CHO PyrR100cells were established by stepwise selection of parental AA8 cells in gradually increasing concentrations of pyrimethamine (21Assaraf Y.G. Slotky J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4556-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The multiple step selection initiated at 100 nm pyrimethamine (the LD50) was terminated at 100 μm, and the 1000-fold pyrimethamine-resistant cells were therefore termed PyrR100. Parental AA8 cells and their PyrR100subline were maintained in monolayer or suspension culture conditions in RPMI 1640 containing 2.3 μm folic acid (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Laboratories Inc.), 1 mm sodium pyruvic acid (Mediatech), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Unless otherwise stated, the growth medium of PyrR100 cells was supplemented with 100 μmpyrimethamine. Monolayer cells were passaged biweekly by a standard trypsinization protocol. Monolayers of AA8 and PyrR100 cells grown for at least five doublings in pyrimethamine-free medium were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and detached by trypsinization. Cells were then seeded at 500–1,000 cells/60-mm Petri dish in 5 ml of folic acid-free RPMI 1640 medium containing a range of folic acid or leucovorin concentrations. After 7–12 days of incubation at 37 °C when colonies (>50 cells/colony) became visible, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with methanol, stained with crystal violet, and counted. The control clonogenic growth was determined in medium containing 2.3 μm folic acid or 100 nm leucovorin. Influx measurements were performed according to a previously described method (22Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Exponentially growing cells from suspension cultures in pyrimethamine-free growth medium were collected by centrifugation (750 × g for 2 min), and washed three times with ice-cold HBS (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucose). Cells were resuspended to a density of 2–6 × 107 cells/ml in 1 mmpyruvate-containing HBS with 5 μm TMQ (only for folic acid transport measurements) to ensure complete blockade of folic acid reduction by DHFR (23Assaraf Y.G. Molina A. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18326-18334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, uptake was initiated by addition of [3H]folic acid or [3H]MTX and 0.5–1-ml portions of the cell suspension were drawn at given times, and transport was terminated by injection into 10 ml of ice-cold HBS. After centrifugation (750 ×g for 2 min) at 4 °C, cells were resuspended in ice-cold HBS, washed twice in the same buffer, and processed for determination of intracellular radiolabel with normalization to dry weight (22Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Intracellular water of AA8 and PyrR100 cells was determined using the membrane-impermeable [carboxyl-14C]inulin as the extracellular marker as described elsewhere (24Bobzien III, W.F. Goldman I.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efflux measurements were performed by first loading cells with [3H]folic acid (in the presence of TMQ) or [3H]MTX for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, a portion was removed for determination of the intracellular level prior to efflux. The remaining radiolabeled cells were sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in a large volume of prewarmed HBS containing 1 mm pyruvate and 5 μm TMQ. Portions of cell suspension were drawn at given times and processed as detailed above for cellular radiolabel. The DHFR binding capacity was the level of [3H]MTX remaining in cells after efflux for 30–60 min, an incubation time sufficient to allow for the loss of all free drug. We have employed the method of equilibrium distribution of the lipid-soluble cation TPP+ across the plasma membrane to determine the membrane potential of AA8 and PyrR100 cells (25Lichtenstein D. Dunlop K. Kaback H.R. Blume A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2580-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The uptake of TPP+ was measured at 2 μm and reached a steady-state after 10 min of incubation at 37 °C. Total cellular TPP+ was corrected for a bound component that was retained in cells after efflux into a buffer free of TPP+. The Nernst equation was employed to calculate the membrane potential using the cell volume determination (see Table II) and intracellular/extracellular TPP+ concentrations.Table IIComparison of folic acid transport parameters in AA8 and PyrR100 cellsAA8 PyrR100PyrR100/AA8Initial uptake rate (nmol/min/g dry wt)0.058 ± 0.0060.108 ± 0.0141.9Efflux rate constant (min−1)0.084 ± 0.0120.0036 ± 0.00110.043Total cell folic acid (nmol/g dry wt)0.51 ± 0.037.52 ± 1.1714.8H2O i /dry wt (μl/mg)4.984.430.89Observed [folic acid] i (μM)0.1021.7016.7Predicted [folic acid] i (μM)2-aBased upon the Nernst equation using the measured membrane potential at an extracellular folic acid level of 1 μm.0.070.071Observed/Predicted1.4624.316.6Membrane potential (mV)−35−351.0Data presented are the means ± S.E. of 4-13 independent experiments.2-a Based upon the Nernst equation using the measured membrane potential at an extracellular folic acid level of 1 μm.

Yallowich J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1890-1896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using two continuous linear gradients of 0–10% and 10–15% acetonitrile over 35 and 15 min, respectively. Unlabeleld MTX-Glu(1–6)standards (Schircks Laboratories, Switzerland) served as internal markers and were monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm. Typically, MTX-Glu(6–3) eluted during the 0–10% acetonitrile gradient whereas MTX-Glu(2–1) resolved during the 10–15% acetonitrile elution. Exponentially growing AA8 and PyrR100 cells (2.5–5 × 108 cells) in pyrimethamine-free suspension cultures were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold HBS. Cells were resuspended in prewarmed HBS containing 1 mm pyruvate and 5 μm TMQ, incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, and then loaded for 1 h with 1 μm[3H]folic acid in the same buffer. A portion of radiolabeled cells was removed for determination of cell-associated folic acid. The remaining cells were washed three times with ice-cold HBS, resuspended in 10 volumes of ice-cold hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2), and allowed to swell for 20–30 min at 0 °C (26Trent D.F. Seither R.L. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Following light microscopy verification of >95% cell swelling, β-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 1%, and cells were disrupted with 50 strokes in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, pestle A); >99% cell lysis was achieved in both parental AA8 and PyrR100 cells. Sucrose (Ultrapure, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added to a final concentration of 0.25m, and the homogenate was layered over 5 ml of 25% sucrose and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to sediment intact cells, nuclei, and cell debris. The supernatant was then collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. Alternatively, to isolate mitochondria under osmoprotective conditions to minimize potential [3H]folic acid leakage, cells loaded with [3H]folic acid were suspended in 10 volumes of isotonic buffer B (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 233 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2). Under these conditions 230–300 Dounce homogenizer strokes, and 50–85 strokes were necessary to disrupt PyrR100 and AA8 cells, respectively. Parental AA8 cells and their PyrR100 subline with high level resistance to lipophilic antifolates were examined for their clonogenic growth requirements for folic acid and leucovorin. Whereas parental AA8 cells maintained a 50% clonogenic viability at 70 nm folic acid and 0.8 nm leucovorin, PyrR100 cells required 14-fold less folate cofactors and displayed a 50% clonogenic viability at leucovorin concentrations as low as 60 pm (Table I). Consequently, PyrR100 cells could grow solely on the residual (∼75 pm) folates present in a folic acid-free medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (data not shown). Thus, PyrR100 cells possess a markedly decreased folate growth requirement and picomolar concentrations of leucovorin are sufficient to support clonogenic growth.Table IFolic acid and leucovorin clonogenic growth requirement for parental AA8 and PyrR100 cellsCV50AA8PyrR100AA8/PyrR100Folic acid70 nm5 nm14Leucovorin800 pm60 pm13Data presented for the 50% clonogenic viability (CV50) values are the means of two experiments. Open table in a new tab Data presented for the 50% clonogenic viability (CV50) values are the means of two experiments. To explore the role of membrane transport in the markedly decreased folate growth dependence of PyrR100 cells, [3H]folic acid transport was measured in the presence of 5 μm TMQ to abolish DHFR activity and subsequent folic acid reduction (23Assaraf Y.G. Molina A. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18326-18334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Net uptake of folic acid into AA8 and PyrR100 cells reached steady-state at 30 min (Fig.1, inset) and 60 min (Fig. 1) with folic acid levels at 0.51 ± 0.03 and 7.52 ± 1.17 nmol per g of dry weight, respectively (Table II). Based on the measured intracellular water, AA8 and PyrR100 cells achieved free intracellular folic acid concentrations of 0.1 and 1.7 μm, respectively (Table II). Therefore, PyrR100 cells achieved a 17-fold higher intracellular folic acid concentration than parental AA8 cells. Net uptake of [3H]MTX (Fig. 2) was also higher in PyrR100 than in AA8 cells (7.63 ± 0.64versus 3.40 ± 0.28 nmol MTX/g of dry weight, respectively, Table III). To assess free MTX, cells loaded with [3H]MTX were resuspended in MTX-free buffer allowing for discrimination between the free and bound components. While the tightly bound MTX fraction was only slightly increased in PyrR100 cells, the free intracellular MTX concentration of 1.1 μm was increased 4.8-fold in this cell line as compared with 0.23 μm in AA8 cells (Table III). Hence, net accumulation of free folic acid in PyrR100 cells was much greater than for MTX.Table IIIComparison of MTX transport parameters between AA8 and PyrR100 cellsAA8PyrR100PyrR100/AA8Initial uptake rate (nmol/min/g dry wt)0.366 ± 0.0360.421 ± 0.0301.153-aThe difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.1805).Efflux rate constant (min−1)0.22 ± 0.060.041 ± 0.0120.186Total cell MTX (nmol/g dry wt)3.396 ± 0.2767.63 ± 0.642.25Bound MTX (nmol/g dry wt)2.25 ± 0.172.70 ± 0.241.20Free MTX (nmol/g dry wt)1.144.934.30Observed [MTX] i0.231.114.83Predicted [MTX] i (μM)3-bBased upon the Nernst equation using the measured membrane potential of −35 mV and an extracellular MTX level of 1 μm.0.070.071Observed/Predicted3.2915.94.8Data presented are the means ± SEM of 4-10 independent experiments.3-a The difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.1805).3-b Based upon the Nernst equation using the measured membrane potential of −35 mV and an extracellular MTX level of 1 μm. Open table in a new tab Data presented are the means ± SEM of 4-10 independent experiments. To assess the role that changes in influx and efflux parameters contribute to the alterations in steady-state (anti)folate levels, bidirectional fluxes were measured. While folic acid influx was increased 2-fold in PyrR100 cells (Table II), no significant difference in the influx of MTX was observed between PyrR100 and AA8 cells (Table III). Analysis of efflux revealed that parental AA8 cells had a very rapid loss of folic acid (t½ = 4 min), whereas the effluxt½ in PyrR100 cells was 80 min (Fig.3 A). While folic acid efflux in PyrR100 cells was not complete even after 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the process could be described by a single exponential in both cell lines (Fig. 3 B). The folic acid efflux rate constant (k′) was decreased by a factor of 23 in PyrR100 relative to AA8 cells (k′ = 0.0036 min−1 and 0.084 min−1, respectively, TableII). MTX efflux was also decreased in PyrR100 cells (Fig.4 A), albeit to a lesser extent than observed for folic acid with a 5-fold fall in the MTX efflux rate constant in PyrR100 relative to AA8 cells (0.041 min−1 and 0.22 min−1), respectively (Fig. 4 B and TableIII). Hence, the large increase in the steady-state folic acid levels in PyrR100 cells is associated with a two fold increase in influx but more than an order of magnitude greater decline in efflux. The smaller increase in MTX uptake in PyrR100 cells is due entirely to a decline in efflux and to a much smaller extent than observed for folic acid in PyrR100 cells. A variety of studies were undertaken to confirm that the markedly diminished efflux of folic acid and MTX in PyrR100 cells was due entirely to a change in membrane transport and not due to: 1) increased (anti)folylpolyglutamylation, 2) increased compartmentation of folate in mitochondria, 3) sequestration by a highly overexpressed (anti)folate-binding protein, or 4) decreased plasma membrane potential. After loading cells with 1 μm[3H]MTX for 1 h, cell extracts were analyzed by HPLC for MTX and its polyglutamate derivatives. PyrR100 and AA8 cells both contained∼ 85% of the radiolabel as the MTX monoglutamate (data not shown). The remaining 15% of radiolabel was associated with decreasing amounts of diglutamate, triglutamate, and tetraglutamate in both cell lines. Thus, the vast majority of radiolabeled MTX in both PyrR100 and AA8 cells remains in the monoglutamate form after 1 h incubation with [3H]MTX. HPLC analysis of cell extracts following 1 h incubation with 1 μm[3H]folic acid in the presence of 5 μm TMQ revealed that greater than 95% of the radiolabel in both PyrR100 and AA8 cells represented folic acid monoglutamate. Hence, there was no metabolism of folic acid under these conditions.Figure 4Time course of MTX efflux in PyrR100 and AA8 cells. After 30 min loading of PyrR100 (squares) and AA8 cells (triangles) with [3H]MTX at 1 μmand 5 μm (to compensate for the small exchangeable pool of MTX in AA8 cells, see Table III), respectively, cells were rapidly sedimented by centrifugation and suspended in drug-free HBS (A). To determine the MTX efflux rate constants, the log value of the percentage of the initial free MTX (corrected for tightly bound MTX, see Table III) was plotted as a function of time (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the levels of compartmentation of folic acid in mitochondria, cells were loaded with 1 μm[3H]folic acid in the presence of 5 μm TMQ for 1 h, following which mitochondria were isolated in isotonic or hypotonic buffer. Under these conditions, mitochondria-associated folic acid in both PyrR100 and AA8 cells did not exceed 0.5% of cellular radiolabel. To explore the possibility of intracellular folic acid sequestration by a potentially overexpressed folate binding protein, cells were loaded with 1 μm[3H]folic acid for 1 h after which G-25 gel filtration of total cellular lysate was performed. All the radiolabel (>99.9%) was retained on the column indicating that all the [3H]folic acid was free and not protein-associated. The possibility of a decline in the membrane potential in PyrR100 cells that would result in an increase in the the levels of folates was explored by the equilibrium distribution of the lipid-soluble cation TPP+ across the plasma membrane. Based on the Nernst equation the mean membrane potential value for both PyrR100 and AA8 cells was calculated to be −35 mV (TableII). Hence, a decline in the membrane potential did not play a role in the marked accumulation of folic acid in PyrR100 cells. Since the data indicated that changes in net folic acid and MTX transport were associated with a large increase in the transmembrane electrochemical potential difference for these folates in PyrR100 cells, studies were focused on the bioenergetic characteristics of these processes in the two cell lines. It has been well established that at least one component of MTX efflux in various mammalian cells is mediated by energy requiring exit pump(s) (14Saxena M. Henderson G.B. J. Biol.

Commun. 1981; 99: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hence studies were undertaken to assess the energy requirement for (anti)folate transport in PyrR100 and AA8 cells. Energy depletion achieved by incubating cells for 30 min in glucose- and pyruvate-deficient transport buffer (27Sprecher H. Barr H.M. Slotky J.I. Tzukerman M. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20668-20676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) decreased the augmented net folic acid transport in PyrR100 cells by 85%, while net folic acid uptake in AA8 cells at steady-state was essentially unchanged (Fig. 5). In contrast, glucose and pyruvate deprivation increased net MTX transport in AA8 (Fig.6 A) but not in PyrR100 cells (Fig. 6 B). Provision of glucose and pyruvate after energy deprivation resulted in an immediate fall in the free MTX in AA8 (Fig.6 A, arrow) but no change in PyrR100cells (Fig. 6 B, arrow). Folic acid influx in PyrR100 and AA8 cells was decreased by 80 and 60%, respectively, in the absence of glucose and pyruvate and under these conditions was comparable in the two cell lines (Fig.7).

https://openalex.org/W2074243206,"Ligands that are transported by the maltose transport system of Escherichia coli must first bind to the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP). However, binding of a ligand does not always lead to its transport. As reported earlier, reduced or oxidized maltodextrins bind tightly to MBP but are not transported; some mutant MBPs, such as MalE254, bind maltodextrins tightly but cannot produce their transport. In this study, UV differential spectroscopy and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were used to study the modes by which various ligands bind to MBP. Maltose binding produced a red shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum of wild type MBP and a sharp hypochromatic trend below 265 nm in its UV spectrum (R mode (for red)). On the other hand, binding of reduced, oxidized, or cyclic maltodextrins produced a pronounced blue shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum of wild type MBP and a peak at about 250 nm in its UV difference spectrum (B mode (for blue). Binding of reducing maltodextrins to wild type MBP produced spectral changes that seemed to be a mixture of predominantly R mode binding and some B mode binding, whereas their binding to mutant MBP MalE254 produced changes indicative of pure B mode binding. Thus, the ligands that are bound exclusively via the B mode to either the wild type or MalE254 MBP are not transported."
https://openalex.org/W2022679761,"GP46 is an abundant glycoprotein of 46 kDa on the surface of the promastigote form of most <i>Leishmania</i>species. We show that the steady state level of GP46 mRNA increases >30-fold as <i>Leishmania chagasi</i> promastigotes develop<i>in vitro</i> from a less infectious form during logarithmic growth to a highly infectious form in the stationary phase of cultivation. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrate that this increase in GP46 mRNA abundance is regulated post-transcriptionally. Plasmids containing the 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) and downstream intergenic regions (IRs) of two different GP46 genes fused immediately downstream of the β-galactosidase coding region were transfected into<i>L. chagasi</i>, and β-galactosidase activity and mRNA levels were examined. The presence of the 3′-UTR + IR of one GP46 gene (<i>gp46</i>A) resulted in a steady increase in β-galactosidase activity and mRNA level as the transfected promastigotes developed from logarithmic to stationary phase. This differential effect parallels that of the 3′-UTRs + IRs of a family of genes for an unrelated <i>Leishmania</i> surface glycoprotein, GP63. Thus, post-transcriptional regulation of the genes for two different surface glycoproteins of <i>Leishmania</i> occurs via a similar mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2082344712,"The bombesin family of G-protein-coupled receptors includes the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R), the neuromedin B receptor (NMB-R), bombesin receptor subtype 3 (BRS-3), and bombesin receptor subtype 4 (bb4). All species homologues of GRP-R, NMB-R, and bb4 bind bombesin with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range; by comparison, human BRS-3 binds bombesin at much lower affinity (K d > 1 μm). We used this difference to help identify candidate residues that were potentially critical for forming the bombesin binding pocket. We reasoned that amino acids essential for bombesin binding would be conserved among all homologues of bb4, NMB-R, and GRP-R; conversely, at least one of these amino acids would not be conserved among homologues of BRS-3. Amino acid sequence alignment revealed nine residues that fit this model. We replaced each of these amino acids in mouse GRP-R with the homologous amino acid in human BRS-3. Four substitutions resulted in a significant decrease in bombesin affinity (R288H, Q121R, P199S, and A308S). The analogous mutations in BRS-3 (R127Q, H294R, S205P, and S315A) together resulted in a receptor with a 100-fold increase in bombesin and GRP affinities relative to wild-type BRS-3.

Erspamer V. Bucci M. Experientia ( Basel ). 1971; 27: 166-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Numerous polypeptides with structurally related carboxyl termini were subsequently isolated from amphibians and classified into three subfamilies (bombesin, ranatensin, and phyllolitorin) based upon the sequence of the last three residues in their amidated carboxy-terminal domains (2Erspamer G. Severini V. Erspamer V. Melchiorri P. delle Fave G. Nakajima T. Regul. Pept. 1988; 21: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).

Bombesin, NMB, and GRP bind to a family of G-protein-coupled receptors known to include at least four receptor subtypes: the GRP-preferring receptor (GRP-R (or bb2)) (5Corjay M. Dobrzanski D. Way J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6205-6209Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although the four subtypes share about 50% identity when their primary amino acid sequences are aligned, the pharmacology of BRS-3 is significantly different from the pharmacology of the others. 2Mantey, S., Weber, C., Sainz, E., Akeson, M., Ryan, R., Pradhan, T., Searles, R., Spindel, E., Battey, J., Coy, D., and Jensen, R., submitted for publication. Notably, GRP-R, NMB-R, and bb4 all bind bombesin with affinities in the nanomolar range, whereas BRS-3 binds bombesin with much lower affinity (>10 μm). We hypothesized that amino acids essential for high affinity bombesin binding would be conserved among all known GRP-R, NMB-R, and bb4 sequences and would diverge in the BRS-3 sequences. Nine amino acids in extracellular loops or in the outer half of transmembrane helices fulfilled these conditions. The importance of each of these residues for agonist binding to GRP-R was determined by using site-directed mutagenesis to exchange the residue found in GRP-R with its divergent counterpart in BRS-3. The affinities of BRS-3 or GRP-R mutants for bombesin and GRP were determined using quantitative ligand displacement analysis and, in instances where the affinity was low, were confirmed by dose-response analysis of ligand-activated inositol phosphate elaboration. Reduced affinity in mouse GRP-R and increased affinity in human BRS-3 revealed that two residues (Gln-121 and Arg-288) were essential for bombesin and GRP binding to GRP-R; two other residues (Pro-199 and Ala-308) modulated binding. These four residues appear to form a pocket centered between TMIII, TMVI, and TMVII, near the membrane-solution interface of the receptor. cDNA inserts for the mouse GRP-R and for human BRS-3 were identical to those described previously (8Fathi Z. Corjay M.H. Shapira H. Wada E. Benya R. Jensen R. Viallet J. Sausville E.A. Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5979-5984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Battey J.F. Way J.

These were cloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) or PCDII (12Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). To generate point mutations in these cDNAs, we initially used the ChameleonTMdouble-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit as suggested by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In our hands, the Chameleon procedure generated an unacceptable number of random mutations. Therefore, we introduced subsequent amino acid substitutions in GRP-R and BRS-3 with the QuickChangeTM kit (Stratagene) following manufacturer instructions, except that the annealing step was at 60–62 °C and the DpnI digestion was incubated overnight. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire coding region was performed on an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 373, Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Balb 3T3 (13Fathi Z. Benya R.V. Shapira H. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14622-14626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CHOP cells (14Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (15Davis L. Kuehl M. Battey J. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1994: 624-630Google Scholar). Transiently expressing CHOP cells were used 48 h later for binding assays. Stably transfected Balb 3T3 cells were selected using 800 μg/ml G418 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin. Clones were then screened for GRP-R or BRS-3 mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis of total RNA, performed essentially as described in Davis et al. (15Davis L. Kuehl M. Battey J. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1994: 624-630Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and 300 μg/ml G418. These cells lines were used for binding or inositol phosphate assays. All reagents used in cell transfection are from Life Technologies, Inc. For the initial screen, 10-cm-diameter plates of transiently transfected CHOP cells were trypsinized approximately 24 h post-transfection and seeded into 24-well plates at 1 × 104 cells/well. Cells were allowed to incubate an additional 24 h in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and 300 μg/ml G418. These assays were performed in binding buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% bacitracin (Sigma). The cells were rinsed twice with 1 ml of binding buffer at room temperature and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 0.2 ml of binding buffer containing 100,000 cpm/ml of [125I-Tyr4]bombesin (2200 Ci/mmol) together with varying concentrations of unlabeled bombesin or GRP. The tracer was stable, and the reaction was at equilibrium as judged by stable binding maxima between 1.5 and 3 h. Therefore, the reaction was terminated at 2 h by rinsing twice in buffer and incubating the cells at 37 °C in 0.2 ml of 0.05% (w/v) trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA (Life Technologies) for 15 min. This suspension and an equal volume rinse were transferred to a glass tube and assayed on a gamma counter. Each point was in duplicate, and each experiment was replicated three times. K d values represent means ± S.E. for the three replicates. Competition binding experiments to measure gain of function in human BRS-3 or to measure low affinity binding to mouse GRP-R mutants were performed with a novel synthetic radioligand similar in structure to the carboxy-terminal end of bombesin. In contrast to bombesin, however, this radioligand ([125I-d-Tyr6, β Ala11, d-Phe13, Nle14]bombesin 6–14, which we call125I-BRS-3) binds BRS-3 with high affinity (K d = 5–10 nm).2Competition binding studies were performed as described earlier (16Benya R.V. Wada E. Battey J.F. Fathi Z. Wang L.-H. Mantey S. Coy D.H. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1058-1068PubMed Google Scholar), except that the protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Briefly, disaggregated transfected Balb 3T3 cells (1–3 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 100,000–600,000 cpm/ml of 125I-BRS-3 (2200 mCi/mmol) in the presence of unlabeled GRP or bombesin up to 30 μm. At 1 h, the binding reaction was at equilibrium as indicated by a plateau in radioligand binding as a function of time (data not shown), and the tracer was not measurably degraded as determined by high performance liquid chromatography of the radioligand from the binding reaction.2 Each point was measured in triplicate, and each experiment was replicated three times.K i values represent mean ± S.E. for the three replicates. Stably transfected Balb 3T3 cells were assayed for GRP or bombesin-induced inositol phosphate hydrolysis as described previously (16Benya R.V. Wada E. Battey J.F. Fathi Z. Wang L.-H. Mantey S. Coy D.H. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1058-1068PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 24-well tissue culture dishes were incubated in the presence of 100 μCi/ml ofmyo-[2-3H]inositol (NEN Life Science Products) in DMEM containing 0.25% FBS for 24 h. The cells were washed and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 20 mm LiCl for 15 min. After this incubation, the wash solution was removed, and cells were incubated for 1 h with varying concentrations of GRP or bombesin in a buffer solution containing 135 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm LiCl, 11.1 mm glucose, and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin adjusted to pH 7.45. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold 1% (v/v) HCl in methanol, and total [3H]inositol phosphate was recovered by anion exchange chromatography (17Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Error estimates are standard errors of the mean. Amino acid residues potentially critical for high affinity bombesin binding were revealed by an alignment of bombesin receptor sequences, which maximizes identity (Fig. 1). Nine positions are highlighted based on three criteria. (i) The amino acid at that position is conserved among all receptors that bind bombesin with high affinity. (ii) The amino acid at that position in BRS-3 is not the same as the conserved residue in the previous criterion. (iii) The amino acid at that position is predicted to lie either in the outer one-half of a transmembrane helix or in an extracellular domain. Among these nine positions, four are believed to be outside the cell, and five are believed to be in transmembrane helices (when the boundaries of the transmembrane domains are determined by Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis). We changed single amino acid residues in the mouse GRP-R, converting each of the nine highlighted residues to the analogous residue in human BRS-3. These constructs were transfected into CHOP cells, and then bombesin affinity for the mutant receptors was measured by displacement of [125I-Tyr4]bombesin. Five of the nine individual substitutions (S100T, D105E, I117L, L172F, and Y292S) had no effect on bombesin binding relative to wild-type mouse GRP-R (K d = 1.5 ± 0.5 nm) and were not analyzed further. Two substitutions (P199S and A308S) caused a modest but reproducible decrease in bombesin affinity (K d = 10 ± 1 nm, P199S; K d = 10 ± 5 nm, A308S), and two other substitutions (Q121R and R288H) resulted in loss of detectable [125I-Tyr4]bombesin binding (data not shown). To examine the R288H and Q121R mutant GRP-R receptors in more detail, we created stably transfected Balb 3T3 clonal cell lines expressing high levels of GRP-R proteins in membranes, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis using an anti-GRP-R antiserum (18Kroog G.S. Sainz E. Worland P.J. Akeson M.A. Benya R.V. Jensen R. Battey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8217-8224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Agonist affinity was measured by displacement of 125I-BRS-3, which we argue is a reliable probe for bombesin binding based upon two characteristics: (i) it is a synthetic bombesin-like peptide whose structure is based on the carboxyl-terminal nine amino acids of bombesin (structure is presented under “Experimental Procedures”), and (ii) the BRS-3 peptide, like bombesin, is an agonist for both GRP-R and BRS-3 3Ryan, R., Weber, C., Sainz, E., Mantey, S., Battey, J., and Jensen, R., submitted for publication. and thus induces the active conformation of the receptor in a similar fashion. We reasoned that, since 125I-BRS-3 binds well to both GRP-R3 and BRS-3,2 this radioligand might bind to R288H or Q121R GRP-R mutants, where individual GRP-R residues have been replaced by their counterparts in BRS-3. The Q121R mutant receptor did not bind 125I-BRS-3, and no ligand-activated inositol phosphate hydrolysis above background was observed even in the presence of 30 μm bombesin (data not shown). This suggests that the Q121R receptor has an affinity decrease of >10,000-fold or that Q121R assumes a dysfunctional tertiary structure. In contrast, the R288H GRP-R did bind 125I-BRS-3 tracer (Fig.2, filled circles in top andbottom panels), and displacement by both GRP and bombesin indicated K i values in the μm range. This represents a 1000-fold reduction in affinity relative to wild-type mouse GRP-R (Fig. 2, open circles in top andbottom panels). Low affinity of R288H for bombesin was confirmed by determining saturation curves for inositol phosphate hydrolysis, where it is predicted that higher doses of bombesin will be needed to elicit a response comparable to that observed in the wild-type GRP-R. A saturation analysis of bombesin-stimulated inositol phosphate hydrolysis indicated a nearly 100-fold-reduced bombesin potency in the R288H GRP-R mutant (Fig. 3, filled circles) relative to the wild-type mouse GRP-R (Fig. 3, open circles). These data indicate a striking decrease in binding affinity for GRP and bombesin in an otherwise functional R288H GRP-R mutant.Figure 3Bombesin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in wild-type and R288H GRP-R-transfected Balb 3T3 cells.

If this interpretation is correct, then changing the same four amino acids in human BRS-3 (R127Q, H294R, S205P, and S315A) to their corresponding residues in the GRP-R would be expected to increase the affinity of bombesin and GRP for that BRS-3 mutant. To test this hypothesis, we constructed two human BRS-3 mutants: 2ΔBRS-3 contained the R127Q and H294R substitutions, and 4ΔBRS-3 contained all four key substitutions (R127Q, H294R, S205P, and S315A). The affinity of GRP and bombesin for these mutant receptors and for wild-type human BRS-3 (Fig. 4, open circles,top and bottom panels) was measured by displacement of 125I-BRS-3. The K i values for bombesin (Fig. 4, top panel) and GRP (Fig. 4,bottom panel) binding to wild-type human BRS-3 exceeded the highest agonist concentration (30 μm) and could not be quantified. Agonist affinities for 2ΔBRS-3 (Fig. 4,squares) and for 4ΔBRS-3 (Fig. 4, closed circles) were reproducibly greater than for the wild-type BRS-3 and were of the expected rank (4ΔBRS-3 > 2ΔBRS-3 > wild-type BRS-3). The K i values for 4ΔBRS-3 could be calculated and equaled 370 ± 70 nm (GRP) and 1.5 ± 0.5 μm (bombesin). Thus, as predicted, introduction of Gln-127, Arg-294, Pro-205, and Ala-315 into human BRS-3 resulted in a receptor that binds bombesin with higher affinity than wild-type BRS-3. This indicates that some, but not all, of the high affinity binding properties of GRP-R have been restored by the amino acid changes made in 4ΔBRS-3. To substantiate this result, we compared bombesin and GRP-stimulated inositol phosphate hydrolysis by wild-type BRS-3 and by 4ΔBRS-3. If the binding for bombesin is shifted to higher affinity in the two BRS-3 mutant receptors, it is predicted that lower doses of bombesin or GRP should be needed to elicit comparable inositol phosphate hydrolysis when BRS-3 mutants are compared with wild-type BRS-3. In agreement with the competitive binding assay, the agonist saturation curves for the 4ΔBRS-3 (Fig. 5, filled circles) were shifted to higher potency relative to wild-type human BRS-3 (Fig.5, open circles). Gln-121, Arg-288, Ala-308, and Pro-199 are at least some of the residues necessary for high affinity bombesin and GRP binding to the mouse GRP-R. This conclusion is based upon lower agonist affinity for the GRP-R when these residues are altered and upon gain of bombesin and GRP affinity when these residues are introduced into human BRS-3 (Figs.4 and 5). A conceptually similar analysis was recently used to identify amino acids that influence agonist binding among opioid receptors (19Meng F. Taylor L.P. Hoversten M.T. Ueda Y. Ardati A. Reinscheid R.K. Monsma F.J. Watson S.J. Civelli O. Akil H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32016-32020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In both the study presented here and in the opioid receptor study, the gain of function mutations present the most compelling evidence that key amino acids play a direct role in determining agonist affinity. Like other members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, the primary sequence of the GRP-R suggests seven helical transmembrane domains that form a tightly packed bundle. Recently, two structural models of these transmembrane helices have been independently proposed, based upon electron diffraction analysis of bovine rhodopsin (20Schertler G. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) or a summary of mutational analyses performed on receptors throughout the superfamily (21Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 22Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The two models agree in most respects and present a useful structural framework to analyze ligand and heterotrimeric G-protein binding to this class of receptors. In Fig. 6, we show the predicted position of the three residues (Gln-121, Arg-288, Ala-308) in the transmembrane helices of the GRP-R. The model we used for helix and residue orientation is from Baldwin (21Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 22Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and the approximate size of the side chains within the cavity circumscribed by the helices is derived from an NMR study of retinal-associated rhodopsin (23Han M. Smith S.O. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1425-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All three side chains are predicted to point into a pocket formed between TMIII, TMVI, and TMVII. Pro-199 is in extracellular domain 3 (Fig. 1) two positions from a cysteine (Cys-197), which is presumed to form a disulfide bridge with Cys-114 of the GRP-R. The cysteine at position 114 is believed to lie at the top of TMIII; therefore, the disulfide bridge and Pro-199 are predicted to be in close proximity to the pocket between Gln-121, Ala-308, and Arg-288. This model for receptor structure predicts that these four residues lie in a plane at or near the membrane solution interface, in agreement with earlier work in our laboratory that showed that serine or isoleucine at position 216 atop TMV (shown in Fig. 6) strongly influences NMB affinity within the bombesin family (13Fathi Z.

This model also predicts that the agonist binding pocket for the GRP-R occupies space between alpha helices similar to the biogenic amine receptors and rhodopsin. In the former case, agonists bind to residues in TMIII, TMV, and TMVI (24Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that a highly conserved aspartate in TMIII of the biogenic amine receptors appears to form an ionic bond to the protonated amine that is shared by all agonists in that class (24Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This aspartate occupies the same position in TMIII as does Gln-121 of the GRP-R. In rhodopsin, Lys-296 at the top of TMVII is the site of Schiff base linkage to the retinal chromophore, and Glu-113 at the top of TMIII is the Schiff base counterion (25Rao V.R. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). These residues in rhodopsin are positioned about one helical turn above the positions of Ala-308 and Gln-121 in the GRP-R. We are presently testing two hypotheses about receptor-ligand interactions in the bombesin family that follow from this study. First, we hypothesize that there is a shared domain within agonists that interacts with Gln-121, Arg-288, Ala-308, and Pro-199, since residues equivalent to Gln-121, Arg-288, Ala-308, and Pro-199 are conserved in all homologues of receptors that bind bombesin with high affinity (GRP-R, NMB-R, and bb4). At the carboxyl terminus of bombesin, GRP, and NMB, four amino acids (GH(L/F)M-NH2) are identical and required for activity. On this basis, we propose that the carboxyl terminus of these agonists interacts with the receptor pocket defined by Gln-121, Arg-288, Ala-308, and Pro-199. Three predictions follow from this: (i) the naturally occurring agonist that binds to BRS-3 would be expected to have at least one residue at its carboxyl terminus that differs from those shown above, (ii) NMB would be expected to bind at high affinity to 4ΔBRS-3, and (iii) amino acid substitutions in NMB-R and bb4 at the four key positions would be expected to reduce agonist affinity. These predictions can be tested when the natural ligand for BRS-3 is discovered, the affinity for NMB is determined in the 4ΔBRS-3 mutant, and mutagenesis studies analogous to that reported for GRP-R are performed using the NMB-R and bb4. Second, we hypothesize that if the pocket defined by Gln-121, Pro-199, Arg-288, and Ala-308 is important for agonist binding within this family, then other conserved residues facing this pocket would be expected to significantly affect agonist binding. We are in the process of examining several candidate amino acids to test this hypothesis. We thank Drs. Patrick Donohue, Thomas Friedman, and Yuhmei Lin and Lori Hampton for their help in editing the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2061060110,"Nuclease hypersensitive sites exist in vivo in the chromatin of the integrated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 proviral genome, in the 5′-long terminal repeat (LTR) within the promoter/enhancer region near Sp1 and NFκB binding sites. Previous studies from the Kadonaga and Jones laboratories have shown that Sp1 and NFκB can establish hypersensitive sites in a truncated form of this LTR when added before in vitro chromatin assembly with Drosophila extracts, thus facilitating subsequent transcriptional activation of a linked reporter gene upon the association of additional factors (Pazin, M. J., Sheridan, P. L., Cannon, K., Cao, Z., Keck, J. G., Kadanaga, J. T., and Jones, K. A. (1996) Genes & Dev. 10, 37–49). Here we assess the role of a full-length LTR and 1 kilobase pair of downstream flanking HIV sequences in chromatin remodeling when these transcription factors are added after chromatin assembly. Using Xenopus laevis oocyte extracts to assemble chromatin in vitro, we have confirmed that Sp1 and NFκB can indeed induce sites hypersensitive to DNase I, micrococcal nuclease, or restriction enzymes on either side of factor binding sites in chromatin but not naked DNA. We extend these earlier studies by demonstrating that the process is ATP-dependent when the factors are added after chromatin assembly and that histone H1, AP1, TBP, or Tat had no effect on hypersensitive site formation. Furthermore, we have found that nucleosomes upstream of NFκB sites are rotationally positioned prior to factor binding and that their translational frame is registered after binding NFκB. On the other hand, binding of Sp1 positions adjacent downstream nucleosome(s). We term this polar repositioning because each factor aligns nucleosomes only on one side of its binding sites. Mutational analysis and oligonucleotide competition each demonstrated that this remodeling required Sp1 and NFκB binding sites.

In its most fundamental form, packaging of DNA in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell into chromatin starts with the creation of the polynucleosomal chain. Each nucleosome consists of a core particle consisting of the histone octamer and 146 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); kbp, kilobase pair(s); LTR, long terminal repeat; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; nt, nucleotide(s). 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); kbp, kilobase pair(s); LTR, long terminal repeat; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; nt, nucleotide(s). of DNA wrapped in the left-handed superhelical sense, and a linker region of variable length but generally less than 50 bp, which interacts with histone H1 and/or other accessory proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1van Holde K.E. Rich A. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 1-489Google Scholar). This polynucleosomal structure is further looped and folded into various higher order structures, leading to the functional sequestration of the genome in the interphase nucleus at a DNA concentration of approximately 50 mg per ml (reviewed in Refs. 2Freeman L.A. Garrard W.T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 165-209PubMed Google Scholar and 3Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1991-2000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The packaging of DNA into chromatin adds levels of complexity to the problem of transcriptional regulation. Nucleosome formation often hinders the accessibility of transcription factors to occupy their binding sites within promoters (reviewed in Refs. 4Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1996; 86: 13-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 5Svaren J. Horz W. Curr. Opin.

On the other hand, formation of the nucleosome can in some instances increase the affinity or action of factor binding (7Schild C. Claret F.-X. Wahli W. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 8Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Hache R.J.G. Beato M.

In addition, transcriptional elongation is attenuated by the formation of the polynucleosomal chain, leading to further potential regulatory opportunities (reviewed in Ref. 10Luse D. Felsenfeld G. Elgin S.C.R. Chromatin Structure and Gene Expression. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 105-122Google Scholar). Although it seems clear that the eukaryotic transcription apparatus has evolved to work through chromatin and not simply naked DNA, we are only now beginning to develop an understanding of these mechanisms (reviewed in Ref. 11Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Windows in chromatin that have already bound transcription factors, or that will allow their binding, are operationally detected as nuclease hypersensitive sites (reviewed in Ref. 12Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Several studies have focused on the mechanism of how these sites are generated. Theoretically one might imagine that DNA replication might be required for transcription factors to invade nucleosomes at the time of chromatin reassembly (13Svaren J. Chalkley R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but the only evidence for this mechanism that has thus far been obtained deals with the establishment of transcriptional repression (14, 15 and references therein). Rather, DNA replication-independent mechanisms seem to have evolved to allow transcription factors access to DNA sequences complexed to histone octamers. At least three different “protein machines” have been identified, by either biochemical or genetic experiments (or both), that utilize ATP to facilitate loading of transcription factors onto promoters originally packaged as nucleosomes: (i) the SWI·SNF complex (16; reviewed in Refs. 17Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar and 18Peterson C.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); (ii) NURF (nucleosomeremodeling factor) (19Tsukiyama T. Daniel C. Tamkun J. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 1021-1026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 20Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar); and (iii) RSC (remodeling the structure ofchromatin), a complex at least 10-fold more abundant than SWI·SNF in yeast (21Cairns B.R.

We report here studies on chromatin remodeling within the HIV-1 5′-LTR where the viral promoter and enhancer are located. We selected this system because the LTR has been well characterized with respect to transcription factor binding sites (reviewed in Refs. 22Steffy K. Wong-Staal F. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gaynor R.B. AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 24Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and nuclease hypersensitive sites in chromatin (25Verdin E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6790-6799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recently the laboratories of Kadonaga and Jones have shown that Sp1 and NFκB can establish hypersensitive sites in a 0.42-kbp truncated-LTR linked to a reporter gene when added before in vitrochromatin assembly with Drosophila extracts (27Pazin M.J. Sheridan P.L. Cannon K. Cao Z. Keck J.G. Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here we have taken advantage of these findings to explore further the mechanism for hypersensitive site formation and the potential for repositioning of nucleosomes along a full-length LTR, including 1 kbp of downstream HIV sequences, when factors are added either before or after chromatin assembly. Using Xenopus laevis oocyte extracts to assemble chromatin in vitro, we have confirmed that Sp1 and NFκB can indeed establish nuclease hypersensitive sites, even when added after chromatin assembly. We demonstrate that the process is ATP-dependent, that nucleosomes upstream of NFκB sites are rotationally positioned, and that factor binding leads to a novel polar repositioning of flanking nucleosomes. The HIV-1SphI/SphI fragment of pHXB2 (28Ou S.-H. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Paulssen E.J. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7188-7199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into pNEB193 (lacking a AvaI polylinker site). The newly generated plasmid termed pWLTR11 contained nucleotides 1–1456 of the HIV-1 genome (5′-LTR and 5′ fragment of the gag gene) and was 4202 bp in length. Plasmids pWLTR12 and pWLTR13 containing mutations within Sp1 and NFκB binding sites, respectively (29Harrich D. Garcia J.A. Mitsuyasu R. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4417-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), were constructed similarly. Fig. 1 shows the positions of factor binding sites, key restriction enzyme sites, and the sequences mutated. Single site labeling of circular DNA utilized the procedure of Shimamura et al. (30Shimamura A. Jessee B. Worcel A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids were linearized at a single cutting restriction enzyme site and treated with alkaline phosphatase. DNA was then purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA circles were generated in a T4 DNA ligase-catalyzed reaction. To remove radioactive label from non-ligated molecules, material was treated with alkaline phosphatase and DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Labeled DNA was dissolved in extraction buffer (see below) at 10 ng/μl and stored at −80 °C (used within 1–2 weeks without signs of significant radiolysis or nicking). Xenopus laevis oocyte extracts were prepared according to Shimamura et al. (30Shimamura A. Jessee B. Worcel A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, ovaries from adult frogs were treated for 3 h at room temperature with 0.15% collagenase type II (Sigma) in buffer OR-2 (5 mm HEPES, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 82 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6). Dispersed oocytes were then washed with 10 changes of OR-2 buffer. Small oocytes were discarded, and large stage-6 oocytes were gently washed with three changes of ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.6). An equal volume mixture of oocytes and extraction buffer was centrifuged in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor for 90 min at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C. The interphase between the pellet and upper lipid layer was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration of extracts typically was about 3 mg/ml. Assembly and analyses of radioactive plasmid into chromatin was done according to the protocols of Worcel and co-workers (30Shimamura A. Jessee B. Worcel A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Shimamura A. Tremethick D. Worcel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4257-4269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Razvi F. Gargiulo G. Worcel A. Gene ( Amst .). 1983; 23: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Rodriguez-Campos A. Shimamura A. Worcel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), in a final volume 10–50 μl. A 10-μl reaction mixture consisted of 4 μl of oocyte extract, 15–25 ng of labeled DNA (the optimal amount was experimentally determined for each DNA preparation), 10 ng of creatine phosphokinase, and 1 μl of 10 × chromatin assembly buffer (400 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2). All reagents were dissolved in extraction buffer (final pH 7.0). In some experiments chromatin was assembled in the presence of total histone H1 isolated from human placenta, final concentration 0.7 ng/μl (that was about 2 histone H1 molecules per nucleosomal repeat). The mixture was then incubated for 5 h at 27 °C. Where indicated, chromatin was assembled in the presence of recombinant human transcription factors. Sp1, p50, and c-Jun were purchased from Promega. p65 and p50/p65 were produced in a baculovirus expression system using standard techniques (34Potter K.N. Li Y. Capra J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2982-2988PubMed Google Scholar). p65 was 6xHis-tagged, which allowed us to purify the p65 homodimer and p50/p65 heterodimer using Ni2+-NTA-agarose columns (Qiagen). TBP and Tat were produced as glutathione S-transferase-fusions in a bacterial expression system and purified as described previously (35Garcia-Martinez L.F. Mavankal G. Wu-Baer P.P.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 350-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In some experiments, factors were added to DNA 15 min before the oocyte extract was added. Final concentrations of the factors in the assembly mixtures were as follows: 10 nm Sp1, 50 nm NFκB (homo- or heterodimer), 50 nm AP1 (c-Jun homodimer), 50 nm TBP, and 100 nm Tat. In other experiments Sp1 (20 nm) and NFκB (100 nm) were added after chromatin assembly, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for another 30 min. ATP was removed from reaction mixtures that contained assembled minichromosomes according to Tsukiyama et al. (36Tsukiyama T. Becker P.B. Wu C. Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar); mixtures were either treated with apyrase (final concentration 0.01 unit/μl) for 15 min at 27 °C or filtered through spin columns containing Bio-Gel A-1.5m (Bio-Rad). Supercoils introduced into DNA circles upon minichromosome formation were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Aliquots of assembly reactions were mixed with 0.5 volume of stop solution (0.6% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, and 6 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. Gel loading dye buffer was added, and samples were then run on 1.25% SeaKem agarose gels (1 × TAE) for about 12 h at 5 V/cm at 4 °C. Alternatively, electrophoresis was performed in the presence of 15 μg/ml (30 mm) chloroquine. Some DNA samples were electrophoresed in two dimensions. After the first dimension, gels were soaked in chloroquine-containing buffer, turned 90°, and run in a second dimension. When electrophoresis was completed, gels were fixed in 1% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, dried, and exposed to x-ray films or PhosphorImager screens. To analyze the nucleosomal ladders of minichromosomes, CaCl2 (final concentration 3 mm) and micrococcal nuclease (Worthington, final concentration 0.15 unit/μl) were added to the assembly mixture. Digestion proceeded 1–90 min at room temperature and was stopped by adding 0.5 volume of stop solution (see above). After incubation at 50 °C samples were run on 1.5% SeaKem agarose gels (1 × TAE), and gels were fixed, dried, and exposed as described above. Chromatin was assembled using plasmids labeled at the PmeI restriction site. After assembly was completed, CaCl2 and MgCl2 (final concentration 3 and 5 mm, respectively) were added and then chromatin was digested with DNase I (Worthington, final concentration 8 units/ml) or micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (Worthington, final concentration 4 units/ml) for 2 or 4 min at 27 °C. In parallel experiments, naked DNA was digested with DNase I (0.04 unit/ml) or micrococcal nuclease (2 units/ml). Digestion was terminated by adding stop solution. After incubation for 1 h at 50 °C, DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Solubilized DNA samples were then digested withEcoRI and electrophoresed on 0.5% SeaKem, 2% NuSieve agarose gels (1 × TAE). Before analyzing for the accessibility of restriction sites, NaCl and MgCl2 (final concentration 50 and 7 mm, respectively) were added to assembled minichromosomes. Restriction enzyme digestion (final concentration 1 unit/μl) was for 7, 15, or 30 min at 27 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding stop solution, and DNA samples were purified as above, digested with EcoRI, and electrophoresed on 1.5% SeaKem agarose gels (1 × TAE). Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray films and PhosphorImager screens as described above. Radioactivity in restriction fragments was quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Chromatin was assembled using plasmids labeled at either the BglII or AvaI restriction sites. After assembly was completed, minichromosome and naked DNA samples were digested with DNase I as described above. Purified DNA was digested either with BglII andSstI or with AvaI and ScaI. Heat-denatured DNA was run on 8 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Gels were dried and exposed as described above. The oligonucleotides used in gel mobility shift assays were 66-mer duplexes spanning NFκB and Sp1 binding sites (−111 to −46 bp), with either wild type or mutated sites. Binding reactions between end-labeled double-strand probes (200 pmol) and purified proteins (500 pmol) were carried out for 30 min at 27 °C in a final volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) in the presence of different amounts of specific unlabeled competitors. Samples were run on native 5% polyacrylamide gels (0.25 × TBE) at 10 V/cm at 4 °C. Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed as described above. To characterize the kinetics and efficiency of chromatin assembly, we assayed for the production of negative DNA supercoils with time of incubation in Xenopus extracts by separating resulting purified DNA circles on agarose gels in the absence or presence of chloroquine (Fig. 2, A and B). The reactions reached completion after 5 h of assembly at 27 °C. To determine the writhe for fully assembled molecules we performed two-dimensional electrophoresis in the presence of a standard that contained an array of topoisomers differing in linking numbers by single integers. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the number of negative DNA supercoils introduced into the 4.2-kbp circles exhibited a distribution with an average between −23 and −24. Assuming 1 negative supercoil per nucleosome (2Freeman L.A. Garrard W.T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 165-209PubMed Google Scholar), these circles possessed nucleosomes about every 175 to 185 bp. To investigate further the assembly process we digested the fully assembled minichromosomes with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) and estimated the DNA lengths of the purified DNA products by gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the size of the protected mononucleosome DNA fragments is close to 146 bp, as expected for core particles, whereas oligonucleosomes exhibit repeat lengths between 165 and 175 bp, with an inter-band background indicative of slightly irregular spacing. Taken together, the DNA supercoiling and nucleosome ladder results indicate that the Xenopus oocyte system works to assemble bona fide chromatin in our hands.Figure 2DNA supercoiling and nucleosomal ladder analysis of reconstituted minichromosomes.

Sheridan P.L. Cannon K. Cao Z. Keck J.G. Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), these recombinant proteins were added individually or together before or after chromatin assembly. As shown in Fig.3 A, when added before chromatin assembly individually, each protein created hypersensitive sites apparently flanking both sides of their DNA binding sites within the LTR, and when added together the hypersensitive sites, which were centered at positions −40 and −160 bp (large arrowheads), exhibited a broadened intervening footprint (for purposes of presentation, unless otherwise stated, the term NFκB will refer to the p50/p65 heterodimer). NFκB also created hypersensitive sites in flanking vector sequences in a region coincidentally exhibiting a 9/11 bp match to its consensus binding site (small arrowheads). It is significant that all of these sites are chromatin-specific and do not appear when these factors are complexed with naked DNA (Fig. 3 B), a point not addressed by the earlier study (27Pazin M.J. Sheridan P.L. Cannon K. Cao Z. Keck J.G. Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, if chromatin was first assembled in the absence of exogenous Sp1 and NFκB, the later addition of these factors induced the hypersensitive sites in an ATP-dependent fashion (Fig. 3 C, asterisks) (for purposes of presentation, when factors are added after chromatin assembly they are designated with asterisks). Although three different forms of NFκB (p50/p65, p50/p50, and p65/p65) each stimulate in vitro transcription from the HIV enhancer on naked DNA (37Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 38Kretzschmar M. Meisterernst M. Scheidereit C. Li G. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the p50/p50 form cannot activate transcription in vitro on chromatin templates (27Pazin M.J. Sheridan P.L. Cannon K. Cao Z. Keck J.G. Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, we found that all three of these forms of NFκB were active in forming DNase I-hypersensitive sites when added either before or after chromatin assembly, in the presence or absence of Sp1 (data not shown; see below). We also tested recombinant forms of other transcription factors (TBP, AP1(c-Jun), and Tat) and found that these proteins (either alone or in combination with Sp1 and NFκB) did not create any chromatin structural alterations (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). We conclude that Sp1 and NFκB are key players in chromatin remodeling within the HIV 5′-LTR in the Xenopus system just as they are in theDrosophila system (27Pazin M.J. Sheridan P.L. Cannon K. Cao Z. Keck J.G. Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To gain further evidence that Sp1 and NFκB must bind to their target sites in the HIV 5′-LTR to create hypersensitive sites, we repeated the experiments shown in Fig. 3 but with DNA constructs that possessed base substitution mutations in the corresponding binding sites known to inhibit transcription in vivo (29Harrich D. Garcia J.A. Mitsuyasu R. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4417-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 C). When DNA containing mutated Sp1-binding sites was mixed with Sp1 in the absence of NFκB and chromatin was assembled, hypersensitive sites characteristic for Sp1 binding were not induced (Fig. 4). However, as expected, NFκB was still able to create its characteristic hypersensitive sites in this mutant construct in the presence or absence of Sp1 (Fig. 4). When DNA containing mutated NFκB-binding sites was mixed with Sp1 and assembled into chromatin, the specific pattern of DNase I hypersensitivity characteristic for Sp1 was present but weaker as compared with that of the wild type control, suggesting that the GC-rich nature of wild type NFκB sites may help preserve Sp1 occupancy after chromatin assembly (Fig. 4). NFκB was still able to create weak hypersensitive sites spaced even broader than those characteristic for NFκB binding per se, even though its binding sites had been mutated, presumably because residual half-sites were still present in this mutant and secondary binding occurred through sequence similarities between NFκB and Sp1 binding sites (Fig. 4; see Fig. 1 C). Gel mobility experiments using a 66-mer duplex spanning these mutations verified that this sequence still had residual affinity to bind NFκB (data not shown). Interestingly, when both factors were combined with the construct carrying the mutated NFκB sites and chromatin was assembled, hypersensitive sites characteristic (although somewhat weaker) of the wild type construct were generated (Fig. 4). Apparently the known cooperative interactions between Sp1 and NFκB (39Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3551-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 40Perkins N.D. Agranoff A.B. Pascal E. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6570-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) leads to synergism in occupancy of the weakened binding sites. We also performed competition experiments with 33-mer duplex oligomers containing wild type NFκB- or Sp1-binding sites (or both). The presence of both competitors completely abolished the formation of these hypersensitive sites, while either alone ablated the formation of its target hypersensitive sites (data not shown). To investigate the possibility of rotational positioning of nucleosomal DNA on the surface of histone octamers as well as prove that Sp1 and NFκB actually target their binding sites in the LTR when added either before or after chromatin assembly, we separated DNase I digests on sequencing gels. When NFκB bound to naked DNA it protected from −109 to −77 nt corresponding to its two binding sites (non-coding strand), whereas Sp1 protected from −87 to −64 nt corresponding to the highest affinity binding site of the triplet array (41Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). Binding of both factors gave the expected additive footprint spanning from −109 to −64 nt, in either naked DNA or chromatin (Fig. 5, A andB). Very similar footprints were seen on chromatin substrates with the three different forms of NFκB whether the factors were added before or after nucleosome assembly (Fig. 5 B; data not shown). We conclude that these transcription factors can target their binding sites in chromatin. In contrast to the similarities in the footprinted regions in these factor binding sites between naked DNA and chromatin, the chromatin but not naked DNA samples exhibited approximately a 10-nt periodicity in DNase I cutting upstream of −220 nt (Fig. 5, B and C, closed circles), even in the absence of added factors, immediately adjacent to a short footprinted region spanning −205 to −220 nt (Fig.5, B and C, X), suggesting the presence of rotationally positioned nucleosomes. It is striking that this presumptive rotational positioning extends beyond the limits of the 5′-LTR (−454 nt) onto flanking vector sequences (Fig.5 C, closed ci"

Using hydrophobic cluster analysis, the catalytic domains of glycosyl hydrolases have been classified into 57 different enzyme families (3Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem.

Although calcium ions often play an important role in conferring structural stability on proteins, only two cellulases, a hybrid Bacillus glucanase and CelD fromClostridium thermocellum, have been shown to bind to Ca2+ and to both Ca2+ and Zn2+ions, respectively (8Keitel T.

The catalytic domain is unique within Family 10 enzymes as it is the only xylanase described to date which contains a calcium binding site (located in loop 7) (11Harris G.W. Jenkins J.A. Connerton I. Cummings N. Lo Leggio L. Scott M. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Gilbert H.J. Pickersgill R.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and it is the only xylanase from either mesophilic or thermophilic microorganisms which has been shown to be sensitive to proteinases (15Hall J. Ali S. Surani M.A. Hazlewood G.P. Clark A.J. Simmons J.P. Hirst B.H. Gilbert H.J. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The function(s) of the calcium binding domain in XYLA and the structural basis for the enzyme's sensitivity to proteinases remain to be elucidated.The objective of this report is to determine the role of the calcium binding domain in XYLA. The data presented show that occupation of the calcium binding loop with its ligand protected the enzyme from thermal inactivation, thermal unfolding, and proteolytic attack. A mutant of XYLA in which the key residues of the calcium binding domain were replaced by alanine exhibited thermal stability similar to that of XYLA complexed with Ca2+ ions; however, the xylanase variant was susceptible to cleavage by chymotrypsin. The role of the calcium binding domain in vivo and the possible mechanism by which the domain evolved are discussed.DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this paper showed that theK a of XYLA for calcium is 4.9 × 104m−1, which represents a relatively weak affinity compared with EF-hand calcium binding domains that bind their ligands with K a values of 105–109m−1 (29Seamon K.B. Kretsinger R.H. Spiro T.G. Calcium in Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1983: 3-51Google Scholar). The low affinity of XYLA for the divalent ion could reflect the environment of P. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa. The bacterium was isolated from soil samples of neutral pH in which Ca2+would be at a concentration >1 mm, sufficient to saturate XYLA (30Russell E.W. Wild A. Soil Conditions and Plant Growth. 11th Ed. Longman, London1988: 151Google Scholar). Inspection of the location of the calcium binding domain in the xylanase suggested that its structure may affect the catalytic properties of the enzyme as Tyr-255, which apparently forms part of subsite B, is positioned on the Ca2+ binding loop (11Harris G.W. Jenkins J.A. Connerton I. Cummings N. Lo Leggio L. Scott M. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Gilbert H.J. Pickersgill R.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the activity of the enzyme was not significantly influenced by either the disruption of the metal binding domain, through amino acid substitution or EDTA treatment, or saturation of the domain with its appropriate ligand. This suggests that either Tyr-255 does not play a pivotal role in xylose binding at site B, or the change in conformation of loop 7 through calcium binding does not influence the ability of the tyrosine residue to participate in substrate binding. It is also apparent that the conformational changes associated with calcium binding to loop 7, which influenced the biophysical properties of the enzyme, did not affect the structure of the extended substrate binding cleft.The binding of the calcium binding loop to its ligand caused a substantial effect on the biophysical properties of XYLA. The enzyme was less sensitive to thermal inactivation, which reflected a general increase in the stability of the protein, as evidenced by a considerable increase in the T m of XYLA in the presence of the divalent cation. These data are in agreement with several previous studies demonstrating that calcium stabilizes the structure of many proteins (9Chauvaux S. Souchon H. Alzari P.M. Chariot P. Beguin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9757-9762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Welfle K. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Politz O. Borriss R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 726-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substituting Asp-256 or Asn-261 for alanine resulted in a substantial destabilization of the enzyme, whereas the D262A mutation resulted in a modest reduction in the thermal stability of the enzyme. It could be argued that these data suggest that Asp-262 is the key residue involved in calcium binding; however, ligand binding assays clearly showed that replacing Asp-256, Asn-261, or Asp-262 with alanine resulted in no detectable affinity of the XYLA variants for the divalent cation. Interestingly, XYLA′′′, in which Asp-256, Asn-261, and Asp-262 had all been replaced with alanine, exhibited thermal stability similar to that of native XYLA bound to calcium. This could reflect the location of Asp-256, Asn-261, and Asp-262 in loop 7. The electronegative carbonyl group of Asn-261 and the negatively charged carboxylic groups of Asp-256 and Asp-262 would repulse each other, resulting in a destabilization of the loop. Either the binding of calcium to these amino acids or their replacement with alanine would prevent the repulsive effects from occurring, resulting in a stabilization of the loop and thus the whole protein. This view is consistent with the acid-pair hypothesis proposed by Reid and Hodges (31Reid R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Theor. Biol. 1980; 84: 401-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) which states that the Ca2+ affinity of EF-hand domains reflects an electrostatic compromise in which the attraction of divalent cations for anionic ligands, such as carboxylate groups, is counterbalanced by the interligand repulsion between coordinating oxygens. As D262A was more stable than D256A and N261A, it is likely that the major repulsive effects occur between Asp-262 and either Asp-256 or Asn-261.Data presented in this report demonstrate that the initial target for proteinase attack of XYLA is within the calcium binding domain in loop 7. It is likely, therefore, that the binding of calcium to this region tightens the conformation of the loop, making it less susceptible to enzymic cleavage. The transient nature of the 29-kDa peptide released by chymotrypsin suggests that hydrolysis of peptide bonds in the calcium binding loop caused a significant destabilization of the structure of XYLA, resulting in the very rapid subsequent hydrolysis of the molecule by the proteinase. In contrast to XYLA, XYLA′′′ was susceptible to proteinase attack in the presence and absence of calcium. These data suggest that the calcium binding loop in XYLA′′′ is more flexible than in the native enzyme (when complexed with its ligand), making it more accessible to proteinase cleavage.From the discussion above, it is apparent that the major role of the calcium binding domain in XYLA is to stabilize the extended structure of loop 7, either against thermal unfolding or proteinase attack. As Ca2+ only protects XYLA from thermal inactivation at temperatures above 55 °C, and the natural habitat ofPseudomonas is normally at a temperature lower than 30 °C, it is unlikely that the enhanced thermal stability afforded by calcium plays an important role in the survival of XYLA. We propose that the major function of the calcium binding domain of the xylanase is to protect the enzyme from proteinase attack. This view is supported by the unusual stability of other xylanases, from both mesophilic and thermophilic microorganisms, to proteolytic attack (7Fontes C.M.G. Hall J. Hirst B.H. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 43: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that this property exerts a strong selection pressure on the evolution of xylanases.To date only 5 of the 28 known Family 10 xylanases contain an extended loop 7. Although inspection of the extended loop in XYLA,Prevotella ruminicola XYLA (XYNA PRERU), Bacteroides ovatus XYLA (XYNA BACOV), and Bacillus stearothermophilus XYLN1 and XYN2 (XYN1 BACST and XYN2 BACST, respectively) did not reveal motifs, such as the EF-hand, which are characteristic of calcium binding domains, it is apparent that loop 7 in XYLA did bind to the divalent metal ion. As XYN1 and 2 BACST function at elevated temperatures, and XYNA PRERU and XYNA BACOV in environments that contain high levels of proteinase activity, it is likely that loop 7 in these xylanases is stabilized, possibly though interactions with metal ions or other sequences within the respective proteins. The central unanswered questions are why do only 5 Family 10 xylanases contain an extended loop 7, and how did the calcium binding domain in XYLA evolve? Loop 7 may confer specific catalytic properties on the enzyme. However, the observation that the biochemical characteristics of XYLA are not altered when the extended loop is replaced with the corresponding shorter loop from Cex argues against this view. It is possible that the ancestral protein that gave rise to Family 10 xylanases contained an extended loop 7 that destabilized the protein, and through natural selection deletions within the loop have resulted in the evolution of stable xylanases. Mutations in loop 7 of the ancestral sequence, which gave rise to XYLA, generated a calcium binding domain that stabilized the loop, hence there was no requirement for the loop to be reduced in size in the Pseudomonasenzyme. An alternative possibility is that the extended loop 7, in 5 of the 28 Family 10 xylanases, is the result of a DNA insertion into a DNA sequence that gave rise to the genes encoding the 5 enzymes. InxynA the inserted DNA subsequently acquired mutations such that it encoded a calcium binding domain in XYLA. To explore this hypothesis further, the primary structure of Family 10 xylanases were subject to phylogenetic analysis using parsimony methods. Initially, all sequence positions (410) were included in the analysis, which suggested a relationship between the xylanases containing the extended loop 7 (data not shown). To remove any bias due to the inclusion of extended loop 7 in the alignments, the corresponding sequence positions were removed and the analysis repeated (Fig. 10). It is interesting that the relationship between 4 of the 5 xylanases is maintained, indicating that the respective genes have evolved from a common ancestral sequence that contained a DNA insertion in the region encoding loop 7. However, this conclusion must be viewed with some caution as it is apparent that there has been considerable horizontal gene transfer between Family 10 xylanase genes (evidenced by the fact that very similar sequences occur in taxonomically diverse groups of organisms), and the bootstrap scores suggest that some clades are not particularly stable. Based on the relationship between thePseudomonas xylanase (XYNA PSEFL) and the clade containing the actinomycete (GUX CELFI and XYNA STRLI) and fungal (XYNA PENCH, GUNF FUSOX, and XYNA PENCH) xylanases, one might hypothesize that the latter had evolved, following loss of the extended loop 7, from XYNA PSEFL. However, additional sequence information from this region of the tree is needed to validate this hypothesis.To conclude, data presented in this report clearly showed that the extended loop 7 of Pseudomonas XYLA was stabilized by a calcium binding loop. Whether the corresponding extended loops of XYNA PRERU, XYNA BACOV, XYN1 BACST, and XYN2 BACST are also stabilized by binding to divalent metal ions, remains to be elucidated.

Structure. 1994; 2: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and it is the only xylanase from either mesophilic or thermophilic microorganisms which has been shown to be sensitive to proteinases (15Hall J. Ali S. Surani M.A. Hazlewood G.P. Clark A.J. Simmons J.P. Hirst B.H. Gilbert H.J. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The function(s) of the calcium binding domain in XYLA and the structural basis for the enzyme's sensitivity to proteinases remain to be elucidated. The objective of this report is to determine the role of the calcium binding domain in XYLA. The data presented show that occupation of the calcium binding loop with its ligand protected the enzyme from thermal inactivation, thermal unfolding, and proteolytic attack. A mutant of XYLA in which the key residues of the calcium binding domain were replaced by alanine exhibited thermal stability similar to that of XYLA complexed with Ca2+ ions; however, the xylanase variant was susceptible to cleavage by chymotrypsin. The role of the calcium binding domain in vivo and the possible mechanism by which the domain evolved are discussed. DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this paper showed that theK a of XYLA for calcium is 4.9 × 104m−1, which represents a relatively weak affinity compared with EF-hand calcium binding domains that bind their ligands with K a values of 105–109m−1 (29Seamon K.B. Kretsinger R.H. Spiro T.G. Calcium in Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1983: 3-51Google Scholar). The low affinity of XYLA for the divalent ion could reflect the environment of P. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa. The bacterium was isolated from soil samples of neutral pH in which Ca2+would be at a concentration >1 mm, sufficient to saturate XYLA (30Russell E.W. Wild A. Soil Conditions and Plant Growth. 11th Ed. Longman, London1988: 151Google Scholar). Inspection of the location of the calcium binding domain in the xylanase suggested that its structure may affect the catalytic properties of the enzyme as Tyr-255, which apparently forms part of subsite B, is positioned on the Ca2+ binding loop (11Harris G.W. Jenkins J.A. Connerton I. Cummings N. Lo Leggio L. Scott M. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Gilbert H.J. Pickersgill R.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the activity of the enzyme was not significantly influenced by either the disruption of the metal binding domain, through amino acid substitution or EDTA treatment, or saturation of the domain with its appropriate ligand. This suggests that either Tyr-255 does not play a pivotal role in xylose binding at site B, or the change in conformation of loop 7 through calcium binding does not influence the ability of the tyrosine residue to participate in substrate binding. It is also apparent that the conformational changes associated with calcium binding to loop 7, which influenced the biophysical properties of the enzyme, did not affect the structure of the extended substrate binding cleft.The binding of the calcium binding loop to its ligand caused a substantial effect on the biophysical properties of XYLA. The enzyme was less sensitive to thermal inactivation, which reflected a general increase in the stability of the protein, as evidenced by a considerable increase in the T m of XYLA in the presence of the divalent cation. These data are in agreement with several previous studies demonstrating that calcium stabilizes the structure of many proteins (9Chauvaux S. Souchon H. Alzari P.M. Chariot P. Beguin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9757-9762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Welfle K. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Politz O. Borriss R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 726-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substituting Asp-256 or Asn-261 for alanine resulted in a substantial destabilization of the enzyme, whereas the D262A mutation resulted in a modest reduction in the thermal stability of the enzyme. It could be argued that these data suggest that Asp-262 is the key residue involved in calcium binding; however, ligand binding assays clearly showed that replacing Asp-256, Asn-261, or Asp-262 with alanine resulted in no detectable affinity of the XYLA variants for the divalent cation. Interestingly, XYLA′′′, in which Asp-256, Asn-261, and Asp-262 had all been replaced with alanine, exhibited thermal stability similar to that of native XYLA bound to calcium. This could reflect the location of Asp-256, Asn-261, and Asp-262 in loop 7. The electronegative carbonyl group of Asn-261 and the negatively charged carboxylic groups of Asp-256 and Asp-262 would repulse each other, resulting in a destabilization of the loop. Either the binding of calcium to these amino acids or their replacement with alanine would prevent the repulsive effects from occurring, resulting in a stabilization of the loop and thus the whole protein. This view is consistent with the acid-pair hypothesis proposed by Reid and Hodges (31Reid R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Theor. Biol. 1980; 84: 401-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) which states that the Ca2+ affinity of EF-hand domains reflects an electrostatic compromise in which the attraction of divalent cations for anionic ligands, such as carboxylate groups, is counterbalanced by the interligand repulsion between coordinating oxygens. As D262A was more stable than D256A and N261A, it is likely that the major repulsive effects occur between Asp-262 and either Asp-256 or Asn-261.Data presented in this report demonstrate that the initial target for proteinase attack of XYLA is within the calcium binding domain in loop 7. It is likely, therefore, that the binding of calcium to this region tightens the conformation of the loop, making it less susceptible to enzymic cleavage. The transient nature of the 29-kDa peptide released by chymotrypsin suggests that hydrolysis of peptide bonds in the calcium binding loop caused a significant destabilization of the structure of XYLA, resulting in the very rapid subsequent hydrolysis of the molecule by the proteinase. In contrast to XYLA, XYLA′′′ was susceptible to proteinase attack in the presence and absence of calcium. These data suggest that the calcium binding loop in XYLA′′′ is more flexible than in the native enzyme (when complexed with its ligand), making it more accessible to proteinase cleavage.From the discussion above, it is apparent that the major role of the calcium binding domain in XYLA is to stabilize the extended structure of loop 7, either against thermal unfolding or proteinase attack. As Ca2+ only protects XYLA from thermal inactivation at temperatures above 55 °C, and the natural habitat ofPseudomonas is normally at a temperature lower than 30 °C, it is unlikely that the enhanced thermal stability afforded by calcium plays an important role in the survival of XYLA. We propose that the major function of the calcium binding domain of the xylanase is to protect the enzyme from proteinase attack. This view is supported by the unusual stability of other xylanases, from both mesophilic and thermophilic microorganisms, to proteolytic attack (7Fontes C.M.G. Hall J. Hirst B.H. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 43: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that this property exerts a strong selection pressure on the evolution of xylanases.To date only 5 of the 28 known Family 10 xylanases contain an extended loop 7. Although inspection of the extended loop in XYLA,Prevotella ruminicola XYLA (XYNA PRERU), Bacteroides ovatus XYLA (XYNA BACOV), and Bacillus stearothermophilus XYLN1 and XYN2 (XYN1 BACST and XYN2 BACST, respectively) did not reveal motifs, such as the EF-hand, which are characteristic of calcium binding domains, it is apparent that loop 7 in XYLA did bind to the divalent metal ion. As XYN1 and 2 BACST function at elevated temperatures, and XYNA PRERU and XYNA BACOV in environments that contain high levels of proteinase activity, it is likely that loop 7 in these xylanases is stabilized, possibly though interactions with metal ions or other sequences within the respective proteins. The central unanswered questions are why do only 5 Family 10 xylanases contain an extended loop 7, and how did the calcium binding domain in XYLA evolve? Loop 7 may confer specific catalytic properties on the enzyme. However, the observation that the biochemical characteristics of XYLA are not altered when the extended loop is replaced with the corresponding shorter loop from Cex argues against this view. It is possible that the ancestral protein that gave rise to Family 10 xylanases contained an extended loop 7 that destabilized the protein, and through natural selection deletions within the loop have resulted in the evolution of stable xylanases. Mutations in loop 7 of the ancestral sequence, which gave rise to XYLA, generated a calcium binding domain that stabilized the loop, hence there was no requirement for the loop to be reduced in size in the Pseudomonasenzyme. An alternative possibility is that the extended loop 7, in 5 of the 28 Family 10 xylanases, is the result of a DNA insertion into a DNA sequence that gave rise to the genes encoding the 5 enzymes. InxynA the inserted DNA subsequently acquired mutations such that it encoded a calcium binding domain in XYLA. To explore this hypothesis further, the primary structure of Family 10 xylanases were subject to phylogenetic analysis using parsimony methods. Initially, all sequence positions (410) were included in the analysis, which suggested a relationship between the xylanases containing the extended loop 7 (data not shown). To remove any bias due to the inclusion of extended loop 7 in the alignments, the corresponding sequence positions were removed and the analysis repeated (Fig. 10). It is interesting that the relationship between 4 of the 5 xylanases is maintained, indicating that the respective genes have evolved from a common ancestral sequence that contained a DNA insertion in the region encoding loop 7. However, this conclusion must be viewed with some caution as it is apparent that there has been considerable horizontal gene transfer between Family 10 xylanase genes (evidenced by the fact that very similar sequences occur in taxonomically diverse groups of organisms), and the bootstrap scores suggest that some clades are not particularly stable. Based on the relationship between thePseudomonas xylanase (XYNA PSEFL) and the clade containing the actinomycete (GUX CELFI and XYNA STRLI) and fungal (XYNA PENCH, GUNF FUSOX, and XYNA PENCH) xylanases, one might hypothesize that the latter had evolved, following loss of the extended loop 7, from XYNA PSEFL. However, additional sequence information from this region of the tree is needed to validate this hypothesis.To conclude, data presented in this report clearly showed that the extended loop 7 of Pseudomonas XYLA was stabilized by a calcium binding loop. Whether the corresponding extended loops of XYNA PRERU, XYNA BACOV, XYN1 BACST, and XYN2 BACST are also stabilized by binding to divalent metal ions, remains to be elucidated. The data presented in this paper showed that theK a of XYLA for calcium is 4.9 × 104m−1, which represents a relatively weak affinity compared with EF-hand calcium binding domains that bind their ligands with K a values of 105–109m−1 (29Seamon K.B.

MYC-MAX heterodimers stimulate transcription, whereas MAX homodimers, or heterodimers between MAX and members of the MAD family of basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper proteins, repress transcription. Max exists in two major isomeric forms, MAX(L) and MAX(S), which differ from one another only by a 9-amino acid insertion/deletion. We show here that MAX(L) is much more effective at homodimeric DNA binding than MAX(S). In NIH3T3 cells, MAX(L) was able to repress a c-Myc-responsive reporter gene whereas MAX(S) either stimulated the reporter gene or had little effect on its expression. In comparison to control cell lines or those stably over-expressing MAX(S), MAX(L)-over-expressing cell lines showed reduced expression of transiently expressed or endogenous c-Myc responsive genes, grew more slowly, possessed a higher growth factor requirement, and showed accelerated apoptosis following growth factor deprivation. Differential effects on growth and apoptosis represent two previously unrecognized properties of MAX proteins. These can at least partly be explained by the differences in their DNA binding abilities and their effects on target gene expression.

However, at lower concentrations and within cells, c-MYC homodimerization does not occur to any detectable degree (14Dang C.V. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Resar L.M.S. Kato G.J. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell.

Several model systems have demonstrated that the expression of such genes is directly dependent upon the levels of c-MYC-MAX heterodimers and inversely dependent upon the levels of MAX (8Amin C.

Alternate mRNA splicing produces two major MAX isoforms, the shorter of which (MAX(S)) is a 151-amino acid polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; IL, interleukin.

The longer form MAX(L) is a 160-amino acid, 22-kDa polypeptide, identical to MAX(S) except for a 9-amino acid insert between residues 12 and 13. Both proteins, and their respective transcripts, are expressed at approximately equal levels in most cell types examined and, unlike c-MYC, are highly stable and unresponsive to the proliferative state of the cell (23Blackwood E. Luscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 30Arsura M. Deshpande A. Hann S.R. Sonnenshein G.E. Mol. Cell.

Both MAX isoforms are highly conserved between humans and such lower species as chickens, Xenopus, and zebrafish (32Schreiber-Agus N. Chin L. Chen K. Torres R. Rao G. Guida P. Skoultchi A.I. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 777-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 33Sollenberger K.G. Kao T.-L. Taparowsky E.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 661-664PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known regarding how the two MAX proteins differ from one another functionally, as most studies have been performed with only one of the two isoforms and/or have been of restricted biological scope. These studies are also difficult to compare as they have utilized different types of expression vectors, growth conditions, and biochemical and biological read-outs. Recent work has also emphasized the seemingly contradictory results of c-MYC reporter gene assays that can occur due to differences in cell density at the time of transfection (34Lee L.A. Resar L.M.S. Dang C.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 900-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that MAX(L) and MAX(S) differ significantly in their DNA binding abilities (35Prochownik E.V. Van Antwerp M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Using several synthetic oligonucleotides whose c-MYC binding sites differed only in their flanking regions, we showed that, in all cases, MAX(L) bound >20-fold more strongly to these sites than MAX(S). However, we could not absolutely rule out that these differences were, at least in part, the consequence of amino-terminal hexahistidine tags that had been introduced to facilitate purification of the recombinant, bacterially expressed proteins. In the present study, we have compared the abilities of full-length, unmodified MAX(L) and MAX(S) to bind DNA and to modulate transiently transfected and endogenous c-MYC-responsive genes. We have also examined the effects of the two proteins on proliferation, growth factor requirement, and apoptosis in two different cell lines. We find that MAX(L) and MAX(S) differ markedly from one another in their abilities to affect these cellular properties. Because not all of the observed effects appear to be the result of the antagonism of c-MYC-MAX heterodimers, our results suggest that, depending upon the identity of the expressed isoform, as well as on its biological context, MAX proteins can either enhance or oppose many of the known activities of c-MYC. Because MAX plays a central role in both the positive and negative regulation of c-Myc activity, such opposing effects may provide a more sensitive control over this process. MAX cDNAs were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: forward, 5′-CGC TCA TGA GCG ATA ACG ATG ACA TC-3′ reverse, 5′-GCG CAA GCT TGC CTG CCC CGA GTG GCT TAG-3′. In the former case, the italics denote “GC clamps” andNcoI-compatible BspHI sites that were added to facilitate cloning into the NcoI site of the QE60 vector (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Following this, cloned cDNAs were sequenced to confirm their identity. The cloning step permitted the expression of IPTG-inducible, full-length, non-hexahistidine-tagged MAX proteins in the pREP4 Escherichia coli strain (Qiagen). Cultures were induced for 4–6 h with IPTG (final concentration 1 mm) at which time the bacteria were concentrated by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and lysed by three rounds of freeze-thawing and sonication in 2 × binding buffer (35Prochownik E.V. Van Antwerp M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that, for MAX(L), consisted of 100 mm KCl; 40 mmHepes, pH 6.5; 2 mm EDTA; 2 mm dithiothreitol; 10% glycerol plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma); and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim). For MAX(S), the identical buffer was used except it's pH was adjusted to 7.6. Following clarification of each lysate at 10,000 × g for 10 min, a portion of the supernatant (“crude lysate”) was used directly in DNA binding assays after adjusting for differences in MAX protein content using the pH 7.6 binding buffer. The remainder of the supernatant was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with the above pH 6.5 or pH 7.6 2 × binding buffer. MAX(L) and MAX(S) proteins were eluted with a stepwise KCl gradient, dialyzed against pH 7.6 2 × binding buffer, and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Hexahistidine-tagged N-Myc protein (35Prochownik E.V. Van Antwerp M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography essentially to homogeneity and dialyzed against 2 × binding buffer. Preliminary control experiments indicated that the different pH values used to bind MAX(L) and MAX(S) to DEAE-cellulose did not influence their DNA binding properties following their adjustment to pH 7.6 (not shown). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described (35Prochownik E.V. Van Antwerp M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using 50 ng of each purified protein or approximately 200 ng of crude bacterial lysate, equivalent to 20–50 ng of MAX. 5 μl of each protein was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 5 μl of 2 × binding buffer containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and 10,000 dpm of the 32P-end-labeled, double-stranded EO(GAC) oligonucleotide containing a single c-MYC consensus binding site (specific activity approximately 108dpm/μg). Bound and free labeled complexes were resolved at room temperature on native 4% polyacrylamide gels in 1 × TBE buffer as described (35Prochownik E.V. Van Antwerp M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). cDNA inserts for c-Myc (1.5-kilobase XhoI fragment, Ref. 36Stanton L.W. Fahrlander P.D. Tesser P.M. Marcu K.B. Nature. 1984; 310: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), MAX(L), and MAX(S) (16Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar) were excised from their parental vectors and cloned into the XhoI site of the pSVLneo vector. This was derived from the pSVL vector (Pharmacia) by inserting into the uniqueEcoRI site a 2.5-kilobase EcoRI-linkered DNA fragment containing the neomycin resistance gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter (37Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar). The p3xMyc-E1b-luc wild-type and p0Myc-E1b-luc mutant c-Myc reporter plasmid (11Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) were kind gifts from Dr. Roger Davis. The pSV2−βgal plasmid was routinely included in all transfections to control for transfection efficiency. Plasmid DNAs were purified using a standard alkaline lysis method followed by two cycles of purification by CsCl/ethidium bromide equilibrium centrifugation. NIH3T3 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 10% supplemented calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). The 32D clone 3 murine myeloid cell line and the WEHI-238 murine B cell line were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as described above except that fetal calf serum was substituted for supplemented calf serum. In addition, the medium used for 32D cell growth was supplemented with 10% (v/v) conditioned medium obtained from the IL-3-producing WEHI-238 cell line. For transient expression assays, NIH3T3 cells were transfected using a standard calcium-phosphate-based procedure (38Apel I. Yu C.L. Wang T. Dobry C. Van Antwerp M.E. Jove R. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3356-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cultures were routinely plated at 5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish, transfected the following day, and harvested 2 days later for the assay of β-galactosidase and luciferase (Analytical Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI). Stable NIH3T3 transfectants were obtained using the above procedure except that 2 days after transfection, the monolayers were split 1:5 and cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml G-418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Individual G-418-resistant clones were isolated using glass cloning cylinders. To obtain stably transfected 32D clones, 2 × 107cells were collected by low speed centrifugation, washed twice in tissue culture medium containing IL-3 and fetal calf serum, and resuspended in 0.3 ml of the same medium. 10 μg ofNdeI-linearized vector DNA in 25 μl of water was added. Electroporation was carried out in a 0.4-cm disposable cuvette (Bio-Rad) using a Bio-Rad apparatus set at 300 V and a capacitance extender set at 960 microfarads. Following electroporation, cells were incubated on ice for 10 min before being replated in standard IL-3 containing medium. Two days later G-418 was added to a final concentration of 400 μg/ml and maintained continuously. G-418-resistant clones were generally observed after about 2 weeks. Pooled cells representing at least several hundred independent clones were used for all experiments. NIH3T3 cell monolayers (approximately 80% confluency) were washed in methionine + cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (ICN Biomedical, Costa Mesa, CA). The medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of the same medium containing 100 μCi of35S-Translabel (ICN, specific activity 1.21 Ci/mmol) for 6 h. The monolayers were then washed exhaustively in ice-cold PBS and collected in 1 ml of standard RIPA buffer containing the same protease inhibitors as used for bacterial cultures (see above). Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C, 2 × 107 dpm of lysate supernatant in a total volume of 1 ml of RIPA buffer was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with a rabbit polyclonal anti-human MAX antibody at a final dilution of 1:300. Antigen-antibody complexes were removed by the addition of 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Bio-Rad) for an additional 2 h. Precipitates were washed three times in RIPA buffer, disrupted in loading buffer, and resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). 32D cells were processed in an identical manner except that labeling was performed following the resuspension of 5 × 106 cells in 1 ml of methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium containing 100 μCi of Translabel. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed in PBS, and fixed in 1 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol for at least 1 h. The cells were pelleted twice in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 100 μg/ml RNase A and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Cell cycle analyses were performed on a Becton-Dickinson FACSTAR fluorescence-activated cell sorter. 20,000 cells were analyzed for each assay with quantitation of cell cycle parameters being performed using single histogram statistics. 32D cells were cultured at 3 × 104 cells/ml in 30 ml of IL-3-supplemented medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h later, the cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in the above medium minus IL-3. Aliquots of cells were removed at timed intervals, and the fraction of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. To evaluate the integrity of DNA, cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.1 m EDTA; 0.5% SDS, 20 μg/ml RNase A, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K). After incubating at 37 °C for 4 h overnight, the lysates were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. DNA was redissolved in water and 10 μg was electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel. NIH3T3 cells were plated at 105 cells/ml and maintained in log-phase growth for 2 days. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, scraped into conical centrifuge tubes, and pelleted at 1,000 × g for 10 min. ODC assays, using 200 μg of cellular extract, were performed as described (39Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5741-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) except that an incubation period of 2 h was used. We previously demonstrated that bacterially expressed MAX(L) binds strongly to a c-Myc binding site, whereas MAX(S) shows little detectable binding (35Prochownik E.V. Van Antwerp M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In these experiments, however, each protein was expressed as a hexahistidine fusion to facilitate its purification, and it was therefore formally possible that these extraneous amino acids altered the DNA binding properties. To address this, we expressed both MAX proteins as non-fusion polypeptides in E. coli. Examination of IPTG-induced E. coli lysates by SDS-PAGE showed that MAX accounted for approximately 25% of the total protein. Following purification by DEAE-cellulose chromatography under non-denaturing conditions, MAX proteins were tested for their ability to bind the above c-Myc site. MAX(L) bound the labeled oligonucleotide strongly, whereas binding by the equivalent amount of MAX(S) was barely detectable (Fig. 1 A). This effect was not due to an inadvertent loss of DNA binding ability by MAX(S) during its purification as it retained the ability to bind the probe in association with purified N-Myc protein (lane 4). The differences in DNA binding by the two MAX proteins were also apparent prior to purification (Fig. 1 B). In some experiments, and at higher protein concentrations, we have observed some DNA binding by MAX(S), but it has always been at least 20-fold less than seen with a comparable amount of MAX(L). These results, with both purified and crude MAX proteins, confirmed our previous observations (35Prochownik E.V. Van Antwerp M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and indicated that the observed differences in DNA binding were not the artifactual result of changes in polypeptide structure.Figure 1DNA binding by purified and crude MAX proteins. MAX proteins were produced as unmodified, full-length polypeptides in E. coli using the QE-60 expression vector (Qiagen). MAX proteins were purified from IPTG-induced cultures by non-denaturing DEAE-cellulose chromatography to yield individual MAX proteins of >90% purity (A) or were used directly from crude bacterial lysates of approximately 25% purity (B). N-MYC was produced as a hexahistidine fusion protein (50Prochownik E.V. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Rodgers C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3683-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and purified using nickel-agarose chromatography. Each protein (approximately 20 ng) was tested for DNA binding with the 32P-labeled double-stranded, palindromic EO(GAC) oligonucleotide (50Prochownik E.V. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Rodgers C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3683-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) using non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A, MAX(L) showed strong binding to the 32-P-labeled probe (lane 2), whereas MAX(S) bound poorly (lane 3). The ability of MAX(S) to dimerize with purified N-MYC and bind the probe (lane 4) indicated that MAX(S) was in an active state. Similar results were obtained with crude extracts of the proteins (B), indicating that the differences in DNA binding were not related to protein purification. Lane 2 shows the absence of MAX(L) DNA binding activity in crude extracts of uninduced E. coli.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The observed differences in DNA binding by MAX(L) and MAX(S) in vitrosuggested that the two proteins might have dissimilar effects on a c-Myc-responsive reporter gene in vivo. We tested this idea using transient transfections in NIH3T3 cells. In the first series of experiments, a constant amount of a c-Myc responsive reporter construct (11Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was co-transfected with increasing amounts of either a MAX(L) or MAX(S) expression vector. We assumed that the basal expression of luciferase activity by the reporter in the absence of any other co-transfected plasmids at least partly reflected the levels of endogenous c-Myc and MAX protein activities in these cells. As seen in Fig. 2 A, MAX(L) suppressed luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with the idea that at high DNA concentrations, MAX(L) homodimers predominate over c-Myc-MAX heterodimers, compete for c-Myc binding sites, and repress reporter gene transcription (10Gu W. Cechova K. Tassi V. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2935-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The small amount of residual luciferase activity seen at the highest MAX(L) concentrations probably represents the c-Myc/MAX-independent activity of the core E1b promoter. In contrast, co-transfected MAX(S) resulted in an increase in reporter gene activity which, at the highest concentrations tested, was 3–4-fold over basal levels. At these concentrations the differences between MAX(L) and MAX(S) were over 7-fold. This observation suggested that high concentrations MAX(S) allowed its heterodimerization with endogenous c-Myc, resulting in an increase in the number of transcriptionally active c-Myc-MAX heterodimers. However, once all available c-Myc was dimerized, further increases in MAX(S) were unable to repress transcription. This is consistent with the weak DNA binding activity of MAX(S) protein purified from E. coli (Fig.1). We next tested the effect of expression of each MAX isoform on reporter gene expression in the presence of co-expressed c-Myc. As shown in Fig.2 B, c-Myc alone stimulated reporter gene activity an average of 4-fold, consistent with the degree of activation reported by many other groups (8Amin C. Wagner A.J. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Gu W. Cechova K. Tassi V. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

With increasing amounts of the co-transfected MAX(S) expression plasmid, only minimal (1.5–2 fold) additional stimulation of the reporter was observed. In contrast, the transfection of the MAX(L) expression plasmid resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in reporter gene expression of up to 8-fold. The difference between MAX(L) and MAX(S) at the highest concentrations examined was over 10-fold. These results were consistent with those presented in Fig. 2 A and indicated that, under the conditions employed for these experiments, MAX(S) was stimulatory whereas MAX(L) was generally inhibitory toward c-Myc reporter genes. Similar results were observed with a CAT reporter construct driven by an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) promoter, a known physiologic c-Myc target (9Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7804-7809Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) (not shown). In control experiments, no regulation by c-Myc or MAX was seen in transient transfections employing either E1b-luciferase or ODC-CAT vectors containing absent or mutant c-M"
https://openalex.org/W2090432837,"Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is a 42-amino acid gastrointestinal regulatory peptide that, in the presence of glucose, stimulates insulin secretion. GIP is expressed in K cells of the small intestine and in cells of the submandibular salivary gland. Using a rat GIP cDNA as a specific probe, we screened a number of established cell lines for the expression of GIP mRNA. STC-1 cells, a cell line derived from a mouse neuroendocrine tumor, were found to express high levels of GIP mRNA. GIP-specific transcripts were not detected in other cell lines tested, which included cells of intestinal, salivary, and endocrine origin. Analysis of GIP-luciferase fusions identified two promoters, a distal and a proximal promoter, upstream of the translation initiation codon for GIP. The distal promoter, located upstream of position +1, corresponds to the principal promoter of the GIP gene and can promote cell-specific transcription. Sequential deletion and site-directed mutational analysis of the distal promoter demonstrated that the sequence between −193 and −182 determines cell-specific expression of GIP. Contained in this region is a consensus GATA motif, suggesting that a member of the GATA family of DNA-binding proteins is involved in the cell-specific regulation of the GIP gene.

Pederson R.A. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1970; 5: 537-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of GIP was described in 1971 (2Brown J.C. Dryburgh J.R. Can. J. Biochem. 1971; 49: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and its amino acid sequence placed it in the secretin family of gastrointestinal regulatory peptides.

Moreover, subsequent studies of the physiological properties of GIP demonstrated that, in addition to its inhibitory effects in the stomach, when GIP is administered in physiological doses, the peptide is a potent stimulator of insulin release by pancreatic β-cells.

Thus, it has been suggested that GIP may function as an incretin, the proposed substance that mediates the enteroinsular axis and plays a physiological role in maintaining glucose homeostasis (14Brown J.C. Otte S.C. Diabetes. 1978; 27: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, the cDNAs encoding human and rat GIP have been isolated from libraries prepared from duodenal RNA (15Takeda J. Seino Y. Tanaka K.-I. Fukumoto H. Kayano T. Takahashi H. Mitani T. Kurono M.

A. 1993; 90: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Using the rat cDNA as a specific probe, Northern hybridization analysis has demonstrated GIP expression in both the rat small intestine and salivary gland (17Tseng C.-C. Jarboe L.A. Landau S.B. Williams E.K. Wolfe M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the small intestine, GIP mRNA levels were highest in the duodenum and jejunum, with lower concentrations detected in the ileum. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that glucose and fat induce GIP gene expression (18Tseng C.-C. Jarboe L.A. Wolfe M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G887-G891PubMed Google Scholar, 19Higashimoto Y. Liddle R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 110C: 207-214Google Scholar). Despite these findings, little is known about the regulatory factors that control the cell-specific and the nutrient-regulated expression of the GIP gene. One reason for this lack of information is the inability to adequately purify populations of GIP-producing K cells, which are scattered throughout the small intestinal mucosa. Therefore, the characterization of the factors that regulate GIP expression, includingcis-acting elements in the promoter/enhancer regions, requires the identification of surrogate cell lines that can be used as a model for in vitro studies. STC-1 cells are an intestinal cell line derived by Rindi et al. (20Rindi G. Grant S.G.N. Yiangou Y. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. Bautch V.L. Solcia E. Polak J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1349-1363PubMed Google Scholar) from transgenic mice expressing viral oncogenes under the control of the insulin promoter. Immunochemical analysis has demonstrated GIP staining in these cells (21Kieffer T.J. Huang Z. McIntosh C.H.S. Buchan A.M.J. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E316-E322PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we use Northern analysis to identify a GIP-specific transcript that has the same electrophoretic mobility as that observed in rat intestinal tissue. In addition, we describe the cloning of the 5′-flanking region of the rat GIP gene and the characterization of the transcriptional activity of these sequences in the neuroendocrine cell line STC-1. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Kingston, MA). STC-1 cells (mouse endocrine) were kindly provided by Dr. D. Hanahan (University of California at San Francisco, CA), Rin5AH cells (rat insulinoma) were a gift from Dr. Å. Lernmark (University of Washington, Seattle, WA), and L cells (mouse connective tissue) were kindly donated by Dr. T. B. Usdin (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD). NIH 3T3 (NIH Swiss mouse embryo), SCA-9 (mouse submandibular gland), HS124 (human sublingual gland), GH4 (rat pituitary), HIT T15 (Syrian hamster β cell), and 407 (human embryonic intestine) cells were purchased from the American Type Tissue Collection (Bethesda, MD). STC-1, SCA-9, HS124, GH4, and Rin5AH cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% calf serum, and 407 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum. HIT cells were grown in modified Ham's F12K media with 12.5% calf serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. All cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in media containing 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cells were grown to 80% confluence, after which medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to RNA isolation. Intestinal mucosa was prepared for RNA extraction by surgically removing an 8–10-cm segment of duodenum immediately distal to the pylorus and scraping the mucosa with a glass slide. Total RNA from duodenal mucosa or STC-1 cells was extracted using the acid/phenol method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162 (2nd ed.): 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62897) Google Scholar). Northern hybridization analysis was done as described previously, using the EcoRI fragment of the rat GIP cDNA (17Tseng C.-C. Jarboe L.A. Landau S.B. Williams E.K. Wolfe M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) radiolabeled with [α-32P]deoxycytidine triphosphate. A rat genomic λ DASH® library, purchased from Strategene, was screened by plaque hybridization with the rat GIP cDNA clone, as described previously (17Tseng C.-C. Jarboe L.A. Landau S.B. Williams E.K. Wolfe M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The hybridization was carried out using standard methods (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA from two positive clones was digested with a variety of enzymes and subjected to Southern analysis using the oligonucleotide 5′-GCCAACAGCTCTTCTTAGCT-3′, which is complementary to the 5′-untranslated region immediately upstream from the ATG codon, as a GIP-specific probe. Two overlapping restriction fragments, a 2.8-kilobase pair (kbp) BamHI-HindIII fragment and a 5.9-kbp SacI fragment, were identified and subcloned into pBSKII+ (Strategene) to form the plasmids pBSBH and pBSSac3, respectively (Fig. 1 A). The 5′-flanking region was then sequenced using double-stranded template and synthetic oligonucleotides. The promoterless plasmid pGL2-basic (Promega, Madison, WI), containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene, was used to examine the transcriptional regulation of the GIP gene. Two series of chimeric clones were constructed (Fig.1, B and C). In the first series, which included pGL-943, pGL-425, pGL-397, pGL-363, pGL-259, pGL-203, pGL193, pGL-182, pGL-173, and pGL-143, all constructs contained GIP-specific inserts with the same 3′-end, a BstYI site at base pair +8 in exon 1, ligated to the BglII site in the pGL2-basic polycloning region. In the second series, which included pGL-943i, pGL-778i, pGL-425i, pGL-397i, pGL-363i, pGL-182i, and pGL+111i, the GIP-specific inserts extended 3′ to include sequences for intron 1. Each of these clones ends with the AluI site at base pair +781, ligated to an EcoRV site that was placed immediately in front of the HindIII site in the polycloning region of pGL2-basic. GIP promoter-specific primers containing various base substitutions were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction using forward primers with the following sequences: 5′-GGGGTACCCAGATGACACTGCAGATACCCAAA-3′ (mut1), 5′-GGGGTACCCAAAAAACACTGCAGATACCCAAA-3′ (mut2), 5′-GGGGTACCCAGATGACACTGCAGAAAAACCCAAA-3′ (mut3), and 5′-GGGGTACCCAAAAAACACTGCAAAAACCCAAA-3′ (mut4). The luciferase-specific primer GLprimer2 (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as the reverse primer with the wild type pGL-193 DNA as the template for each reaction. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with KpnI and HindIII before ligation into pGL2-basic. One day prior to transfection, cells were plated at a density of ∼3–6 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish in the appropriate growth medium. A mixture containing 2.5 μg of pGL2 reporter plasmid, 14 μl of lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.5 μg of pCMVβ-gal DNA (a control for transfection efficiency), and 600 μl of serum-free medium was incubated at room temperature. After 15 min, 2.4 ml of media was added, and the DNA mixture was added to cells previously washed twice with serum-free medium. After 5 h, 3 ml of medium containing twice the normal concentration of serum was added, and the incubation was continued for 48 h, after which the cells were harvested. For luciferase assays, the cells were first washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer following the manufacturer's instructions (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA). To assay luciferase activity, 100 μl of the cell lysate was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase substrate solution A (Analytical Luminescence). Using a luminometer with automatic injection, 100 μl of substrate solution B (Analytical Luminescence) was then added, and luciferase activity was measured as the light emission over a 30-s period. β-Galactosidase activity in 40 μl of the cell lysate was determined after a 5–30-min incubation at 37 °C with 2 mmchlorophenol red β-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) in 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 45 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mmNaHPO4, pH 8. The reactions were stopped by adding 500 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer. Within each experiment, luciferase activity was determined in duplicate and normalized to β-galactosidase activity for each dish. Each plasmid was tested at least six times in two separate experiments. Initially, a number of established cell lines were screened for the expression of immunoreactive GIP. Because GIP expression was initially detected in both intestinal and salivary tissues, cells of intestinal origin, including STC-1 and intestinal 407, and cells derived from the salivary gland, including SCA-9 and Hs124, were screened. In addition, three endocrine cell lines, HIT T15, Rin5AH, and GH4, were also screened for expression of immunoreactive GIP. Expression of GIP was demonstrated only in the mouse neuroendocrine tumor cell line STC-1 and the human embryonic intestinal 407 cell line (data not shown). The level of immunoreactive GIP expression was significantly greater in STC-1 cells than in 407 cells. Consistent with this observation, Northern hybridization analysis using a GIP cDNA probe demonstrated a specific band in RNA isolated from STC-1 cells with the same mobility as rat duodenal GIP mRNA, while no hybridization was detectable in RNA isolated from any of the other cell lines screened, including 407 cells; comparable levels of actin transcripts were detected in the same samples (Fig.2). To characterize the tissue-specific transcriptional activity of the GIP promoter, the GIP gene was isolated from a rat genomic library after screening 106 plaques with a rat intestinal GIP cDNA. Two overlapping clones, each having inserts of approximately 20 kbp, were identified. Restriction fragments that contained upstream sequences were identified by restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern hybridization analysis using a synthetic oligonucleotide homologous to the 5′-end of the GIP cDNA sequence. Two fragments, a 5.9-kbp SacI-SacI fragment and a 2.8-kbpBamHI-HindIII fragment, were identified, subcloned into pBSKII, and partially sequenced (Fig. 1 A). The sequence of the GIP gene was found to be identical to a previously published sequence (24Higashimoto Y. Liddle R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with the exception of a one-base pair substitution (G for T) at position −800. This substitution introduces an AluI site. To define DNA regions upstream to the GIP start site responsible for basal transcriptional activity (24Higashimoto Y. Liddle R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a series of restriction fragments of varying sizes were placed upstream to the promoterless luciferase gene of the reporter plasmid pGL2-basic. Two series of GIP-Luc chimeric plasmids were constructed. One series contained sequences upstream of position +8 with respect to the putative transcription start site (Fig.1 B), and the second series of clones contained sequences upstream of position +781 and included intron 1 (Fig.1 C). After transient transfection of the GIP-Luc constructs into STC-1 cells, transcriptional activity was determined by measuring luciferase activity in cell extracts. All GIP-Luc constructs produced luciferase activities higher than the control plasmid, pGL2-basic (Fig.3). Transfection of STC-1 cells with the plasmids pGL-943, pGL-425, pGL-397, pGL-363, pGL-259, pGL-203, and pGL-193 resulted in activities approximately 200-fold over control (Fig.3 A). In contrast, transfection of pGL-182 induced only an approximately 30-fold increase in luciferase activity when compared with pGL2-basic (Fig. 3 A). When the construct pGL-173 was compared with pGL2-basic, only an 11-fold enhancement was observed. The GIP-specific insert in the plasmid pGL-173 contains a TATA box sequence (−27 to −24), a consensus sequence of an enhancer core (−133 to −126), and two CAAT box sequences (−158 to −154 and −171 to −167) and may represent the minimal promoter of the GIP gene. This minimal promoter activity was almost completely abolished when sequences from −173 to −144 were deleted from pGL-173, producing the plasmid pGL-143 (Fig. 3 A). The differences in the transcriptional activities observed between constructs pGL-182 and pGL-193 indicated the possible presence of a specific element(s) that can enhance basal GIP gene expression is present in the region of base pairs −193 to −182. Analysis of the DNA sequence in this region revealed a potential GATA binding motif starting at position −190, with the sequence AGATAA. This sequences conforms to the consensus sequence, (A/T)GATA(A/G), for a GATA binding motif (25Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). A mutational analysis was performed to determine the importance of this site, as well as another site located 6 base pairs downstream that shares five of the six bases with the consensus sequence for a GATA motif having the sequence AGATAC. The sequences of the wild type (WT) and four mutants (Mut1–4) in the region of interest are shown in Fig. 4 B. An A to G substitution at position −186 (Mut1) yielded a 40% reduction in promoter activity (Fig. 4 C). The enhancer effect was abolished by mutating two sites within the upstream GATA motif, a G to A and a T to A substitution at positions −189 and −186 (Mut2), respectively (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, a similar mutation in the downstream GATA motif (Mut3) produced only a 35% reduction in promoter activity from the wild type sequence (Fig. 4 C). A construct with two mutated GATA motifs (Mut4) behaved the same as the construct with only the upstream motif (Mut2) altered (Fig.4 C), suggesting that the upstream site is more important in determining promoter activity. As described previously, consensus sequences for cis-acting elements, including a TATA box and a CAAT box, are present within the first intron of the rat GIP gene (24Higashimoto Y. Liddle R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To examine the properties of these sequences, a second series of GIP-Luc chimeric constructs containing intron 1 sequences (Fig. 1 C) was transfected into STC-1 cells. Transfection of STC-1 cells with the plasmid pGL+111i, which does not contain sequences upstream of the putative transcriptional start site, did increase luciferase activity over control (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that intron one sequences may possess promoter activity. The transcriptional activity of pGL+111i is equivalent to the activity of pGL-182i that, in addition to the intron one sequences, includes exon 1 and upstream sequences that are responsible for the low level of promoter activity observed with pGL-182. Similar to the first series of GIP-Luc constructs, enhancement of transcriptional activity could be seen when the sequences from −190 to −182 were included (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, transcription rates did not differ significantly between GIP-Luc fusions that contained intron 1 from those GIP-Luc fusions that lacked these sequences (Figs. 3, A and B), suggesting that the intron 1 sequences do not contribute to the activity of the upstream promoter. To determine whether the putative enhancer located between −190 and −182 might influence transcription initiated within intron 1, the plasmids pGL-Δ363i and pGL-Δ425i were constructed by deletion of sequences between −177 and +111 from the plasmids pGL-363i and pGL-425i, respectively. When pGL-Δ363i and pGL-Δ425i were transfected into STC-1 cells, no further increase in luciferase activity, over that for pGL+111, was detected (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether changes in transcriptional activity represent cell-specific expression, luciferase activity was measured in a number of additional cell lines transfected with GIP promoter constructs (Fig.5). All cell lines examined demonstrated a high level of luciferase activity following transfection with pRSVLUC (data not shown). As demonstrated in Fig. 5, only minimal GIP promoter activity was detected in these cell lines. Moreover, the enhancer activity observed in STC-1 cells was greatly diminished in all the other cell lines (Fig. 5). Interestingly, GIP promoter activity was not enhanced at all in the human embryonic intestinal 407 cell line, which expressed detectable levels of immunoreactive GIP. These results are consistent with Northern hybridization analysis that demonstrated GIP-specific transcripts only in STC-1 cells (Fig. 2). In addition, with the exception of the NIH 3T3 cells, minimal promoter activity elicited from constructs containing intron 1 sequences was similar to activity resulting from constructs containing sequences +8 to −182 to (Fig. 5). In the NIH 3T3 cell line, reduced promoter activity was detected in cells transfected with constructs containing intron 1 sequences only. Because of their presumed importance in the pathogenesis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), renewed interest in incretins, such as GIP and its closely related peptide glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), has been evident in recent years. Elevated circulating levels of GIP have been found in some patients with NIDDM (26Elahi D. Andersen D.K. Muller D.C. Tobin J.D. Brown J.C. Andreas R. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Jones I.R. Owens D.R Luzio S. Williams S. Hayes T.M. Diabetologia. 1989; 32: 668-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and recent clinical trials have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of GLP-1 in the treatment of some forms of NIDDM (28Gutniak M. Ørskov C. Holst J.J. Ahrén B. Efendic S. N. Eng. J. Med. 1992; 326: 1316-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Both GIP and GLP-1 are synthesized in the small intestine and augment insulin secretion after binding to specific G-coupled protein receptors present on pancreatic β-cell membranes (29Fehmann H.-C. Göke R. Göke B. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 390-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Although substantial information has been accrued concerning tissue-specific expression of GLP-1, relatively little information is available regarding the biosynthesis of GIP. The gene encoding GLP-1 is transcribed in pancreatic α-cells, in L cells of the small intestine, and in the brain (30Novak U. Wilks A. Buell G. McEwen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31Drucker D.J. Asa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13475-13478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue-specific expression of GLP-1 is regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. GLP-1 results from limited proteolysis of proglucagon, a process restricted to the L cells of the intestine and possibly the brain (32Drucker D.J. Mojsov S. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9637-9643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like GLP-1, the GIP gene is expressed in more than one tissue. We have previously demonstrated GIP immunoreactivity in K cells of the small intestine and in ductal cells of the rat submandibular salivary gland (17Tseng C.-C. Jarboe L.A. Landau S.B. Williams E.K. Wolfe M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Tseng C.-C. Boylan M.O. Jarboe L.A. Williams E.K. Sunday M.E. Wolfe M.M. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1995; 115: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). GIP-(1–42) is the main functional proteolytic product of proGIP, the primary product of the GIP gene in the upper small intestine. Recently, GIP-(7–42) was purified from the upper part of the porcine intestine and was shown to have antibacterial activity (34Agerberth B. Boman A. Anderson M. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Boman H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether the immunoreactivity detected in the salivary gland represents either GIP or GIP-(7–42) or whether it is a closely related peptide derived by alternate posttranslational processing of proGIP. In the present study, we have used a combination of Northern hybridization analysis and cell-mediated transcription assays to identify an established cell line that can be used to examine tissue-specific regulation of GIP. The identification of a surrogate cell line was necessary to enable investigation of the regulation of GIP gene expression because of difficulties encountered when trying to isolate and culture intestinal K cells. Canine K cells, which represent less than 0.1% of duodenal mucosal cells, have been enriched as much as 100-fold; however, the viability of these cells in culture has been limited to less than 2 days (35Kieffer T.J. Buchan A.M.J. Barker H. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E489-E496PubMed Google Scholar). Only one cell line we tested, STC-1, expressed detectable levels of GIP-specific transcripts. The mRNA had an electrophoretic mobility identical to GIP mRNA previously identified in rat duodenal mucosa (17Tseng C.-C. Jarboe L.A. Landau S.B. Williams E.K. Wolfe M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). STC-1 cells were derived from an intestinal endocrine tumor isolated from a transgenic mouse carrying two oncogenes, SV40 large T antigen and polyoma small T antigen, both of which were linked to the rat insulin promoter. Like the tumors that developed in these same transgenic mice, STC-1 cells are plurihormonal and, in addition to GIP, express GLP-I, GLP-II, glicentin, secretin, somatostatin, gastrin-CCK, neurotensin, and pancreatic polypeptide. Rindi et al. (20Rindi G. Grant S.G.N. Yiangou Y. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. Bautch V.L. Solcia E. Polak J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1349-1363PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the plurihormonal nature of these tumors arises from the ability of their proliferating cells to switch to multiple differentiated states, a quality that has apparently prevailed in the establishment of the STC-1 cell line (20Rindi G. Grant S.G.N. Yiangou Y. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. Bautch V.L. Solcia E. Polak J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1349-1363PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, like many tumor-derived cell lines, the STC-1 cell line must be viewed as a mixture of different cell types (36Tischler, A. S. (1983) Scand. J. Gasteroenterol., 82,(suppl.) 33–43.Google Scholar, 37Madsen O.D. Larsson L.-I. Rehfeld J.F. Schwartz T.W. Lernmark A. Labrecque A.D. Steiner D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2025-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and interactions among the various cell types must be taken into consideration when studying the regulation of hormone expression. Interestingly, while attempting to clone a pure GIP-expressing cell from parental STC-1 cells, Kiefferet al. (21Kieffer T.J. Huang Z. McIntosh C.H.S. Buchan A.M.J. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E316-E322PubMed Google Scholar) found that only 30% of the expanded clone still expressed GIP immunoreactivity, suggesting that dedifferentiation of STC-1 cells was possible. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the STC-1 cells, they have been used as a convenient model to study both gastrointestinal peptide release and transcriptional regulation (21Kieffer T.J. Huang Z. McIntosh C.H.S. Buchan A.M.J. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E316-E322PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mangel A.W. Snow N.D. Misukonis M.A. Basavappa S. Middleton J.P. Fitz J.G. Liddle R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G1031-G1036PubMed Google Scholar, 39Gajic O. Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have used variable length restriction fragments, representing the 5′-flanking region of the rat GIP gene, fused to the luciferase reporter gene in transient transfection assays to investigate GIP gene transcription in STC-1 cells. Two separate regions of the GIP gene were able to promote gene transcription in STC-1 cells. The major promoter located upstream had been previously identified by primer extension analysis and RNase protection analysis of GIP mRNA expressed in rat duodenal tissue (24Higashimoto Y. Liddle R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The first 173 base pairs of this promoter encode minimal promoter activity that is lost if base pairs −144 to −173 are deleted. Interestingly, two putative CCAAT boxes are located in this sequence. In addition, the sequence from −154 to −161, TCACCCAT, is similar to the sequence, TCACCAA, that is located from −152 to −159 in the human GIP promoter and that confers cAMP responsiveness in a hamster insulinoma cell line (40Someya Y. Inagaki N. Maekawa T. Sieno Y. Ishii S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, the addition of base pairs −183 to −193 resulted in a significant increase in promoter activity, suggesting the presence of an enhancer sequence in this region. The further addition of sequences 5′ to position −193 up to −963 did not significantly change the level of promoter activity. We have also found similar rates of transcription with a sequence that extends to approximately position −2500 of the rat GIP gene. This observation does not preclude the presence of additional tissue-specific enhancers as well as repressors upstream of position −193. Earlier studies of the proglucagon promoter demonstrated that sequences that were capable of promoting gene expression in STC-1 cells could not promote intestine-specific gene expression in a transgenic mouse model. A 5′-flanking segment extending only to position −238 promoted enhanced transcriptional activity in STC-1 cells, while a segment extending past position −1400 was required for intestine-specific promoter activity in the transgenic model (39Gajic O. Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The sequence between base pairs −173 and −193 contains two consensus GATA binding motifs. In the present study, a mutational analysis of this region demonstrated the upstream motif to be more important than the downstream sequence in enhancing expression of the GIP gene. Disrupting this motif resulted in a loss of 90% of the activity. Interestingly, of the two GATA motifs, only the sequence of the upstream motif is conserved between rats and humans (41Inagaki N. Seino Y. Takeda J. Yano H. Yamada Y. Bell G.I. Eddy R.L. Fukushima Y. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Imura H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DNA regulatory elements conforming to the sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) were first identified to play a role in the transcriptional regulation of erythroid genes (42Kulessa H. Frampton J. Graf T. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1250-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Since then, GATA binding motifs have been implicated in the tissue-specific expression of numerous other genes.

Intestinal K cells that express GIP are thought to be derived from the endoderm during development like other neuroendocrine tissue. Since GATA-binding proteins, including GATA4/5 and 6 (25Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 46Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.E.E. Evans T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been found in a number of different endodermally derived tissues, it is possible that the upstream GATA motif in the GIP gene could represent a target for one of these transcription factors. The second GIP promoter, located within the first intron, conferred only minimal promoter activity in STC-1 cells. This more proximal promoter does contain a TATAA box, as well as a putative CCAAT box, but does not include an enhancer core consensus sequence (24Higashimoto Y. Liddle R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The rate of transcription of this promoter was not affected by putative enhancers located between base pairs −173 and −193. This was demonstrated by the removal of sequences required for the initiation of transcription of the primary (or distal) promoter (−143 to +8), while retaining sequences in the proximal promoter (+111 to +781) that conferred minimal gene transcription. The resulting GIP-Luc chimera produced the same transcriptional activity as the GIP-Luc construct that included only intron 1 sequences. Primer extension analysis and RNase protection analysis have indicated that GIP transcription initiates from the distal promoter in the duodenum of adult rats (24Higashimoto Y. Liddle R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Little is presently known about either the regulation of GIP gene expression during the ontogeny of rats or GIP expression in the salivary gland, and it is conceivable that coordinate regulation of the two GIP promoters could be involved in either of these two processes. In conclusion, the results of this present study indicate that STC-1 cells represent a suitable model for the examination of cell-specific expression of the GIP gene. Future studies using these cells will enable investigators to identify the transcription factors that interact with and regulate the GIP gene. More advanced approaches, possibly involving transgenic mouse models, may be necessary to investigate the contributions of the sequences upstream of position −193, as well as the proximal promoter located within intron 1."

Site-directed mutagenesis was employed here to analyze the functional importance of Ca2+ binding to EGF-1 in factor VIIa (VIIa), which initiates coagulation in complex with its cofactor, tissue factor (TF). Ala replacements for Asp63 or Gln49 resulted in reduced TF affinity concordant with the number of eliminated Ca2+-coordinating oxygen atoms in the respective side chains. Ca2+ binding to EGF-1 had no major direct effect on contacts with TF residue Gln110 or on interactions of VIIa residues Arg79 and Phe40, suggesting that the stabilized Gla-EGF-1 orientation affects overall docking. Gly, Ala, and Glu replacements at Asp46, which is a Ca2+-coordinating residue at the Gla aromatic stack carboxyl terminus, are consistent with the notion that an increased flexibility of the Gla domain relative to EGF-1 contributes significantly to loss of function. Certain mutants in the EGF-1 Ca2+ site had reduced proteolytic function, suggesting the importance of the high affinity Ca2+ binding site for macromolecular substrate interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2069317020,"Modulation of the components involved in mitogenic signaling cascades is critical to the regulation of cell growth. GTP-binding proteins and the stimulation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis have been shown to play major roles in these cascades. One of the enzymes involved in PC hydrolysis, a PC-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) has received relatively little attention. In this paper we examined the role of a particular heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein, Go, in the regulation of cell growth and PC-PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PC in IIC9 fibroblasts. The Go α-subunit was ablated in IIC9 cells by stable expression of antisense RNA. These stably transfected cells acquired a transformed phenotype as indicated by: (a) the formation of multiple foci in monolayer cultures, (b) the acquisition of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar; and (c) an increased level of thymidine incorporation in the absence of added mitogens. These data implicate Goα as a novel tumor suppressor. Interestingly, PC-PLC activity was constitutively active in the Goα-ablated cells as evidenced by the chronically elevated levels of diacylglycerol and phosphorylcholine in the absence of growth factors. In contrast, basal activities of PC-phospholipase D, phospholipase A2, or phosphoinositol-PLC were not affected. These data demonstrate, for the first time, a role for Goin regulating cell growth and provide definitive evidence for the existence of a PC-PLC in eukaryotic cells. The data further indicate that a subunit of Go, is involved in regulating this enzyme.

The data further indicate that a subunit of Go, is involved in regulating this enzyme. Defects in signal transduction cascades involved in the regulation of cell growth often lead to pathological conditions, including the development of neoplasms. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) 1The abbreviations used are: G protein, heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PLC, phospholipase C; PI, phosphoinositide; PLD, phospholipase D; PA, phosphatidic acid; DAG, diacylglycerol; PAPH, phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase; TLC, thin layer chromatography; PLA2, phospholipase A2; FCS, fetal calf serum; CK, choline kinase; IP, inositol phosphate. and induced lipid metabolism are important components in growth factor-coupled cellular signal transduction pathways. Heterotrimeric G proteins are a family of membrane-bound proteins composed of α, β, and γ subunits, which, in response to receptor activation, dissociate into free α subunits and βγ dimers. Both the GTP-bound α subunits and βγ dimers have been shown to play roles in a variety mitogenic signal transduction cascades (1Seuwen K. Pouyssegur J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 58: 75-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), including those involving induced lipid metabolism (2Sternweis P.C. Smrcka A.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 502-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 3Wakelam M.J. Briscoe C.P. Stewart A. Pettitt T.R. Cross M.J. Paul A. Yule J.M. Gardner S.D. Hodgkin M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). There is now strong evidence indicating that G proteins play crucial roles in the regulation of mitogenic signals and that specific defects in these proteins lead to the development of transformed phenotypes. In addition to the observation that the activation of certain growth factor receptors stimulates the dissociation of G proteins into GTP-bound α subunits and βγ dimers, mutations that reduce the intrinsic GTPase activity in specific α-subunits transform these G proteins into oncoproteins. For example, mutations in the Gsα gene result in an oncogene (gsp), the protein product of which is a Gsα with substitutions at amino acids 201 (R201C/H) and 227 (Q227R/H/L) which have been found in growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumors (4Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations in the Gi2α gene yield another oncogene (gip2) characterized by a substitution of amino acid 179 in Gi2α (R179C/H) which has been found in ovarian sex cord stromal tumors and adrenal cortical tumors (5Lyons J. Landis C.A. Harsh G. Vallar L. Grunewald K. Feichtinger H. Duh Q.Y. Clark O.H. Kawasaki E. Bourne H.R. McCormick F. Science. 1990; 249: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). These data provide strong support for the notion that these G proteins are important components involved in the regulation of mitogenic signal transduction cascades and represent potential targets for oncogenic mutations in human tumors. In addition to G proteins, agonist-induced lipid metabolism also plays a central role in mitogenic signaling cascades. While induced hydrolysis of phosphoinositides (PIs) has long been recognized as playing such a role (6Noh D.Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), it is now well recognized that induced PC metabolism is often just as, if not more, important (7Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Although PI and PC hydrolysis are induced by a variety of mitogens, PI hydrolysis is often transient while PC hydrolysis is usually sustained in the continuous presence of growth factors. In this regard, PC hydrolysis correlates with the requirement for the prolonged presence of growth factors for full mitogenic responses (8Wright T.M. Rangan L.A. Shin H.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9374-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type and specific mitogen, three enzymes have been implicated in mitogen-induced PC metabolism: PLA2, PC-PLD, and PC-PLC. PLA2 removes the fatty acid esterified at sn-2 of the glycerol backbone in PC resulting in the liberation of a free fatty acid, often arachidonic acid, and a lysophospholipid. PLD-mediated hydrolysis of PC results in the production of phosphatidic acid (PA) and free choline. This generated PA is often, but not always, hydrolyzed by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAPH) leading to the production of diacylglycerol (DAG). Alternatively, in some systems (9Baldi E.

J. 1992; 285: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), PC-derived DAGs, in addition to phosphorylcholine, are produced from a PC-PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PC. Most studies have focused on PLA2 and PLD while very little attention has been given to PC-PLC. Indeed, the existence of a eukaryotic PC-PLC remains somewhat controversial. Given this lack of attention to eukaryotic PC-PLC, it is not surprising that the cellular components involved in its regulation have not been identified. The observation that activation of receptors, such as the thrombin receptor (16Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar), which are known to couple to G proteins (17Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) lead to an increase in PC-PLC activity (15Wright T.M. Willenberger S. Raben D.M. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 293-304PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that this enzyme is regulated by a G protein. That a G protein couples to PC-PLC is consistent with the fact that these proteins are known to regulate other specific phospholipases. PI-PLCβ is regulated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (19Exton J.H. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 28: 65-72PubMed Google Scholar), involving both αq and βγ dimers (20Blank J.L. Brattain K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23069-23075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee S.B. Shin S.H. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

In a similar manner, heterotrimeric G proteins have been implicated in the regulation of a high molecular weight PLA2 (23Axelrod J. Trends. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 64-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), while PC-PLD has been shown to be regulated by small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (24Cockcroft S.

In view of these data, it is reasonable to hypothesize that PC-PLC may also be regulated by a G protein. In this report, we demonstrate that the ablation of Goα results in a transformed phenotype. Furthermore, in these Goα-ablated cells, PC-PLC is significantly elevated providing definitive evidence for a PC-PLC and implicating Go, Goα in particular, in the regulation of this enzyme in vivo. The relationship between Goα, the transformed phenotype and the constitutive activation of PC-PLC is discussed.

IIC9 cells, a subclone of Chinese hamster embryo fibroblasts (25Low D.A. Scott R.W. Baker J.B. Cunningham D.D. Nature. 1982; 298: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), were grown, maintained, and serum-deprived as described previously (8Wright T.M. Rangan L.A. Shin H.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9374-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were grown and maintained in minimal essential medium-α/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1, v/v) containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml of 100 mg of streptomycin/ml, and 2 mml-glutamine (complete media). Subconfluent cultures were serum-deprived by washing three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay grade), 100 units of penicillin, 100 mg of streptomycin/ml, 2 mml-glutamine, and 20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.4. The cultures were then incubated in this media supplemented with 5 mg/ml human transferrin (serum-free medium) and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C. Cultures were washed twice and equilibrated in fresh serum-free media for at least 30 min prior to addition of each experiment. EcoRI fragment of Goα cDNA from pGEM-2/Goα was subcloned into a vector plasmid, pcDNAI, in a antisense orientation, i.e. the 3′ end of the Goα cDNA was immediately adjacent to cytomegalovirus promoter under which control the antisense sequence is transcribed. Plasmids were sequenced and transfected into IIC9 cells using a Lipofectamine protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). pcDNAI without inserts were transfected into IIC9s as a control. Briefly, subconfluent cells in 60-mm culture dishes were washed with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected by incubation with 5-μg plasmids and Lipofectamine for 24 h at 37 °C. The Opti-MEM media was then replaced with complete media and the cells were grown for 48 h at 37 °C to allow expression of the neomycin resistance gene products. The transfected cells were subcultured and grown for several weeks in selection medium (complete medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418). G418-resistant clones were isolated with cloning cylinders and the transfected clones were maintained in complete medium supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418. All other assays, including growth in soft agar, [3H]thymidine incorporation, Western blot analysis, and quantification of DAG mass, choline metabolites, and PLD activation were performed as described previously (8Wright T.M.

To investigate the physiological role of Goα, we stably transfected IIC9 cells with a Goα antisense construct (Fig.1 A). Western blot analysis demonstrated that Goα was absent in the transfected cells while other G protein α subunits, Gi1α, Gi2α, Gsα, and Gqα, were present (Fig.1 B). This has been observed in at least three independently isolated Goα-ablated clones (data not shown).Figure 1Schematic representation of the Goα antisense construct and its effect on the expression of Goα protein in IIC9 cells. A, pGoas: pcDNAI containing Goα cDNA in a antisense orientation as described under “Experimental Procedures.”B, cell lysates (50 μg/lane) were subjected to Western blot analysis. For this analysis, 50 μg of protein in sample buffer was separated by electrophoresis in 9% polyacrylamide gels (64Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-P by electroblotting. The blot was incubated overnight in wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) containing 5% dry milk as described (65Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar) followed by washing and incubation for 1 h at room temperature with antibodies specifically directed against the indicated Gα subunits. After washing and incubation one-half hour at room temperature with anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate, the blot was then developed using chemiluminescence detection (Amersham). The figure was constructed by photocopying autoradiograms of Western blots onto a transparency. The appropriate lanes were mounted onto white paper and then photographed.

The data are representative of at least three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to wild type IIC9 cells which are flat and extended (Fig.2 A), Goα-ablated cells appear round, retracted, and form multiple foci in confluent monolayer cultures (Fig. 2 B). This morphology, observed in three independently isolated clones, suggest that the Goα-ablated cells have lost contact inhibition and acquired a transformed phenotype. An important characteristic of transformed fibroblasts is their ability to grow in an anchorage independent manner. In view of this and the above data, we assessed the ability of the Goα-ablated cells to grow in soft agar. As shown in Table I, Goa1 cells formed 20–30-fold more colonies in soft agar than wild type cells and this has been observed in a second, independently isolated, clone (data not shown). Furthermore, each of the colonies formed by the ablated cells were much larger and more dense (Fig. 3, B and D) than the colonies formed by the wild type cells (Fig. 3, A andC). Cells transfected with control vectors (vectors without inserts) formed colonies similar to those seen with wild type cells (data not shown).Table IInformation of colonies in soft agarCell typeNumber of coloniesWT10 ± 4Goal365 ± 39The ability of wild type IIC9 cells and Goa-ablated cells (Gao1) to grow in soft agar was assesed as described under “Experimental Prodecures.” The data represent the average number of colonies in three 35-mm dishes for each cell type and is representative of three independent experiments. Error values indicate the range. Open table in a new tab The ability of wild type IIC9 cells and Goa-ablated cells (Gao1) to grow in soft agar was assesed as described under “Experimental Prodecures.” The data represent the average number of colonies in three 35-mm dishes for each cell type and is representative of three independent experiments. Error values indicate the range. To further investigate the possibility that the ablated cells were transformed, we assessed the “basal” level of thymidine incorporation. As shown in Fig. 4, wild type IIC9 cells became quiescent after serum deprivation for 48 h and the level of [3H]thymidine incorporation was low. In contrast, serum-deprived Goα-ablated cells displayed a 10-fold higher level of [3H]thymidine incorporation than the quiescent wild type cells (Fig. 4). FCS (10%) or thrombin (2 NIH units/ml) stimulated only a modest increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation in the ablated cells while these treatments stimulated a 10-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation in the quiescent wild type cells (Fig. 4). These data have been observed in three independently isolated clones. Consistent with these data, the Goα-ablated cells survive in serum-free media for an extended period of time while the wild type cells do not (Fig. 2,C and D). These data indicate that the Goα-ablated cells are not growth arrested in serum-free medium and are consistent with the transformed phenotype of these cells. Cells transformed as a consequence of a defect in a signal transduction component normally associated with the regulation of mitogenesis often show changes in the concentrations of second messengers under their control (30Macara I.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31Weinstein I.B. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1990; 24: 307-316PubMed Google Scholar, 32Waterfield M.D. Br. Med. Bull. 1989; 45: 570-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Many of the signaling cascades known to be involved in mediating mitogenic signals involve the stimulation of lipid metabolism and G proteins are known to play a role in some of these cascades (1Seuwen K. Pouyssegur J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 58: 75-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Noh D.Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition, the elevation of DAG levels plays a central early role in transducing the mitogenic signal in these cascades. In view of this and the above observations regarding the transformed phenotype of the Goα-ablated cells, we measured the mass of DAG in the ablated cells. Subconfluent wild type and ablated cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 2 days and DAG levels were quantified. Interestingly, the basal DAG level in the serum-starved Goα-ablated cells was twice that of quiescent wild type cells (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, while the addition of α-thrombin to the wild type cells resulted in a 2-fold increase in DAG mass level, addition of α-thrombin to the ablated cells did not induce a significant further increase in DAG levels (Fig.5 A). These results, observed in two independently isolated clones, indicate that the DAG level in Goα-ablated cells was constitutively elevated even in the absence of any added mitogens. We have shown that PC hydrolysis is the major, if not exclusive, source of mitogen-induced DAGs in IIC9 cells (8Wright T.M. Rangan L.A. Shin H.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9374-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wright T.M. Willenberger S. Raben D.M. Biochem.

In view of these data, we examined the possibility that an increase in PC hydrolysis contributed to the elevated DAG level in the Goα-ablated cells. To determine if PC hydrolysis was affected in the Goα-ablated cells, the cells were radiolabeled to isotopic equilibrium with [3H]choline chloride in serum-free medium for 48 h and the intracellular [3H]choline and [3H]phosphorylcholine level were quantified (15Wright T.M. Willenberger S. Raben D.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). TLC analysis of water-soluble head groups indicated that the phosphorylcholine level in the Goα-ablated cells was 5–10-fold higher than that found in wild type cells. The level of choline in the ablated and wild type cells, however, was identical (Fig. 5 B). To ensure that the increased level of radiolabeled phosphorylcholine was not due to contaminant which co-migrated with the phosphorylcholine, the radioactivity in the region of the TLC plate containing phosphorylcholine was recovered, subjected to alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis, and the products were identified by TLC. All of the radioactivity that migrated with phosphorylcholine was converted to choline indicating that co-migrating contaminants were not present (data not shown). These data indicate that both phosphorylcholine and DAG, the two products of PC-PLC, are elevated in ablated cells and strongly suggest that PC-PLC is constitutively activated in Goα-ablated cells. These results have been observed in three independently isolated clones. An alternative explanation for the above results is that PC is hydrolyzed via a PLD and the resulting PA is dephosphorylated to DAG, via PAPH, while the free choline is phosphorylated via CK. As a result of the combined action of all three enzymes, PLD, PAPH, and choline kinase (CK), an apparent PC-PLC activity would be detected similar to that observed in v-ras transformed cells (36Carnero A. Dolfi F. Lacal J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Carnero A. Cuadrado A. del Peso L. Lacal J.C.

In view of the above, PLD activity was quantified in Goα-ablated and wild type IIC9 cells by taking advantage of the unique transphosphatidylation activity of PLD and the ability to preferentially label PC by acute labeling with [3H]myristate (15Wright T.M. Willenberger S. Raben D.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the transphosphatidylation reaction, a small molecular weight alcohol such as ethanol is used as the nucleophile in lieu of water resulting in the generation of phosphatidylethanol instead of PA. As shown in Fig. 5 C, PLD activity is indistinguishable in the ablated and wild type cells in the absence of thrombin or FCS. Furthermore, the addition of thrombin to both cell types results in comparable increases in PLD activity. These data indicate that both basal and thrombin activated PLD activity are unaltered in Goα-ablated cells and have been observed in three independently isolated clones. To further examine the possible involvement of PLD/PAPH/CK activities, CK activity was quantified in wild type and Goα-ablated serum-deprived cells. These cells were incubated with [3H]choline for 15 and 30 min and the level of radiolabeled phosphorylcholine was quantified. As shown in Fig.5 D, the conversion of choline to phosphorylcholine was essentially identical in both cell types demonstrating that the CK activity was not elevated in the Goα-ablated cells. These results have been observed in two independently isolated clones. We should note that sphingomyelinase was also not contributing to the increased phosphorylcholine levels in Goα-ablated cells. If this choline metabolite was generated from a sphingomyelinase-mediated hydrolysis of sphingomyelin ceramide, in addition to phosphorylcholine, would be generated. Ceramide levels were quantified, therefore, in wild type and Goα-ablated cells and was found to be identical in both cell types (data not shown). Taken together, the above data eliminate the involvement of PLD/PAPH/CK as a mechanism for the chronic elevation of DAG and phosphorylcholine levels in Goα-ablated cells. In addition, they indicate that Goα ablation-induced transformation is different from v-ras-induced transformation, since the later involves PLD/PAPH/CK activities (36Carnero A. Dolfi F. Lacal J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Carnero A. Cuadrado A. del Peso L. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1387-1395PubMed Google Scholar, 38Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another mitogen-activated PC hydrolyzing enzyme is PLA2. In IIC9 cells, thrombin and FCS stimulate PLA2 activity which hydrolyze PC to lysophosphocholine and arachidonic acid (27Raben D.M. Yasuda K.M. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), both of which have been implicated in mitogenic signaling cascades (7Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Basal and α-thrombin-induced PLA2activities in Goα-ablated and wild type cells was assessed by quantifying the release of arachidonic acid and its metabolites. As observed for PLD, basal and α-thrombin-activated PLA2 activity was not affected by the ablation of Goα (Fig. 6 A). Consistent with these data, glycerolphosphocholine, another metabolite produced by the hydrolysis of PLA2-generated lysophospholipid, was also at similar levels in both cell types (data not shown). These data, observed in three independently isolated clones, indicated that PLA2 activity is unaffected in the Goα-ablated cells. Induced PI hydrolysis has been observed in response to a wide variety of mitogens and defects in this metabolism have been implicated in"
https://openalex.org/W1982977552,"Most mammalian cells rely on an external supply of glucose for survival, proliferation, and function. Glucose enters cells through specific transporter molecules at the plasma membrane by a facilitative process that does not expend energy. Regulation of glucose transport into cells is thought to occur largely through transporter expression at the cell surface, but the extent to which the intrinsic properties of glucose transporters are regulated is at present controversial. Using a bone marrow-derived cell line that responds to the hemopoietic growth factor, interleukin-3 (IL-3), we investigated IL-3 regulation of glucose transport. IL-3 significantly increased 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) uptake within 1 h (26 ± 8.0%, n = 11) with a maximum 73% increase after 6 h. Withdrawal of IL-3 resulted in decreased uptake within 1 h and this continued to decline to 43% of initial uptake by 16 h. To determine whether these changes in 2-DOG uptake were associated with corresponding changes in glucose transporter expression, subtype-specific antisera against Glut-1 and Glut-3 were used. Little change in membrane expression of these transporters was observed prior to 16 h. Fractionation of cell membranes on Nycodenz gradients showed that the majority of each transporter subtype was associated with the plasma membrane (63–93%) and that transporter distribution did not change markedly in response to addition or withdrawal of IL-3. These results demonstrate that IL-3 regulates glucose uptake by modulating the intrinsic transporting ability of glucose transporters. Decreased transporter affinity for 2-DOG and 3-O-methylglucose was observed following IL-3 withdrawal. Similar affinity changes were observed with 2-DOG following exposure of IL-3-stimulated cells to the protein kinase inhibitors, genistein and staurosporine. In contrast, the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate, acted like IL-3 to increase transporter affinity for glucose. Together these results demonstrate that IL-3 acts to maintain the intrinsic transport properties of glucose transporters without markedly affecting their expression or translocation.

The energy requirements of most mammalian cells are met through a continuous supply of glucose which circulates in the blood or is supplied in culture medium. Glucose enters cells through specific glucose transporter molecules (Gluts) present in the plasma membrane. A small family of facilitative glucose transporter molecules is known and the different transporter subtypes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (1Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 2Pessin J.E. Bell G.I. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 911-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Glucose is transported into cells down its concentration gradient, the rate of transport being dependent on the absolute concentration of glucose, the steepness of the gradient and the level of expression of transporters at the cell surface. The extent to which the intrinsic glucose transporting ability of individual transporters is regulated is not known although evidence suggests that this level of regulation is also important. For example, excessive Glut-1 expression on human erythrocytes implies negative control, while in pigeon erythrocytes, sugar transport via Glut-1 appears to be negatively regulated in that sugar transport can be derepressed by metabolic poisons like cyanide (3Diamond D.L. Carruthers A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6437-6444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, acute stimulation of rat liver clone 9 cells with azide markedly increased glucose uptake without increasing Glut-1 expression at the plasma membrane or transporter affinity for glucose (4Shi Y. Liu H. Vanderburg G. Samuel S.J. Ismail-Beigi F. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21772-21778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In another study, depriving 3T3-L1 adipocytes of glucose increased glucose transport without increasing transporter expression or translocation (5Fisher M.D. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11806-11809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In insulin-responsive tissues in the basal state, glucose transport occurs primarily through Glut-1, but when stimulated by insulin, the majority of transport occurs through Glut-4. In adipose and muscle cells, increased transport in response to insulin occurs in the short-term by translocation of Glut-4 from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (6Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 7Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol.

The Glut-1 transporter subtype may also be recruited to the plasma membrane in response to insulin although this occurs to a much lesser extent than with Glut-4 (9Zorzano A. Wilkinson W. Kotliar N.

However, in addition to recruitment, there is also evidence for modulation of the intrinsic activity of both Glut-1 and Glut-4 (11Joost H.G. Weber T.M. Cushman S.W. Simpson I.A. J. Biol.

Despite the importance of glucose uptake for normal cell metabolism, regulation of glucose transport in systems responding to signals other than insulin has not been widely studied. Increased glucose transport in response to growth factors has been shown previously in fibroblasts (15Bird T.A. Davies A. Baldwin S.A. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), retinal epithelial cells (16Takagi H. Tanihara H. Seino Y. Yoshimura N. Invest. Ophthalmol.

With some cells, increased transport has been shown to occur through increased glucose transporter expression or translocation of stored transporters to the plasma membrane (15Bird T.A. Davies A. Baldwin S.A. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Takagi H. Tanihara H. Seino Y. Yoshimura N. Invest. Ophthalmol.

However, in other studies intrinsic activation of transporters already expressed at the cell surface may be involved in the stimulation of glucose transport (23Nefesh I. Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Golembo M. Ben N.Y. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the pro-B lymphocyte cell line, Ba/F3, treatment with IL-3 1The abbreviations used are: IL-3, interleukin-3; 2-DOG, 2-deoxyglucose; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. or insulin-like growth factor-1 led to decreased transporter K m for glucose compared with untreated cells, whereas no change in V maxwas observed (23Nefesh I. Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Golembo M. Ben N.Y. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This suggests that growth factors can regulate the affinity of glucose transporters for glucose without altering the number of transporters present. These studies were confirmed and extended with the growth factor-dependent myeloid cell line, 32D. IL-3 was shown to maintain the affinity of transporters for glucose without altering V max, whereas IL-3 withdrawal resulted in an increase in K m and these changes were associated with protein phosphorylation (24Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In these studies, both Ba/F3 and 32D cells are presumed to express predominantly Glut-1 as the major transporter subtype as has been shown for other cultured hemopoietic cells. These studies suggest that growth factors may act to regulate glucose transport in hemopoietic cells by modulating the activation state of glucose transporters. The present study extends these findings by showing that IL-3 stimulates 2-DOG uptake into 32D cells without a corresponding increase in transporter expression in crude cell membranes or translocation of intracellularly stored transporters to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, withdrawal of IL-3 leads to a significant decline in 2-DOG uptake that is associated with a decline in transporter affinity for glucose. Changes in transporter expression may also contribute to this effect. These results provide strong independent evidence that IL-3 acts through its receptor to modulate the intrinsic transport function of glucose transporters on hemopoietic cells, and raise the possibility that cell survival, growth, proliferation, and function may be regulated by growth factors and cytokines at the level of glucose transport in addition to other levels of metabolic and cell cycle control. 32D clone 23 cells (32D), originally derived from long-term bone marrow cultures of C3H/HeJ mice (25Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), were obtained from Prof. J. D. Watson (Genesis Research and Development Corp., Auckland, NZ) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% Wehi-3-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3, 25 μg/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml streptomycin and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator maintained at 5% CO2. 32D cells (4 × 105 cells/ml) were cultured in serum-free RPMI containing 2 ng/ml IL-3 (recombinant murine IL-3 obtained from Prof. J. D. Watson, Genesis Research and Development Corp.) for 16 h. Cells were washed three times, resuspended to 5 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI and treated with or without 20 ng/ml IL-3 for the times indicated. Cells were collected by centrifugation, counted, and cell viability assessed by trypan blue exclusion. 1 × 106 viable cells were removed in duplicate at each time point for 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) uptake measurement and the remaining cells put on ice for membrane preparation. Cells were resuspended in 250 μl of glucose-free RPMI (Sigma) and preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C. 2-[3H]DOG (1 μCi, Amersham) and 2-DOG (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) were added to a final concentration of 100 μm, or for kinetic analysis, 0.2–2.5 mm. Glucose uptake was measured for 3 min at 37 °C. Uptake was stopped by adding 250 μl of ice-cold glucose-free RPMI containing 0.6 mm phloretin and the cells placed on ice. Cells were centrifuged through a cushion of 10% ice-cold bovine serum albumin for 30 s at 8,800 × g in a Microfuge, washed with ice-cold glucose-free RPMI and the pellet lysed with 1% Triton X-100 and radioactivity determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). 3-O-[3H]Methylglucose (Amersham) uptake was determined by a similar procedure to that described above for 2-DOG uptake except that cells were starved of serum for 2 h in the absence of IL-3 prior to treatment with and without IL-3. The reaction was performed at 37 °C and was terminated after 30 s at which time uptake was in the linear range. Total cell membranes were isolated by the method of Nagamatsu et al. (26Nagamatsu S. Kornhauser J.M. Burant C.F. Seino S. Mayo K.E. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 467-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were homogenized in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm sucrose, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The nuclei and cell debris were removed from the homogenate by centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C (SW40 rotor, Beckman ultracentrifuge). The membrane pellet was solubilized in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for a minimum of 1 h at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and 1 μg/ml aprotinin added to solubilized membrane samples prior to storage at −70 °C. Cells were incubated with or without 20 ng/ml IL-3 for 6 h, then were harvested and resuspended in Hepes-sucrose buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin) at 3.0 × 107 cells/ml. The cell suspension was then added to an equal volume of 1 mm Hepes and incubated for 30 min on ice to allow cells to swell. Cells were fragmented by passing 10–15 times through a ball bearing homogenizer (8.020-mm bore, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) with a 8.008-mm ball bearing until approximately 95% of cells were broken. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 900 ×g for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The postnuclear homogenate was then layered over a continuous linear gradient of 0–45% Nycodenz (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway) in Hepes sucrose buffer containing protease inhibitors and the gradient centrifuged at 101,000 × g (SW40 rotor, Beckman ultracentrifuge) at 4 °C for 2 h. Gradient fractions (0.4 ml) were collected from the bottom of the gradient using a peristaltic pump. Alkaline phosphodiesterase I (EC 3.1.4.1) was used as a marker enzyme for plasma membrane. Membrane fractions were added to reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm sodium thymidine 5′-monophosphatep-nitrophenyl ester) and absorbance read at 405 nm after 2 h incubation at 37 °C. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase (EC 1.6.2.4) was used to monitor endoplasmic reticulum. Membrane fractions were added to reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.33 mm KCN, 0.1 mm NADPH, and 0.05 mmcytochrome c) and absorbance read at 550 nm after 15 min incubation at room temperature. The concentration of protein in the membrane samples was determined by a modified Lowry protein assay (27Harrington C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 285-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 15 μg of total membrane protein or 20 μl of each gradient fraction were added to Laemmli sample buffer, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and proteins separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a Mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to supported nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C Super, Amersham) at 15 V for 30 min. Nonspecific binding to membranes was blocked by incubating in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS/T) containing 5% non-fat dried milk and 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with primary antisera diluted in TBS/T containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the COOH terminus of rat Glut-1 or Glut-4 (1/500 dilution, EastAcres Biologicals, Southbridge, MA) and affinity-purified antibodies against the COOH terminus of mouse Glut-3 (1/50 dilution, gift from G. W. Gould, University of Glasgow, Scotland) were employed. Membranes were washed with TBS/T, then incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified swine Ig anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA) diluted 1/4000 in TBS/T. Membranes were washed and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Nitrocellulose membranes were stripped of bound antibodies by submerging in stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and incubating at 50 °C for 30 min. Membranes were washed with TBS/T, then blocked before reprobing with another antibody. Densitometric analysis used a Macintosh LC 630 computer and the public domain NIH image program. Density of autoradiographic bands was linear over the range used in the experiments described. To determine the effects of IL-3 on glucose uptake, 32D cells were preincubated with 2 ng/ml IL-3 in the absence of serum for 16 h. This preconditioning regime has been shown to maintain the viability of cells in the absence of cell proliferation (24Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Biochem.

IL-3 significantly stimulated glucose uptake with the greatest increase occurring after 6 h (Fig. 1). Cells incubated for the same period of time without IL-3 showed reduced 2-DOG uptake. Cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion was greater than 91% in the presence of IL-3, and at times up to 12 h in the absence of IL-3 but dropped to 74% after 16 h incubation without IL-3.Figure 4Distribution of glucose transporters on membranes from 32D cells treated for 6 h with IL-3. 32D cells were treated for 16 h in serum-free media supplemented with 2 ng/ml IL-3, washed, then treated with 20 ng/ml IL-3 for 6 h.

Kansara and M. Berridge, unpublished results. Fig. 2 shows that there was little change in the expression of Glut-1 and Glut-3 in the presence of IL-3 at times up to 16 h, whereas IL-3 withdrawal for 16 h caused Glut-1 and Glut-3 expression to decline sharply. The ratio of Glut-1:Glut-3 did not alter significantly during the course of the experiment. Densitometric analysis of Glut-1 and Glut-3 expression is summarized in Fig. 3 and shows no significant changes in the expression of Glut-1 and Glut-3 prior to 16 h.Figure 3Quantitation of glucose transporters on total membranes from 32D cells.

Cell fractions containing plasma membrane were identified using alkaline phosphodiesterase I, while fractions containing endoplasmic reticulum were identified using NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase. Figs.4 and 5 show that a single immunoreactive peak of Glut-1 and Glut-3 was observed in each gradient, and that most immunoreactivity was associated with the plasma membrane marker. No obvious changes in the distribution of Glut-1 or Glut-3 were observed in the presence or absence of IL-3. A consistent tendency for Glut-3 to be associated with less dense fractions than Glut-1 is evident in both gradients. Quantitation of Glut-1 and Glut-3 immunoreactivity in each fraction by densitometric analysis permitted transporters in fractions containing plasma membrane to be compared with those containing endoplasmic reticulum (Table I). Most Glut-1 (63–77%) and Glut-3 (82–96%) was associated with the plasma membrane, and the distribution showed only small (<20%) differences between IL-3 treatment and withdrawal and when compared with exponentially growing cells.Table IQuantification of glucose transporters in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum-associated fractions of 32D cellsGlut-1Glut-3I (ER)II (PM)I (ER)II (PM)% total transporters% total transportersExponentially growing cells3365393−IL-335631882+IL-32377496Quantitative densitometry showing the distribution of glucose transporter subtypes in the plasma membrane (PM) and microsomal (ER) fractions from experiments shown in Figs. 4 and 5 and from exponentially growing cells.

We have previously shown that withdrawal of IL-3 from serum-starved 32D cells for 1 h reduces transporter affinity for glucose, or conversely, that IL-3 maintains transporter affinity for glucose (24Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Table II compares the kinetics of 2-DOG uptake following IL-3 treatment and withdrawal for 1, 2, and 6 h with that of exponentially growing cells and serum-starved cells. A similar 1.6–2.2-fold increases in transporter K m for glucose were observed at each time point following IL-3 withdrawal. In contrast, V max showed no significant change following IL-3 withdrawal for 1 and 2 h, but was elevated at 6 h.Table IIEffects of IL-3 on the kinetics of 2-DOG uptakeTreatmentKinetic parametersTimeIL-3nK mV maxh20 ng/mlmmnmol/10 6 cells/minExponentially growing cells in WEHI 3-CM−−81.24 ± 0.075.45 ± 0.45Serum-starved cells treated with 2 ng/ml IL-3 for 16 h0+31.48 ± 0.142.81 ± 0.591+41.35 ± 0.153.15 ± 0.342+31.54 ± 0.022.60 ± 0.176+31.57 ± 0.092.64 ± 0.031−42.96 ± 0.282-aSignificantly different from cells treated in the presence of IL-3, p < 0.05.3.42 ± 0.532−32.55 ± 0.322-aSignificantly different from cells treated in the presence of IL-3, p < 0.05.2.93 ± 0.276−32.67 ± 0.472-aSignificantly different from cells treated in the presence of IL-3, p < 0.05.4.51 ± 0.43Data on 1-h IL-3 treatment from Ref. 24Berridge M.V.

All data are the mean ofn experiments each performed in duplicate or triplicate. Because 2-DOG is rapidly phosphorylated following uptake into the cell, it is possible that phosphorylation may become rate-limiting for 2-DOG uptake. Involvement of post-transport phosphorylation in uptake kinetics was determined using 3-O-methylglucose, a glucose analogue which is not phosphorylated. Table III shows that IL-3 withdrawal resulted in a similar 2-fold increase in transporterK m for 3-O-methylglucose without alteringV max. These results indicate that phosphorylation is not rate-limiting for 2-DOG uptake under these conditions.Table IIIEffects of IL-3 on the kinetics of 3-O-methylglucose uptakeCell treatment3-a32D cells were starved of serum for 2 h before being treated with or without IL-3 for a further 2 h.

https://openalex.org/W1978857678,"A panel of murine monoclonal antibodies was generated against the extracellular domain of the human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β receptor (PDGFRβ). These antibodies were assayed for both the ability to inhibit binding of PDGF BB to PDGFRβ+ cells as well as the capacity to inhibit PDGF BB-mediated mitogenesis. As expected, all antibodies that could prevent PDGF BB binding also inhibited mitogenesis. However one antibody (M4TS.11), with no detectable ability to inhibit PDGF BB binding, was a potent inhibitor of proliferation induced by PDGF BB. Further characterization indicated that M4TS.11 impaired PDGFRβ dimerization, revealing the mechanism by which it prevented PDGF BB-mediated mitogenesis. Using domain deletion mutants of the extracellular portion of PDGFRβ, the determinant recognized by this antibody was localized to the fourth extracellular domain of PDGFRβ, indicating that this domain, which is not involved in ligand binding, actively participates in receptor dimerization and signal transduction. The M4TS.11 antibody could also inhibit PDGF BB-mediated proliferation of responsive cells from both the baboon and the rabbit, indicating the determinant recognized by the antibody is not limited to humans and making it possible to use this antibody to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of interfering with PDGF in animal models of human disease.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) 1The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFRβ, PDGF β receptor; sPDGFRβ, soluble form of PDGFRβ CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; SMC, smooth muscle cells; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; SCF, stem cell factor; SCFR, SCF receptor. is a mitogen and chemoattractant for cells of mesenchymal origin, such as fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and glial cells (1Kohler N. Lipton A. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 87: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 2Ross R. Glomset J. Kariya B. Harker L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PDGF is encoded by two genes, the products of which are designated A and B. The active PDGF molecule is a disulfide-linked dimer of these polypeptides and thus can exist in three forms: the homodimers AA or BB or the heterodimer AB (4Johnsson A. Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Waterson Å. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Studies examining the interaction of PDGF with responsive cells have revealed the existence of two specific receptors designated α and β and encoded by separate genes. Each receptor type is composed of five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains attached to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain via a transmembrane segment (5Claesson-Welsch L. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This structural organization is the prototype for the PDGF receptor family of protein-tyrosine kinases, which includes stem cell factor receptor, colony stimulating factor receptor, and Flk-2 (6Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). The PDGF dimer stimulates responsive cells by cross-linking two receptor subunits (5Claesson-Welsch L. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 6Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). The different forms of PDGF exhibit different affinities for the two forms of the PDGF receptor. The PDGFRα can interact with all three forms of PDGF; PDGFRβ can only interact with PDGF BB and AB. This pattern of reactivity dictates that PDGF AA can signal the cell only through homodimers of PDGFRα, PDGF BB can signal the cell through homodimers of PDGFRα or PDGFRβ or the heterodimer PDGFRα·PDGFRβ, and PDGF AB can stimulate cells through either homodimers of PDGFRα or the PDGFRα· PDGFRβ heterodimer (7Claesson-Welsch L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a potent mitogenic and chemotactic agent, PDGF has been implicated as a contributing factor in a number of pathologic conditions that involve the migration and proliferation of PDGF-responsive cells. Such conditions include arteriosclerosis (8Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar), restenosis following coronary bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty (9Ferns G.A.A. Raines E.W. Sprugel K.H. Montani A.S. Reidy M.A. Ross R. Science. 1991; 253: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), nephritis (10Iida H. Seifert R. Alpers C.E.,. Grunwald R.G. K Phillips P.E. Pritzl P. Gordon K. Gown A.M.

Dermatol. 1989; 92: 301-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and some neoplasias (12Westermark B. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 146-162Google Scholar). Thus, interfering with the biologic activities of PDGF may be of therapeutic value for one or more of these conditions. We have generated and characterized a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular portion of the PDGFRβ and examined the ability of these antibodies to inhibit PDGF BB-specific binding and/or induction of mitogenesis. One of these antibodies exhibits no effect on PDGF BB binding to the receptor but does inhibit PDGF-mediated mitogenesis by impairing receptor dimerization. This antibody cross-reacts with PDGFRβ from other species, making it an ideal candidate to study the therapeutic potential of an antibody PDGF antagonist in animal models of human disease. The Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO/dhFr− and the rabbit cornea cell line SIRC were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Baboon primary aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) were kindly provided by J. Anderson and S. Hanson at Emory University (Atlanta, GA). Purified PDGF BB was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. A gene encoding the PDGFRβ, lacking the nucleotides encoding a portion of the 5′ end, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The missing portion of the gene, which included the secretion signal sequence, was constructed by oligonucleotide synthesis and used to assemble the complete PDGFRβ gene with an XbaI site at each end. This fragment was inserted into the XbaI site of the plasmid pVk (13Co M.S. Avdalovic N.M. Caron P.C. Avdalovic M.V. Scheinberg D.A. Queen C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1149-1154PubMed Google Scholar) and co-transfected together with plasmid pVgl (13Co M.S. Avdalovic N.M. Caron P.C. Avdalovic M.V. Scheinberg D.A. Queen C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1149-1154PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a dhfr gene, into CHO/dhFr− cells using the calcium phosphate method essentially as described (14Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Methotrexate-resistant transfectants expressing the PDGFRβ were identified by indirect immunofluorescence using a commercially available antibody (Genzyme) and cloned by single cell sorting using a FACStarPLUS (Becton Dickinson). The resulting cell line (CHO C4) was responsive to PDGF BB as evidenced by increased DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in the presence of the growth factor as demonstrated previously (15Escobedo J.A. Keating M.T. Ives H.E. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1482-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To produce a soluble form of PDGFRβ (sPDGFRβ), the gene encoding the protein was truncated immediately before the transmembrane sequence, and a stop codon followed by an XbaI restriction endonuclease site was inserted. This gene fragment was inserted into the XbaI site of pVk. The resulting plasmid was cotransfected as above into CHO/dhFr− cells together with plasmid pVgl. Transfectants resistant to methotrexate were selected and used for production of sPDGFRβ by growing to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum, then replacing this serum-containing medium with protein-free medium and incubating for an additional 72 h. The exhausted medium was harvested and passed over a wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose column. The column was washed and eluted withN-acetyl-d-glucosamine. The eluant containing sPDGFRβ was dialyzed and concentrated to approximately 300 μg/ml. The purified protein was >95% pure based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. A panel of monoclonal antibodies was generated against the extracellular portion of the human PDGFRβ by immunizing outbred Swiss Webster mice with 50 μg of purified sPDGFRβ in RIBI adjuvant (ImmunoChem Research). The mice received booster immunizations of 50 μg of PDGFRβ every 1–2 weeks. Mice were bled 1 week following each boost, and the sera were tested for reactivity with sPDGFRβ by an ELISA. The mouse exhibiting the highest serum titer of anti-PDGFRβ activity was sacrificed 3 days after receiving a final boost of 50 μg of sPDGFRβ, and hybridomas were prepared. Hybridoma supernatants were tested for reactivity with sPDGFRβ by an ELISA (see below). Hybridomas that exhibited reactivity were expanded and cloned. All monoclonal antibodies reactive with soluble PDGFRβ were assayed for reactivity against cell surface-expressed PDGFRβ on the surface of CHO C4 transfectants by flow cytometry. Only antibodies demonstrating reactivity with cell surface-expressed PDGFRβ were further characterized. Immulon 1 96-well plates (Dynatech Laboratories Inc.) were coated with sPDGFRβ by adding 100 μl of a 0.5 μg/ml solution of sPDGFRβ in phosphate-buffered saline to each well. After an overnight incubation at 4 C°, 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween 20 were added to each well to block unoccupied protein binding sites. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% Tween 20. Dilutions of purified antibody or antibody-containing supernatants (100 μl) were added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, after which it was washed three times as described above. One hundred μl of a 1 μg/ml solution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated GAMIgG (Tago, Inc.) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 additional h at room temperature, after which they were washed three times. One hundred μl of peroxidase substrate (Bio-Rad) was added to each well, the plate was incubated for 15–60 min, and absorbance at 415 nm was determined. CHO C4 cells were harvested, washed twice with cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The assay was carried out in triplicate by incubating 100 μl of the cell suspension with either no antibody (to determine maximum binding), 5 μg of the indicated antibody, or 100 ng of cold PDGF BB (to saturate specific binding sites and determine nonspecific binding) in 12 × 75 mm polystyrene tubes for 15 min at 4 C°. Each sample received 1.0 ng of 125I-labeled PDGF BB (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) and was incubated for an additional 60 min at 4 C°. Unbound125I-labeled PDGF BB was separated from that bound to the cell by layering the sample over a mixture of 80% dibutylphthalate, 20% olive oil in a Reagiergefäβ test tube (Sarstedt, Inc.) and microfuging briefly to pellet the cells through the oil mixture (16Lowenthal J.W. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 6.1.1-6.1.7Google Scholar). The tubes were placed in dry ice to freeze the contents, the tip of the tube containing the cell pellet was cut off into a vial, and radioactivity was determined in a gamma counter. Antibody neutralization of PDGF BB-mediated proliferation was assessed using CHO C4 cells. The amount of PDGF BB that induced 90% maximum proliferation (25–50 ng/ml) as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation was selected for use in the assay. All assays were carried out in triplicate or quadruplicate. The assay involved preparing a 96-well plate containing 50,000 CHO C4 cells/well in Ham's F-12 plus 10% fetal calf serum. After a 24-h incubation, the medium was replaced with Ham's F-12 plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and an additional 24-h incubation served to put the cells into a quiescent state. Varying concentrations of anti-PDGFRβ or control antibodies were added. Following a 2-h incubation with antibody, PDGF BB was added. The cells were incubated overnight, then 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well. The cells were incubated for an additional 4 h then harvested using a PHD cell harvester (Cambridge Technology, Inc.). [3H]Thymidine incorporation in each well was determined with a scintillation counter. The same assay was used to measure the inhibitory activity of the antibodies on baboon SMC and the rabbit cornea cell line SIRC. Domain deletion mutants of PDGFRβ were prepared by cloning the PDGFRβ gene fragment (with various extracellular domains deleted) into the XbaI site of a version of pVgl that had the IgG1 constant region replaced with the human lambda constant region cDNA. This allowed production of fusion proteins that contained varying numbers of the PDGFRβ extracellular domains with the human lambda light chain constant domain at the carboxyl terminus. The mutants included only the first, the first and second, the first through third, and the first through fourth extracellular domains of PDGFRβ fused to the human lambda light chain constant domain. The lambda constant domain served as a tag and allowed the deletion mutants to be captured onto the surface of an ELISA plate. The five-domain extracellular portion of the human PDGFRβ with no lambda constant domain (sPDGFRβ) served as the positive control. The domain deletion mutants were captured onto an ELISA plate using a goat anti-human lambda chain antiserum (Tago). Deletion mutant binding was confirmed using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human lambda antiserum. The sPDGFRβ (domains 1–5) was directly coated onto the plate as described above. Reactivity of the antibodies with the domain deletion mutants was determined by incubating antibody with the plate-bound deletion mutants for 1 h, washing away unbound antibody, and developing the assay with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated GAMIgG. The dimerization status of PDGFRβ on the surface of CHO C4 cells exposed to PDGF BB was carried out in a manner similar to that described previously (17Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Einstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular portion of the human PDGFRβ and assayed the antibodies both for the ability to inhibit radiolabeled PDGF BB binding to the receptor as well as the capacity to inhibit PDGF BB-mediated cell proliferation. The antibodies examined fell into three categories. Fig. 1 presents the results for a representative example of each category. Several antibodies, such as M4TS.15, had little or no effect on PDGF BB binding and likewise did not inhibit PDGF-mediated proliferation. Another class of antibodies, represented by M4TS.22, inhibited both PDGF BB binding to PDGFRβ and PDGF BB-mediated proliferation. A single antibody (M4TS.11) exhibited no inhibitory activity in the PDGF BB binding assay; however, it did display inhibition of PDGF BB-mediated proliferation. Despite the difference in the ability to inhibit binding of PDGF BB to cells expressing PDGFRβ, M4TS.11 and M4TS.22 were indistinguishable in their ability to inhibit PDGF BB-mediated proliferation (Fig.1 B). The easily detectable ability of M4TS.11 to inhibit PDGF BB-mediated proliferation in the absence of the ability to block ligand interaction with receptor implied that the antibody was influencing an event post-ligand binding that was a prerequisite for the induction of the mitogenic signal. PDGFRβ is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose activity is dependent upon ligand-mediated dimerization (5Claesson-Welsch L. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To determine if M4TS.11 influenced the ability of PDGF BB to induce receptor dimerization, we examined the status of PDGFRβ on cells exposed to PDGF BB in the presence and absence of this antibody. CHO C4 cells were exposed to 125I-labeled PDGF BB after a preincubation with no antibody or with M4TS.11 or M4TS.15. The cells were then treated with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) to covalently cross-link the 125I-PDGF BB·PDGFRβ complex (17Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Einstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40, and lysate aliquots were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 6% gel. A 6% gel was selected to allow migration of all cross-linked complexes into the gel, and this was confirmed by the lack of radioactivity detected at the top of the gel as well as the ability to recover between 86 and 94% of the counts loaded from the gel lanes (data not shown). Density scans of autoradiographs of the gels indicated that radioactive PDGF BB predominantly migrated in the two areas of the gel that corresponded to the molecular weight of the125I-labeled PDGF BB cross-linked to one (monomer) or two (dimer) PDGFRβ molecules (unbound 125I-labeled PDGF BB runs off the gel). Cells preincubated with M4TS.11 before exposure to125I-labeled PDGF BB and cross-linking had approximately 50% that of the level of receptor dimer (with a corresponding 100% increase in receptor monomer) as compared with cells exposed to PDGF BB in the presence M4TS.15 or no antibody (Fig. 2). To identify the portion of the PDGFRβ recognized by the M4TS antibodies, domain deletion mutants of the extracellular portion of PDGFRβ were constructed and expressed in a soluble form. The deletion mutants included the first, first and second, first through third, and first through fourth extracellular domains of PDGFRβ fused to the human lambda immunoglobulin constant domain (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each deletion mutant was tested for reactivity with M4TS.11, M4TS.15, or M4TS.22. This analysis revealed that M4TS.11 exhibited reactivity only when extracellular domain 4 of the PDGFRβ was present (Fig. 3). M4TS.15 required the presence of extracellular domain 2, whereas reactivity with M4TS.22 was dependent on the presence of extracellular domain 3 (Fig. 3). It was of interest to determine if the M4TS.11 and M4TS.22 antibodies could react with the PDGFRβ from species other than human and if they would function as a PDGF BB antagonist for these species. PDGFRβ expression has been reported for a variety of cell types derived from a number of mammalian species, and human PDGF BB can induce proliferation in these cells. Baboon SMC (18Koyoma N. Hart C.E. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and the rabbit SIRC line (19Knorr M. Steuhl K.P. Tatje D. Hoppe J. Investig. Opthalmol.

Preliminary indirect immunofluorescence experiments revealed that both M4TS.11 and M4TS.22 could bind baboon SMC, but only M4TS.11 reacted with SIRC cells (data not shown). Fig. 4 demonstrates that preincubation with either M4TS.11 or M4TS.22 significantly decreased PDGF BB-mediated proliferation of the baboon SMC. M4TS.11, but not M4TS.22, exhibited a similar effect on the rabbit SIRC cell line (Fig. 4). The M4TS.11 antibody has also been shown to inhibit PDGF BB mitogenesis of smooth muscle cells from both the rat and the pig. 2E. Poptic, unpublished data. We have generated a panel of antibodies against the extracellular domain of the human PDGFRβ. Characterization of this panel revealed that antibodies fell into three groups: 1) those that had little or no effect on ligand binding or PDGF BB-induced proliferation, 2) those that prevented interaction of the ligand with the receptor and thus prevented ligand-induced proliferation, and 3) a single antibody, M4TS.11, that had no detectable effect on ligand binding but was a potent inhibitor of ligand-induced proliferation. The ability of M4TS.11 to inhibit mitogenesis in the absence of any detectable effect on PDGF BB binding to the receptor implied that the antibody was interfering with an event required for triggering mitogenesis but distinct from ligand binding. Ligand-induced dimerization of transmembrane tyrosine kinases such as PDGFRβ is requisite for transmission of the mitogenic signal (6Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Examination of the status of PDGFRβ on cells preincubated with M4TS.11 and then exposed to PDGF BB revealed a decrease in the level of receptor dimer and a corresponding increase in receptor monomer as compared with the levels observed in cells preincubated with a control antibody (Fig. 2). This indicates that M4TS.11 impairs the ability of PDGF BB to induce receptor dimerization, a characteristic that makes it a PDGF BB antagonist that is equivalent in potency to an antibody such as M4TS.22 that directly inhibits PDGF BB binding. Deletion mutants allowed us to map the determinant recognized by M4TS.11, M4TS.15, and M4TS.22 to the fourth, second, and third extracellular Ig-like domains, respectively. Domain 3 is required for M4TS.22 binding, indicating that the antibody recognizes a determinant that either resides in domain 3 or is composed of portions of domain 3 and domain(s) 1 and/or 2. The first three domains of PDGFRβ are required to form the ligand binding site (20Heidaran M. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), thus M4TS.22 reacts with the receptor at a site near to, or possibly identical with, that part of PDGFRβ that binds PDGF BB. This is consistent with the observation that M4TS.22 can inhibit PDGF BB-induced proliferation by preventing the interaction of the ligand with the receptor. M4TS.15, an antibody that has no effect on PDGF BB binding or proliferation, reacts with each of the deletion mutants that contains domain 2. Thus, despite the involvement of domain 2 in forming the ligand binding site, the portion recognized by M4TS.15 is spatially distinct from that which interacts with PDGF BB. The requirement of domain 4 for reactivity with M4TS.11 indicates that the determinant recognized by this antibody is distinct from the ligand binding portion of the PDGFRβ formed by domains 1–3 and suggests that domain 4, despite being uninvolved in PDGF BB binding (20Heidaran M. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), does participate in transmitting the mitogenic signal to the cell. Each of these antibodies appears very different from the anti-PDGFRβ monoclonal antibody 2A1E2, which inhibits ligand binding and mitogenesis but reacts with the fifth extracellular domain of PDGFRβ (21Ramakrishnan V. Escobedo M.A. Fretto L.J. Seroogy J.J. Tomlinson J.E. Wolf D.L. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which M4TS.11 inhibits PDGF BB-induced mitogenesis appears very similar to that of antibodies that have been described by Blechman et al. (17Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Einstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Blechman J.M. Lev S. Brizzi M.F. Leitner O. Pegoraro L. Givol D. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4399-4406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) against the stem cell factor receptor (SCFR). The SCFR, which is the product of the c-kit proto-oncogene, is a receptor protein kinase that, like PDGFRβ, transmits a signal when dimerized by the divalent ligand, SCF (23Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsch L. Siegbahn A. Zsebo K.M. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4121-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Antibodies that bind to the fourth Ig-like domain of SCFR inhibit SCF-induced dimerization but have no effect on SCF binding (17Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Einstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Blechman J.M. Lev S. Brizzi M.F. Leitner O. Pegoraro L. Givol D. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4399-4406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings, coupled with the inability of a domain-four deletion mutant of SCFR to dimerize in the presence of SCF, have led to the hypothesis that divalent ligand binding per se is insufficient for receptor dimerization but rather exposes an intrinsic dimerization site on the receptor that mediates subsequent dimerization and thus, signal transmission (17Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Einstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The behavior of M4TS.11, which binds to the analogous domain four of the PDGFRβ, is consistent with the above hypothesis and supports the contention that the proposed mechanism may be a general feature of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (17Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Einstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, the reactivity of M4TS.11 with PDGFRβ from a wide variety of species indicates that the determinant recognized by the antibody is evolutionarily conserved. This is a characteristic expected of a portion of the molecule essential for proper function. The unique ability of M4TS.11 to inhibit PDGF BB-mediated proliferation while allowing the interaction of this ligand with PDGFRβ may make it an especially efficient PDGF BB antagonist in vivo, as local fluctuations in the concentration of PDGF BB should have no effect on the binding of antibody to the receptor. An antibody that inhibits PDGF BB-induced proliferation by blocking ligand binding could theoretically be displaced by high local concentrations of the ligand, possibly negating the inhibitory effect and making it a less effective antagonist than M4TS.11. The involvement of PDGF in a variety of human disease conditions makes it an attractive target for therapy, and neutralizing the activity of PDGF with an antibody is a viable strategy. Advances over the past decade have made human treatment with monoclonal antibodies a feasible therapeutic approach. The major complication of the human anti-murine antibody response has largely been eliminated by “humanization” techniques, which transform a murine monoclonal antibody into a molecule that is indistinguishable from a human immunoglobulin (24Co M.S. Queen C. Nature. 1991; 351: 501-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The excellent safety profile and extended half-life of such antibodies (25Co M.S. Baker J. Bednark K. Janzek E. Neruda W. Mayer P. Plot R. Stumper B. Vasquez M. Queen C. Loibner H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1118-1125PubMed Google Scholar) make them ideal candidates for applications such as interfering with the PDGF system. We have successfully humanized both the M4TS.11 and M4TS.22 antibodies and retained all the characteristics of the original murine versions, 3C. N. Chang, et al., manuscript in preparation. thereby making these antibodies excellent candidates for potential development as therapeutic agents.

However, the biosynthetic pathway responsible for the production of acylacetyl-GPC is not well understood. In the present investigation, we have demonstrated that the acyl analogs of PAF are also the major products from calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells in response to a time-dependent stimulation of ATP (10−3m), bradykinin (10−8m), or ionophore A23187 (2 μm). In addition, we have found that the CoA-independent PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase recently identified by us is concurrently and transiently induced with maximal 4-fold enhancement at 5 min and returned to near basal level by 10 min treatment of endothelial cells with ATP. Acid phosphatase reduces the increased PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase activity from the homogenates of ATP-activated endothelial cells. Reduced PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase activity can be restored by incubating the acid phosphatase-treated homogenates with ATP (5 mm) and Mg2+ (10 mm). Furthermore, okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor, incubated with endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner (1–100 nm) for 10-min potentiates and sustained the stimulation of PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase activity by ATP. On the other hand, genistein, tyrphostin-25 (inhibitors of tyrosine-specific protein kinase), and calphostin C (an inhibitor of protein kinase C) block the activation of PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase by ATP. These results are consistent with the notion that ATP regulates the transacetylase activity by reversible activation and inactivation via the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle. ATP also augments the activities of alkyllyso-GPC/acyllyso-GPC:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase. However, the activation of the acetyltransferases precedes that of the transacetylase with peak activation occurring at 1–2 min of the ATP treatment. In addition, sodium vanadate, also an inhibitor of protein phosphatase, stimulates the increase in the incorporation of [3H]acetate into acyl[3H]acetyl-GPC of the ATP-treated endothelial cells. Collectively, our data show that both acetyltransferases and transacetylase participate in and contribute to the biosynthesis of acyl analogs of PAF in a coordinate fashion in endothelial cells.

Different cell types from various species activated by specific stimuli are able to produce PAF (4Lee T.-c. Snyder F. Platelet Activating Factor and Related Lipid Mediators. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987: 115-133Google Scholar). The chemical structure of PAF is originally elucidated as 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkylacetyl-GPC, 5–7). However, it recently becomes apparent that acylacetyl-GPC can be the predominant product in certain cell types. For instance, the major compound produced by human umbilical vein endothelial cells activated with thrombin and ionophore A23187 (8Clay K.L. Johnson C. Worthen G.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Rosenthal M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) is acylacetyl-GPC. Also, depending on the agonist used, either alkylacetyl-GPC or acylacetyl-GPC can be synthesized within the same cell type. For example, the human basophils generate mainly acylacetyl-GPC in response to anti-IgE and mostly alkylacetyl-GPC in response to ionophore A23187 (13Triggiani M. Schleimer R.P. Warner J.A. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 660-666PubMed Google Scholar). Although the biological activities of acylacetyl-GPC are >500-fold less potent than alkylacetyl-GPC in lowering the blood pressure of spontaneous hypertensive rats, in releasing serotonin from rabbit platelets (14Blank M.L. Cress E.A. Lee T.-c. Malone B. Surles J.R. Piantadosi C. Hajdu J. Snyder F. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol.

Johnson C. Mazer B.D. Clay K.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 566-573PubMed Google Scholar), however, acylacetyl-GPC can act as a specific noncompetitive inhibitor of alkylacetyl-GPC-induced activation of the human neutrophils and leukotriene C4 release from the human leukocytes (10Triggiani M.

Furthermore, 1-acyl analogs of PAF at nm concentrations can prime polymorphonuclear leukocytes for enhanced O2− production after stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe or human recombinant C5a (17Pinckard R.N. Showell H.J. Castillo R. Lear C. Breslow R. McManus L.M. Woodard D.S. Ludwig J.C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3528-3535PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, acylacetyl-GPC has the ability to decrease the susceptibility of the low density lipoprotein particles to oxidative modification mediated by copper ions, monocytes, or endothelial cells, whereas PAF has no effect (18Maziere C. Djavahery-Mergny M. Auclair M. Maziere J.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The pathways leading to the accumulation of acylacetyl-GPC are not completely understood. It is suggested that the remodeling pathway (3Snyder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) is responsible for the biosynthesis of alkylacetyl-GPC/acylacetyl-GPC during short term stimulation by agonists in endothelial cells (19Holland M.R. Venable M.E. Whatley R.E. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22883-22890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first step of the remodeling pathway involved the conversion of alkylarachidonoyl-GPC/acylarachidonoyl-GPC to alkyllyso-GPC/acyllyso-GPC by a putative phospholipase A2or/and a CoA-independent transacylase (20Uemura Y.

The alkyllyso-GPC/acyllyso-GPC formed is subsequently acetylated by the alkyllyso-GPC/acyllyso-GPC:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (19Holland M.R. Venable M.E. Whatley R.E. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M.

Increases in intracellular calcium concentration and protein kinase C activate the phospholipase A2 that is involved in the synthesis of PAF (25Whatley R.E. Nelson P. Zimmerman G.A. Stevens D.L.

The alkyllyso-GPC:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (26Lenihan D.J. Lee T.-c. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Gomez-Cambronero J. Mato J.M. Vivanco F. Sanchez-Crespo M. Biochem.

Alkylacetyl-GPC and acylacetyl-GPC have different catabolic routes. In most cell types, alkylacetyl-GPC is hydrolyzed by acetylhydrolase to form alkyllyso-GPC and then the alkyllyso-GPC is reacylated to produce alkylacyl-GPC (see reviews herein). On the other hand, the major metabolic pathway for the acylacetyl-GPC is the removal of acyl group at the sn-1 position by a yet to be characterized 1-acylhydrolase (30Triggiani M. D'Souza D.M. Chilton F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6928-6935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acetyl-GPC formed from this reaction is further degraded to glycerophosphocholine, choline, or phosphocholine (30Triggiani M. D'Souza D.M. Chilton F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6928-6935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is reported that lysophospholipase can also catalyze the stoichiometric conversion of acylacetyl-GPC to acetyl-GPC (31van den Bosch H. Sturk F. ten Cate J.W. Aarsman A.J. Lipids. 1991; 26: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 32Aarsman A.J. Neys F.W. van den Bosch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, the activity of lysophospholipase may control the level of acyl analogs of PAF, because peritoneal macrophages that preferentially synthesize acyl analogs of PAF contain only one-sixth of the lysophospholipase activity in comparison to that of alveolar macrophages which primarily make PAF (33Nakagawa Y. Sugai M. Karasawa K. Tokumura A. Tsukatani H. Setaka M. Nojima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Besides, the amounts of acylacetyl-GPC produced within a specific cell type can be increased by blocking the phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-sensitive phospholipase A1 or lysophospholipase activity (31van den Bosch H. Sturk F. ten Cate J.W. Aarsman A.J. Lipids. 1991; 26: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Sturk A. Schaap M.C.L. Prins A. ten Cate J.W. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys.

We have previously identified a novel CoA-independent and PAF-dependent transacetylase that transfers the acetate group from PAF to a variety of lysophospholipids; acyllyso-GPC is the most active acceptor that converts to acylacetyl-GPC by the transacetylase (36Lee T.-c. Uemura Y. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, we investigate the possibility that PAF-dependent transacetylase may be involved in the biosynthesis of acyl analogs of PAF. Our results demonstrate that the PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase is induced severalfold during agonist-coupled activation of the endothelial cells and is most likely to be regulated via covalent modification of the enzyme through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Based on the temporal relationships that exist between the synthesis of acylacetyl-GPC and induction of the transacetylase activity in stimulus-activated cells, our findings suggest that the PAF-dependent transacetylase participates in the production and controls the level of acylacetyl-GPC in endothelial cells. 1-Hexadecyl-2-[3H]acetyl-GPC (7.1 Ci/mmol), [3H]acetate (1.9 Ci/mmol), and [3H]acetyl-CoA (1.54 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Hexadecylacetyl-GPC, hexadecyllyso-GPC, palmitoyllyso-GPC, acetyl-CoA, phospholipase C type V fromBacillus cereus, acid phosphatase from potato, ionophore A23187, thrombin, bradykinin, ATP, genistein, and tyrphostin 25 were the products of Sigma. Sodium salt of okadaic acid, calphostin C, KT5720, H-89 dihydrochloride, and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) were from Calbiochem. Alkylacetyl-GPC and oleoylacetyl-GPC were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. All cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells (CCL-209) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium with 20% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks, and only the confluent monolayers between passages 20 and 25 were used for experiments. Unless indicated otherwise, the cells were washed twice with 10 ml of Hank's balanced salt solutions (HBSS) before starting the experiments. Washed monolayers of calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells were incubated with 25 μCi of [3H]acetate in the presence of 10 ml of HBSS, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and with or without agonist, thrombin (2 units/ml), bradykinin (10−8m), ATP (10−3m), or ionophore A23187 (2 μm) at 37 °C for various times as indicated in the figures. At the end of incubations, the media were removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with 5 ml of HBSS, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) before scraping into 3 ml of methanol. The cellular lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41794) Google Scholar) except that 2% of acetic acid was included in the methanol. The thin layer chromatographic solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (50:25:8:6, v/v/v/v) was used to isolate the radyl[3H]acetyl-GPC fraction. Radioactivity in lipid fractions separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) was determined by area or zonal scraping of the silica gel into vials for liquid scintillation counting. The purity of the isolated radyl[3H]acetyl-GPC was further confirmed by using a TLC solvent system of chloroform/methanol/concentrated NH4OH/H2O (60:35:8:2.3; v/v/v/v). The purified samples of radyl[3H]acetyl-GPC were then treated with phospholipase C to form radyl[3H]acetylglycerols that were derivatized with benzoic anhydride. The benzoate derivatives of radyl[3H]acetylglycerols were separated into acylacetyl-, alkylacetyl-, and alk-1-enylacetylglycerol benzoates on silica G TLC plates as described (38Blank M.L. Cress E.A.

PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase and PAF:lysoplasmalogen transacetylase were determined as reported earlier by us (36Lee T.-c. Uemura Y. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, standard incubations consisted of 50 μm PAF (0.5 μCi in 50 μl of 0.1% bovine serum albumin/saline), 300 μm palmitoyllyso-GPC or lysoplasmalogen (in 50 μl of 0.1% bovine serum albumin/saline), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 100 μg of homogenate protein in a final volume of 0.50 ml. The incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 15 and 30 min to ensure that the enzyme activity is measured under zero order kinetic. The cell homogenates were prepared by scraping agonist-treated or nontreated cells from the surface of the flasks into 2 ml of homogenizing buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF). The cell suspensions were homogenized by using an ultrasonic cell disruptor (Microson™) at 30% power output for 15 s × 5 times. The extracted lipid product (>95% as radyl[3H]acetyl-GPC) was treated by phospholipase C. The resulting radyl[3H]acetylglycerols were converted to their respective benzoate derivatives and analyzed by a combination of TLC and liquid scintillation counting as described in the above section. Alkyllyso-GPC/acyllyso-GPC:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase and PAF acetylhydrolase activities were measured according to the methods we previously described (39Lee T.-c. Vallari D.S. Snyder F. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 40Lee T.-c. Fitzgerald V. Chatterjee R. Malone B. Snyder F. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1994; 9: 267-283PubMed Google Scholar) except that the cell homogenates were used as the enzyme sources in most of the experiments. The protein content of the enzyme preparations was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the possible involvement of PAF-dependent transacetylase in the biosynthesis of acylacetyl-GPC of endothelial cells, it was necessary to establish in our laboratory that the stimulus-treated endothelial cells produced acyl analogs of PAF as the predominant product. We chose bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells as a model system for the convenience. Data in Fig. 1 A showed that the incorporation of [3H]acetate into radyl[3H]acetyl-GPC was increased in a time-dependent fashion with noticeable rise at 1 min and approaching plateau at 10 min, when the endothelial cells were incubated with ATP (10−3m). Treatment of endothelial cells with bradykinin (10−8m) or ionophore A23187 (2 μm) yielded similar time course responses (data not shown). However, the increase in radylacetyl-GPC synthesis was minimal in thrombin-treated (2 units/ml) endothelial cells (data not shown). These results were consistent with the findings demonstrated by Garcia et al. (12Garcia M.C. Mueller H.W. Rosenthal M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). They showed that 1 μm bradykinin or 10 μm ionophore A23187 enhanced the [3H]acetate incorporation into radylacetyl-GPC in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Besides, our data were similar to that reported by Whatley et al.(42Whatley R.E. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 321-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in that cultured endothelial cells from various bovine blood vessels responded to ATP, bradykinin, or ionophore A23187 but not to thrombin stimulation in generating an increase in PAF production. Garcia et al. (12Garcia M.C. Mueller H.W. Rosenthal M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) described that when calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells were treated with ionophore A23187 (10 μm), the primary product formed under the conditions was acyl analogs of PAF rather than PAF. We found that acyl analogs of PAF were also the major product when calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells were stimulated with ATP (approximately 85% as acylacetyl-GPC) (Fig. 1 B), bradykinin (about 67% as acylacetyl-GPC), or ionophore A23187 (nearly over 80% as acylacetyl-GPC) (data not shown). The kinetics of the time-dependent incorporation of [3H]acetate into the subclasses of radylacetyl-GPC were similar among the three agonists tested. On the other hand, the kinetic of the time-dependent incorporation of [3H]acetate into the subclasses of radylacetyl-GPC treated with thrombin was different from that treated with ATP, bradykinin, or ionophore A23187. It is possible that the kinetics of the time-dependent incorporation of [3H]acetate in thrombin-treated endothelial cells reflected the turnover of the endogenous subclasses of radylacetyl-GPC, since bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells did not respond to thrombin activation. Since ATP caused the highest stimulation on the incorporation of [3H]acetate into radyl[3H]acetyl-GPC among the physiological agonists we tested, ATP was chosen as the agonist in the subsequent experiments. Fig. 2 depicted that ATP induced a rapid and transient increase in PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase activity with maximal activation at 5 min. The activity of PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase returned to near basal levels after 10 min of ATP treatment. The increase in transacetylase activity at 5 min incubation of ATP with endothelial cells was about 4-fold over that in the untreated cells. It was unlikely that the increase in PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase activity by ATP was due to de novo protein synthesis, because the induction of the transacetylase activity by ATP was a rapid process (within 2 min). Therefore, we investigated the possibility that the activity of PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase may be regulated by ATP through covalent modifications, specifically through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. When the homogenates of ATP-stimulated endothelial cells were treated with an acid phosphatase from potato for 15 min, a decrease of 61% in transacetylase activity was observed (Fig. 3, 2nd column versus 1st column). The percent of decrease in transacetylase activity depended on the concentrations of acid phosphatase used and the lengths of the preincubation times of the homogenates with acid phosphatase (data not shown). Furthermore, preincubation of the homogenates with boiled acid phosphatase (at 100 °C for 10 min) had no effect on the transacetylase activity (Fig. 3, 3rd column versus 1st column). On the other hand, addition of ATP (5 mm) plus Mg2+ (10 mm) to the homogenates of ATP-treated endothelial cells (Fig. 3, 4th column versus 1st column) or to the homogenates of ATP-stimulated endothelial cells that were pretreated with acid phosphatase (Fig. 3, 5th column versus 2nd column) could further potentiate the transacetylase activity. These data from in vitro experiments suggested that the transacetylase activity is activated/inactivated through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. To further substantiate the fact that the transacetylase activity is regulated through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, several following experiments using whole cell systems were performed. Endothelial cells were preincubated with various concentrations of okadaic acid (1 to 100 nm) for 30 min and then incubated with ATP (10−3m) for an additional 10 min. The activity of transacetylase was closed to near basal levels when endothelial cells were treated with ATP for 10 min (see Fig. 2). Okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A (43Cohen P. Holmes F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 17: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1247) Google Scholar), induced a 2-fold increase in PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase activity over that of the 10-min ATP-treated control (Fig. 4). Optimal concentrations of okadaic acid that potentiated the ATP-augmented transacetylase activity occurred between 10 and 100 nm (Fig. 4). Therefore, these results were consistent with the notion that by blocking the dephosphorylation of the proteins with okadaic acid, the transacetylase activity is amplified. A different protein phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), likewise sustained and prolonged the activation of transacetylase in calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells treated with ATP for 10 min (data not shown). When endothelial cells were preincubated with a selective inhibitor of tyrosine-specific protein kinase, tyrphostin-25 (44Levitzki A. Gazit A. Osherov N. Posner I. Gilon C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45Glaser K.B. Sung A. Bauer J. Weichman B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) for 10 min, and incubated with ATP for additional 5 min, tyrphostin-25 blocked the induction of PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase activity by ATP in a dose-dependent manner with close to total inhibition at 50 μm (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained when another inhibitor of tyrosine-specific protein kinase, genistein (46Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used (data not shown). These data provide added support that PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase activity is controlled by reversible activation and inactivation through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. To gain insight as to which of the protein kinase(s) may be involved in the activation of PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase besides tyrosine-specific protein kinase, we tested the effects of inhibitors for three different kinds of protein kinases, namely protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and casein kinase II, on both PAF:lysoplasmalogen transacetylase and PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase activities (TableI). Based on the results we obtained previously from the mixed substrate experiments, the transfer of the acetate group from PAF to either lysoplasmalogen or acyllyso-GPC is catalyzed by a single enzyme (47Lee T.-c. Ou M. Shinozaki K. Malone B. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that the effects of various protein kinase inhibitors are similar for both PAF:lysoplasmalogen transacetylase and PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase activities (Table I). Only calphostin C, a specific inhibitor for protein kinase C, exerted inhibitory effect on both transacetylase activities, whereas the inhibitors for protein kinase A (KT 5720 or H-89) and casein kinase II (DRB) did not block neither ATP-induced transacetylase activities. Thus, our data suggest that tyrosine protein kinase and protein kinase C are directly or indirectly involved in the activation of the transacetylase activity through protein phosphorylation.Table IEffect of inhibitors of protein kinase on the activities of PAF:lysoplasmalogen and PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylases in endothelial cells treated with ATPInhibitorsPAF:lysoplasmalogen transacetylasePAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylase% controlCalphostin C (1 μm)4432KT 5720 (2 μm)117NDH-89 (10 μm)11197DRB (60 μm)8893The methods used to assay PAF:lysoplasmalogen and PAF:acyllyso-GPC transacetylases were the same as described under “Experimental Procedures” except the inhibitors at the indicated concentrations were preincubated with endothelial cells for either 30 min (calphostin C, KT 5720, and H-89) or 15 min (DRB) before further incubation with ATP for additional 5 min.

https://openalex.org/W1966136233,"The requirement of mitochondrial hsp70 (mt-hsp70) for the import of a series of preproteins containing hydrophobic sorting signals into isolated yeast mitochondria was investigated. Here we demonstrate that the presence of such a sorting signal in proximity to the N-terminal matrix-targeting sequence of a preprotein can secure a translocating polypeptide chain in the import channel in a manner that does not require mt-hsp70 activity. Trapping the translocating chain in this fashion leads to efficient processing by the mitochondrial processing peptidase and to complete translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space. These mt-hsp70-independent effects appear to be exerted at the level of the inner membrane through an interaction of the hydrophobic core of the sorting signal with component(s) of the translocase of the inner membrane. Hydrophobic sorting signals of inner membrane proteins inserted into the membrane from the matrix, as well as those of intermembrane space proteins, are capable of causing this mt-hsp70-independent stabilization, demonstrating that this phenomenon is not unique to those preproteins normally sorted to the intermembrane space.

The majority of these preproteins are targeted to the mitochondria by N-terminal targeting sequences that are processed in the matrix by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) 1The abbreviations used are: MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; mt-hsp70, mitochondrial hsp70; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; mt-hsp70, mitochondrial hsp70; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.(4Böhni P.

In addition to their targeting function, presequences initiate translocation across the inner membrane via the TIM (translocase of the inner membrane) machinery in a Δψ-dependent manner (6Schleyer M.

Binding of the molecular chaperone mt-hsp70, together with TIM44, a component of the TIM machinery, serves to hold the presequence upon its exposure to the matrix and thus confers unidirectionality on the import process (13Cyr D.M. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23751-23754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stuart R.A. Cyr D.M. Craig E.A. Neupert W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Studies with matrix-targeted preproteins suggested that binding of mt-hsp70 to the preprotein is the only or major force for achieving vectorial movement at the initial steps of import. Supporting this, retrograde movement of the translocating polypeptide was observed if bound mt-hsp70 was released (12Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 16Schneider H.C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 371: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the activity of mt-hsp70 was observed not to be required to initiate translocation of some preproteins targeted to the inner membrane (17Miller B. Cumsky M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Schwarz E. Seytter T. Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism by which mt-hsp70 function is bypassed, we analyzed the import of preproteins either destined for the inner membrane (which are first imported into the matrix; see below) or targeted to the intermembrane space. These preproteins all contain hydrophobic sorting signals. Their import in the presence or absence of functional mt-hsp70 was investigated. The precursor proteins chosen consisted of N-terminal segments of either pre-subunit 9 of the F1F0-ATPase or precytochromeb 2 fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The pre-subunit 9 chimera included the first transmembrane domain of subunit 9 fused to DHFR (pSu9-(1–112)-DHFR) and attains an Nout-Cin topology across the inner membrane in an export event following initial import into the matrix (20Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b 2, on the other hand, is targeted to the intermembrane space by a cleavable N-terminal bipartite presequence that is initially processed by MPP. According to recent evidence, the sorting signal targets cytochrome b 2 along a sorting pathway that involves at least partial passage through the matrix (21Gruhler A. Ono H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1349-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This import pathway differs, however, from that of matrix-targeted preproteins, as it appears to disengage from mt-hsp70 machinery at an early stage of the import process (22Gärtner F. Bömer U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6043-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that the hydrophobic sorting signal of a preprotein, when in proximity to a matrix-targeting sequence, can guarantee the maintenance of a translocating polypeptide in the TIM channel in the apparent absence of mt-hsp70 activity, thereby efficient MPP processing, as well as translocation across the outer membrane, takes place under conditions when further translocation across the inner membrane is blocked. Sorting signals of both a matrix-targeted protein and an intermembrane space protein were capable of mediating this mt-hsp70-independent securing of translocating polypeptides in the TIM machinery. The common denominator for maintaining a preprotein in the TIM channel is therefore a suitably positioned hydrophobic core rather than a sorting signal specific for one mitochondrial subcompartment over another. We propose that hydrophobic segments retard the sliding of a translocating chain in the import channel to facilitate recognition and lateral exit of those preproteins that become inserted into the inner membrane. Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type strain D273-10B was grown in lactate medium (23Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis D.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, New York1994: 538-544Google Scholar) at 30 °C, whereas the temperature-sensitive mutant of mt-hsp70,ssc1-3 (PK83), and its corresponding wild type (PK82) (24Gambill B.D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were grown at 24 °C. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (23Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis D.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, New York1994: 538-544Google Scholar, 27Fölsch H. Guiard W. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). DNA encoding precursor proteins was transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase as described previously for the cytochrome b 2-derived precursors (18Schwarz E. Seytter T. Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Rassow J. Hartl F.-U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the pSu9-DHFR fusion proteins (15Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). All precursor proteins were then synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (26Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were converted to mitoplasts prior to import as follows. Mitochondria were diluted 10-fold in 10 mm potassium Pi buffer and incubated for 20 min at 0 °C prior to reisolation and resuspension in SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2). Import was performed at 25 °C in the following buffer: 220 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 10 mmMOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) 25 mmpotassium phosphate, 5 mm MgOAc, and 1 mmMnCl2. Import mixtures contained 2 mm NADH, 3 μm hemin, 0.3 mg/ml mitochondrial protein, and 1% (v/v) reticulocyte lysate containing the radiolabeled precursor proteins. Samples were treated with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 0 °C under either non-swelling or hypotonic swelling conditions (see below) (27Fölsch H. Guiard W. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting onto nitrocellulose. The efficiency of swelling of the mitochondria was assessed following immunodecoration of the blot with antisera against endogenous cytochrome c peroxidase (soluble intermembrane space protein) and Mge1p (matrix-localized protein). Swelling in each case was >95% efficient, whereas the integrity of the inner membrane was not perturbed (data not shown). To stall the import of the various DHFR fusion proteins with methotrexate/NADPH, translation of the radiolabeled proteins was performed at 25 °C in the presence of 1 μm methotrexate. The reticulocyte lysates were diluted in import buffer containing 1 μmmethotrexate and 1 mm NADPH and incubated for 5 min at 0 °C followed by 5 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of mitochondria. Isolated mitochondria were depleted of their free matrix ATP by treatment with oligomycin and carboxyatractyloside as described previously (28Stuart R.A. Gruhler A. van der Klei I. Guiard B. Koll H. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). When matrix ATP levels were to be restored in depleted mitochondria following an import reaction, mitochondria were incubated in import buffer with oligomycin (20 μm) and apyrase (40 units/ml) for 3 min at 25 °C, and the carboxyatractyloside was omitted. (This depletion procedure resulted in a >90% import inhibition of the matrix-targeted preprotein pSu9-(1–69)-DHFR (data not shown).) Matrix ATP was replenished by incubating the reisolated and washed mitochondria in the presence of 5 mm succinate, 5 mm malate, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm NADH. pSu9-(1–112)-DHFR was arrested as a methotrexate translocation intermediate across the inner membrane in mitoplasts. Chemical cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate (200 μm) and immunoprecipitation of the resulting cross-linked adducts were performed as described previously (11Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Schneider H.-C. Klaus C. Dietmeier K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Protein determination and SDS-PAGE were performed according to the published methods of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar) and Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar), respectively. The detection of proteins after blotting onto nitrocellulose was performed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). To study the ability of hydrophobic sequences in preproteins to interact with the TIM translocation channel, the import of a number of precursor proteins was analyzed: the cytochrome b 2-derived preproteins pb 2-(1–76)-DHFR, pb 2-(1–85)-DHFR, and pb 2-(1–109)-DHFR and the matrix-targeted inner membrane protein pSu9-(1–112)-DHFR (Fig.1 A). Import was performed initially in the presence of methotrexate to arrest the DHFR domain in a tightly folded state at the surface of the outer membrane and thereby allow only translocation of the N-terminal region of the precursor across the inner membrane. The positions of the hydrophobic segments in the various preproteins relative to MPP processing sites are depicted in Fig. 1 A.Figure 3Roles of matrix ATP and membrane potential in stabilizing methotrexate-arrested import intermediates in mitochondria and mitoplasts. Radiolabeled preproteins were imported in the presence of methotrexate into mitochondria (black bars) or mitoplasts (hatched bars). Samples were divided and incubated for a further 30 min at 25 °C in the presence of ATP (+ATP), 2 μm valinomycin (+Val), or 20 μm oligomycin and 40 units/ml apyrase (+Oli/Ap). Samples were centrifuged, and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.

The zig-zag lines represent the matrix-targeting sequences that are cleaved once by MPP for cytochromeb 2-derived preproteins after amino acid 30 and twice for pSu9-(1–112)-DHFR after amino acids 36 and 66, as indicated by arrowheads. B, radiolabeled preproteins were imported in the presence of methotrexate (Mtx) into isolated wild-type (wt) or ssc1-3 (1-3) mitochondria, which had been preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C.

When imported into wild-type mitochondria, all precursors arrested with methotrexate were efficiently processed by MPP and were reisolated with the mitochondria (Fig. 1 B). Upon import into mitochondria containing inactivated mt-hsp70 from the temperature-sensitive ssc1-3 mutant (24Gambill B.D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), the processing of pb 2-(1–76)-DHFR, pb 2-(1–85)-DHFR, and pSu9-(1–112)-DHFR by MPP was inhibited. In contrast, pb 2-(1–109)-DHFR was efficiently processed to its intermediate-size form in the absence of mt-hsp70 activity (Fig. 1 B). Thus, despite that all three precursors contain hydrophobic segments, only methotrexate-arrested pb 2-(1–109)-DHFR can be accumulated as an MPP-processed translocation intermediate in intact mitochondria in the absence of functional mt-hsp70. On the other hand, all of these methotrexate-arrested preproteins can be accumulated as MPP-processed translocation intermediates upon import into mitoplasts in the absence of functional mt-hsp70 (data not shown). These findings suggest that the hydrophobic segment must extend at least to the inner membrane to secure stabilization of a translocation intermediate in an mt-hsp70-independent manner. Depletion of matrix ATP levels impairs the ATP-dependent activity of mt-hsp70 and leads to an almost complete block of import of hydrophilic matrix-targeted proteins (13Cyr D.M. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23751-23754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cytochrome b 2-derived precursor proteins analyzed were efficiently processed by MPP and were imported to a protease-resistant location in the mitochondria in a matrix ATP-independent manner (Fig. 2, upper panel,+ATP versus −ATP). A similar ATP independence of import was obtained for the pSu9-(1–112)-DHFR protein, despite that it is a matrix-targeted protein (Fig. 2, lower panel, +ATP versus −ATP). This is in marked contrast to the hydrophilic matrix-targeted precursor protein pSu9-(1–69)-DHFR, where import was strictly matrix ATP-dependent (Fig. 2, lower panel). Subfractionation of the mitochondria by hypotonic swelling revealed one important difference between the ATP-containing and ATP-depleted mitochondria. In the presence of matrix ATP, both pb 2-(1–76)-DHFR (Fig. 2, upper panel, lane 3) and pSu9-(1–112)-DHFR (Fig. 2,lower panel, lane 9) were imported into the mitochondrial matrix, as they were largely protease-protected in mitoplasts. In ATP-depleted mitochondria, efficient translocation across the outer membrane occurred, but both proteins became arrested in the inner membrane during import in an Nin-Cout topology. This is demonstrated by MPP processing of the N-terminal presequence and accessibility of the C-terminal DHFR domain to added protease in mitoplasts (Fig. 2,upper panel, lane 6; and lower panel,lane 12). Therefore, their import into the matrix was arrested at the level of the inner membrane in the absence of matrix ATP, indicating lack of functional mt-hsp70. In the case of the other cytochrome b 2-derived preproteins, an Nin-Cout topology was achieved following import into both matrix ATP-containing and ATP-depleted mitochondria. Thus, the sorting process appears to proceed in a manner independent of functional mt-hsp70 (Fig. 2, upper panel). The DHFR moiety following import of each of the preproteins analyzed was folded, irrespective of whether import into matrix ATP-containing or ATP-depleted mitochondria was performed (data not shown). In summary, preproteins of both intermembrane space- and matrix-targeted proteins bearing an N-terminal hydrophobic segment can be imported into mitochondria and become stabilized as translocation intermediates without requiring the activity of mt-hsp70. Stabilization in this manner appears to mediate the completion of translocation across the outer membrane in the absence of further mt-hsp70-driven import across the inner membrane. Import in this mt-hsp70-independent manner occurs not only for intermembrane space-targeted proteins, but also as efficiently for a matrix-targeted protein bearing a hydrophobic insertion signal. In contrast, hydrophilic matrix-targeted proteins cannot be stabilized as translocation intermediates in the absence of mt-hsp70 binding, and hence, their import displays an absolute dependence on mt-hsp70 action. We asked whether the hydrophobic segment in a preprotein is sufficient to prevent retrograde translocation of methotrexate-arrested intermediates when stalled at the level of the inner membrane following the release of bound mt-hsp70. Retrograde translocation of methotrexate-arrested preproteins was analyzed in both mitochondria and mitoplasts (Fig.3). pb 2-(1–76)-DHFR, pb 2-(1–85)-DHFR, and pb 2-(1–109)-DHFR were imported into either wild-type mitochondria or mitoplasts in the presence of methotrexate, where they became arrested as translocation intermediates, processed by MPP in the matrix (Fig. 3). These translocation intermediates were associated with the import sites in a stable manner when further incubated in the presence of ATP and a membrane potential. Depletion of the matrix ATP results in the release of bound mt-hsp70 from the translocating polypeptide chain (15Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the MPP-processed forms of pb 2-(1–76)-DHFR and pb 2-(1–85)-DHFR underwent retrograde translocation and were released from the mitochondria into the supernatant (Fig. 3, +Oli/Ap). Dissipation of the membrane potential by addition of valinomycin led also to a release of the methotrexate-arrested intermediates (Fig. 3, +Val). In contrast, the MPP-processed form of pb 2-(1–109)-DHFR remained associated with the mitochondria under both of these conditions, suggesting that it had become stabilized in a manner no longer dependent on Δψ and mt-hsp70 binding. When accumulated in mitoplasts, all preproteins remained tightly associated as translocation intermediates, even under conditions of matrix ATP depletion and Δψ dissipation (Fig. 3,hatched bars). A control hydrophilic matrix-targeted protein, pSu9-(1–69)-DHFR, when arrested with methotrexate in mitoplasts and mitochondria, underwent retrograde translocation upon both of these treatments (data not shown) (12Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In conclusion, penetration of the hydrophobic segment to the translocase of the inner membrane leads to maintenance in the import channel and prevention of retrograde translocation upon release of bound mt-hsp70. The common denominator for mt-hsp70-independent stabilization appears to be the interaction of a suitably positioned hydrophobic core with component(s) of the TIM channel, rather than a particular recognition of a sorting signal specific for one mitochondrial sublocation or another. To investigate the specificity of the sorting signal in more detail, we analyzed the import of a cytochrome b 2derivative, pb 2RIC-(1–167)-DHFR, which bears mutations in the essential cluster of positively charged amino acids (Arg-Lys-Arg) just prior to the hydrophobic core of the sorting signal. This mutated preprotein becomes missorted to the matrix in an ATP/mt-hsp70-dependent manner. In the absence of functional mt-hsp70, it is imported into the intermembrane space, where it is matured by the Imp1p protease (18Schwarz E. Seytter T. Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the presence of matrix ATP, pb 2RIC-(1–167)-DHFR was rapidly imported into the mitochondria (Fig. 4), where it was localized to the matrix (data not shown). The decrease in the signal at later time points reflected degradation of the matrix-accumulated species by the Pim1p protease, as reported previously (31Wagner I. Arlt H. van Dyck L. Langer T. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In ATP-depleted mitochondria, pb 2RIC-(1–167)-DHFR was imported with reduced kinetics (Fig. 4), and it accumulated in the intermembrane space (data not shown) (18Schwarz E. Seytter T. Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand, wild-type pb 2-(1–167)-DHFR was largely unaffected by alterations in the matrix ATP levels (Fig. 4). Despite the mutation in the sorting signal, pb 2RIC-(1–167)-DHFR could be as effectively imported into the mitochondria as its wild-type counterpart in the absence of functional mt-hsp70. We conclude therefore that the mt-hsp70-independent stabilization observed is not dependent on a functional sorting signal, but rather on the presence of an intact hydrophobic core. Do preproteins stabilized in an mt-hsp70-independent manner remain in the environment of the TIM machinery? In a first approach, pSu9-(1–112)-DHFR was arrested as a translocation intermediate in mitoplasts by import in the presence of methotrexate. Cross-linking to TIM17, TIM44, and mt-hsp70 was observed (Fig. 5 A, +ATP). Following arrest, the matrix ATP levels were reduced by an oligomycin/apyrase treatment as described previously (15Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The translocation intermediate was still found in the environment of components of the TIM machinery, as it could be cross-linked to TIM44 and TIM17, whereas the mt-hsp70-cross-linked adduct was missing (Fig. 5 A, −ATP). In a second approach, pSu9-(1–112)-DHFR was imported into matrix ATP-depleted mitochondria, where it accumulated in the intermembrane space spanning the inner membrane (Fig. 5 B,−chase). Upon replenishment of matrix ATP levels, this accumulated species could be further chased across the inner membrane into the matrix (Fig. 5 B, +chase). In conclusion, the arrested translocation intermediate in ATP-depleted mitochondria remains a productive one, associated with an active TIM machinery through its hydrophobic segment. The import of mitochondrial preproteins containing N-terminal hydrophobic segments does not depend on an early interaction with mt-hsp70. As we show here, this is in contrast to the import of hydrophilic proteins. By virtue of such hydrophobic segments, preproteins become stabilized in the TIM machinery. This occurs apparently by interaction with component(s) that either are part of the TIM channel or are in close proximity to the TIM channel. Stabilization in this manner can lead to processing by MPP in the matrix and completion of passage over the outer membrane. This observation sheds light on a number of aspects of mitochondrial protein import and sorting. First, import and stabilization in this manner are not unique to sorting signals that normally direct the preprotein to the intermembrane space, such as the cytochromeb 2 signal. Rather, matrix-targeted proteins containing hydrophobic segments (such as subunit 9 of the F1F0-ATPase and nonfunctional cytochromeb 2 sorting signals retaining intact hydrophobic cores) are also stabilized with equal efficiencies. A similar observation was made with cytochrome c 1-derived sorting signal mutants. 2A. Gruhler, I. Arnold, T. Seytter, B. Guiard, E. Schwarz, W. Neupert, and R. A. Stuart, unpublished results. Apparently, the hydrophobicity of a sorting signal, rather than its specificity for a particular sorting pathway, is responsible for the phenomenon of mt-hsp70-independent stabilization and import. Hence, the observed mt-hsp70 independence of import is not a characteristic of preproteins sorted to the intermembrane space, although it has been repeatedly taken as support for a “stop-transfer”-type mechanism. Second, the hydrophobic segments must penetrate into the inner membrane to stabilize the translocating polypeptide chain in the import channel in a membrane potential- and an mt-hsp70-independent manner. If the sorting signal is physically restricted from reaching as far as the inner membrane (e.g. by a folded DHFR moiety), both the presence of a membrane potential and binding of mt-hsp70 to the incoming polypeptide are necessary for the prevention of retrograde translocation. The mt-hsp70-independent stabilization may be exerted by an interaction of the hydrophobic core with components of the TIM machinery in the inner membrane or by unknown components in the mitochondrial matrix. Third, the position of the hydrophobic core relative to the presequence is critical for a preprotein to become stabilized in an mt-hsp70-independent manner. From results presented here and from the analysis of other inner membrane proteins such as cytochrome oxidase subunit Va and Sco1p (13Cyr D.M. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23751-23754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gärtner F. Voos W. Querol A. Miller B.R. Craig E.A. Cumsky M.G. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3788-3795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), 3I. Arnold and R. A. Stuart, unpublished results. it appears that a maximum distance of ∼75 amino acids from the N terminus of the preprotein to its hydrophobic core can be tolerated if mt-hsp70-independent stabilization is to be ensured. In the case of cytochrome oxidase subunit Va, where the hydrophobic segment is ∼100 amino acid residues from the N terminus, import is dependent on mt-hsp70 activity (13Cyr D.M. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23751-23754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gärtner F. Voos W. Querol A. Miller B.R. Craig E.A. Cumsky M.G. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3788-3795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); moving the hydrophobic sorting signal of cytochrome oxidase subunit Va closer to the N terminus conferred mt-hsp70 independence on the import process (32Gärtner F.

These findings support the following mechanism of protein transport across the inner membrane. Translocation of polypeptides can occur, at least of the N-terminal ∼75 amino acid residues, by random reversible diffusion (33Neupert W. Hartl F.-U. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Cell. 1990; 63: 447-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); mt-hsp70, by binding to preproteins upon their emergence in the matrix, then acts to shift the equilibrium to thetrans-side of the inner membrane. The free diffusion across the inner membrane of these N-terminal regions would not support an import model where mt-hsp70 functions solely in a manner whereby it pulls segments of the polypeptide chain into the matrix (34Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 35Pfanner N. Meijer M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 132-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that matrix-targeted proteins containing a suitably positioned hydrophobic segment can artificially become arrested in the inner membrane. Is such a hydrophobic arrest mechanism used by at least a subset of inner membrane proteins, such as cytochrome oxidase subunit Va, as a physiological targeting pathway? Sorting by hydrophobic arrest most likely exists for some inner membrane proteins. We speculate that the TIM channel, perhaps together with other protein components of the inner membrane, scans the incoming polypeptide for the presence of hydrophobic cores. Recognition of such an element would result in a slowdown in translocation of the preprotein. Such a translocational arrest is necessary if the sorting signal is to laterally insert into the inner membrane. Hydrophilic sequences flanking the hydrophobic core appear to play an important role in the specificity of the process of lateral integration into the inner membrane. 4E. E. Rojo and R. A. Stuart, manuscript in preparation. If such a lateral sorting signal is not present, translocation will proceed, resulting in matrix import of the hydrophobic core. This further translocation requires active mt-hsp70. If absent, the affinity of component(s) of the TIM channel for such a hydrophobic core is sufficient to trap the incoming polypeptide in the import channel. Under these conditions, complete translocation across the outer membrane can occur, but import across the inner membrane is blocked. Is this arrest mechanism used by the cytochromeb 2-derived proteins? The rates and efficiencies of import of these preproteins were found not to be adversely affected by the lack of mt-hsp70 activity. These data suggest that the cytochrome b 2-derived preproteins follow the same sorting route irrespective of whether mt-hsp70 is functional or not. Only in the case of those cytochromeb 2-derived proteins bearing an intact folded heme domain is their import dependent on mt-hsp70 intervention (28Stuart R.A. Gruhler A. van der Klei I. Guiard B.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We propose that the sorting signal enters the matrix, where it is specifically recognized and secured by a putative sorting signal recognition protein. The translocating preprotein then disengages from further involvement of the mt-hsp70 system for subsequent import. Evidence in favor of passage of at least N-terminal parts of mature-size cytochrome b 2 through the matrix was recently presented; these sorting intermediates looped through the matrix while remaining in contact with components of the TIM machinery (21Gruhler A.

Hence, the mitogen-induced activation of cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes allows for progression through the restriction point in vivopresumably through the hyperphorylation and inactivation of pRb in concert with other G1 cyclin-CDK complexes.

The role of Ras proteins in the mitogenesis and transformation of cells is mediated, in part, by a downstream cascade of serine-threonine kinases that terminates with the activation of p42 and p44 MAPKs (ERK1, ERK2). Activated ERKs phosphorylate several nuclear factors that control gene expression. Evidence for the role of the Ras-mediated MAPK cascade is well documented with kinase-deficient mutants of Raf-1, MEK and MAPKs inhibiting Ras transformation. Recent evidence has shown that Goα activates ERK (20van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1266-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Goα activation of ERK is mediated by a novel protein kinase C-dependent mitogenic signaling pathway which is independent of Ras activation. The studies reported here examine the effects of ablation of Goα by overexpression of antisense Goα RNA in IIC9 cells on the Ras/ERK pathway and cell cycle activities known to be important in mitogen-induced growth.

Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that loss of Goα expression in IIC9 cells results in unregulated growth by constitutively activating the Ras/ERK pathway, a pathway we and others have shown positively regulates cyclin D1-CDK activity through the increased expression of cyclin D1. IIC9 cells, a subclone of Chinese hamster embryo fibroblasts (46Low D.A. Scott R.W. Baker J.B. Cunningham D.D. Nature. 1982; 298: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), were grown and maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine (all chemicals were obtained from Sigma, unless specified otherwise). Subconfluent cultures were growth-arrested by washing once with serum-free DMEM and cultured for 48–60 h in serum-free media. PDGF was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Stable Goα antisense transfectants were produced and maintained as described previously (48Cheng J. Weber J.D. Baldassare J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17312-17319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, pcDNAI containing Goα cDNA in an antisense orientation to the cytomegalovirus promoter was transfected into IIC9 cells using LipofectAmine™ protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following an 18-h transfection period, cells were cultured for 48 h in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum to allow for the expression of neomycin-resistant gene products. Transfected IIC9 cells were grown for several weeks in selection media containing G418 (500 μg/ml). G418-resistant clones were isolated and subcultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 250 μg/ml G418. Several Goα-ablated clones were isolated of which two, Goa1 and Goa2 (described in the previous paper (48Cheng J. Weber J.D. Baldassare J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17312-17319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)), were used for the studies in this paper. The experiments in this paper utilized both clones even though the data presented is only that of the Goa1 clone. Transient transfection of IIC9 cells using LipofectAmine™resulted in 85–90% expression efficiency as visualized by β-galactosidase staining. IIC9 cells were also transiently transfected with Goα antisense cDNA (3 μg/ml) for 18 h. Transfected cells were stimulated with serum for 20–24 h and cultured in serum-free media for 48 h for subsequent experiments. Similarly, Goa1 cells were transiently transfected with Gtα cDNA (3 μg/ml) to achieve the phenotype of the Goa1/Gtα cell type. However, Goa1/Gtα cells were cultured in serum-free media for only 24 h to ensure the continued expression of Gtα protein in the absence of mitogen. PDGF (10 ng/ml) was added directly to serum-deprived IIC9 and Goa1 cells. Cells (1–2 × 106) were then harvested at 24 h after addition of PDGF by scraping in cold 1 × PBS. Harvested cells were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 5 min and lysed with 30 μl of solubilization buffer (25 mm Hepes, 300 mmNaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). IIC9 and Goa1 cells were incubated with aphidicolin (5 μg/ml) for 12–16 h to achieve growth arrest. Arrested cells were released by washing twice with DMEM and incubating in serum-free DMEM. Cells were then harvested and lysed 8 h after release from aphidicolin arrest as described above. Protein concentrations of lysates were determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) as recommended by the manufacturer. Lysates/proteins (15 μg) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Boston, MA). Membranes were probed with a cyclin D1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) was added as the secondary antibody and specific protein bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham) as recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNA was isolated from IIC9 and Goa1 cells (4–8 × 106) cultured on 100-mm dishes with Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was electrophoresed on 2% agarose/formaldehyde gels. Formaldehyde was removed by washing gels in 0.5 m ammonium acetate. RNA was transferred onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham) using the Turboblotter™ system (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). RNA was cross-linked onto membranes with an Ultraviolet Crosslinker (Amersham) using the manufacturers protocol. Transferred RNA was visualized using a methylene blue/sodium acetate stain. Randomly-labeled [α-32P]dCTP cDNA probes (murine cDNA for cyclin D1 was a generous gift from Dr. Charles Sherr) were made using the Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Blots were probed simultaneously with cyclin D1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes for 2 h at 65 °C using Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham) and washed once at room temperature with 5 × SSPE (20 mm EDTA, 1m NaCl, 50 mmNaH2PO4-H2O), 0.1% SDS and subjected to either autoradiography or direct quantitation with a PhosphorImager™ (Molecular Dynamics). More stringent washes were done at 65 °C with 0.5% SDS when necessary. Thymidine incorporation was performed as described previously (1Weber, J. D., Raben, D. M., Phillips, P. J., and Baldassare, J. J. (1997) Biochem J., in press.Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, growth-arrested IIC9 cells were stimulated with PDGF (10 ng/ml) for approximately 20 h. Goa1 cells were serum-starved by washing twice with DMEM and incubated for 48 h in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine. To growth-arrest Goa1 cells, aphidicolin (5 μg/ml) was added to serum-deprived cells as described above. Following a 24-h incubation, aphidicolin-arrested cells were released from arrest by washing twice with DMEM. Following primary incubation, cells were incubated for 3 h with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine/ml (NEN Life Sciences Products). 3H-Labeled cells were washed twice with cold 1 × PBS and the DNA was precipitated by incubating the cells for 30 min with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated DNA was washed twice with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized with 2% sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 nNaOH. The solution was neutralized by addition of one-fifth volume of 5% trichloroacetic acid and the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated [3H]DNA was quantitated by scintillation counting. Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were stimulated with mitogen at 37 °C. After 15 min the media was removed and the cells were washed with 1 × PBS. Goa1 cells were either grown in serum (10%), serum-starved for 48 h, arrested with aphidicolin (5 μg/ml), or released from aphidicolin arrest for 8 h as described above and washed with 1 × PBS. After washing, cells were lysed by scraping in 300 μl of solubilization buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysates were assayed for ERK activity as described previously (1Weber, J. D., Raben, D. M., Phillips, P. J., and Baldassare, J. J. (1997) Biochem J., in press.Google Scholar). Cyclin D1/CDK activity was assayed as described previously (8Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, growth-arrested IIC9 cells were stimulated with PDGF (10 ng/ml) and harvested at 0 and 24 h after stimulation by scraping in cold 1 × PBS and lysed in 50 μl of IP buffer (50 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Goa1 cells were grown in serum, serum-deprived for 48 h, aphidicolin-arrested, or released from aphidicolin arrest for 8 h and harvested by scraping in cold 1 × PBS. Lysates were sonicated briefly and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody (2 μg) was added to supernatants and incubated at 4 °C. After 1–2 h cyclin D1 complexes were precipitated for 2–3 h with protein G-Sepharose. Cyclin D1 immune complexes were washed 4 times with 1 ml of cold IP buffer and 2 times with 1 ml of cold wash buffer (50 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cyclin D1 immune complexes were pelleted and resuspended in 30 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mmEGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 μm ATP). The immune complexes were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 2 μg/ml soluble GST-Rb fusion protein (GST-Rb cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Mark Ewen) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by addition of 15 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The assay is a modification of the protocol by Downward et al. (47Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Serum-deprived IIC9 cells or Goa1 cells were labeled for 18 h with [32P]Pi at 0.2 mCi/100 mm dish in phosphate-free DMEM. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-free media and with a saline buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl). Cells were incubated with PDGF (10 ng/ml) for 15 min and washed twice with cold 1 × PBS. Cells were harvested and lysed by scraping in 500 μl of IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After a 10-min incubation the homogenate was centrifuged at 750 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was treated with 100 μl of bovine serum albumin-coated charcoal for 5 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 750 × g to remove charcoal. A monoclonal p21 ras antibody (Oncogene) was added to supernatants and Ras immune complexes were precipitated with protein G plus agarose (Oncogene) overnight at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed twice with IP buffer and 3 times with wash buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl). Final pellets were drained and bound nucleotides were eluted in 20 μl of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mmEDTA, 2% SDS, 0.5 mm GDP, and 0.5 mm GTP). Eluants were heated at 65 °C for 5 min and centrifuged. The supernatant was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plate (Merck) and developed with 0.75 mKH2PO4 (pH 3.4). GDP and GTP32P-labeled fractions were quantified by scintillation counting. We previously generated a panel of stable IIC9 clones (including Goa1 and Goa2 clones) overexpressing full-length Goα RNA (48Cheng J. Weber J.D. Baldassare J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17312-17319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We examined the phenotype of two of these clones, Goa1 and Goa2. In contrast to IIC9 cells, Goa1 and Goa2 cells do not express Goα protein. Goa1 and Goa2 cells formed multiple foci in monolayer cultures and anchorage independent colonies in soft agar (48Cheng J. Weber J.D. Baldassare J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17312-17319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism for the transformed phenotype of these cells, we examined whether Goa1 cells growth arrested upon removal of mitogen. Goa1 cells did not growth arrest upon removal of serum (Fig.1 A) and flow cytometry showed Goa1 cells randomly distributed throughout the cell cycle with a slight majority of cells in S phase (data not shown). To arrest and synchronize populations of mitogen-independent Goa1 cells, aphidicolin, a novel DNA polymerase α inhibitor, was utilized. Addition of aphidicolin in the absence of serum resulted in growth arrest within 12–16 h after treatment (Fig. 1 B). Previous studies have shown that removal of aphidicolin by washing with serum-free media is sufficient to allow cells to enter S phase in the absence of mitogen within 4–8 h (5Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). However, aphidicolin-released cells arrest when they reach the subsequent G1/S restriction point of the next cycle. Goa1 cells resumed cell cycle progression after release from aphidicolin in serum-free media and continued through subsequent cycles in the absence of mitogen while IIC9 cells arrested at the proceeding G1/S restriction point (Fig. 1 B) further demonstrating the mitogen-independent growth of Goa1 cells. Transient overexpression of Goα antisense RNA also resulted in mitogen-independent growth suggesting that the transformed phenotype of the stable Goa1 cell type is a result of Goα ablation and not a result of a deletion of another gene due to homologous recombinantion (data not shown). IIC9 cells overexpressing constitutively activated Ras form multiple foci when grown in soft agar and do not growth arrest when serum-depleted (data not shown). To examine whether the Ras pathway was involved in the transformation of Goa1 cells we first examined Ras activation. In growth-arrested IIC9 cells, levels of activated Ras as determined by the ratio GTP/(GTP + GDP) associated with Ras were quite low (Fig. 2) and increased 6-fold within 5 min after the addition of PDGF (Fig. 2) or several other growth factors (data not shown). In contrast, Goa1 cells exhibited high levels of activated Ras in the absence of mitogen similar to levels found in IIC9 cells treated with PDGF (Fig. 2). Addition of PDGF did not increase the level of activated Ras above the levels seen in serum-depleted Goa1 cells. Similar results were observed with a second clonal Goα-ablated cell line (Goa2) (data not shown) indicating that ablation of Goα in IIC9 cells results in significant activation of Ras. These results are consistent with the observed inability of these cells to growth arrest with the removal of mitogen and suggest that in certain cell types loss of Goα could result in neoplastic transformation. Recent data from several laboratories has suggested the importance of ERK activation in Ras-dependent growth. We have previously demonstrated that suppression of PDGF-induced ERK activation blocked G1progression in IIC9 cells (1Weber, J. D., Raben, D. M., Phillips, P. J., and Baldassare, J. J. (1997) Biochem J., in press.Google Scholar). To determine whether ablation of Goα resulted in constitutive activation of the ERK pathway, we next examined the endogenous activity of ERK in Goa1 cells. Addition of PDGF (Fig. 3) and several other growth factors (data not shown) to growth-arrested IIC9 cells increased ERK activity approximately 7–8-fold within 15 min. As previously found in CCL39 cells (24Vouret-Craviari V. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Scimeca J.C. Van Obberghen E. Pouyssegur J. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and IIC9 cells (1Weber, J. D., Raben, D. M., Phillips, P. J., and Baldassare, J. J. (1997) Biochem J., in press.Google Scholar) addition of thrombin or PDGF to growth-arrested cells induced a biphasic increase in ERK activity. A rapid 8–12-fold increase of ERK activity within 5–10 min is followed by a sustained 4–6-fold increase in ERK activity. Asynchronous Goa1 cells grown in serum-free media express levels of ERK activity (7–9-fold) (Fig. 3) similar to the levels of ERK activity of IIC9 cells stimulated with PDGF (Fig. 3). An ERK-responsive region has recently been identified in the cyclin D1 promoter (25Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) and we have previously shown that addition of PDGF to IIC9 cells induces cyclin D1 mRNA and protein expression (1Weber, J. D., Raben, D. M., Phillips, P. J., and Baldassare, J. J. (1997) Biochem J., in press.Google Scholar). In addition, we and others have shown that inhibition of mitogen-induced ERK activity blocks expression of cyclin D1 and progression of IIC9 cells through G1 (1Weber, J. D., Raben, D. M., Phillips, P. J., and Baldassare, J. J. (1997) Biochem J., in press.Google Scholar, 6Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

To identify a possible downstream target of the Goa1 constitutively active Ras/ERK pathway, we measured levels of cyclin D1. Goα ablation conferred increased cyclin D1 protein expression by approximately 3–4-fold (Fig. 4 A). The levels of cyclin D1 in Goa1 cells remained constitutively elevated in the absence of mitogen. We next investigated the effect of aphidicolin arrest and release on cyclin D1 expression. Treatment of Goa1 cells with aphidicolin for 12 h resulted in sustained levels of cyclin D1 protein in the absence of mitogen (Fig. 4 A). Matsushime et al.(5Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) previously showed that Bac1.2F5A macrophages released from aphidicolin arrest required the presence of growth factor (CSF-1) to sustain the expression of cyclin D1. Release of IIC9 cells from aphidicolin arrest in the absence of PDGF resulted in the rapid (within 5 h) decrease in the levels of cyclin D1 protein (Fig.4 A). However, cyclin D1 protein levels in Goa1 cells did not decrease significantly when released from aphidicolin in the absence of PDGF suggesting a significant difference in the requirement of sustained presence of growth factor for cyclin D1 expression. It is clear that the constitutive activation of the Ras/ERK pathway (Figs. 2and 3) provides the sustained mitogenic signals required for the continued expression of cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 protein expression remained high through the next round of replication (approximately 24 h after aphidicolin release) (Fig. 4 A). In the absence of mitogen, cyclin D1 mRNA levels in Goa1 cells were similar to the levels found in IIC9 cells treated with PDGF (Fig.4 B). Aphidicolin-treated and released Goa1 cells exhibited a 1.6-fold decrease in cyclin D1 mRNA expression although these levels were still 3-fold higher than serum-deprived IIC9 cells (Fig.4 B) providing further evidence for the positive role of the Ras/ERK pathway in sustaining cyclin D1 expression in Goa1 cells in the absence of mitogen. Phosphorylation of Rb by active cyclin D1-CDK complexes has been demonstrated to be required for progression through G1 in several cell types (12Dowdy S.F. Hinds P.W. Louie K. Reed S.I. Arnold A.

However, cyclin D1-CDK activity is thought to play an important role in mitogen-induced progression of cells through G1. In the absence of mitogen, IIC9 cells contain low levels of cyclin D1-CDK activity (Fig.4 C). PDGF treatment induced a 6-fold increase in cyclin D1-CDK activity within 4 h (data not shown) and sustained this level of activity through"
https://openalex.org/W2008838256,"Stopped-flow rapid-scan spectrophotometry was employed to study complicated oxidation processes of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (QCR) that was purified from bovine heart mitochondria and maximally contained 0.36 mol of ubiquinone-10/mol of heme c 1. When fully reduced QCR was allowed to react with dioxygen in the presence of cytochrome c plus cytochrome c oxidase, the oxidation of b-type hemes accompanied an initial lag, apparently low potential heme b L was oxidized first, followed by high potential heme b H. Antimycin A inhibited the oxidation of both b-type hemes. The oxidation of heme c 1 was triphasic and became biphasic in the presence of antimycin A. On the other hand, starting from partially reduced QCR that was poised at a higher redox potential with succinate and succinate-cytochrome creductase, the b-type hemes were oxidized immediately without a lag. When the ubiquinone content in QCR was as low as 0.1 mol/mol heme c 1 the oxidation of theb-type hemes was almost suppressed. As the Q-deficient QCR was supplemented with ubiquinol-2, the rapid oxidation ofb-type hemes was restored to some extent. These results indicate that a limited amount of ubiquinone-10 found in purified preparations of QCR is obligatory for electron transfer from theb-type hemes to iron-sulfur protein (ISP) and hemec 1.The characteristic oxidation profiles of hemeb L, heme b H, and hemec 1 were simulated successfully based on a mechanistic Q cycle model. According to the simulations the two-electron oxidation of ubiquinol-10 via the ISP and hemec 1 pathway, which is more favorable thermodynamically than the bifurcation of electron flow into both ISP and heme b L, does really occur as long as hemeb L is in the reduced state and provides ubiquinone-10 at center i. Mechanistically this process takes time, thus explaining the initial lag in the oxidation of theb-type hemes. With the partially reduced QCR, inherent ubisemiquinone at center i immediately oxidizes reduced heme b H thus eliminating the lag.The mechanistic Q cycle model consists of 56 reaction species, which are interconnected by the reaction paths specified with microscopic rate constants. The simulations further indicate that the rate constants for electron transfer between the redox centers can be from 105 to 103 s−1 and are rarely rate-limiting. On the other hand, a shuttle of ubiquinone or ubiquinol between center o and center i and the oxidation of heme c 1 can be rate-limiting. The interplay of the microscopic rate constants determines the actual reaction pathway that is shown schematically by the “reaction map.” Most significantly, the simulations support the consecutive oxidation of ubiquinol in center o as long as both hemeb L and heme b H are in the reduced state. Only when heme b L is oxidized and ISP is reduced can SQ o donate an electron to hemeb L. Thus, we propose that a kinetic control mechanism, or “a kinetic switch,” is significant for the bifurcation of electron flow.

QCR contains four redox centers, two b-type hemes (hemeb 562/b H and hemeb 566/b L), ac-type heme (heme c 1), and a 2Fe-2S cluster (ISP) (3Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, low potential hemeb L is located near the outside surface of the inner membrane, whereas high potential heme b His situated inside the membrane about 20 Å away from hemeb L. ISP and heme c 1 are largely extramembranous on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane (4Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to these four prosthetic groups, ubiquinone-10 is usually found in purified QCR prepared from mammalian mitochondria (5Rieske J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 239-244Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar,6Yu C.-A. Yu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Previous work on the mechanism of electron transfer and proton translocation by QCR revealed characteristic features that lead to various hypothetical mechanisms (7Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wikström M. Krab K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To date, the protonmotive Q cycle, originally proposed by Mitchell (2Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), has become the generally accepted hypothesis. The central idea of the cyclic model is “branching” of electron flow from ubiquinol that delivers an initial electron to ISP at center o on the cytoplasmic side, one of the assumed Q-reactive centers. This electron is transferred from ISP to heme c 1 and then to cytochromec. Ubisemiquinone (SQ) thus generated is an intermediate and subsequently donates an electron to low potential hemeb L at center o yielding quinone in turn. Then, quinone is translocated to center i, another Q-reactive site on the matrix side, and reduced to SQ i by accepting an electron from high potential hemeb H to which the electron has been transferred from heme b L (3Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 9Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ubiquinone at centero or i is usually referred to as Q o or Q i, respectively. These reactions constitute the first half of the Q cycle. In the second half, the oxidation of another molecule of quinol at center o proceeds following the same processes as before and provides a second electron at center i to reduce SQ i to quinol. The quinol then goes back to center ocompleting the protonmotive Q cycle. Thus bifurcation of electron flow from ubiquinol into ISP and heme b L at centero as well as electrogenic electron transfer from hemeb L to heme b H is most pivotal in the energy conservation mechanism because this supports proton translocation across the membrane. Despite a considerable experimental support for the protonmotive Q cycle, there are still some observations that are not necessarily compatible with this model (11Degli Esposti M. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Lenaz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Tsai A.-L. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The oxidation of reduced QCR purified from yeast or bovine heart mitochondria by oxidants has been reported to occur even when the endogenous ubiquinone is depleted from the enzyme complex (11Degli Esposti M. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Lenaz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Tsai A.-L. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8677-8684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result is apparently inconsistent with the proposed functional role of Q not only as a proton translocator but also as an electron mediator between b-type hemes and ISP. Also, it has been reported that no lag appears in the oxidation of b-type hemes when fully reduced yeast QCR is oxidized by ferricyanide (12Tsai A.-L. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8677-8684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or of heme b in rat liver mitochondria by ferricyanide plus air (13Rich P.R. Wikström M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 194: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The latter result forms the basis for a proposed semiquinone cycle that assumes a shuttle of ubisemiquinone between center o and center i (8Wikström M. Krab K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). According to the Q cycle mechanism, the oxidation of theb-type hemes initiated by pulsing an oxidant to the fully reduced QCR does not occur immediately; Q that is required to oxidize heme b H at center i is lacking because further oxidation of an intermediate SQ o by hemeb L at center o is blocked as this heme is in the reduced state initially. Therefore, it is important to confirm experimentally whether the oxidation of b-type hemes accompanies a lag or not and to examine the obligatory role of ubiquinone in this oxidation (16de Vries S. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In previous studies (11Degli Esposti M. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Lenaz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Tsai A.-L. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8677-8684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rich P.R. Wikström M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 194: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), nonphysiological oxidants such as ferricyanide and a cobalt chelate were used mostly as an electron acceptor for QCR. Although precautions to eliminate their direct interactions especially with the b heme(s) in QCR were taken, the possibility has been pointed out that ferrous hemeb is accessible to ferricyanide at the outer side of submitochondrial particles (19Kunz W.S. Konstantinov A.A. Tsofina L. Liberman E.A. FEBS Lett. 1984; 172: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This problem would be resolved if we use cytochrome c plus cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) as the oxidizing system. On the other hand, spectral complexities that are introduced by use of this system and accordingly may hamper the data analyses will be lessened by recording all the spectral changes with rapid-scan spectrophotometry. A series of absorption spectra collected during a reaction and displayed in a way to disclose their characteristic features in detail are useful not only in manifesting the full aspect of the spectral changes at a glance but also in detecting and characterizing reaction intermediates of hitherto unknown nature, if any (20Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7187-7190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Orii Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Orii Y. Yumoto I. Fukumori Y. Yamanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14310-14316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A deliberate choice of experimental conditions to shift the rate-limiting step would be advantageous to increase an occupancy of a certain spectral species and thus to identify its nature. Here, we employ a stopped-flow and rapid-scan technique to establish whether the oxidation of b-type hemes in fully reduced QCR exhibits a lag or not. The oxidation is initiated by mixing reduced QCR with dioxygen in the presence of cytochrome c and CCO. The QCR preparations purified from bovine heart muscle usually contain a varying amount of ubiquinone, mostly substoichiometric to hemec 1, and consequently the preparations seem to be a mixture of QCR with a full set of redox centers and an incomplete set. Especially the QCR preparation with the lowest content of ubiquinone is suitable to examine its putative obligatory role in reoxidation, and in fact it is shown that ubiquinone is absolutely necessary for the oxidation of b-type hemes. These results have led us to interpret our results in the context of a “Q pocket” model that contains centers i and o, as assumed by Wikström and Krab (8Wikström M. Krab K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such a pocket may be provided by a dimeric structure of this complex revealed by the structural studies (4Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Akiba T. Toyoshima C. Matsunaga T. Kawamoto M. Kubota T. Fukuyama K. Namba K. Matsubara H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) even if it is lacking in the monomeric structure. It is also possible that ubiquinone and ubiquinol make contact alternatively witho and i domain in the Q pocket without being released from QCR. We also simulate the behavior of the redox centers based on a proposed kinetic model, in which starting from the fully reduced state of QCR the reaction intermediates proliferate as the reaction proceeds in accordance with the multiplicity of an intermediate containing a specified number of reducing equivalents, and then converge to final products. One of the advantages of this approach is to allow us to test alternative mechanistic possibilities by incorporating the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters that define the reaction into computer simulations. Consequently, a kinetic control mechanism for the bifurcation of electron flow will be proposed that contrasts with the thermodynamic barrier hypothesis proposed by Ding et al. (24Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15979-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) but bears some resemblance to the “catalytic switch” mechanism proposed by Brandt et al. (25Brandt U. Von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Brandt U. Haase U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 2016-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (6Yu C.-A. Yu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and cytochromec oxidase (20Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7187-7190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purified from beef heart muscle according to previously reported methods and stored at −80 °C until used. Succinate-cytochrome c reductase (SCR) contained about 3.5 nmol of heme b/mg of protein and exhibited the electron transfer activity of 70–90 nmol of cytochrome creduced·s−1·(mg protein)−1 in a medium containing 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.3 mm EDTA, 20 mm succinate, and 100 μm cytochrome c (28Yu C.A. Yu L. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4905-4910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Miki T. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Purified preparations of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (QCR) contained 4.2–4.5 nmol of heme c 1/mg of protein and exhibited the catalytic activity of 330–410 mol of cytochromec reduced·s−1·(mol hemec 1)−1 when measured in an assay mixture containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.3 mm EDTA, 50 μm cytochrome c, and 25 μm Q2H2 at 20 °C (6Yu C.-A. Yu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,30Miki T. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The initial rate of cytochrome c reduction was corrected against nonenzymatic reduction of cytochrome c by ubiquinol in the absence of QCR. The Q10 content of QCR varied with enzyme preparations ranging from 0.1 to 0.36 mol of Q10/mol of heme c 1. The purity and the enzyme activity of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) were the same as reported previously (20Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7187-7190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome c (horse heart, type III) and antimycin A were purchased from Sigma. Cholic acid was obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). Other chemicals were obtained commercially at the highest purity. Stopped-flow rapid-scan recordings with and without a laser flash were carried out on an apparatus as described previously (20Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7187-7190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Orii Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Orii Y. Yumoto I. Fukumori Y. Yamanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14310-14316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this apparatus the recording time of a spectrum over a 200-nm wavelength range was 12 ms, and usually 100 spectra were recorded with a minimal time interval of 30 ms including the recording time. The dead time of the apparatus under the present experimental conditions was around 10 ms, and the end of this period was chosen as time 0 for displaying spectral changes. Two different methods were employed to prepare sample solutions for stopped-flow and rapid-scan measurements as follows. Method 1: purified QCR was diluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25% sodium cholate to give a final concentration of 6–7 μm heme c 1 and placed in one of the reservoirs of the stopped-flow apparatus. The solution was bubbled with N2 gas for 15 min at 20 °C to attain anaerobic conditions. The fully reduced form of QCR was prepared by addition of a slight excess of sodium dithionite, and allowed to stand for another 15 min at 20 °C under N2 atmosphere. Then the temperature was lowered to 10 °C. The other reservoir contained cytochromec (1.0 μm) and CCO (6–7 μm aa 3) in an air-saturated solution consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.25% sodium cholate. After incubation for 10 min at 10 °C, the solutions in both reservoirs were mixed at a 1:1 ratio to start the reaction, and spectral changes were recorded by rapid-scan spectrophotometry at an appropriate time interval. Method 2: a mixture containing QCR (6–7 μm cytochrome c 1), 1 μm cytochrome c, and CCO (6–7 μm aa 3) in 0.25% sodium cholate, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was placed in one reservoir and bubbled with a gas mixture of CO and N2 (1:4) for 10 min at 20 °C. A slight excess of sodium dithionite was added to reduce all redox components before further incubation for 15 min at 20 °C. Then the temperature was brought to 10 °C. In the other reservoir, an air-saturated solution containing 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.25% sodium cholate, and no protein components was placed, and the temperature was equilibrated at 10 °C. The two solutions in the reservoirs were mixed to flow at a 1:1 ratio into the observation cell of the stopped-flow apparatus, and the mixture in the cell was irradiated with a laser flash of 587 nm to initiate the redox reaction by photolyzing the cytochrome coxidase-CO complex. The two methods gave essentially the same result in terms of the oxygen reaction. Partially reduced QCR was prepared by using a catalytic amount of SCR (0.5 μm cytochrome b) and 10 mmsodium succinate as a reducing system. After reduction of QCR with succinate for 30 min at 20 °C, sodium malonate was added (12 mm, final) to block electron transfer from succinate to QCR catalyzed by SCR. The reaction of partially reduced QCR with cytochromec and CCO was followed by Method 1. Optical measurements to determine the electron transfer activity of respiratory enzymes and the concentration of cytochrome components were carried out with a Unisoku multi-wavelength spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cell holder. The ubiquinone-10 content of purified QCR was estimated according to the reported method (31Redfeam E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 381-384Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) by using an extinction coefficient of 12.25 mm−1·cm−1 for the difference between the oxidized and reduced quinone at 275 nm (12Tsai A.-L. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8677-8684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochromec (6Yu C.-A. Yu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), cytochrome c 1 (32Yu C.A. Yu L. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1012-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cytochromeb in SCR (33Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and heme a in CCO (20Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7187-7190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were determined according to the reported methods. The concentration of CCO was expressed in terms of cytochrome aa 3. Protein was estimated according to Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectral data collected by rapid-scan spectrophotometry were processed by using either a home-built computer program as described previously (35Orii Y. Anni H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Numerical calculations for solving the differential equations that represent a reaction model were performed by using MATLAB on a desktop computer (Dell, OptiPlex XMT 5133). Fig. 1 A shows three-dimensional display of spectral changes recorded on mixing dithionite-reduced QCR (0.36 mol of Q10/mol of hemec 1) with an air-saturated solution containing cytochrome c and CCO in the stopped-flow rapid-scan apparatus. The concentration of cytochrome c was 6–7-fold lower than that of CCO or of QCR to minimize its spectral contribution to the absorbance change of heme c 1 around 553 nm and to control the rate of its oxidation. An excess of CCO is expected to keep cytochrome c almost in the oxidized state during the redox reaction. The first spectrum taken immediately after the mixing, or at time 0, shows that QCR is almost in the reduced state with a peak of heme b components at 562 nm and a shoulder of heme c 1 at 553 nm. A broad absorption band around 600 nm is due to the oxidized form of CCO. As the reaction proceeds, the 562-nm peak becomes smaller after a short lag period with a growth of the 604-nm peak. This result indicates that mixing of fully reduced QCR with cytochrome c and CCO under the air brought about the oxidation of hemes b in QCR and electron transfer to CCO. It should be noted that a fairly large portion of hemeb still remained in the reduced state at 3 s (Fig. 1,A and B). Based on the ubiquinone content of the samples employed, we simply assume that maximally 36% QCR in the purified preparation contains a full set of redox centers; that is 1 mol each of Q10-(2), heme b L-(1), heme b H-(1), heme c 1-(1), and ISP-(1). In parentheses the maximal number of reducing equivalent that can be retained is given. Accordingly, fully reduced QCR contains six reducing equivalents. It is proposed that center o accommodates two ubiquinone molecules at domains Qos and Qow that have a strong and weak interaction with ubiquinone, respectively (24Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15979-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 36Ding H. Robertson D.E. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3144-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the present preparation shows that only one of them is retained probably at Qos. On reaction with the oxidizing system, QCR equipped with a full set of redox centers can be oxidized rapidly compared with the incomplete complex. This is in accord with the experimental result indicating that a fairly large portion of hemeb remains in the reduced state after the rapid oxidation (Fig. 1, A and B) as described above. According to the Q cycle mechanism ubiquinone is supposed to be released from QCR to move from center o to center i or vice versa (2Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 3Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). But it is less likely that a limited amount of ubiquinone-10 found in the purified preparation of QCR swims around in a detergent medium to mediate translocation of protons between centers oand i. Rather, it is more likely for ubiquinone to mediate proton translocation without being released from the QCR complex. Therefore, we postulate in QCR a big ubiquinone pocket that contains centers i and o, as assumed by Wikström and Krab (8Wikström M. Krab K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Ubiquinone and ubiquinol (not ubisemiquinone) may be able to make contact alternatively with o and i domain in the ubiquinone pocket through a “flip-flop” motion. Such a pocket may be provided by a dimeric structure of this complex as described previously. Further studies are required to find out whether this kind of mechanism is functioning in the catalytic reaction of QCR in phospholipid membranes. Also the x-ray crystallographic studies that are in progress will soon reveal these essential features (4Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys.

Steroid hormone receptors regulate gene transcription through a multistep process that requires binding to DNA sequences known as hormone response elements (HREs) 1The abbreviations used are: HRE, hormone response element; AR, androgen receptor; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; bp, base pair(s); ARE, androgen response element; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MMTV-LTR, mouse mammory tumor virus-long terminal repeat.

Since different classes of steroid receptors co-exist in the same cell, the commonality of shared DNA consensus sequences raises the question as to how steroid-specific gene regulation is achieved.

Studies in our laboratory have shown that within the first intron of this gene is a complex enhancer that responds selectively to AR (Fig.1). This 358-bp sequence, referred to as fragment In-1c, binds both AR and GR, but in CV1 cells, it confers only AR-dependent transactivation in transient cotransfection assays (18Ho K.-C. Marschke K.B. Tan J. Power S.G.A. Wilson E.M. French F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27226-27235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In PC3 and HeLa cells, transactivation was observed with both AR and GR; however, AR-induced activation was greater than that of GR. A 130-bp subfragment of In-1c, referred to as D2, retained ARE specificity in all three cell lines. D2 mediates transactivation by AR but does not contain a strong consensus 15-bp partial palindromic response element. We have identified a novel AR binding sequence in the 5′-end of this fragment. 2C. W. Gregory, K. B. Marschke, S. G. A. Power, M. C. W. Avellar, K.-C. Ho, and F. S. French, manuscript in preparation.

The 20-kDa protein gene mRNA decreased to 13% of control 2d following castration and required several hours of testosterone stimulation for return to the control level. The testosterone-induced increase in 20-kDa protein mRNA was blocked by cycloheximide, suggesting that rapidly turning-over proteins are required for AR transactivation (19Winderickx J. Hemschoote K. De Clercq N. Van Dijck P. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Verhoeven G. Heyns W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Since AR interacts directly with the D2 enhancer (18Ho K.-C. Marschke K.B. Tan J. Power S.G.A. Wilson E.M. French F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27226-27235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 20-kDa protein gene would be classified as a delayed primary response gene (28Dean D.M. Sanders M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1489-1495PubMed Google Scholar). D2 contains a number of inverted and direct repeats that may serve as recognition sites for cell-specific proteins and provide secondary structure that influences D2 interactions with other transcription control proteins. Thus, characterization of rat ventral prostate nuclear proteins that bind D2 is important in understanding the function of this androgen-responsive unit in the regulation of transcription. Here we report androgen-dependent nuclear protein interactions with the complex androgen response element D2 in the 20-kDa protein gene first intron. DNase I footprinting in isolated ventral prostate nuclei revealed protected and hypersensitive regions, consistent with androgen regulation of D2 chromatin structure. D2 binding of nuclear proteins was demonstrated by DNase I footprintingin vitro and gel mobility shift assays. UV cross-linking of D2-bound proteins identified androgen-regulated protein complexes of 140 and 55 kDa. Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Rats were castrated through a scrotal incision made under anesthesia with ketamine hydrochloride (Bristol Laboratories, Syracuse, NY) and acepromazine maleate (Aveco Co., Inc., Fort Dodge, IA). Castrated rats were injected with testosterone enanthate (Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc., Port Washington, NY) (5 mg/kg subcutaneously) immediately after castration. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation 24 or 48 h post-castration. Tissues were collected, stripped of connective tissues, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C until preparation of nuclear extracts as described below. Nuclei were isolated according to Rigaudet al. (29Rigaud G. Roux J. Pictet R. Grange T. Cell. 1991; 67: 977-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and Scarlett and Robins (12Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 413-423PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Frozen tissue (1 g) from intact and 24- or 48-h postcastration rats was pulverized under liquid nitrogen, transferred to a 50-ml tube, and allowed to thaw on ice. All buffers used to isolate ventral prostate nuclei from intact rats contained 10 nm dihydrotestosterone (Sigma). After homogenization in 15 ml TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA) containing 1.5 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5% sucrose, using 4 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, samples were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of TE buffer containing 1.5 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. Centrifugation was repeated, the pellets containing nuclei were resuspended in 2 ml of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 66 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2), and nucleic acid was quantitated by absorption atA 260 nm. Volumes were adjusted to 10A/ml. Nuclei were aliquoted (250 μl), and MgCl2 and CaCl2 were added to achieve 1 and 0.5 mm, respectively. Aliquots containing 0–5 units of DNase I were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Cleavage reactions were terminated by addition of 50 μl of stop solution (100 mmEDTA, 4 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubation for 15 s at 50 °C. After addition of 200 μl of 2.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate and incubation at 50 °C for 2 h, 50 μl of stop solution was added, and samples were kept overnight at 50 °C. DNA was extracted twice with phenol, once with phenol/chloroform, and once with chloroform. Samples were dialyzed for 48 h with 3 changes of 500 volumes of TE buffer. DNA was digested with BamHI (1 unit/μg) to decrease viscosity prior to ligation-mediated PCR. Untreated DNA (50 μg) was methylated with dimethylsulfate and cleaved with piperidine according to Hornstra and Yang (30Hornstra I.A. Yang T.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to serve as a G ladder for D2 sequence alignment. The following primers were used for ligation-mediated-PCR (5′ to 3′ in the 20-kDa protein gene): D1–1 (nucleotides 2852–2875), to extend complementary to D2 sequence; D1–2 (nucleotides 2779–2801) for amplification and D1–3 (nucleotides 2775–2800) for labeling; reading 5′ to 3′ on the antisense strand of the 20-kDa protein gene sequence: D1–1, GACAACCTTCTTCAGACACACAC; D1–2: GTCGGAAGTGGAACCAAGG and D1–3, TCAGGGTCGGAAGTGGAACCCACAG. DNA (2 μg) was denatured 5 min at 95 °C, and primer D1–1 (1 μm) was annealed for 30 min at 61 °C, followed by extension for 10 min at 76 °C using Deep Vent polymerase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). After PCR, an overnight ligation was performed at 16 °C using linker primer (20 μm) and T4 DNA ligase (Boehringer Mannheim). DNA was precipitated, and PCR using a ligation primer and D1–2 was performed as follows: 1) denaturation at 95 °C for 4 min, annealing at 65 °C for 3 min, and extension at 76 °C for 2 min; 2) 18 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 65 °C for 2 min and extension at 76 °C for 3 min adding 5 s to each subsequent cycle; 3) extension for 10 min at 76 °C. DNA was labeled in PCR reactions using 2.5 pmol [γ32P] ATP-kinased primer D1–3 purified from free nucleotides on Bio-Spin 30 columns (Bio-Rad). Two rounds of PCR (4 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 66 °C, and 10 min at 76 °C) were performed, and reactions were stopped by addition of sodium acetate to 0.3 m and EDTA to 1 mm. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol, followed by resuspension in formamide loading buffer and electrophoresis on 6% sequencing gels. 1 g of frozen ventral prostate was pulverized under liquid nitrogen, placed in 10 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmEDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 μmPefabloc®-SC (Boehringer Mannheim), 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), homogenized with 5 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 3 volumes of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm KCl, 1.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmPefabloc®-SC, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), homogenized with 5 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and placed on ice. The suspension was frozen in dry-ice/ethanol, thawed on ice for 30 min, resuspended with a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclear extract pellets were resuspended in and dialyzed against DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 4 h at 4 °C. D2 was obtained by digestion of the reporter vector D2-ptkCAT (18Ho K.-C. Marschke K.B. Tan J. Power S.G.A. Wilson E.M. French F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27226-27235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with XBaI and 3′-end-labeled using [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). A second restriction digestion with HindIII yielded a labeled 130-bp fragment (D2). D2 was purified by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and isolated by electroelution. DNA-binding reactions were carried out in 20-μl volumes with different amounts of nuclear extract, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 30 μg of bovine serum albumin in DNA binding buffer. After 15 min on ice,32P-labeled D2 (40,000 cpm) was added and then incubated for 30 min on ice. MgCl2 and CaCl2 (2 mm) were added to the reaction mixture with DNase I (2 units), and the digestion was allowed to proceed for 3 min at room temperature. DNase I digestion was stopped by the addition of 4 μl of EDTA (50 mm). Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, and D2 was precipitated, rinsed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 15 μl of formamide loading buffer. Samples were denatured for 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed on an 8% sequencing gel together with G and G + A chemical sequencing ladders prepared according to Maxam and Gilbert (31Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). The gel was transferred to Whatman 3MM paper, dried, and autoradiographed at −80 °C using an intensifying screen. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 30 μg of bovine serum albumin for 15 min on ice in DNA binding buffer with or without D2 oligonucleotide competitors (see below). The32P-labeled probe (10,000 cpm) was added, and samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels (acryl/bisacrylamide ratio 37.5:1) buffered with 0.5 × TBE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm boric acid, 0.2 mm EDTA). Gels were transferred to Whatmann 3MM paper, dried, and autoradiographed with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. Three oligonucleotide subfragments of D2 were chemically synthesized using the phosphoramide method and an Applied Biosystems Model 380B DNA synthesizer. Sense strand sequences are as follows: oligo A, 5′-CTACTAATGGTGATCATTAGGTGATAAAACCAGCCTGAAACCTTTT-3′, 20-kDa protein gene nucleotides 2549 to 2594; oligo B, 5′-TAGAGTTACAAAGTATGACTACCTTTTATCCCAAAATCGATAGG-3′, nucleotides 2595 to 2638; and oligo C, 5′-ATCATTCAATTCATGCTGACTCTAAAGCCTTCCCTTCTTCTC-3′, nucleotides 2639 to 2681. Oligonucleotides A, B, and C were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed to the respective complementary oligonucleotide, purified on an 8% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel, and isolated by electroelution. For competition studies, unlabeled double- and single-stranded oligonucleotides were used as competitors. A 100-bp fragment from the C3 gene (C3-C fragment) (2Tan J. Marschke K.B. Ho K.-C. Perry S.T. Wilson E.M. French F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4456-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in these studies as a nonspecific competitor. Nuclear proteins were incubated with 32P-labeled probes, and protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels as described above. Gels were exposed to UV light (254 nm) for 30 min, and D2-protein complexes were visualized on overnight autoradiographic exposures. Bands were cut from the gel and homogenized in SDS sample buffer (0.25 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2.2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were resolved on 15% polyacrylamide denaturing gels. Controls were from lanes with 32P-labeled probes either in the absence of nuclear extracts or in the presence of nuclear extracts but with no UV light exposure. Protein size was determined using RainbowTM high molecular weight range markers (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The schematic shown in Fig.1 demonstrates the structure of the 20-kDa protein gene. We used DNase I footprinting of D2 in isolated nuclei of rat ventral prostate and ligation-mediated PCR to detect androgen-dependent changes in chromatin structure. Nuclei were treated with DNase I, and ligation-mediated PCR was performed on isolated DNA using primer sets for amplification of the D2 region in intron 1 of the 20-kDa protein gene. DNase I cleavage sites in the sense strand of D2 indicate the presence of protected regions and hypersensitive sites in nuclei from intact rats compared with nuclei isolated 24 (Fig. 2 A) and 48 h (Fig.2 B) after castration. Diminished intensities of bands in intact compared with castrate lanes 24 h after castration demonstrate several protected regions. A few weakly protected sites were more apparent at the lower concentration of DNase I. After 48 h, protected regions and several hypersensitive sites were revealed, with changes spanning the full fragment. The schematic representation in Fig. 2, C and D, illustrates the position of these changes in the nucleotide sequence of D2 for each treatment. The results indicate an androgen effect on chromatin structure in the region of D2. DNA-protein interactions were analyzed by DNase I footprinting in vitro using D2 end-labeled and ventral prostate nuclear proteins (Fig. 3). Parallel binding reactions were performed without protein as a control for the nuclease digestion pattern of protein-free DNA. Fig. 3 Ashows the results obtained with D2 end-labeled in the sense strand. Protected regions (asterisks) and hypersensitive sites (arrowheads) were formed with nuclear proteins from intact rats and castrated rats treated immediately with testosterone, as compared with nuclear proteins from 48-h postcastrates, suggesting the presence of androgen-dependent D2 binding proteins in ventral prostate nuclei. A schematic representation of these androgen-dependent protected regions and hypersensitive sites in D2 is presented in Fig. 3 B. Footprinting in vitro with D2 end-labeled in the antisense strand revealed stronger androgen-dependent protected regions and hypersensitive sites than those obtained with D2 end-labeled in the sense strand (Fig. 4 A). Comparing Figs. 3 B and 4 B, similar footprints in sense and antisense labeled D2 were observed in the inverted repeat 2 (GATAAA) present in the 5′ and middle region of D2. Other locations of footprints in sense and antisense strand are consistent with the complex dyad symmetry within the D2 sequence and suggest that both single- and double-stranded DNA binding proteins are involved in these footprints. These data indicate that multiple proteins bind D2, and some D2-protein interactions are androgen-dependent. The tissue specificity of D2 footprints was examined using the same amounts of nuclear proteins from kidney of intact male rats. D2 DNase I digestion patterns were almost identical to those obtained in the absence of nuclear proteins (Fig. 3 C). To further analyze the binding of androgen-regulated nuclear proteins, three double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotides spanning D2 were synthesized and used in gel mobility shift assays. Oligonucleotide A spans the 5′-end (nucleotides 2549 to 2594), oligonucleotide B spans the middle region (nucleotides 2595 to 2638), and oligonucleotide C spans the 3′-end of D2 (nucleotides 2639 to 2681). The specificity of nuclear protein binding to these sequences was tested using molar excess amounts of double-stranded A, B, C, and random unlabeled oligonucleotides as competitors. Protein-DNA complexes with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide A migrated at 3 different positions (A1, A2, and A3) (Fig. 5 A). Complexes A1 and A2 were eliminated by an excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide A but not by oligonucleotide C or a random oligonucleotide. When 32P-labeled oligonucleotide B was used as a probe, four DNA-protein complexes were observed (Fig.5 B). Minor complexes (B1 and B2) and one major complex (B4) were competed with unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide B but not with oligonucleotide C or a random oligonucleotide. Bands A3 and B3 were not competed either by the specific or nonspecific unlabeled oligonucleotides, indicating nonspecific protein binding. Competition assays suggested that proteins involved in complexes A1 and A2 are related to bands B1 and B2 since unlabeled oligonucleotide B competed for complexes A1 and A2 while unlabeled oligonucleotide A competed for B1 and B2. However, unlabeled oligonucleotide A at 250 molar excess had little effect on complex B4, suggesting that this protein bound specifically to oligonucleotide B. Since D2 contains regions of complex dyad symmetry, we tested for single-stranded D2 binding proteins in nuclear extracts by competition with unlabeled single-stranded oligonucleotides. Bands A1 and A2 observed with double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide A (32 P-Oligo A"
https://openalex.org/W2067515669,"Subunit 7 of the yeast cytochromebc 1 complex is encoded by the nuclearQCR7 gene and is essential for respiration. This protein does not contain a cleavable N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, and it is not understood how the Qcr7 protein is imported into mitochondria and assembled into the complex. To test the role of the N terminus of the Qcr7 protein in mitochondrial import, assembly of the complex, and proton translocation, we inactivated the endogenousQCR7 gene and expressed mutated qcr7 genes capable of synthesizing proteins truncated by 7, 10, 14, and 20 residues (Qcr7p-Δ7, Qcr7p-Δ10, Qcr7p-Δ14, and Qcr7p-Δ20, respectively) from the N terminus. In addition, we studied two mutants containing Qcr7 proteins with point mutations in addition to a Δ7 truncation, Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V) and Qcr7p-Δ7(R10K). All the mutant proteins with the exception of Qcr7p-Δ10 were present in the mitochondria at 30 °C, although most at lower steady-state levels than the Qcr7p from the strain overexpressing wild typeQCR7. The absence of the Qcr7p-Δ10 may be the result of an unstable protein or a decrease in the efficiency of mitochondrial import due to its compromised amphipathic α-helix and the presence of a negative charge exposed at the N terminus. Cytochrome creductase activities and the amounts of ATP synthesized were comparable with the wild type in the strain expressing Qcr7p-Δ7. The strain expressing Qcr7p-Δ7(R10K) had an identical phenotype to the one containing the Qcr7p-Δ7, whereas strains expressing the Qcr7p-Δ10, Qcr7p-Δ14, Qcr7p-Δ20, and Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V) were all respiration-deficient. Examination of the steady-state levels of complex III subunits showed that core protein 2, cytochromec 1, the iron-sulfur protein, and the 11-kDa subunit are reduced in respiration-deficient mutant strains. Results from deletion analyses indicate that the N-terminal 20 residues (after Met-1) of the Qcr7 protein are not essential for import into mitochondria and that the N-terminal seven residues (after Met-1) are not involved in proton translocation. The results of this work show, however, that the N terminus of the Qcr7 protein is essential for the biosynthesis of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase.

The results of this work show, however, that the N terminus of the Qcr7 protein is essential for the biosynthesis of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. The mitochondrial respiratory chain consists of multisubunit enzyme complexes that are embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electron transport through the ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase and cytochrome oxidase complexes in S. cerevisiaeis coupled to vectorial H+ translocation into the intermembrane space, resulting in the establishment of a H+gradient and subsequent membrane potential. The energy from this gradient is then used as the driving force for ion translocation, protein import into mitochondria, and ATP synthesis, which is catalyzed by the F0F1 ATPase (1Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2De Vries S. Marres C.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 205-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase consists of 10 subunits in yeast (2De Vries S. Marres C.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 205-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 3Brandt U. Uribe S. Schägger H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12947-12953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are the three heme-containing subunits cytochrome b, cytochrome c 1, and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein as well as an additional six so-called supernumerary subunits whose functions remain largely unknown. The homologous complex in some prokaryotes such as P. dentrificans consists of only the three catalytic subunits (4Yang X. Trumpower B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that have been conserved throughout evolution. Thus, it is possible that the supernumerary subunits do not have any functions in the energy transducing activity of the bc 1 complex. However, gene inactivation studies of these supernumerary subunits have shown that all are necessary for the integrity and normal functioning of complex III (5Yang M. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1270-1275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Graham L.A. Phillips J.D. Trumpower B.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 7Maarse A.C.

Cytochrome b is encoded by the mitochondrial genome, the other polypeptides being nuclear encoded (8Wallace D.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1982; 46: 208-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These nuclear encoded subunits are targeted for import into mitochondria after synthesis on cytoplasmic ribosomes. Thus there is a requirement for the coordination of the two separate genetic systems for assembly of thebc 1 complex. QCR7, the yeast gene encoding the 14.5-kDa polypeptide, has been cloned and sequenced and was found to be homologous to the 13.4-kDa subunit of the bc 1 complex in beef heart mitochondria (9De Haan M. van Loon A.P.G.M.

Plenum Publishing, New York1987: 289-301Crossref Google Scholar). Studies performed on thebc 1 complex in beef heart suggest that the N terminus of the 13.4-kDa subunit protrudes into the matrix where it has been postulated to contribute to the H+ conducting pathway(s) from the matrix phase to the primary protolytic redox center (12Lorusso M. Cocco T. Boffoli D. Gatti D. Meinhardt S. Ohnishi T. Papa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of 7–11 residues from the N terminus of this subunit was associated with decoupling of redox-linked H+ pumping (13Cocco T. Lorusso M. Sardanelli A.M. Minuto M. Ronchi S. Tedeschi G. Papa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have now investigated the involvement of the Qcr7p N terminus with respect to mitochondrial targeting, complex III assembly, and proton conduction. By CD spectroscopy of synthetic peptides we show that the secondary structures of the N termini of the yeast and beef heart proteins strongly resemble one another and are largely α-helical when inserted into the membrane-mimetic environment of SDS micelles. By deletion analysis we found that the N-terminal seven amino acids are not required for conducting protons and that the N-terminal 20 residues are not required for import into mitochondria. However, the N terminus does contain information required for the assembly of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase. l-Amino acids, uracil, adenine, serum albumin (essentially fatty acid-free), succinate, horse heart cytochrome c, and Total Protein Reagent™ were obtained from Sigma. Yeast extract, peptone, tryptone, and yeast nitrogen base without amino acids were purchased from Difco. Most restriction and modification enzymes were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. T7 GEN in vitro mutagenesis kit was obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Yeast lytic enzyme, zymolyase 100T, and galactose were purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals. Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at the University of Toronto. Yeast expression vector pG-3 (14Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1991Google Scholar) was a gift from Jacqueline Segall at the University of Toronto. Alkaline phosphatase substratesp-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-toluidine were purchased from Bio-Rad. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303–1B (Matα, ade 2–1, his 3–11, 15, ura 3–1, leu 2–3, 112, trp 1–1, can 1–100) was used as the parent strain. Rho−strain (Mat a, ura 1 [rho − ][C321R E514°]) was obtained from ATCC 42209 (donated by L. A. Grivell). Transformation of yeast was carried out by the Me2SO-enhanced whole cell yeast transformation method (15Hill J. Ian K.A. Donald G. Griffiths D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on minimal medium containing 0.87% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 2% (w/v) glucose, 2% agar and supplemented with the appropriate amino acid mix (0.87 mg/liter). Escherichia coli strain JMED3 was used for propagation of recombinant DNA constructs in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid DNA from E. coli (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and genomic DNA from yeast (14Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1991Google Scholar) were isolated as described. E. coli strain JMED3 was made competent by growing a culture to A 600< 0.5, pelleting the cells, and resuspending them in 0.12 volumes of cold 0.1 m CaCl2 with gentle shaking by hand. Cells were left on ice for 30 min, pelleted, and resuspended in 0.02 volumes of cold 0.1 m CaCl2 containing 15% (v/v) glycerol. After another 30-min incubation on ice, cells were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Yeast were made competent for transformation as described in Ref. 15Hill J. Ian K.A. Donald G. Griffiths D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar. The original pG-3 expression plasmid was modified by digestion with SacI to excise a 1700-base pair fragment in the polylinker region and self-ligated to create the new pG-3Δ vector. Recombinant plasmids were constructed by digesting pG-3Δ with SalI and KpnI in two steps followed by ligation to an accordingly restricted QCR7 gene generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. Ligations were carried out overnight at 12 °C. The coding region of the QCR7 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from yeast genomic DNA and subcloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen, San Diego). This construct was linearized withHincII to generate one fragment, disrupted in the middle of the QCR7 gene. The LEU2 gene, isolated from the vector pFJ110 by the blunt cutting enzyme PVUII, was subcloned into this HincII site. The fragment containing theLEU2 gene flanked by the disrupted qcr7 gene was excised from the plasmid and transformed into yeast strain W303-1B. Transformants were selected for on leucine-deficient medium. Mutants were constructed using polymerase chain reaction. For the deletion mutants, degenerate oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized missing the bases corresponding to the N-terminal 2–8, 2–11, 2–15, and 2–21 amino acids, respectively. Point mutants were generated from the Qcr7p-Δ7 by using oligonucleotides containing the missense mutations R10K and D13V, respectively. Mutant genes generated by polymerase chain reaction were digested with SalI andKpnI and subcloned into the respective sites of the pG-3Δ vector. DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using the T7 Sequencing kit from Pharmacia. The sequencing primers used were in the central portion, 5′-GGGAGTCTTCTTAAAGCGG-3′, and in the 3′ downstream region of the coding sequence, 5′-CCGTCGACCGGGTTGTGTGTTCGTGGTG-3′. Total yeast RNA was prepared by growing a 25-ml culture overnight, harvesting the cells, and resuspending them in 2 ml of AE buffer (50 mm NaOAc, pH 4.8, 10 mmEDTA). The suspension was vortexed after the addition of 200 μl of 10% SDS and again after the addition of 450 μl of phenol saturated with AE buffer. The suspension was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min during which it was vortexed three times. Then the mixture was washed with equal volume of phenol/chloroform, and the RNA was precipitated from the supernatant with 2.5 volumes of ethanol. Northern blotting was performed as described by Fourney et al. (17Fourney R.M. Miyakoshi J. Day III, R.S. Paterson M.C. Focus. 1988; 10: 5-7Google Scholar). NADH-cytochrome c reductase and succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities were assayed in 0.1 m potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.0, containing 94 μm cytochrome c and 1 mm azide. To start the reaction, either 34.2 μm NADH or 10 mm succinate was added, and reduction of cytochromec was monitored at 550 nm. Cytochrome oxidase activities were assayed in 0.1 m potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.0. Cytochrome c was reduced with 3.2 mmascorbate followed by dialysis against 0.1 m potassium Pi for 2 days, during which the buffer was changed twice. Reduced cytochrome c (94 μm) was added to start the reaction and oxidation of cytochrome c was followed at 550 nm. For spectral analyses of the cytochromes, mitochondria were resuspended in 0.1 m potassium Pi, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5% cholic acid (10Schoppink P.J. Berden J.A. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To obtain a spectrum containing cytochromes c andc 1, cytochrome b, and cytochromesa and a 3, a ferricyanide (grains) oxidized spectrum was deducted from a dithionite (grains) reduced spectrum. To obtain a spectrum containing cytochrome b only, dithionite reduced minus ascorbate (grains)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (0.2 mm) reduced samples were run. Spectra were recorded on a DW-2a Aminco spectrophotometer from 520–620 nm. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was run according to the published procedure (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred for 2 h at 55 V at 4 °C in 1 × running buffer (3.02 g of Tris, 14.4 g of glycine/liter), 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol. Blots were subsequently blocked with 2% gelatin in Blotto (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h and then incubated overnight with primary antibody in Blotto containing 1% gelatin. Blots were washed 4 × 30 min in Blotto and then incubated for 1–2 h under the above conditions with a secondary antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase. Membranes were washed 4 × 15 min in Blotto, and the proteins were visualized using p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-toluidine as substrates in 0.1m NaHCO3-1 mmMgCl2. Cultures were grown for 2 days in synthetic medium containing a variety of different carbon sources. Mitochondria were isolated essentially as outlined (14Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1991Google Scholar) with the substitution of breaking buffer (0.6 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.5, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for mitochondrial isolation buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in breaking buffer without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.6 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.5, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Freshly prepared coupled mitochondria were resuspended in 200 μl of breaking buffer without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To start the reaction, 5 mmpotassium Pi, pH 7.4, 1 mm ADP, and 5 mm succinate were freshly added. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, and the reaction was stopped with 80 mm perchloric acid. Proteins were pelleted, and the supernatant was assayed for the amount of ATP synthesized by using a hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase coupled assay (18Robinson B.H. Ward J. Goodyear P. Beaudet A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1422-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the NADPH generated was measured by an Eppendorf fluorimeter. Peptides were chosen as follows from the N terminus of the Qcr7 protein in yeast and the homolog in beef heart and synthesized by the Alberta Peptide Institute: AGRPAVSASSRWLEG (beef heart, peptide 1), AGRPAVSASSRWLEGIRKWYYNAAG (beef heart, peptide 2), PQSFTSIARIGDY (yeast, peptide 3), and PQSFTSIARIGDYILKSPVLSKL (yeast, peptide 4). For recording CD spectra, peptides were dissolved at 1 mg/ml in either 10 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, methanol, or SDS (to a 30-fold molar excess diluted in 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4·H2O). Spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720A spectropolarimeter and scanned two to three times each from 250 to 190 nm at 25 °C. Base-line spectra for each solvent were subtracted from the peptide spectra. The yeast strain YSM-qcr7Δ, which contains the chromosomal qcr7Δ:LEU2 disruption, lacks a mRNA transcript for the qcr7 gene (results not shown). The absence of mRNA indicates that a fusion transcript containing the LEU2 gene within the disrupted qcr7 coding region is not synthesized, nor is a stable transcript made corresponding to the 5′ end of the qcr7 gene. A message of approximately 450 bases can be seen in YSM-qcr7Δ when complemented with QCR7 on the expression vector pG-3Δ (not shown). Immunoblotting with an antibody recognizing the core proteins, the iron-sulfur protein and the 17-, 14-, and 11-kDa subunits, showed that no Qcr7 protein is present in mitochondrial membranes isolated from YSM-qcr7Δ (Fig. 1, lane 5). A band, however, can be seen in Fig. 1 (lane 6) corresponding to the Qcr7p from the strain YSM-qcr7Δ complemented with the wild typeQCR7 gene. This indicates that the Qcr7p is being produced from the expression plasmid and imported into mitochondria. Linket al. (11Link T.A. Schaegger H. Von Jagow G. Papa S. Chance B. Ernster L. Cytochrome Systems. Plenum Publishing, New York1987: 289-301Crossref Google Scholar) have previously suggested that the N terminus of the 13.4-kDa subunit of complex III from beef heart mitochondria forms an amphiphilic α-helix. To confirm this helicity and to compare the yeast N terminus of the Qcr7 protein with its beef heart homolog, two peptides corresponding to amino acids 2–16 and 2–26, respectively, for the bovine sequence and 2–14 and 2–24, respectively, for the yeast sequence were synthesized (see “Experimental Procedures”). CD spectra were obtained for all four peptides in aqueous buffer, methanol, and SDS micelles. All peptides formed only a limited amount of secondary structure in aqueous buffer; however, as shown in Fig.2, peptides 2 (long beef heart peptide,top panel, middle) and 4 (long yeast peptide, bottom panel, middle) have considerable α-helix content in methanol. In SDS micelles, the secondary structure of peptides 2 and 4 are similarly α-helical (Fig. 2). Spectra and helical content of peptide 4(bottom panels) strongly resemble that of peptide1 (short beef heart peptide, spectra not shown), an expected result, because these two regions can be shown to be homologous upon comparison of the yeast Qcr7 protein with the beef heart 13.4-kDa protein (11Link T.A. Schaegger H. Von Jagow G. Papa S. Chance B. Ernster L. Cytochrome Systems. Plenum Publishing, New York1987: 289-301Crossref Google Scholar). Many nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins possess targeting sequences, 15–70 amino acids long, which are usually located at the N terminus. Some proteins such as cytochromesc 1 and b 2 even have bipartite signal sequences that are cleaved in two steps (19Segui-Real B. Stuart R. Neupert W. FEBS Letts. 1992; 313: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Gasser S.M. Ohashi A. Daum G. Boehni P.C. Gibson J. Reid G.A. Yonetani T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Targeting sequences have no obvious homology but are generally rich in hydrophobic and hydroxylated amino acids, have a net positive charge, and are able to form amphipathic α-helices when in contact with the lipid bilayer (21Hammen P.K. Gorenstein D.G. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Pfanner N. Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 331-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 23Allison D.S. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The Qcr7 protein does not contain a cleavable N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. However, given the α-helical nature of the wild type Qcr7p N terminus and its potential for forming an amphiphilic helix (Fig. 3), we decided to investigate whether this region contains any information for the mitochondrial localization of the protein. Accordingly, we constructed four deletion mutants in which residues 2–8, 2–11, 2–15, and 2–21 (Qcr7p-Δ7, Qcr7p-Δ10, Qcr7p-Δ14, and Qcr7p-Δ20, respectively) were deleted from the N terminus (Fig. 3). In each case the initial Met (residue 1) was retained; however, a number of residues typical for import sequences were deleted. When expressing the Qcr7p-Δ7, the Qcr7p-Δ14, and the Qcr7p-Δ20 in the strain YSM-qcr7Δ at 30 °C, the respective, truncated Qcr7 proteins are synthesized and transported into mitochondria, as can be seen from the Western analysis in Fig. 1(lanes 1, 2, and 4). However, it is evident that the amount of protein present in the mitochondria is lower in yeast transformed with the deletion mutants than in yeast transformed with the wild type gene. It is also obvious that in yeast transformed with the gene encoding Qcr7p-Δ10, the protein is not present in the mitochondria (Fig. 1, lane 3). This protein may be unstable and degraded in the cytoplasm or in the mitochondria. Growth studies were performed at 30 °C on two types of solid media to determine whether any of the mutants are respiration-deficient. Fig.4 (top) shows that when grown on synthetic deficient medium with ethanol/glycerol containing 0.1% glucose, the yeast Qcr7p-Δ7 is comparable in size with the wild type, whereas YSM-qcr7Δ as well as yeast strains containing Qcr7p-Δ10, -Δ14, and -Δ20 are pet − mutants, indicative of a respiratory chain defect. Similarly, when grown on synthetic deficient medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source (Fig. 4,bottom), the deficient deletion mutants remain white. The wild type strain has a red phenotype due to the ade2mutation, which causes a pigment to accumulate (24Stotz A. Linder P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 95: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In respiration incompetent mutants, this pigment is not formed, and the cells retain a white phenotype. Growth characteristics of the strains containing the point mutants (not shown) were in agreement with the results from the enzyme activities. The strain expressing Qcr7p-Δ7(R10K) was comparable with the wild type, whereas that containing Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V) resembled the profile of the respiration-deficient deletion mutants. Having established that the majority of mutant proteins are present in the mitochondria, it was of interest to find out whether they assemble into a functional enzyme complex. Mitochondrial membranes from the yeast YSM-qcr7Δ were devoid of NADH-cytochrome c reductase (Fig.5) and succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was diminished by about 35% when compared with the wild type (not shown). Strains carrying Qcr7p-Δ7 and the Qcr7p-Δ7(R10K) were assayed for respiratory chain complex activities and found to have wild type activities for NADH-cytochrome c reductase (Fig. 5) as well as succinate-cytochrome c reductase and cytochromec oxidase (not shown). Expression of qcr7 genes encoding Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V), Qcr7p-Δ14, and Qcr7p-Δ20, which produce stable but truncated protein products that are located into mitochondria, did not restore NADH-cytochrome c reductase (Fig. 5) or succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities. Cytochrome c oxidase activities were lowered in these strains by 35% similarly as in YSM-qcr7Δ. When examining the levels of the other subunits in the complex (Fig. 1), it can be seen that core protein 1 is present at comparable levels in all the mutant strains and the wild type. Intermediate iron-sulfur and cytochrome c 1proteins are present in high amounts in the wild type and in somewhat lower amounts in the strain expressing the Qcr7p-Δ7. Strains carrying Qcr7p-Δ14 and Qcr7p-Δ20, however, only contain trace amounts of these intermediates, and they are not detectable in the strain with Qcr7p-Δ10 and in YSM-qcr7Δ. Mature iron-sulfur and cytochromec 1 proteins are present in all strains, although in varying amounts. Of the strains examined in Fig. 1, yeast expressing wild type and Δ7 Qcr7 proteins contain comparable levels, whereas the remaining mutants have lower amounts. A similar pattern is seen for the 11-kDa subunit, with the highest levels in the mutants expressing wild type and Qcr7p-Δ7, and the lowest levels in the strain expressing the Qcr7p-Δ10 and the YSM-qcr7Δ. To determine more precisely what the function of the N terminus may be, we constructed two point mutants in the context of a Δ7 deletion. The mutations targeted two charged residues, Arg-10 (changed to Lys) and Asp-13 (mutated to Val). From examining the subunit composition of the strains containing these mutant proteins (Fig. 6), it is evident that the mutant Qcr7 proteins are all located in the mitochondria. Interestingly, in the strain expressing Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V) the level of 14-kDa subunit is comparable with the wild type, whereas in the strain with Qcr7p-Δ7(R10K) the level is similar to that of the yeast containing the Qcr7p-Δ7, Qcr7p-Δ14, and Qcr7p-Δ20. All the other subunits are present at comparable amounts in the yeast containing Qcr7p-Δ7(R10K) as in the yeast overexpressing the wild type QCR7 gene. As for the strain expressing the Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V), its subunit composition is similar to that of the Δ14 and Δ20 deletion mutants; unchanged amounts of core protein 1, however, lower amounts of mature cytochrome c 1and the iron-sulfur protein. Furthermore, the 11-kDa subunit as well as intermediate cytochrome c 1 and iron-sulfur proteins are nearly undetectable in this strain. From the spectral analyses it is evident that the strain carrying the conservative substitution R10K displays near wild type levels of cytochromeb, whereas the strain expressing proteins with the D13V mutation contains low and undetectable amounts of cytochromeb, respectively (spectra not shown). Taken together with the results from the enzyme activities, the varying levels of complex III subunits implicate the Qcr7p N terminus in assembly. Because truncation of the N-terminal seven amino acids does not impair electron transport, we were interested in determining whether this segment contributes to the proton conducting pathways from the matrix phase to the primary protolytic redox center. Studies have been performed on the homologous subunit in beef heart where cleavage of 7–11 residues from the N terminus was correlated with decoupling of redox-linked proton pumping (13Cocco T. Lorusso M. Sardanelli A.M. Minuto M. Ronchi S. Tedeschi G. Papa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To establish a proton gradient, electron transport has to be intact; hence, of the strains tested, only Qcr7p-Δ7 produced ATP in the assay system. With succinate as substrate, the integrity of the proton gradient that is established by complexes III and III+IV was measured. When ferricyanide was used as electron acceptor and cytochrome oxidase was inhibited by azide, the ATP produced was solely due to the action of complex III. In both cases, the yield of ATP in the mutant with Qcr7p-Δ7 was comparable with the wild type (not shown). This indicates that in yeast, unlike in beef heart, the N-terminal seven amino acids are unlikely to be involved in proton translocation. The growth of the yeast strain expressing the Qcr7p-Δ7 displays a different profile at 37 °C when compared with the phenotype at 30 °C. At 37 °C this strain is a pet −mutant with undetectable NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity. In this case the immunoblotting (Fig. 7) showed that the Δ7 protein was not present in the mitochondria (lane 1) in contrast to the wild type (lane 2). This result suggests that the Qcr7p-Δ7 is not sufficiently stable at 37 °C to be imported into mitochondria and therefore degraded in the cytoplasm or, alternatively, that it is imported and rapidly degraded in the mitochondria. Previous studies of the QCR7 gene have shown that this subunit is an essential component of ubiquinol-cytochrome coxidoreductase (10Schoppink P.J. Berden J.A. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that the C terminus may be involved in the assembly of a functional enzyme complex (25Hemrika W. De Jong M. Berden J.A. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the current work, we have investigated the role of the N terminus of the Qcr7 protein with respect to proton translocation, because previous studies have postulated that this subunit faces the matrix (13Cocco T. Lorusso M. Sardanelli A.M. Minuto M. Ronchi S. Tedeschi G. Papa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Japa S. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13994-13997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is involved in the uptake of protons from the matrix (13Cocco T. Lorusso M. Sardanelli A.M. Minuto M. Ronchi S. Tedeschi G. Papa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We were also interested in determining the importance of this region with respect to assembly of the bc 1 complex and mitochondrial targeting, because the Qcr7 protein does not contain a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence but displays features characteristic such sequences. We have approached the above issues by expressing a number of point and deletion mutants in the strain YSM-qcr7Δ in which we inactivated the chromosomal QCR7 gene and through investigation of the secondary structure(s) of selected N-terminal peptides by CD spectroscopy and comparison with their beef heart homologs. We have confirmed earlier findings of Schoppink et al. (10Schoppink P.J. Berden J.A. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that inactivating the QCR7 gene gives rise to a respiration-deficient strain. Complementation of this strain with the gene encoding Qcr7p-Δ7 restored cytochrome c reductase activities to wild type levels at 30 °C (Fig. 5) and resulted in a strain that was no longer respiration-deficient (Fig. 4). This result indicated that electron transport had been restored, and we proceeded to examine whether these N-terminal amino acids play a role in proton transfer by assaying the amount of ATP synthesized in coupled mitochondria. Efficiency of ATP synthesis in the mutant containing Qcr7p-Δ7, however, was observed to be equivalent to the wild type, and it was concluded that the involvement of the N-terminal seven amino acids in proton translocation and ATP synthesis is unlikely to be critical. When complementing YSM-qcr7Δ with the gene encoding Qcr7p-Δ10, a substantially different profile is seen. The Qcr7p-Δ10 is not present in the mitochondria (Fig. 1), and as a result, complex III is inactive and the mutant strain is respiration-deficient. Truncation of 10 amino acids from the N terminus of the Qcr7p results in the exposure of the negative charge of Asp-13 at the front end (now residue 2 of mature Qcr7p) of the protein. It is conceivable that the exposure of this negative charge is detrimental to the import process. Mitochondrial signal sequences rarely contain negatively charged residues; however, depending on their location and orientation they may not always be as disruptive. In addition, it is not clear whether this or any of the other truncated proteins can form amphiphilic α-helices because the charged residues are more widely interspersed with hydrophobic residues and thus result in sequences uncharacteristic for amphiphilic helices. Alternatively, this result may simply imply that the protein is unstable and degraded in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria. The phenotype of the strains containing the Qcr7p-Δ14 and Qcr7p-Δ20 is significantly different from mutants with Qcr7p-Δ7 and Qcr7p-Δ10. Strains expressing these truncated proteins form stable products that are imported into mitochondria (Fig. 1), albeit to a lesser degree than the Qcr7p from the wild type strain in whichQCR7 is overexpressed. Significantly, NADH-cytochromec reductase activities are absent, and these mutants display a pet − phenotype (Fig. 4), despite the fact that their truncated proteins are present in the mitochondria at levels comparable with those of the respiration-competent mutant containing Qcr7p-Δ7. Examination of the steady-state levels of the 11-kDa subunit, as well as the iron-sulfur protein and cytochromec 1, shows that these subunits are significantly reduced in strains with Qcr7p-Δ14 and Qcr7p-Δ20 when compared with the wild type strain. To determine more precisely the function of the N terminus of the Qcr7p, we mutated the two charged residues Arg-10 and Asp-13 in the context of a Δ7 deletion. The strain complemented with the Qcr7p-Δ7(R10K), which contains a conservative substitution, has a phenotype comparable with that carrying the Qcr7p-Δ7 and the wild type at 30 °C. On the other hand, the strain expressing Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V) is completely devoid of NADH-cytochrome creductase activities and displays a pet −phenotype. Furthermore, when examining the levels of complex III subunits in this mutant, it can be seen (Fig. 6) that the levels of cytochrome c 1, iron-sulfur protein, and 11-kDa subunit are reduced, with the level of 11-kDa subunit being lower than in mutants with Qcr7p-Δ14 and Qcr7p-Δ20. This stands in contrast to the level of Qcr7p, which is higher in this mutant than in the others and compares with the wild type (Fig. 6). Cytochrome bspectra of strains with the Qcr7p-Δ7(R10K) and Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V) correlate with the results from the NADH-cytochrome creductase activities; the R10K mutation resulted in a strain with nearly wild type levels of cytochrome b, whereas cytochromeb was not detectable in the strain with Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V). Although the N-terminal 23 amino acids spontaneously assume a largely α-helical conformation (Fig. 2) when inserted into the membrane-mimetic environment of SDS micelles and there is a potential for the wild type N terminus to form an amphiphilic α-helix (Fig. 3), in strains expressing Qcr7p-Δ7 and Qcr7p-Δ7(R10K) the complex functions just as in the wild type at 30 °C. This finding suggests that the N-terminal seven amino acids are not required for the functioning of the complex. However, in strains complemented with the Qcr7p-Δ14 and Qcr7p-Δ20, as well as with Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V), the truncated Qcr7 protein products are imported into mitochondria at 30 °C to approximately the same level as Qcr7p-Δ7, but thebc 1 complex is not functional. All the mutants with the exception of the strain expressing the Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V) contain lower than wild type levels of Qcr7p in the mitochondria. This fact may point toward a function in mitochondrial import for the N terminus, especially because Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V) is present at wild type levels. One could argue that the elimination of the negative charge, which is an uncommon feature for signal sequences, causes the N terminus to assume a more typical character for transit sequences. This may in turn compensate for the truncation of the seven residues and restore mitochondrial protein levels back to wild type levels as seen in the mutant with Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V). If the Qcr7 protein were to follow the same import pathway as proteins that have a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence, then deletion of the N terminus could conceivably cause a number of problems that result in decreased import. Truncated proteins may not interact with cytosolic chaperones as efficiently, or alternatively they may not bind as tightly to the outer mitochondrial membrane receptors. The absence of the Qcr7p-Δ7 at 37 °C could thus be due to a higher degradation rate at that temperature, resulting from impaired binding to cytosolic chaperones, for example. Roise et al. (27Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) have suggested that part of the mechanism of import is the perturbation of the phospholipid bilayer by the surface active amphiphilic helix of the presequence. This ability of the presequence to cause a local defect in the membranes would then create a route for the rest of the protein to follow. It is thus conceivable that the deletion mutants in our study cannot enter the membrane as efficiently, because the amphiphilic character (and inherent lytic properties) has been decreased by shortening the presequence. Hence, this again may reduce the efficiency of import. In summary, the N terminus of the Qcr7p of thebc 1 complex may have some characteristic features of mitochondrial targeting sequences and may indeed facilitate import. Nevertheless, this region is not essential for the localization of the Qcr7 protein into mitochondria. This notion is reinforced by Western blot analyses of cytosolic protein fractions, which do not show an accumulation of nonimported Qcr7 proteins (result not shown). Because the steady-state levels of Qcr7p-Δ14, Qcr7p-Δ20, and Qcr7p-Δ7(D13V) are comparable with or higher than the level of Qcr7p-Δ7, the pet − character of the deficient mutants cannot be attributed to the decreased levels of Qcr7p. We therefore conclude that the respiratory chain defect of these mutants is the result of the lowered levels of complex III subunits. This implicates the N terminus of the Qcr7p in assembly of thebc 1 complex. More precisely, this region may bind cytochrome b and/or the 11-kDa subunit. Hence, substitution of critical residues in the N terminus of the Qcr7 protein may prevent the formation of the subcomplex consisting of cytochromeb and the 11-kDa and the 14-kDa subunits. This would then lead to the observed lowered steady-state levels of complex III subunits with the concurrent loss of complex III-linked enzyme activities.

Most spliceosome assembly assays, however, fail to detect the U1 snRNP. Here, I used a new native gel electrophoretic assay to find the yeast U1 snRNP in three pre-splicing complexes (δ, β1, α2) formed in vitro. The order of complex formation is deduced to be δ → β1 → α2 → α1 → β2, the active spliceosome. The δ complex is formed when U1 snRNP binds to pre-mRNA in the absence of ATP. There are two forms of δ: a major one, δun, unstable to competitor RNA; and a minor one, δcommit, committed to the splicing pathway. The other complexes are formed in the presence of ATP and contain the following snRNPs: β1, the pre-spliceosome, has both U1 and U2; α2 has all five, however, U1 is reduced compared with the others; and α1 and β2 have U2, U5, and U6. Prior work by others suggests that U1 is “handing off” the 5′ splice site region to the U5 and U6 snRNPs before splicing begins. The reduced levels of U1 snRNP in the α2 complex suggests that the handoff occurs during formation of this complex.

U1 is the first snRNP to bind to pre-mRNA during spliceosome assembly as studied by in vitro assays. Subsequently the U2 snRNP binds and the pre-spliceosome is formed. Next the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP binds, and the spliceosome is created. Finally, the spliceosome is activated for splicing by at least one conformational change in which the U4 and U6 snRNAs dissociate from one another.Although the order of binding of snRNPs and some non-snRNP proteins during spliceosome assembly is known, the presence and function of U1 snRNP in several of the spliceosome assembly intermediates are controversial. The U1 snRNP has been thought to function in recognizing the intron primarily during the early steps of spliceosome assembly. As the first snRNP to bind to the pre-mRNA, U1 has an important, hierarchic role in spliceosome assembly and in recognition of the splice sites in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The nucleotides 3–8 at the 5′ end of U1 snRNA base pair with the pre-mRNA 5′ splice site region (8Siliciano P.G. Guthrie C. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1258-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This interaction probably occurs when U1 binds to pre-mRNA because mutations in the pre-mRNA 5′ splice site decrease U1 snRNP binding and inhibit subsequent steps in spliceosome assembly (9Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Seraphin B. Rosbash M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2533-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). RNase H degradation (9Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) or depletion (11Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 59: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) of the U1 snRNP prevents the other snRNPs from binding to the pre-mRNA as well.In addition to base pairing with the 5′ splice site, U1 snRNP interacts directly or indirectly with several other spliceosomal components. A protein bridge may span the 5′ splice site and branchpoint region (12Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar,13Abovich N. Liao X.C. Rosbash M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and contribute to U1 snRNP binding to the pre-mRNA (9Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Rosbash M. Seraphin B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). U1 snRNP may also associate directly with the U2 snRNP as a U1/U2 snRNP complex can be induced in Hela cell extracts by an RNA complementary to the 5′ end of U1 snRNA (15Daugeron M.-C. Tazi J. Jeanteur P. Brunel C. Cathala G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3625-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Finally, U1 snRNP may interact with additional spliceosomal components during the late steps of spliceosome assembly as suggested by the finding that a 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotide complementary to U5 snRNA can induce the formation of a U1/U4/U5 snRNP complex in Hela cell extracts (16Ast G. Weiner A.M. Science. 1996; 272: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Most of these interactions are probably important for spliceosome assembly but not for splicing catalysis because once a yeast spliceosome is formed on the pre-mRNA, it can lose U1 snRNA and still catalyze splicing (17Yean S.-L. Lin R.-J. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 301-313PubMed Google Scholar).These interactions suggest that the U1 snRNP is present in several intermediates in spliceosome assembly. At least in HeLa cell splicing extracts, this is the case. When pre-mRNA is added to HeLa cell extracts, the pre-splicing complexes E, A, and B form in that order as precursors to the active spliceosome, complex C (18Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 19Reed R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8031-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Bennett M.

The U1 snRNP can be detected in all four complexes when purified by affinity chromatography. However, it is found predominantly in E, and its concentration decreases relative to the U2 and U4/U5/U6 snRNPs as these snRNPs bind during formation of the A and B complexes, respectively (20Bennett M. Michaud S. Kingston J. Reed R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1986-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These and other studies (23Bindereif A. Green M.R.

Cell. 1993; 75: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have proposed that the association of the U1 snRNP with the spliceosome changes sometime before splicing is catalyzed. In fact, U1 is supplanted by the U5 and U6 snRNAs at the pre-mRNA 5′ splice site before catalysis (for review, see Refs. 5Newman A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 462-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and 6Ares M. Weiser B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 131-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that the base pairing between U1 and pre-mRNA is disrupted even earlier, before U2 snRNP binds (25Liao X.C. Colot H.V. Wang Y. Rosbash M.

Pre-splicing complexes III, I, and II, as detected initially by one-gel electrophoretic assay (27Pikielny C.W. Rymond B.C. Rosbash M.

Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 1014-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), form in that order and contain the U2, U2/U4/U5/U6, and U2/U5/U6 snRNPs, respectively. U1 snRNP binding to the pre-mRNA during the first step of yeast spliceosome assembly was discovered subsequently by affinity chromatography (9Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and by gel-electrophoresis (11Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 59: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). All gel electrophoretic assays, however, have failed to find U1 snRNA in pre-splicing complexes formed after this first assembly step (11Seraphin B. Rosbash M.

Zapp M.L. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).To detect the U1 snRNP during yeast spliceosome assembly in vitro, I developed a new native gel electrophoretic assay. I found U1 snRNA in three pre-splicing complexes (δ, β1, and α2). One of these complexes, β1 (the pre-spliceosome), contains both U1 and U2 snRNAs as had been proposed by previous studies (9Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 59: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The α2 complex contains the U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs, as well as reduced amounts of U1. This reduction in the amount of U1 suggests that the association of U1 with pre-mRNA or other spliceosomal components that makes this snRNP stable in the pre-spliceosome is disrupted about the time the α2 complex is formed. This change in U1 may indicate the “handing off” of the 5′ splice site region from the U1 to the U5 and U6 snRNPs.

U1 is the first snRNP to bind to pre-mRNA during spliceosome assembly as studied by in vitro assays. Subsequently the U2 snRNP binds and the pre-spliceosome is formed. Next the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP binds, and the spliceosome is created. Finally, the spliceosome is activated for splicing by at least one conformational change in which the U4 and U6 snRNAs dissociate from one another. Although the order of binding of snRNPs and some non-snRNP proteins during spliceosome assembly is known, the presence and function of U1 snRNP in several of the spliceosome assembly intermediates are controversial. The U1 snRNP has been thought to function in recognizing the intron primarily during the early steps of spliceosome assembly. As the first snRNP to bind to the pre-mRNA, U1 has an important, hierarchic role in spliceosome assembly and in recognition of the splice sites in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The nucleotides 3–8 at the 5′ end of U1 snRNA base pair with the pre-mRNA 5′ splice site region (8Siliciano P.G. Guthrie C. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1258-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This interaction probably occurs when U1 binds to pre-mRNA because mutations in the pre-mRNA 5′ splice site decrease U1 snRNP binding and inhibit subsequent steps in spliceosome assembly (9Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Seraphin B. Rosbash M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2533-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). RNase H degradation (9Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) or depletion (11Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 59: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) of the U1 snRNP prevents the other snRNPs from binding to the pre-mRNA as well. In addition to base pairing with the 5′ splice site, U1 snRNP interacts directly or indirectly with several other spliceosomal components. A protein bridge may span the 5′ splice site and branchpoint region (12Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar,13Abovich N. Liao X.C. Rosbash M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and contribute to U1 snRNP binding to the pre-mRNA (9Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Rosbash M. Seraphin B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). U1 snRNP may also associate directly with the U2 snRNP as a U1/U2 snRNP complex can be induced in Hela cell extracts by an RNA complementary to the 5′ end of U1 snRNA (15Daugeron M.-C. Tazi J. Jeanteur P. Brunel C. Cathala G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3625-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Finally, U1 snRNP may interact with additional spliceosomal components during the late steps of spliceosome assembly as suggested by the finding that a 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotide complementary to U5 snRNA can induce the formation of a U1/U4/U5 snRNP complex in Hela cell extracts (16Ast G. Weiner A.M. Science. 1996; 272: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Most of these interactions are probably important for spliceosome assembly but not for splicing catalysis because once a yeast spliceosome is formed on the pre-mRNA, it can lose U1 snRNA and still catalyze splicing (17Yean S.-L. Lin R.-J. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 301-313PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions suggest that the U1 snRNP is present in several intermediates in spliceosome assembly. At least in HeLa cell splicing extracts, this is the case. When pre-mRNA is added to HeLa cell extracts, the pre-splicing complexes E, A, and B form in that order as precursors to the active spliceosome, complex C (18Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 19Reed R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8031-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Bennett M.

The U1 snRNP can be detected in all four complexes when purified by affinity chromatography. However, it is found predominantly in E, and its concentration decreases relative to the U2 and U4/U5/U6 snRNPs as these snRNPs bind during formation of the A and B complexes, respectively (20Bennett M. Michaud S. Kingston J. Reed R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1986-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These and other studies (23Bindereif A. Green M.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2415-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Konforti B.B. Koziolkiewicz M.J. Konarska M.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have proposed that the association of the U1 snRNP with the spliceosome changes sometime before splicing is catalyzed. In fact, U1 is supplanted by the U5 and U6 snRNAs at the pre-mRNA 5′ splice site before catalysis (for review, see Refs. 5Newman A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 462-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and 6Ares M. Weiser B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 131-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that the base pairing between U1 and pre-mRNA is disrupted even earlier, before U2 snRNP binds (25Liao X.C. Colot H.V. Wang Y. Rosbash M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4237-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Champion-Arnaud P. Gonzani O. Palandjian L. Reed R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5750-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the U1 snRNP has been thought to participate in several steps of spliceosome formation in yeast, its presence in most of the yeast pre-splicing complexes formed in vitro has not been shown. Pre-splicing complexes III, I, and II, as detected initially by one-gel electrophoretic assay (27Pikielny C.W. Rymond B.C. Rosbash M. Nature. 1986; 324: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 28Pikielny C.W. Rosbash M. Cell. 1986; 45: 869-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and complexes B, A2–1, and A2–2, as identified by a different gel assay (29Cheng S.-C. Abelson J. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 1014-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), form in that order and contain the U2, U2/U4/U5/U6, and U2/U5/U6 snRNPs, respectively. U1 snRNP binding to the pre-mRNA during the first step of yeast spliceosome assembly was discovered subsequently by affinity chromatography (9Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and by gel-electrophoresis (11Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 59: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). All gel electrophoretic assays, however, have failed to find U1 snRNA in pre-splicing complexes formed after this first assembly step (11Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 59: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 18Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar,27Pikielny C.W. Rymond B.C. Rosbash M. Nature. 1986; 324: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Cheng S.-C. Abelson J. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 1014-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), although the U1 snRNP-specific 70K protein was found in pre-splicing complexes formed in HeLa extracts and resolved by gel electrophoresis (30Zillmann M. Zapp M.L. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To detect the U1 snRNP during yeast spliceosome assembly in vitro, I developed a new native gel electrophoretic assay. I found U1 snRNA in three pre-splicing complexes (δ, β1, and α2). One of these complexes, β1 (the pre-spliceosome), contains both U1 and U2 snRNAs as had been proposed by previous studies (9Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 59: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The α2 complex contains the U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs, as well as reduced amounts of U1. This reduction in the amount of U1 suggests that the association of U1 with pre-mRNA or other spliceosomal components that makes this snRNP stable in the pre-spliceosome is disrupted about the time the α2 complex is formed. This change in U1 may indicate the “handing off” of the 5′ splice site region from the U1 to the U5 and U6 snRNPs. I thank J. Banroques, P. Fabrizio, L. Krinke, R-J. Lin, D. McPheeters, M.
