https://openalex.org/W1976829005,"Cytotoxic accumulation of long chain fatty acids has been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and heart disease. To explore the mechanism of cellular lipotoxicity, we cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in the presence of media supplemented with fatty acid. The saturated fatty acid palmitate, but not the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate, induced programmed cell death as determined by annexin V positivity, caspase 3 activity, and DNA laddering. <i>De novo</i> ceramide synthesis increased 2.4-fold with palmitate supplementation; however, this was not required for palmitate-induced apoptosis. Neither biochemical nor genetic inhibition of <i>de novo</i> ceramide synthesis arrested apoptosis in Chinese hamster ovary cells in response to palmitate supplementation. Rather, our data suggest that palmitate-induced apoptosis occurs through the generation of reactive oxygen species. Fluorescence of an oxidant-sensitive probe was increased 3.5-fold with palmitate supplementation indicating that production of reactive intermediates increased. In addition, palmitate-induced apoptosis was blocked by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene-disulfonic acid, two compounds that scavenge reactive intermediates. These studies suggest that generation of reactive oxygen species, independent of ceramide synthesis, is important for the lipotoxic response and may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases involving intracellular lipid accumulation."

Production of NADPH required for the regeneration of glutathione in the mitochondria is critical for scavenging mitochondrial ROS through glutathione reductase and peroxidase systems. We investigated the role of mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDPm) in controlling the mitochondrial redox balance and subsequent cellular defense against oxidative damage. We demonstrate in this report that IDPm is induced by ROS and that decreased expression of IDPm markedly elevates the ROS generation, DNA fragmentation, lipid peroxidation, and concurrent mitochondrial damage with a significant reduction in ATP level. Conversely, overproduction of IDPm protein efficiently protected the cells from ROS-induced damage. The protective role of IDPm against oxidative damage may be attributed to increased levels of a reducing equivalent, NADPH, needed for regeneration of glutathione in the mitochondria.

Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7913-7922Crossref Scopus (5418) Google Scholar). As one of the major sources of ROS (2Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4830) Google Scholar), mitochondria are highly susceptible to oxidative damage. ROS can damage mitochondrial enzymes directly (3Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), and they can cause mutation in mitochondrial DNAs (4Esposito L.A. Melov S. Panov A. Cottrell B.A. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). At the same time, ROS can change the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm), which is indicative of mitochondrial membrane integrity (5Huang P. Feng L. Oldham E.A. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Nature. 2000; 407: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) and precedes cell death induced by various toxic compounds and cytokines (6Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Qian T. Trost L.C.

Recent reports indicate that mitochondrial ROS cause apoptosis (7Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.-M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3294) Google Scholar,8Nomura K. Imai H. Koumura T. Arai M. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol.

Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp.

Another report also suggested that mitochondrial ROS directly caused apoptosis of T cells (12Hildeman D.A. Mitchell T. Teague T.K. Henson P. Day B.J. Kappler J. Marrack P.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). It was also reported that tumor necrosis factor α causes a rapid production of mitochondrial ROS (13Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and that ceramide, an apoptotic stimulus, also plays a crucial role in tumor necrosis factor α-induced mitochondrial ROS generation (14Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several other investigators demonstrated that ROS are involved in the signaling pathway of certain growth factors (15Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans C.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar) and cytokines (16Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In addition, mitochondrial ROS, under hypoxic conditions, activate the transcription of the genes for glycolytic enzymes as well as erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor by up-regulating a transcriptional factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (17Semenza G.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), suggesting that mitochondrial ROS mediate cross-talk between the nucleus and the mitochondria. These reports suggest an important role of ROS in the regulation of cellular homeostasis including cell death and signal transduction pathway after treatments with various agents or growth factors. During aerobic respiration to generate ATP in mitochondria, leakage of electrons frequently produces mitochondrial superoxide anions that are rapidly reduced to H2O2 by manganese superoxide dismutase. Because catalase, which metabolizes H2O2, is absent in the mitochondria of most animal cells (18Esworthy R, S. Ho Y.S. Chu F.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase plays a key role in metabolizing H2O2. Therefore, reduced glutathione (GSH), an efficient antioxidant and free radical scavenger by itself and required for the activity of mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase, becomes the best defense available against the potential toxicity of H2O2 in the mitochondria. Nevertheless, GSH is known to be synthesized in the cytosol and transported into the mitochondria (19Griffith O.W. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4668-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) through rapid exchange of GSH between the cytosol and mitochondria (20Martensson J. Lai J.C.K. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7185-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In contrast, oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in the mitochondria cannot be exported into the cytosol (21Olafsdottier K. Reed D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 964: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) for reconversion into GSH. These facts underscore the importance of mitochondrial NADPH as a necessary reducing equivalent for the regeneration of GSH from GSSG by the activity of mitochondrial glutathione reductase. Until now, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glu-6-P dehydrogenase) was regarded as the major source of cellular NADPH because it reduces cellular oxidative stress by increasing the GSH concentration (22Salvemini F. Franze A. Iervolino A. Filosa S. Salzano S. Ursini M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Because Glu-6-P dehydrogenase is absent in the mitochondria, the mechanism for maintaining the mitochondrial NADPH pool, crucial to the control of mitochondrial redox balance, remains to be elucidated. In mammals, three classes of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) isoenzymes exist: mitochondrial NAD+-dependent ICDH (IDH), mitochondrial NADP+-dependent ICDH (IDPm) and cytosolic NADP+-dependent ICDH (IDPc) (23Plaut G.W.E. Gabriel J.L. Biochemistry of Metabolic Process. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1983: 285-301Google Scholar). Among the eukaryotic ICDH isoenzymes, IDH has been assumed to play a major role in the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (24Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact roles of IDPm and IDPc, which catalyze decarboxylation of isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate with concurrent production of NADPH in the mitochondria and cytosol, respectively, have not been elucidated. We have reported previously the isolation and molecular characterization of cDNA clones for bovine IDPm (25Huh T.-L. Ryu J.H. Huh J.W. Sung H.C. Oh I.-U. Song B.J. Veech R.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and other IDH subunits (26Kim Y.-O. Koh H.-J. Kim S.-H. Jo S.-H. Huh J.-W. Jeong K.-S. Lee J.I. Song B.J. Huh T.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36866-36875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the potential role of IDPm in the defense against ROS-induced oxidative damage and cell death. Our study was performed by overproducing the coding region of a cDNA for mouse IDPm followed by measurement of cell death and various indicators of oxidative stress. Reduced expression of IDPm by transfecting the antisense cDNA increased spontaneous production of ROS and lipid peroxidation accompanied by significantly more mitochondrial injury compared with the control cells transfected with vector alone. In contrast, increased expression of IDPm derived from the sense cDNA effectively prevented or reduced ROS-related damage. Our results further provide evidence that ROS-inducible IDPm is a major producer of mitochondrial NADPH, subsequently leading to an increased mitochondrial GSH pool needed for the defense against ROS-mediated oxidative injury. Bovine IDPm cDNA (25Huh T.-L. Ryu J.H. Huh J.W. Sung H.C. Oh I.-U. Song B.J. Veech R.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was used as a probe to screen mouse IDPm cDNA from a λ-ZAP II cDNA library of NIH3T3 cells (Stratagene). The largest IDPm cDNA was initially subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM7 (Promega). The resultant DNA was digested byApaI, blunt-ended, and then digested further by eitherHindIII or ClaI before the IDPm cDNA was ligated into a LNCX-retroviral vector (27Miller A.D. Rosman G.T. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar) in a sense or antisense orientation, respectively. In the LNCX-retroviral vector, expression of sense or antisense IDPm cDNA was directed by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The respective two recombinant IDPm DNA constructs or LNCX-vector alone was transfected into the BOSC23 retroviral packaging cells (28Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar) by the calcium phosphate method. The retrovirus particles were separated from the packaging cells by filtration through a sterile filter (0.4-μm diameter) and used to transfect into NIH3T3 cells. Stable NIH3T3 transformants were identified in the presence of G418. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and 10 μg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C in an incubator under 5% CO2. To prepare IDPm polyclonal antibody, a peptide representing the N-terminal 16 amino acids of mouse IDPm (ADKRIKVAKPVVEMDG) was synthesized with a peptide synthesizer (Excell, Milligene Bioresearch) and purified according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. The purified peptide (5 mg) was conjugated by rabbit serum albumin (1 mg) using a kit (Imject, Pierce Chemical Co.) and used to prepare polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies in rabbit. The mitochondrial homogenates from cultured cells were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Shuell), and subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-peptide antibodies. Immunoreactive antigen was then recognized by using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNAs from cultured cells were prepared using RNAzol (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA from cultured cells was separated by electrophoresis on 0.66 m formamide, 1% agarose gels, transferred to GeneScreen membranes, and hybridized with32P-labeled mouse IDPm cDNA as a probe. A membrane for human or mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized with32P-labeled DNA probe. Hybridization and subsequent procedures were the same as those described previously (26Kim Y.-O. Koh H.-J. Kim S.-H. Jo S.-H. Huh J.-W. Jeong K.-S. Lee J.I. Song B.J. Huh T.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36866-36875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial pellets (25Huh T.-L. Ryu J.H. Huh J.W. Sung H.C. Oh I.-U. Song B.J. Veech R.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) prepared from cultured cells were resuspended in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, disrupted by sonication (4710 series, Cole-Palmer) twice at 40% of the maximum setting for 10 s, and centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 30 min. The supernatants were used to measure the activities of several mitochondrial enzymes. Activities of IDH and IDPm were measured by the production of NADH (26Kim Y.-O. Koh H.-J. Kim S.-H. Jo S.-H. Huh J.-W. Jeong K.-S. Lee J.I. Song B.J. Huh T.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36866-36875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and NADPH (29Loverde A.W. Lehrer G.M. J. Neurochem. 1973; 20: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), respectively, at 340 nm at 25 °C. 1 unit of IDPm activity is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the production of 1 μmol of NADPH/min. Activities for manganese superoxide dismutase, mitochondrial glutathione reductase, and mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase were determined by published methods (30Marklund S.L. Marklund G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (8071) Google Scholar, 31Pinto R.E. Bartley W. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Activities for Glu-6-P dehydrogenase and catalase were analyzed by the methods described (22Salvemini F. Franze A. Iervolino A. Filosa S. Salzano S. Ursini M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 32Aebi H. Method. Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18681) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 104) were grown until 80% confluence in 96-well plates, and cell viability after treatment with H2O2 was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (33Matteo M.A. Loweth A.C. Thomas S. Mabley J.G. Apoptosis. 1997; 2: 164-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After the cells were treated for 48 h with various concentrations of H2O2, 50 μl of MTT (2 mg/ml, Sigma) solution was added and incubated for another 4 h at 37 °C. The MTT solution was discarded by aspiration, and the resulting formazan product converted by the viable cells was dissolved in 150 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. The absorbance at 540 nm with a 620 nm reference was read with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of untreated control cells. For analyses of DNA fragmentation, cells exposed to different concentrations of H2O2 for 1 h were lysed in NTE buffer, pH 8.0 (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1% SDS and proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml). DNA extraction and purification were performed by the method described by Bernhard et al. (34Bernhard C.T. Klas C. Peters A.M.J. Matzku S. Moller P. Falk W. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). To analyze the degree of DNA fragmentation, 5 μg of each DNA sample was resolved on 1% agarose gel and visualized under UV illumination. Total peroxide concentrations were calculated by the rate of oxidation of ferrous (Fe2+) to ferric ion (Fe3+) (35Jiang Z.Y. Hunt J.V. Wolff S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106) were either untreated or pretreated with 0.1 mm H2O2 for 1 h. Cell extracts were incubated with the reaction mixture (0.1 mm xylenol orange, 0.25 mm ammonium ferrous sulfate, 100 mm sorbitol, and 25 mmH2SO4) at 22 °C for 30 min prior to measurement of the absorbance at 560 nm. H2O2(0–5 μm) was used to produce a standard curve. Cells (1 × 106) were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated slide glasses and untreated or treated with 1.0 mm H2O2 for 5 min. Intracellular ROS generation was monitored by the fluorescence produced from 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) after oxidation of 10 μm dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (36Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). Images of DCF fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 520 nm) were acquired using a laser confocal scanning microscope (DM/R-TCS, Leica) coupled to a microscope (Leitz DM RBE). To measure the fluorescence intensity, 20 cells from each image were picked randomly, and their averages of fluorescence intensity were calculated as described (15Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans C.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar). For FACS analyses, cells (2 × 106) were pretreated with 5 μmdichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and followed by exposure to 30 μm C2-ceramide (N-acetyl-d-sphingosine, Sigma) for 15 min. Measurements of DCF fluorescence in trypsin-treated cells were made at least 10,000 events/test using a FACS Calibar flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. For measuring lipid peroxidation, cells (2 × 106) were either untreated or pretreated with 0.1 mm H2O2 for 1 h and analyzed by measuring of the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). The concentration of MDA in different cells was measured by a spectrophotometric assay (37Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10824) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106) were either untreated or pretreated with 0.1 mm H2O2 for 1 h. Then cell extracts (500 μl) were mixed with 1 ml of thiobarbituric acid-trichloroacetic acid-HCl solution (0.375% thiobarbituric acid, trichloroacetic acid in 0.25 n HCl, pH 2.0) and heated at 100 °C for 15 min. The absorbance of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance was determined at 535 nm. Cells grown to 80% confluence were either untreated or pretreated with 0.1 mmH2O2 for 2 h, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, and centrifuged at 50 ×g for 5 min. Cell pellets were fixed immediately in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 30 min, washed with water, and then subjected to a dehydration procedure using graded ethanol series. For preparing the specimen, cells were embedded in Epon 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), and two random areas were cut and processed. The sections (60–70 nm) were cut with an ultramicrotome (Soya MT-7000), transferred to copper grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. At least 40 cells of each sample were examined and photographed using Hitachi H-7100 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi Co., Japan) at 75 kV. Intracellular ATP levels were determined by using luciferin-luciferase (38Spragg R.G. Hinshaw D.B. Hyslop P.A. Schraufstätter I.U. Cochrane C.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 106) either untreated or treated with 0.1 mmH2O2 for 2 h were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 250 μl of extraction solution (10 mm KH2PO4, 4 mmMgSO4, pH 7.4), heated at 98 °C for 4 min, and placed on ice. For ATP measurement, an aliquot of a 50-μl sample was added to 100 μl of reaction solution (50 mm NaAsO2, 20 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) containing 800 μg of luciferin/luciferase (Sigma). Light emission was quantified in a Turner Designs TD 20/20 luminometer (Stratec Biomedical Systems, Germany). For all experiments, ATP standard curves were run and were linear in the range of 5–2500 nm. Concentrations of ATP stock solution were calculated from spectrophotometric absorbance at 259 nm using an extinction coefficient of 15,400. NADPH values were determined by the method of Zerez et al. (39Zerez C.R. Lee S.J. Tanaka K.R. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 1964: 367-373Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and expressed as the ratio of NADPH to the total NADP pool [NADPH]/[NADP+ + NADPH]. The GSH level was analyzed by producing of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate at 412 nm (ε= 1.36 × 104m−1 cm−1) by the method described previously (40Akerboom T.P.M. Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). Total GSH level was measured in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg of NADPH, 30 μg of 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 0.12 unit of glutathione reductase (Sigma). The GSSG level was measured as the same as total the GSH level after treatment with 1 μl of 2-vinylpyridine and 3 μl of triethanolamine for 1 h (41Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). To isolate cDNAs for mouse IDPm, a cDNA library of NIH3T3 cells (Stratagene) was screened with the cDNA for bovine IDPm (25Huh T.-L. Ryu J.H. Huh J.W. Sung H.C. Oh I.-U. Song B.J. Veech R.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as a probe. 11 positive cDNA clones for mouse IDPm were isolated from about two million phage plaques screened. From these clones, one clone with the largest DNA insert (1.7 kilobase pairs) was purified, subcloned into plasmid pGEM7(+), and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Mouse IDPm cDNA was 1,679 base pairs long (data not shown) with an open reading frame (1,356 base pairs) for the entire protein coding region of IDPm (Fig. 1). Structural analysis of the pig (42Haselbeck R.J. Colman R.F. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6219-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), bovine, and mouse IDPm (25Huh T.-L. Ryu J.H. Huh J.W. Sung H.C. Oh I.-U. Song B.J. Veech R.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) revealed that the precursor mouse IDPm protein contains 452 amino acids (50,934 Da), and the complete protein consists of 413 amino acids (46,575 Da) with the first 39 amino acids as the mitochondrial signal peptide. The deduced protein sequence of mouse IDPm showed 94.5 and 95% identity to that of bovine and porcine IDPm, respectively. However, the mitochondrial leader sequence of the mouse IDPm was quite different from the previously reported mouse IDPm (mNADP-IDH) (43Yang L. Luo H. Vinay P. Wu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The mNADP-IDH contained an extremely long mitochondrial leader peptide (111 amino acids), and its mature protein sequence (412 amino acids) was 1 amino acid shorter than that of our clone for mouse IDPm. In addition, 11 amino acids in its mature protein sequence are different from that of our mouse IDPm (Fig. 1). To investigate the expression pattern of IDPm in different human and mouse tissues, Northern analyses were performed. One major IDPm transcript (2.2 kilobase pairs) was observed in both human and mouse tissues and expressed in a tissue-specific manner (Fig.2 A). The levels of IDPm expressed in human and mouse tissues were highest in heart, one of the most O2-consuming tissues, whereas liver and kidney contained considerable levels of IDPm transcript but significantly less than that in heart. In contrast, other tissues including brain and lung, which are vulnerable to oxidative injury, contained very low levels of IDPm message. Interestingly, the levels of IDPm expression in human and mouse skeletal muscles were strikingly different. To investigate the role of IDPm directly, two different transformants for each recombinant IDPm construct were isolated after stable transfection of the sense IDPm (S1 and S2) and antisense IDPm (AS1 and AS2) or LNCX-vector alone (control) (Fig. 2 B). Chromosomal integration of the transfected IDPm constructs was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (data not shown). The level of IDPm transcript (2.2 kilobase pairs) in control cells was very low (Fig. 2 C). S1 cells contained much less viral IDPm transcript (2.8 kilobase pairs) than S2 cells. Both AS1 and AS2 cells contained substantially less IDPm transcript than S1 cells (Fig. 2 C). S1 and S2 cells exhibited 52.6 ± 5.1 and 66.7 ± 5.5 units of IDPm activities, respectively. These values are 3.5- and 4.5-fold higher, respectively, than that of control cells with the vector alone. In contrast, AS1 and AS2 cells exhibited 39 and 47% less IDPm activities, respectively, compared with that of control (Table I). To demonstrate any differences in ROS-mediated damage between cells with sense or antisense IDPm, we intentionally chose to use S1 and AS1 cells as a comparison pair because of less difference in IDPm activity in this pair than in the paired S2 and AS2 cells. Immunoblot analysis using anti-IDPm antibody further confirmed the increased expression of IDPm in S1 cells compared with the control cells and AS1 cells that contained significantly less expression of IDPm protein (Fig.2 D). However, immunoreactive IDPm was not detected in the cytosol of S1, AS1, or control cells (data not shown). Activities of mitochondrial IDH and other major antioxidant enzymes such as mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase, mitochondrial glutathione reductase, and manganese superoxide dismutase, were all similar in each group comparable to the control (Table I). In addition, there was less difference in Glu-6-P dehydrogenase and catalase activities in the cell lysates of S1, AS1, and control cells, suggesting that transfection of IDPm cDNAs did not affect the activities of other enzymes involved in antioxidation.Table IAntioxidant enzyme activities in NIH3T3 transfectant cellsCell linesIDPm 1-aEnzyme activities measured from mitochondrial fractions.1-bEnzyme activity represents units/g protein.mGPx 1-aEnzyme activities measured from mitochondrial fractions.1-bEnzyme activity represents units/g protein.mGRd 1-aEnzyme activities measured from mitochondrial fractions.1-cEnzyme activity represents units/mg protein.Mn-SOD 1-aEnzyme activities measured from mitochondrial fractions.1-cEnzyme activity represents units/mg protein.IDH 1-aEnzyme activities measured from mitochondrial fractions.1-bEnzyme activity represents units/g protein.G6PD 1-bEnzyme activity represents units/g protein.1-dEnzyme activities measured from total cell lysates.Catalase 1-cEnzyme activity represents units/mg protein.1-dEnzyme activities measured from total cell lysates.Vector14.9 ± 1.141.5 ± 1.37.11 ± 0.41.50 ± 0.16.07 ± 1.445.7 ± 2.43.5 ± 0.2S1 (sense IDPm)52.6 ± 5.138.6 ± 0.17.30 ± 0.11.48 ± 0.16.16 ± 0.845.2 ± 1.53.4 ± 0.2(66.7 ± 5.5) 1-eIDPm activities for S2 and AS2 cells are indicated in parentheses.AS1 (antisense IDPm)9.1 ± 1.539.1 ± 2.07.12 ± 0.11.50 ± 0.16.03 ± 0.144.8 ± 1.53.6 ± 0.3(7.9 ± 0.6) 1-eIDPm activities for S2 and AS2 cells are indicated in parentheses.Values represent means ± S.D. of three independent"

Forced expression of the JAK inhibitor gene SOCS1/JAB/SSI-1 induced apoptosis of TEL-JAK2-transformed Ba/F3 cells. This suppression of TEL-JAK2 activity was dependent on SOCS box-mediated proteasomal degradation of TEL-JAK2 rather than on kinase inhibition. Degradation of JAK2 depended on its phosphorylation and its high affinity binding with SOCS1 through the kinase inhibitory region and the SH2 domain. It has been demonstrated that von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene product possesses the SOCS box that forms a complex with Elongin B and C and Cullin-2, and it functions as a ubiquitin ligase. The SOCS box of SOCS1/JAB has also been shown to interact with Elongins; however, ubiquitin ligase activity has not been demonstrated. We found that the SOCS box interacted with Cullin-2 and promoted ubiquitination of TEL-JAK2. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negative Cullin-2 suppressed SOCS1-dependent TEL-JAK2 degradation.

TEL, a subset of the ETS family of transcription factors, contains a conserved oligomerization domain, known as the PNT domain, in the N-terminal region. Like other TEL-tyrosine kinase fusion proteins such as the TEL-PDGF receptor β chain and TEL-Abl, the JAK2 tyrosine kinase domain is constitutively activated by oligomerization mediated by the PNT domain. Stable expression of TEL-JAK2 confers factor-independent growth on IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells and induces myeloproliferative and T-cell lymphoproliferative diseases in mice (9Schwaller J. Frantsve J.

The CIS family (also referred to as the SOCS or SSI family) has been shown to play an important role in regulating cytokine signal transduction. CIS1, the first member of this family to be cloned, suppresses STAT5 activation by binding to cytokine receptors (11Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T.

The second family member found, JAB/SOCS1/SSI-1, directly binds to the JAK2 kinase (JH1) domain, thereby inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity (13Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H.

Mutational analysis and biochemical characterization revealed a novel type of inhibition of JAK2 tyrosine kinase activity through the two independent binding sites of SOCS1/JAB: the N-terminal kinase inhibitory region binds to the catalytic groove of JH1, and the SH2 domain binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue Tyr-1007 in the activation loop (16Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Gene disruption studies have suggested that one of the major physiological functions of SOCS1 is the negative regulation of the IFNγ/STAT1 pathway (18Marine J.C. Topham D.J. McKay C. Wang D.

Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In this family, the SH2 domain and the C-terminal region of about 40 amino acids, referred to as the SOCS box, are conserved. The data base search also revealed that a similar SOCS box is present in several proteins containing ankyrin-like repeats, Ras-like GTPases, or WD40 domains (20Masuhara M. Sakamoto H. Matsumoto A. Suzuki R. Yasukawa H. Mitsui K. Wakioka T. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Misawa H. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The SOCS box has been implicated in protein stability or degradation of associated molecules, because it was found to interact with the Elongin B and Elongin C (Elongin B,C) complex, which may recruit Cullin-2 (Cul-2), Rbx1, and the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (23Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 24Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A.

Therefore, CIS family members are hypothesized to function as E3-like ubiquitin-ligase complexes against target molecules from an analogy with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene product. However, no evidence in support of this hypothesis has yet been reported. Kamura et al. (23Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) reported that the protein levels of full-length JAK2 were not affected by coexpression of SOCS1, and, rather, that coexpression of Elongin B,C stabilized the SOCS1 protein. Furthermore, it has been shown that the SOCS box is not essential for the inhibition of cytokine-induced JAK/STAT activation by SOCS1 (16Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 17Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13130-13134Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of the SOCS box of SOCS1 still remains to be elucidated. To suppress the oncogenic potential of activated tyrosine kinases, we introduced the SOCS1 gene into Ba/F3 cells transformed with TEL-JAK2 using a retrovirus system. Overexpression of SOCS1 could efficiently suppress the transforming potential of TEL-JAK2. However, simple inhibition of kinase activity by SOCS1 could not explain the suppression of TEL-JAK2. We found that SOCS1 promoted ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of TEL-JAK2 and full-length JAK2, and that this process required the C-terminal SOCS box of SOCS1 as well as the phosphorylation of JAK2. Murine IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% conditioned medium from WEHI-3B cells as a source of IL-3. Ba/F3 cells were transformed with pCDNA3-TEL-JAK2 or pCDNA3-Bcr-Abl as described previously (11Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). After selection with G418 (1 mg/ml), cells that could grow without IL-3 were subsequently selected. Transient transfection and the luciferase assay in 293 cells have been described previously (20Masuhara M. Sakamoto H. Matsumoto A. Suzuki R. Yasukawa H. Mitsui K. Wakioka T. Tanimura S. Sasaki A.

Deletion, substitution, and chimeric mutants were generated by standard PCR methods as described previously (16Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S.

Johnston J.A. Yoshimura A. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Some of the mutants and wild-type SOCS1 were subcloned into a pMX-IRES-EGFP vector (28Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). For swapping of the SOCS box, the SOCS boxes of SOCS1 (codon 167–212), CIS3/SOCS3 (codon 180–225), and CIS1 (codon 213–257) were interchanged by introducing an SplI site at the joint. All constructs contained an N-terminal Myc- or FLAG-tag (13Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Nature. 1997; 387: 92-921Crossref Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). For TEL-JAK2 fusion, the human TEL (codon 1–162) part was obtained by PCR and fused to the mouse JAK2 JH1 domain (codon 839–1127). This fusion gene corresponds to the TEL-JAK2 found in B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia patients (9Schwaller J. Frantsve J. Aster J. Williams I.R. Tomasson M.H. Ross T.S. Peeters P. Van Rompaey L. Van Etten R.A. Ilaria Jr., R. Marynen P. Gilliland D.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5321-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Murine Cul-2 cDNA was obtained by PCR from a brain cDNA library and cloned into a pCDNA3 vector containing an N-terminal HA-tag. The R452C mutant was created by site-directed mutagenesis. Retroviruses were produced by transient transfection of the PLAT-E packaging cell line with cDNAs in pMX-IRES-EGFP (28Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the culture supernatant was harvested and stored at −80 °C. BF/TEL-JAK or BF/Bcr-Abl cells (2 × 105cells) were infected with appropriately diluted PLAT-E supernatants containing 10 μg/ml Polybrene for 24 h. After being washed, cells were further cultured in an RPMI medium for an additional 24 or 48 h. Then, aliquots of cells (1 × 104) were analyzed using a Coulter EPICS-XL flow cytometer. All experiments were performed in the absence of IL-3. An in vitro kinase assay for TEL-JAK2 was performed as described previously (16Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Briefly, FLAG-tagged TEL-JAK2 expressed in 293 cells (3.0 μg/transfection) grown in 10-cm dishes was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody in 60 μl (50% v/v) of protein G-Sepharose. Then the resin was incubated with 1 ml of cell extracts from 293 cells transiently expressing wild-type SOCS1 (WT) or a deletion mutant lacking 40 amino acids at the C terminus (dC40) at 4 °C for 1 h. After being washed twice with kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes-buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 μm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm Na3VO4), the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing the substrate polypeptide, GST-EPOR cytoplasmic domain (GST-YY) (16Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) (0.1 mg/ml), and ATP (50 μm) and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Kinase activity was analyzed by immunoblotting of GST-YY with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (11Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Anti-JAK2 JH1 (αJAK2) rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-Myc (αMYC) monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, and anti-phosphotyrosine (αPY, 4G10) antibodies have been described previously (16Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). For pulse-chase experiments, 293 cells (1 × 106) grown in 10-cm dishes were transfected with TEL-JAK2 (2.0 μg of plasmid) and WT or dC40 cDNA (0.02 μg). After 18 h, the cells were pulse-labeled with Tran35S-label (ICN) at a concentration of 150 μCi/ml for 15 min and then scraped. After being divided into four parts, cells were replated into 3.5-cm dishes. Following the indicated chase periods, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2 antibody followed by protein A-Sepharose, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, exposed, and quantified by a BAS-2000 imaging system (Fuji). To see the effect of proteasome inhibitors, 293 cells transfected with TEL-JAK2 and WT-SOCS1 were treated with lactacystin or MG132 (25 μm each) for 30 min before labeling. The drugs were maintained throughout the pulse-chase period. For the cycloheximide treatment experiment, 293 cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 2.0 μg of TEL-JAK2 plus WT or mutant SOCS1 (0.02 μg). Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and divided into four parts. After a 5-h incubation period, cells were attached to the dishes and then treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for the indicated periods. The cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted with anti-JAK2, anti-STAT5, and anti-Myc antibodies as described (16Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S.

To determine whether the JAK inhibitor SOCS1/JAB can suppress oncogenic tyrosine kinases, SOCS1 cDNA was introduced into Ba/F3 cells transformed with either TEL-JAK2 (BF/TEL-JAK) or p210 Bcr-Abl (BF/Bcr-Abl) together with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) using the bicistronic retrovirus vector pMX-IRES-EGFP (28Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Because the infected cells expressed both EGFP and Myc-tagged SOCS1, the percentage of infected cells was determined as the EGFP-positive rate by flow cytometry. The same virus was shown to induce apoptosis of parental Ba/F3 cells in the presence of IL-3 (28Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (A andB), the population of wild-type SOCS1 (WT)-infected BF/TEL-JAK cells decreased markedly, suggesting that WT-infected cells disappeared with cell death. Indeed, WT-infected BF/TEL-JAK cells underwent apoptosis characterized by DNA fragmentation (Fig.1 C, lane 2). Similar effects were observed even in the presence of IL-3 (data not shown). WT did not affect the growth of BF/Bcr-Abl cells (Fig. 1 B), which is consistent with the observation that SOCS1 did not inhibit Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity (data not shown). Thus, the inhibitory effect of SOCS1 was shown to be specific to JAKs. We have shown that the N-terminal kinase inhibitory region and the SH2 domain, but not the C-terminal SOCS box, are essential for SOCS1 to inhibit JAK kinase activity in vitro and in vivo(16Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). However, unexpectedly, the dC40 mutant lacking the entire SOCS box could not suppress the growth of BF/TEL-JAK cells (Fig. 1,B and C). To clarify the reason for this discrepancy, we examined STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation in BF/TEL-JAK cells after infection (Fig. 2; infection efficiency is listed as I.E.). Infection with WT and dC40, but not with a control virus, resulted in a decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 2, αPY-STAT5). Reduction of STAT5 phosphorylation by WT was more profound than that by dC40. Tyrosine phosphorylation of TEL-JAK2 was partially reduced by dC40, suggesting that dC40 could reduce TEL-JAK2 kinase activity but was not sufficient to induce apoptosis of BF/TEL-JAK cells at the expression levels obtained by the retrovirus system. It should be noted that the infection efficiency of the WT virus to BF/TEL-JAK2 judged by flow cytometry was less than 55%, whereas those of dC40 and control viruses were more than 75%, even though virus titers were similar when assayed with NIH-3T3 cells. This is presumably because WT virus-infected cells die rapidly after infection. Thus, the infection efficiency of the WT virus will be underestimated. More drastically, we noticed that the protein levels of TEL-JAK2 decreased in WT-infected cells but not in dC40-infected cells (Fig. 2,αJAK2). WT-SOCS1 did not affect the protein level of Bcr-Abl (Fig. 2, αAbl). We found a 70–80% decrease of TEL-JAK2 and PY-STAT5 levels in WT virus-infected cells, whereas the infection efficiency was only 50%. This is probably because of the underestimation of the infection efficiency of WT-infected cells. These data suggest that kinase inhibition by SOCS1 is not sufficient to suppress the oncogenic potential of TEL-JAK2 and that the C-terminal SOCS box is necessary for complete suppression of the oncogenic potential of TEL-JAK2 by reducing the TEL-JAK2 protein level. We clarified the mechanism of reduction of the protein level of TEL-JAK2 by coexpression of SOCS1 using a transient expression system in 293 cells. As shown in Fig.3 A, WT, but not dC40-SOCS1, also reduced the level of TEL-JAK2 in a dose-dependent manner in 293 cells (Fig. 3 A,αJAK2). Thus, SOCS1 reduced the TEL-JAK2 protein level SOCS-box-dependently not only in Ba/F3 cells but also in 293 cells. Consequently, WT suppressed the TEL-JAK2-mediated STAT activation ∼50 times more efficiently than dC40 (Fig. 3 B). To confirm a similar kinase inhibitory activity of WT and dC40, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using the recombinant protein of the GST-tagged erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) cytoplasmic domain as substrate (16Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Consistently, with the previous study using GST-JH1 as a constitutively activated kinase, WT and dC40 could similarly suppress the in vitrokinase activity of TEL-JAK2 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and4). These results indicate that, although the SOCS box of SOCS1 is not necessary for kinase inhibition, the inhibitory effect of WT-SOCS1 was strongly enhanced by inducing degradation of TEL-JAK2 (Fig. 3, A and B). The half-life of TEL-JAK2 was examined in a metabolic pulse labeling and chase experiment (Fig.4 A). The half-life of TEL-JAK2 was over 60 min, but coexpression of WT accelerated the decay of TEL-JAK2, reducing its half-life to less than 30 min. dC40 did not affect the half-life of TEL-JAK2. Accelerated degradation of TEL-JAK2 in the presence of WT, but not dC40, was also observed after cells were treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (Fig.4 B). Normalized levels of TEL-JAK2 are shown as the TJ/S ratio against the levels of STAT5, which is a very stable protein (Fig.4 B). As shown in Fig. 4 (A and C), the rapid degradation of TEL-JAK2 by coexpression of SOCS1 was significantly delayed by treatment of the cells with two proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and MG132. These data suggest that SOCS1 promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of TEL-JAK2. Previously, Kamura et al. (20Masuhara M. Sakamoto H. Matsumoto A. Suzuki R. Yasukawa H. Mitsui K. Wakioka T. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Misawa H. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) reported that SOCS1 overexpression did not affect wild-type JAK2 protein stability. We tried to resolve this discrepancy between TEL-JAK2 and full-length JAK2. As shown in Fig.5 A, full-length JAK2 was much less tyrosine-phosphorylated than TEL-JAK2 when expressed alone in 293 cells. Therefore, we suspect that the phosphorylation of the JH1 domain is necessary for SOCS1-mediated degradation. Because glutathioneS-transferase (GST) is a dimer, the JH1 domain fused to GST (GST-JH1) is another constitutively activated form of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase domain (16Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Like TEL-JAK2, GST-JH1 was markedly decreased in its expression level when coexpressed with WT, but not with dC40 (Fig.5 B). Pulse-chase experiments revealed that WT-SOCS1 also shortened the half-life of GST-JH1 (data not shown). Moreover, the protein level of the phosphorylation-deficient mutant (FF) of GST-JH1 was not affected by SOCS1 (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, reduction in the GST-JH1 protein level by SOCS1 was dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation or the activation of the JH1 domain. Next, we examined whether SOCS1 promotes the degradation of activated full-length JAK2. To achieve the activation of JAK2, JAK2 was fused to gyrase B (Gyr-JAK2), and Gyr-JAK2 was dimerized by coumermycin (29Mohi M.G. Arai K. Watanabe S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3299-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 A, coumermycin treatment enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gyr-JAK2. Without coumermycin, WT-SOCS1 did not affect the protein levels of JAK2 (Fig.6 B, left). However, WT, but not dC40, induced the degradation of Gyr-JAK2 in the presence of coumermycin (Fig.6 B, Coum. (+), αJAK2). These data suggest that the SOCS1-SOCS box can potentially induce the degradation of full-length JAK2 but that this process requires tyrosine phosphorylation (or activation) of JAK2. To examine the functional redundancy of the SH2 domain and the SOCS box for TEL-JAK2 degradation, we constructed chimeric mutants among CIS1, CIS3/SOCS3, and SOCS1 (Fig.7). The SH2 domain mutant R105E-SOCS1 exhibited a lesser effect on TEL-JAK2 protein stability. Thus, tight binding of SOCS1 to the JH1 domain through the SH2 domain is necessary for the degradation of TEL-JAK2. CIS1, which does not bind to JAK2, did not induce TEL-JAK2 degradation, although CIS1"

We demonstrate that Mts1 binds to the extreme end of the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 by several in vitro and in vivoapproaches: co-immunoprecipitation, affinity chromatography, and far Western blot analysis. The Mts1 protein in vitro inhibits phosphorylation of the full-length p53 and its C-terminal peptide by protein kinase C but not by casein kinase II. The Mts1 binding to p53 interferes with the DNA binding activity of p53 in vitro and reporter gene transactivation in vivo, and this has a regulatory function. A differential modulation of the p53 target gene (p21/WAF, bax, thrombospondin-1, and mdm-2) transcription was observed upon Mts1 induction in tet-inducible cell lines expressing wild type p53. Mts1 cooperates with wild type p53 in apoptosis induction. Our data imply that the ability of Mts1 to enhance p53-dependent apoptosis might accelerate the loss of wild type p53 function in tumors. In this way, Mts1 can contribute to the development of a more aggressive phenotype during tumor progression.

The existence of multiple S100 protein targets may explain the involvement of the S100 proteins in a large group of cellular events such as neurite growth, cell-cell communication, cell growth, cell structure, energy metabolism, contraction, motility, intracellular signaling, and cell division (3Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res.

The Mts1-MHC interaction results in the inhibition of the protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of the MHC molecule and associates Mts1 with cell motility, which is one of the determinative functions in the metastatic disease (7Kriajevska M.

In response to “proliferation-affecting” events (DNA damage, oncogenes, oxidative stress, etc.), cells utilizing p53 pathways may switch to either growth arrest, programmed cell death, or cell differentiation (8Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). The pathways of p53 regulation are only starting to emerge.As a transcriptional regulator, p53 modulates the expression of target genes by binding to specific p53-responsive sites. The majority of genes regulated by p53 are involved either in cell cycle control or apoptosis.The p53 protein has three main functional domains. The N-terminal transactivation domain interacts with several components of the basal transcription machinery and provides a transcriptional regulation (9Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The central part of the protein contains the specific DNA-binding domain, a hot spot for p53 mutations that affect its DNA binding ability and lead to tumorigenic transformation of cells. The C-terminal part of p53 is a multifunctional domain, responsible for oligomerization, nuclear translocation, and binding to damaged DNA. In addition, the C terminus negatively regulates the specific DNA binding activity of the core domain. Binding to certain proteins, acetylation, or phosphorylation by PKC and casein kinase II (CKII) abolish the negative effect imposed by the C terminus. The C terminus regulates the conversion of p53 from inactive to active forms and vice versa, thereby modulating the transcriptional activity of p53 (10Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 55: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Hupp T.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Here we show a physical link between Mts1 and amino acid residues 360–393 of the C-terminal domain of p53. This interaction affects the phosphorylation of p53 by PKC as well as its DNA binding capacityin vitro. Moreover, Mts1 influences the transactivation of a reporter gene placed under the control of p53-binding elements in vivo and differentially modulates the transcription of p53-regulated genes. Cooperation between wild type p53 and Mts1 may induce an apoptotic response depending on environment and cell type.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we demonstrate a functional interaction between the small Ca2+-binding protein Mts1/S100A4 and p53 tumor suppressor protein and characterize the biological significance of this interaction.It was initially observed that transfection of Mts1-negative tumor cells with mts1 expression constructs results in intensive clonal death. Since co-transfection of the antiapoptotic genebcl-2 was able to rescue the clones, we suggested that Mts1 induces cell death by apoptosis within 24–48 h after transfection. Moreover, a direct cooperation of Mts1 and wt-p53 in the cell death was demonstrated by transfection of p53 expression constructs into Mts1-inducible cell lines. The data obtained demonstrate that the level of p53-dependent apoptosis significantly increases upon Mts1 induction. These findings suggest that Mts1 and p53 cooperate in the promotion of apoptosis.Analysis of 26 tumor-derived cell lines revealed a significant reverse correlation between the expression of wild type p53 and Mts1. This fact may explain our observation that Mts1 promotes p53-induced apoptosis. More likely, there is a selection against wt-p53 in Mts-1-expressing tumor cells in vivo. Indeed, a trend for more p53-positive human breast carcinomas to be positive for Mts1 compared with p53-negative ones in immunohistological studies was demonstrated (18Platt-Higgins A.M. Renshaw C. West C.R. Winstanley J.H.R. Rudland S.S. Barraclough R. Rudland P. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 89: 198-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Rudland P.S. Platt-Higgins A. Renshaw C. West C. Winstanley J.H.R. Robertson L. Barraclough R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1595-1603PubMed Google Scholar). Although the status of p53 in these tumor samples was not tested directly, the positive immunohistostaining indicates that p53 is probably mutated, since the level of wt-p53 in most cells and tissues is at or below the level of detection in paraffin-imbedded samples. Although the association between p53 overexpression and the presence of Mts1 in the above mentioned studies is not so striking compared with our data, it nevertheless points to a similar conclusion.The co-existence of wt-p53 and Mts1 in immortalized fibroblasts may be explained by conformational transformation of p53, since it was observed in the 10T½ cell line (16Coleman W.B. Grisham J.W. Smith G.J. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The co-expression of Mts1 and elevated level of wt-p53 were shown in a dexamethasone-inducible clone of B16 melanoma cell line transfected with MMTV-mts1(20Parker C. Whittaker R.B. Usmani B.A. Lakshmi M.S. Sherbet G.V. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We assume that there may be more than one interpretation of these data. This could be due to functional inactivation of p53 by glucocoticoid receptor, since it was shown that glucocoticoid receptor forms a complex with p53 in vivo, resulting in cytoplasmic sequestration of both p53 and glucocoticoid receptor (21Sengupta S. Vonesch J.L. Waltzinger C. Zheng H. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6051-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Alternatively, dexamethasone-mediated pleiotrophic effect on gene regulation, cell cycle, apoptosis, etc. in glucocoticoid receptor-positive cells might neutralize p53/Mts1 cooperation.The most prominent biological effects elicited by p53 as a transcriptional activator are cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to diverse types of stress (22Oren M. Prives C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: R13-R19PubMed Google Scholar). A number of proteins that interact with p53 and modulate its functional activity by covalent and noncovalent modifications have been identified (8Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar, 9Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The C-terminal basic domain of p53 was shown to negatively regulate the specific DNA binding activity of the protein (9Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Modulators of p53, which bind or modify this region, dramatically affect the activity of the protein. Interaction with the C-terminus-specific antibody pAb421 and single-stranded RNA and DNA (23Mundt M. Hupp T. Fritsche M. Merkle C. Hansen S. Lane D. Groner B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and deletion of this regulatory domain (24Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) abolish the negative regulatory role of the C terminus, thus activating p53 (9Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Additionally, phosphorylation of Ser392by CKII or Ser371, Ser376, and Ser378 by PKC results in protein activation (25Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is logical that Mts1, which, according to our data, interacts with the C-terminal regulatory domain, is able to modulate p53 activity.Using several approaches, we have demonstrated a physical interaction between p53 and Mts1. The Mts1-binding site is localized in the C terminus of the p53 molecule, including aa 364–393. The interaction of Mts1 with p53 results in inhibition of p53 phosphorylation by PKC but not by CKII. Moreover, binding of Mts1 to p53 leads to the inhibition of the complex formation between p53 and a p53-specific consensus oligonucleotide derived from the p21/WAF promoter. The interaction of p53 with another member of the S100 family, S100B, was shown previously. S100B physically interacts with the C-terminal domain of p53, inhibits its phosphorylation by PKC, and influences p53 oligomerization and biological activity (26Scotto C. Delphin C. Deloulme J.C. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7168-7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, a direct influence on the p53 transactivation activity is demonstrated only for Mts1 so far. Recently, it was shown using NMR spectroscopy that a peptide from the C-terminal domain of p53 (aa 367–388) does not have a regular structure in its native form. Binding of S100B in the presence of Ca2+ leads to conformational alterations of the p53-derived peptide. The three-dimensional structure of the complex reveals several hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between S100B and p53, which result in a sterical block by S100B of the phosphorylation and acetylation sites of p53 (27Rust R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Such modifications can in turn alter the transcriptional activation capacity of p53 (induction and repression). It is conceivable that Mts1, similarly to S100B, can induce conformational changes in p53. However, this issue requires further elucidation.Here we demonstrate that, via interaction with p53, Mts1 differentially modulates the transactivation function of p53. Interestingly, the effect of Mts1 on p53 is dependent on the particular target gene and cellular environment. For instance, Mts1 inhibits the DNA binding capacity of p53 to the p53-responsive element from the p21/WAF promoterin vitro. In accordance with that, the expression of Mts1in vivo down-regulates luciferase activity driven by the same p53-binding sequence. In contrast, more than 3-fold activation of the proapoptotic bax gene expression occurs within 24–48 h following Mts1 induction. Presumably, cooperation between p53 and Mts-1 in apoptosis induction observed in our experiments is at least partially due to the up-regulation of bax gene expression.In the reporter gene assay, the presence of Mts1 stimulates luciferase activity driven by the p53-responsive element from the baxpromoter only slightly. The disparity between the extent of RNA up-regulation and reporter gene transactivation is probably due to a requirement for additional regulatory elements present in the full-length bax gene promoter.An interesting pattern of gene expression was observed for THBS1, another p53 target. The THBS1 gene is known to repress tumor progression, since it is an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Repression of THBS1 promotes tumor vascularization, increasing the metastatic potential of tumor cells (28Roberts D.D. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 183-191Google Scholar). We showed that Mts-1 strongly down-regulates THBS1 gene expression in dense cultures. This suggests that Mts1 might prevent the anti-angiogenic function of THBS1 in vivo. These results are in line with our observation that Mts1 is able to promote angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. 2Ambartsumian, N., Klingelhofer, J., Grigorian, M., Christensen, C., Kriajevska, M., Tulchinsky, E., Georgiev, G., Berezin, V., Bock, E., Rygaard, J., Cao, R., Cao, Y., and Lukanidin, E., (2001) Oncogene, in press. However, in sparse cultures, Mts1 up-regulated THBS1 gene expression. This might indicate that the activity of Mts1 depends on the proliferation state of cells and cellular environment. Since the conditions inside the tumor rather resemble dense cultures, our results point to the possibility that down-regulation of THBS1 by Mts1 might play an important role in tumor angiogenesis.The functional performance of the Mts1 and mutant p53 interaction in tumor cells is a matter of great interest, since this combination is widely represented in malignant tumor cells, as we have demonstrated. An inverse, oncogenic function is shown for several “gain of function” p53 mutants (29Olson D.C. Levine A.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dittmer D. Pati S. Zambetti G. Chu S. Teresky A.K. More M. Finlay C. Levine A.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Some p53 mutants have oncogenic properties due to the ability of these mutants to regulate the expression of a new set of genes such as c-myc (31Frazier M.W. He X. Wang J. Gu Z. Cleveland J.L. Zambetti G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar),EGFR, PCNA, MDR-1 (32Lanyi A. Deb D. Seymour R.C. Ludes-Meyers J.H. Subler M.A. Deb S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3169-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), andBAG-1 (33Yang X. Pater A. Tang S-C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The requirement of the C-terminal domain for the “gain of function” by p53 tumor-derived mutants was demonstrated (31Frazier M.W. He X. Wang J. Gu Z. Cleveland J.L. Zambetti G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 32Lanyi A. Deb D. Seymour R.C. Ludes-Meyers J.H. Subler M.A. Deb S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3169-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since we show that Mts1 binds to the C-terminal regulatory region of p53, there is an intriguing possibility that Mts1 can also modulate the activity of mutant p53 proteins. We propose that Mts1 interacting with wild type p53 and stimulating apoptosis at early stages of tumor development may contribute to the selection of the malignant phenotype. At later stages, the Mts1 protein may be involved in the regulation of gain of function mutant p53 molecules and via modulation of the gene expression fulfill its “prometastatic” role and further advance tumor progression. Further studies elucidating the role of Mts1 in modulating the function of mutant p53 by C-terminal interaction might help to understand a mechanism of oncogenic potential of mutant p53. The mts1/S100A4 gene has been isolated as a gene specifically expressed in murine and human metastatic tumor cells (1Ebralidze A. Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Afanasyeva A. Senin V. Revazova E. Lukanidin E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 10886-10893Crossref Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Expression of mts1 in nonmetastatic murine and human cell lines results in a more malignant phenotype (2Lukanidin E. Georgiev G.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 213: 171-195PubMed Google Scholar). Mts1/S100A4 is a small 11-kDa protein that belongs to the S100 family of Ca2+-binding proteins. The existence of multiple S100 protein targets may explain the involvement of the S100 proteins in a large group of cellular events such as neurite growth, cell-cell communication, cell growth, cell structure, energy metabolism, contraction, motility, intracellular signaling, and cell division (3Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Mts1 participates in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility by association with stress fibers, F-actin, and tropomyosin (4Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakiyama S. Hasegawa Y. Sato K. Endo H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Watanabe Y. Usada N. Minami H. Morita T. Tsugane S.-I. Ishikawa R. Kohama K. Tomida Y. Hikada H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In our laboratory, the heavy chain of nonmuscle myosin II (MHC)1 was identified as a target for Mts1 (6Kriajevska M.V. Cardenas M.N. Grigorian M.S. Ambartsumian N.S. Georgiev N.S. Lukanidin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19679-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Mts1-MHC interaction results in the inhibition of the protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of the MHC molecule and associates Mts1 with cell motility, which is one of the determinative functions in the metastatic disease (7Kriajevska M. Tarabykina S. Bronstein I. Maitland N. Lomonosov M. Hansen K. Georgiev G. Lukanidin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9852-9856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Tumor suppressor p53 protein is a transcriptional factor, which regulates several cellular processes, creating limitations for tumorigenic transformation. In response to “proliferation-affecting” events (DNA damage, oncogenes, oxidative stress, etc.), cells utilizing p53 pathways may switch to either growth arrest, programmed cell death, or cell differentiation (8Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). The pathways of p53 regulation are only starting to emerge. As a transcriptional regulator, p53 modulates the expression of target genes by binding to specific p53-responsive sites. The majority of genes regulated by p53 are involved either in cell cycle control or apoptosis. The p53 protein has three main functional domains. The N-terminal transactivation domain interacts with several components of the basal transcription machinery and provides a transcriptional regulation (9Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The central part of the protein contains the specific DNA-binding domain, a hot spot for p53 mutations that affect its DNA binding ability and lead to tumorigenic transformation of cells. The C-terminal part of p53 is a multifunctional domain, responsible for oligomerization, nuclear translocation, and binding to damaged DNA. In addition, the C terminus negatively regulates the specific DNA binding activity of the core domain. Binding to certain proteins, acetylation, or phosphorylation by PKC and casein kinase II (CKII) abolish the negative effect imposed by the C terminus. The C terminus regulates the conversion of p53 from inactive to active forms and vice versa, thereby modulating the transcriptional activity of p53 (10Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 55: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Hupp T.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here we show a physical link between Mts1 and amino acid residues 360–393 of the C-terminal domain of p53. This interaction affects the phosphorylation of p53 by PKC as well as its DNA binding capacityin vitro. Moreover, Mts1 influences the transactivation of a reporter gene placed under the control of p53-binding elements in vivo and differentially modulates the transcription of p53-regulated genes. Cooperation between wild type p53 and Mts1 may induce an apoptotic response depending on environment and cell type. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we demonstrate a functional interaction between the small Ca2+-binding protein Mts1/S100A4 and p53 tumor suppressor protein and characterize the biological significance of this interaction.It was initially observed that transfection of Mts1-negative tumor cells with mts1 expression constructs results in intensive clonal death. Since co-transfection of the antiapoptotic genebcl-2 was able to rescue the clones, we suggested that Mts1 induces cell death by apoptosis within 24–48 h after transfection. Moreover, a direct cooperation of Mts1 and wt-p53 in the cell death was demonstrated by transfection of p53 expression constructs into Mts1-inducible cell lines. The data obtained demonstrate that the level of p53-dependent apoptosis significantly increases upon Mts1 induction. These findings suggest that Mts1 and p53 cooperate in the promotion of apoptosis.Analysis of 26 tumor-derived cell lines revealed a significant reverse correlation between the expression of wild type p53 and Mts1. This fact may explain our observation that Mts1 promotes p53-induced apoptosis. More likely, there is a selection against wt-p53 in Mts-1-expressing tumor cells in vivo. Indeed, a trend for more p53-positive human breast carcinomas to be positive for Mts1 compared with p53-negative ones in immunohistological studies was demonstrated (18Platt-Higgins A.M. Renshaw C. West C.R. Winstanley J.H.R. Rudland S.S. Barraclough R. Rudland P. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 89: 198-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Rudland P.S. Platt-Higgins A. Renshaw C. West C. Winstanley J.H.R. Robertson L. Barraclough R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1595-1603PubMed Google Scholar). Although the status of p53 in these tumor samples was not tested directly, the positive immunohistostaining indicates that p53 is probably mutated, since the level of wt-p53 in most cells and tissues is at or below the level of detection in paraffin-imbedded samples. Although the association between p53 overexpression and the presence of Mts1 in the above mentioned studies is not so striking compared with our data, it nevertheless points to a similar conclusion.The co-existence of wt-p53 and Mts1 in immortalized fibroblasts may be explained by conformational transformation of p53, since it was observed in the 10T½ cell line (16Coleman W.B. Grisham J.W. Smith G.J. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The co-expression of Mts1 and elevated level of wt-p53 were shown in a dexamethasone-inducible clone of B16 melanoma cell line transfected with MMTV-mts1(20Parker C. Whittaker R.B. Usmani B.A. Lakshmi M.S. Sherbet G.V. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We assume that there may be more than one interpretation of these data. This could be due to functional inactivation of p53 by glucocoticoid receptor, since it was shown that glucocoticoid receptor forms a complex with p53 in vivo, resulting in cytoplasmic sequestration of both p53 and glucocoticoid receptor (21Sengupta S. Vonesch J.L. Waltzinger C. Zheng H. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6051-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Alternatively, dexamethasone-mediated pleiotrophic effect on gene regulation, cell cycle, apoptosis, etc. in glucocoticoid receptor-positive cells might neutralize p53/Mts1 cooperation.The most prominent biological effects elicited by p53 as a transcriptional activator are cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to diverse types of stress (22Oren M. Prives C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: R13-R19PubMed Google Scholar). A number of proteins that interact with p53 and modulate its functional activity by covalent and noncovalent modifications have been identified (8Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar, 9Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The C-terminal basic domain of p53 was shown to negatively regulate the specific DNA binding activity of the protein (9Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Modulators of p53, which bind or modify this region, dramatically affect the activity of the protein. Interaction with the C-terminus-specific antibody pAb421 and single-stranded RNA and DNA (23Mundt M. Hupp T. Fritsche M. Merkle C. Hansen S. Lane D. Groner B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and deletion of this regulatory domain (24Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) abolish the negative regulatory role of the C terminus, thus activating p53 (9Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Additionally, phosphorylation of Ser392by CKII or Ser371, Ser376, and Ser378 by PKC results in protein activation (25Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is logical that Mts1, which, according to our data, interacts with the C-terminal regulatory domain, is able to modulate p53 activity.Using several approaches, we have demonstrated a physical interaction between p53 and Mts1. The Mts1-binding site is localized in the C terminus of the p53 molecule, including aa 364–393. The interaction of Mts1 with p53 results in inhibition of p53 phosphorylation by PKC but not by CKII. Moreover, binding of Mts1 to p53 leads to the inhibition of the complex formation between p53 and a p53-specific consensus oligonucleotide derived from the p21/WAF promoter. The interaction of p53 with another member of the S100 family, S100B, was shown previously. S100B physically interacts with the C-terminal domain of p53, inhibits its phosphorylation by PKC, and influences p53 oligomerization and biological activity (26Scotto C. Delphin C. Deloulme J.C. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7168-7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, a direct influence on the p53 transactivation activity is demonstrated only for Mts1 so far. Recently, it was shown using NMR spectroscopy that a peptide from the C-terminal domain of p53 (aa 367–388) does not have a regular structure in its native form. Binding of S100B in the presence of Ca2+ leads to conformational alterations of the p53-derived peptide. The three-dimensional structure of the complex reveals several hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between S100B and p53, which result in a sterical block by S100B of the phosphorylation and acetylation sites of p53 (27Rust R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Such modifications can in turn alter the transcriptional activation capacity of p53 (induction and repression). It is conceivable that Mts1, similarly to S100B, can induce conformational changes in p53. However, this issue requires further elucidation.Here we demonstrate that, via interaction with p53, Mts1 differentially modulates the transactivation function of p53. Interestingly, the effect of Mts1 on p53 is dependent on the particular target gene and cellular environment. For instance, Mts1 inhibits the DNA binding capacity of p53 to the p53-responsive element from the p21/WAF promoterin vitro. In accordance with that, the expression of Mts1in vivo down-regulates luciferase activity driven by the same p53-binding sequence. In contrast, more than 3-fold activation of the proapoptotic bax gene expression occurs within 24–48 h following Mts1 induction. Presumably, cooperation between p53 and Mts-1 in apoptosis induction observed in our experiments is at least partially due to the up-regulation of bax gene expression.In the reporter gene assay, the presence of Mts1 stimulates luciferase activity driven by the p53-responsive element from the baxpromoter only slightly. The disparity between the extent of RNA up-regulation and reporter gene transactivation is probably due to a requirement for additional regulatory elements present in the full-length bax gene promoter.An interesting pattern of gene expression was observed for THBS1, another p53 target. The THBS1 gene is known to repress tumor progression, since it is an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Repression of THBS1 promotes tumor vascularization, increasing the metastatic potential of tumor cells (28Roberts D.D. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 183-191Google Scholar). We showed that Mts-1 strongly down-regulates THBS1 gene expression in dense cultures. This suggests that Mts1 might prevent the anti-angiogenic function of THBS1 in vivo. These results are in line with our observation that Mts1 is able to promote angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. 2Ambartsumian, N., Klingelhofer, J., Grigorian, M., Christensen, C., Kriajevska, M., Tulchinsky, E., Georgiev, G., Berezin, V., Bock, E., Rygaard, J., Cao, R., Cao, Y., and Lukanidin, E., (2001) Oncogene, in press. However, in sparse cultures, Mts1 up-regulated THBS1 gene expression. This might indicate that the activity of Mts1 depends on the proliferation state of cells and cellular environment. Since the conditions inside the tumor rather resemble dense cultures, our results point to the possibility that down-regulation of THBS1 by Mts1 might play an important role in tumor angiogenesis.The functional performance of the Mts1 and mutant p53 interaction in tumor cells is a matter of great interest, since this combination is widely represented in malignant tumor cells, as we have demonstrated. An inverse, oncogenic function is shown for several “gain of function” p53 mutants (29Olson D.C. Levine A.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dittmer D. Pati S. Zambetti G. Chu S. Teresky A.K. More M. Finlay C. Levine A.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Some p53 mutants have oncogenic properties due to the ability of these mutants to regulate the expression of a new set of genes such as c-myc (31Frazier M.W. He X. Wang J. Gu Z. Cleveland J.L. Zambetti G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar),EGFR, PCNA, MDR-1 (32Lanyi A. Deb D. Seymour R.C. Ludes-Meyers J.H. Subler M.A. Deb S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3169-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), andBAG-1 (33Yang X. Pater A. Tang S-C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The requirement of the C-terminal domain for the “gain of function” by p53 tumor-derived mutants was demonstrated (31Frazier M.W. He X. Wang J. Gu Z. Cleveland J.L. Zambetti G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 32Lanyi A. Deb D. Seymour R.C. Ludes-Meyers J.H. Subler M.A. Deb S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3169-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since we show that Mts1 binds to the C-terminal regulatory region of p53, there is an intriguing possibility that Mts1 can also modulate the activity of mutant p53 proteins. We propose that Mts1 interacting with wild type p53 and stimulating apoptosis at early stages of tumor development may contribute to the selection of the malignant phenotype. At later stages, the Mts1 protein may be involved in the regulation of gain of function mutant p53 molecules and via modulation of the gene expression fulfill its “prometastatic” role and further advance tumor progression. Further studies elucidating the role of Mts1 in modulating the function of mutant p53 by C-terminal interaction might help to understand a mechanism of oncogenic potential of mutant p53. In the present study, we demonstrate a functional interaction between the small Ca2+-binding protein Mts1/S100A4 and p53 tumor suppressor protein and characterize the biological significance of this interaction. It was initially observed that transfection of Mts1-negative tumor cells with mts1 expression constructs results in intensive clonal death.

https://openalex.org/W2027473346,"Cell invasion requires cooperation between adhesion receptors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Membrane type (MT)-MMPs have been thought to be primarily involved in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix. Our report presents evidence that MT-MMPs in addition to the breakdown of the extracellular matrix may be engaged in proteolysis of adhesion receptors on tumor cell surfaces. Overexpression of MT1-MMP by glioma and fibrosarcoma cells led to proteolytic degradation of cell surface tissue transglutaminase (tTG) at the leading edge of motile cancer cells. In agreement, structurally related MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, and MT3-MMP but not evolutionary distant MT4-MMP efficiently degraded purified tTG in vitro. Because cell surface tTG represents a ubiquitously expressed, potent integrin-binding adhesion coreceptor involved in the binding of cells to fibronectin (Fn), the proteolytic degradation of tTG by MT1-MMP specifically suppressed cell adhesion and migration on Fn. Reciprocally, Fn in vitro and in cultured cells protected its surface receptor, tTG, from proteolysis by MT1-MMP, thereby supporting cell adhesion and locomotion. In contrast, the proteolytic degradation of tTG stimulated migration of cells on collagen matrices. Together, our observations suggest both an important coreceptor role for cell surface tTG and a novel regulatory function of membrane-anchored MMPs in cancer cell adhesion and locomotion. Proteolysis of adhesion proteins colocalized with MT-MMPs at discrete regions on the surface of migrating tumor cells might be controlled by composition of the surrounding ECM.

Integrin adhesion receptors dynamically regulate cell-matrix interactions by the binding to matrix proteins and inside-out signaling (30Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar, 31Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar). This allows cells to discriminate any subtle alteration of the environment and to adjust cell locomotion accordingly. Direct interactions with multiple transmembrane and cell surface proteins (32Deryugina E.I. Bourdon M.A. Jungwirth K. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) including integrin-associated protein-50 (33Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), TM4SF proteins (tetraspanins) (34Hemler M.E. Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 67-71PubMed Google Scholar) and tTG (35Akimov S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) further attenuate adhesive and signaling efficiency of integrins. Cell surface tTG (protein-glutamine γ-glutamyltransferase, EC2.3.2.13) promotes integrin-dependent adhesion and spreading of cells. By both direct associations with multiple β1 and β3 integrins and the binding with Fn, tTG independently mediates the interactions of integrins with Fn (35Akimov S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The high affinity binding of tTG with Fn specifically involves the 42 kDa gelatin-binding domain of the Fn molecule, which consists of modules I6II1,2I7–9 (36Radek J.T. Jeong J.M. Murthy S.N. Ingham K.C. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3152-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The enhancement of integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading of cells on Fn is independent from the enzymatic activity of surface tTG (35Akimov S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, reduced expression of tTG has been linked to aggressiveness and high metastatic potential of tumors, whereas overexpression of tTG in fibrosarcomas inhibited primary tumor growth (37Johnson T.S. Knight C.R. el-Alaoui S. Mian S. Rees R.C. Gentile V. Davies P.J. Griffin M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2935-2942PubMed Google Scholar, 38Haroon Z.A. Lai T.S. Hettasch J.M. Lindberg R.A. Dewhirst M.W. Greenberg C.S. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1679-1686PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolysis of tTG at the normal tissue/tumor boundary was observed in invasive tumors (38Haroon Z.A. Lai T.S. Hettasch J.M. Lindberg R.A. Dewhirst M.W. Greenberg C.S. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1679-1686PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report that depending on the structure of the ECM, MT-MMPs are capable of both positively and negatively regulating locomotion of cancer cells. Matrix-dependent proteolysis of surface tTG by MT1-MMP occurs on tumor cells of a diverse tissue origin, thereby representing a general phenomenon and a novel MT-MMP function. Our data suggest an existence of an unexpected link between tumor cell locomotion, the ECM and membrane-anchored MMPs. Regulatory proteolysis of cell surface adhesion proteins by the adjacent MT-MMP molecules is likely to play a significant functional role in cancer cell invasion. The tTG protein was purified from human red blood cells (39Turner P.M. Lorand L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). GM6001 (Ilomastat), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, the individual catalytic domains of MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, and MT4-MMP and anti-MT1-MMP rabbit polyclonal antibody AB815 were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-β1 integrin mAb 9EG7 and sulfo-NHS-biotin were from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and Pierce (Rockford, IL), respectively. Fn and its proteolytic fragments were obtained as reported earlier (35Akimov S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Vector- and MT1-MMP-transfected human HT1080 fibrosarcoma and U251 glioma cell lines were selected and maintained as described previously (27Deryugina E.I. Bourdon M.A. Luo G.-X. Reisfeld R.A.

Bourdon M.A. Jungwirth K. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Where indicated, protein synthesis in cells was blocked with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the full-length tTG protein, as well as rabbit function-blocking antibody against the NH2-terminal 1–165 Fn-binding fragment of tTG inhibitory to the tTG-Fn interactions, and anti-tTG mAbs TG100 and CUB7402 were characterized earlier (35Akimov S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Radioactive labeling of cells with Tran35S-label (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA) was performed as described earlier (35Akimov S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Purified tTG (10–20 μg) was incubated with the individual catalytic domain of MT-MMPs (0.2 μg each) for 0.5–12 h at 37 °C in 0.05 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 μmZnCl2. The reaction was stopped by SDS-sample buffer. After electrophoresis in 12% gels and transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, protein bands were stained, excised, and subjected to the NH2-terminal microsequencing at the Protein Chemistry Facility of Washington University (St. Louis, MO). To determine surface levels of MT1-MMP, live untreated or GM6001-treated HT-vector and HT-MT cells were stained with 10 μg/ml rabbit anti-MT1-MMP antibody followed by fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. For measurements of cell surface tTG, live nonpermeabilized transfectants were each incubated for 2 h at 37 °C without or with 20 μm GM6001, 1 μg/ml TIMP-1, and 1 μg/ml TIMP-2 and then stained with 10 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-tTG antibody and secondary fluorescein-conjugated IgG (35Akimov S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). At least three independent experiments were performed for each cell line. To evaluate the status of MMP-2, nonreduced aliquots of medium conditioned with HT-vector and HT-MT cells were analyzed by gelatin zymography. Zymography was performed in 0.1% gelatin and 10% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (29Deryugina E.I. Bourdon M.A. Reisfeld R.A. Strongin A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3743-3750PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, SDS was replaced by Triton X-100, followed by incubation in a Tris-based buffer overnight. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and gelatinolytic activity was detected as clear bands in the background of uniform staining. Transglutaminase activity expressed on the surface of HT-vector and HT-MT cells was determined as reported earlier (35Akimov S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). For these purposes, cells were detached by EDTA. Live cells (2 × 106) were resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm Ca2+ and 10 mg/mlN,N-dimethylcaseine. Further, cells were incubated with 10 μCi of [3H]putrescine (35.7 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h at 37 °C on a rotator. To evaluate the incorporation of [3H]putrescine,N,N-dimethylcaseine was precipitated from cell-free supernatants with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Excess label was removed by successively washing the pellets with 5% trichloroacetic acid, ethanol, and acetone. Finally, the pellet was dried and redissolved in 100 μl of 1% SDS. Protein-incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. EDTA-detached HT-vector and HT-MT cells resuspended at 2 × 106cells/200 μl of Tyrode's buffer, 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mmNaHCO3, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml dextrose, pH 7.4, were incubated with 1 μm125I-labeled 42 kDa Fn fragment (specific activity 1.6 × 106 cpm/μg) for 1 h at 37 °C on a rotator. Further, cells were layered on 0.5 ml of 20% sucrose in Tyrode's buffer and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm. 125I radioactivity associated with the cell pellets was quantified in a gamma counter. Measurements were performed in triplicates. Values were corrected for nonspecific binding determined in presence of excess (10 μm) unlabeled 42-kDa Fn fragment. To determine the expression and the status of surface MT1-MMP and tTG, EDTA-detached cells were surface biotinylated for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin. MT1-MMP and tTG were immunoprecipitated from the lysates of surface-biotinylated cells with MT-MMP- and tTG-specific polyclonal antibodies, respectively. The resulting immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane support. Biotin-labeled proteins were visualized by probing the membrane with neutravidin-horseradish peroxidase. To analyze coprecipitation of tTG with β1 and β3 integrins, HT-MT cells were plated for 12 h in serum-free medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide on plastic coated with Fn or collagen type I. Where indicated, 20 μm GM6001 was added to the medium. Next, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.55 sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, with 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (35Akimov S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). β1integrins, β3 integrins, and tTG were each immunoprecipitated from the aliquots (0.5 mg of total protein) of the RIPA lysates with mAb P4C10, mAb LM609, and rabbit polyclonal anti-tTG antibody, respectively. The precipitated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane. To identify specifically tTG in the precipitated samples the membrane was probed with mAb TG100 against tTG. To protect surface tTG from proteolysis, cells were plated for 24 h in serum-containing medium on Fn-coated coverslips. Next, live nonpermeabilized cells were double stained for tTG/MT1-MMP, tTG/β1 integrin, and β1integrin/MT1-MMP by using a respective combination of murine anti-tTG mAbs CUB7402 or TG100 (20 μg/ml), rat anti-β1 integrin mAb 9EG7 (10 μg/ml), and rabbit anti-MT1-MMP antibody AB815 (10 μg/ml). After incubation with antibodies for 40 min, cells were washed and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell surface proteins were visualized using secondary species-specific IgG conjugated with rhodamine or fluorescein (Chemicon). To induce proteolytic degradation of surface tTG by MT1-MMP, cells were detached by EDTA and then incubated in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 2 h. Then, cells were plated for 3 h on Fn in serum-free medium containing 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. Three antibodies (murine anti-tTG, rat anti-β1 integrin, and rabbit anti-MT1-MMP) were used to visualize simultaneously tTG, β1 integrin, and MT1-MMP on live nonpermeabilized cells. After fixation, the proteins were detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, and goat anti-rat IgG conjugated with blue Alexa-Fluor 350, green Alexa-Fluor 488, and red Alexa-Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) with nonoverlapping emission spectra, respectively. The cells were analyzed and photographed by using Nikon Eclipse E800 epifluorescence microscope and Spot RT digital camera (Molecular Diagnostics). For adhesion studies, a suspension of 35S-labeled U-vector or U-MT cells in serum-free medium was incubated for 2 h without or with 20 μm GM6001, 1 μg/ml TIMP-1, or 1 μg/ml TIMP-2 in the presence of 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. 1 h before plating on plastic coated with 10 μg/ml Fn, the 110-kDa or the 42-kDa Fn fragments and blocked with bovine serum albumin, function-blocking anti-tTG antibody (10 μg/ml) or control nonimmune IgG (10 μg/ml) was added to the corresponding cell samples. The cells were plated for 1 h without or with GM6001 in serum-free medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (35Akimov S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Adherent cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% SDS. The bound radioactivity was counted and converted in the number of adherent cells by referring to the levels of 35S incorporation/103cells. Directional migration of cells (5 × 104 cells/insert) in Transwells (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with the membrane undersurface coated with collagen I, Fn, the-42 kDa or 110-kDa Fn fragments (10 μg/ml each), was analyzed under serum-free conditions (27Deryugina E.I. Bourdon M.A. Luo G.-X. Reisfeld R.A. Strongin A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2473-2482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Deryugina E.I. Bourdon M.A. Jungwirth K. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). U-vector and U-MT cells were incubated for 2 h without or with 20 μm GM6001, 1 μg/ml TIMP-1, and 1 μg/ml TIMP-2 in serum-free AIM-V medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). 1 h prior to plating, function-blocking anti-tTG antibody (10 μg/ml) or control nonspecific IgG (10 μg/ml) was added to the respective samples. Both the upper and the lower chambers of the inserts were supplemented with 10 μm GM6001, 1 μg/ml TIMP-1, 1 μg/ml TIMP-2, 10 μg/ml function-blocking anti-tTG antibody, or 10 μg/ml control IgG. After incubation for 12 h, cells transmigrated to the membrane undersurface were detached and counted. At least three independent experiments were performed with each reagent and cell type. HT1080 fibrosarcoma and U251 glioma cells that naturally express relatively low levels of MT1-MMP were transfected with the MT1-MMP cDNA (GenBank U41078) to up-regulate MT1-MMP and create HT-MT and U-MT pools of cells, respectively (27Deryugina E.I.

To avoid any undesirable clonal effects, our studies were performed with the corresponding pools of stable transfectants. Highly elevated levels of MT1-MMP in U-MT cells relative to U-vector control were confirmed previously by immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry, and functional assays (27Deryugina E.I.

To corroborate these findings further, we evaluated the levels of MT1-MMP in HT-MT cells by immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry, and by analysis of the ability of cells to initiate the activation of the secretory MMP-2 proenzyme. Immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry studies employed rabbit polyclonal AB815 antibody directed against the hinge region of MT1-MMP. Immunoprecipitation confirmed an increase in the amounts of 60-kDa enzyme and the 42-kDa ectodomain form of MT1-MMP expressed on the surface of HT-MT cells, relative to those of HT-vector cells (Fig.1 a). Earlier, it has been shown that TIMP-2 regulates the amount of active 60-kDa MT1-MMP enzyme on the cell surface, whereas in the absence of TIMP-2 MT1-MMP undergoes autocatalysis to the 42-kDa form (41Overall C.M. Tam E. McQuibban G.A. Morrison C. Wallon U.M. Bigg H.F. King A.E. Roberts C.R. J. Biol.

Apparently, our immunoprecipitation experiments showing high levels of the 42-kDa form point to an insufficiency of TIMP-2 relative to MT1-MMP in HT-MT transfectants (43Stanton H. Gavrilovic J. Atkinson S.J. d'Ortho M.P. Yamada K.M. Zardi L. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry confirmed the immunoprecipitation data and demonstrated high cell surface levels of MT1-MMP expressed in HT-MT cells (Fig.1 b). As determined by gelatin zymography of conditioned medium samples, up-regulation of MT1-MMP correlated directly with the ability of HT-MT cells to activate the MMP-2 proenzyme (44Ratnikov B. Deryugina E. Leng J. Marchenko G. Dembrow D. Strongin A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The intermediate and active forms of MMP-2 enzyme were present in the conditioned medium from HT-MT but not from HT-vector cells (Fig.1 c, middle and bottom arrows). Apparently, MT1-MMP transfection shifts a balance among the preexisting levels of TIMP-2, MT1-MMP, and MMP-2, thus inducing the activation of pro-MMP-2 by the cells (23Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). GM6001, a hydroxamate inhibitor of MMPs (45Galardy R.E. Cassabonne M.E. Giese C. Gilbert J.H. Lapierre F. Lopez Schaeffer M.E. Stack R. Sullivan M. Summers B. Tressler R. Tyrrell D. Wee J. Allen S.D.

In contrast, GM6001, by binding to the active site and, thereby inactivating MT1-MMP, completely abolished the MT1-MMP-induced activation of pro-MMP-2 (Fig.1 c). These findings correlate well with the results of our previous studies with U-MT and U-vector control cells (40Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B. Monosov E. Postnova T.I. DiScipio R. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and demonstrate high levels of functionally active MT1-MMP enzyme expressed on the surface of cancer cells stably transfected with MT1-MMP cDNA. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated a 4-fold decrease in surface tTG expression in HT-MT cells relative to that of HT-vector control cells (Fig. 2 a). GM6001 at 20 μm restored the expression of tTG on the surface of HT-MT cells to the control levels. Because GM6001 is a general inhibitor of MMP activity, we employed TIMP-2, an efficient inhibitor of MT1-MMP, and TIMP-1, which is a poor inhibitor of MT1-MMP, to distinguish the MT1-MMP effect on tTG. Importantly, TIMP-2 fully restored surface tTG on HT-MT cells. In turn, TIMP-1 was significantly less potent relative to TIMP-2 and GM6001 in its ability to restore the tTG expression on HT-MT cells (Fig. 2 a). Any inhibitor had no effect on surface tTG of HT-vector cells."

Interleukin (IL)-1α,1IL-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and IL-18 belong to the IL-1 family of cytokines.

The balanced expression of the IL-1 family members has been postulated to be important in regulating inflammation and host defense responses. IL-1α and IL-1β signal through the IL-1 type I receptor, whereas IL-1ra functions as an antagonist by competitively binding to the same receptor without eliciting receptor signaling (1Dinarello C.A.

To identify novel cytokine genes expressed at low levels, a unique high throughput cDNA screening approach (10Drmanac S. Stavropoulos N.A. Labat I. Vonau J. Hauser B. Soares M.B. Drmanac R. Genomics. 1996; 37: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Drmanac R. Drmanac S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was employed. This approach utilizes a set of oligonucleotide probes to hybridize successively to arrays of human cDNAs from various tissues. Hybridization patterns allow the cDNA clones to be clustered into groups of similar or identical sequences. The number of clones in a particular cluster represents the relative expression level of a specific gene. Representative clones from clusters with low numbers of members were selected for sequencing. Novel cytokine family members were identified using various sequence analysis algorithms. TheIL-1HY1 gene was recently identified using this approach (5Mulero J.J. Pace A.M. Nelken S.T. Loeb D.B. Correa T.R. Drmanac R. Ford J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).In the current report, we describe the discovery of a novel IL-1 family member referred to as IL-1HY2. The characteristics ofIL-1HY2 indicate that it shares a common ancestral precursor gene with other IL-1 family members. We demonstrate that IL-1HY2 is secreted, binds the soluble IL-1 receptor, and is expressed in human skin, spleen, and tonsil, suggesting that it may play a role as a secreted ligand in host defense and other immune responses.RESULTSTo identify additional IL-1 family member genes, BLAST and motif algorithms were used to search an expressed human gene sequence data base generated using screening by hybridization technology (10Drmanac S.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A cDNA sequence from a human fetal skin library was identified that encodes a polypeptide with homology to the IL-1ra protein. Sequencing of the cDNA clone and subsequent 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis led to the identification of a full-length coding sequence designated as IL-1HY2. The nucleotide and the deduced protein sequences are shown in Fig.1. Blast search analysis indicated that this nucleotide sequence had not been previously reported in any public data bases. The IL-1HY2 cDNA contains an open reading frame corresponding to a 152-amino acid residue protein with a predicted molecular mass of 17 kDa and a predicted isoelectric point of 4.7.Sequence analysis indicated that the IL-1HY2 protein is highly homologous to IL-1HY1 (41% similarity) and IL-1ra (37% similarity), whereas it shares lower homology (14–30%) with IL-1β and other IL-1 family proteins (Fig. 2, A andB). Based on amino acid similarities among the IL-1 family members, IL-1HY2, IL-1HY1, and IL-1ra may be grouped into a subfamily, and FIL1ε, FIL1η, FIL1ζ, and IL-1H1 belong to a second subfamily, whereas IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-18 fall to a third subfamily (Fig.2 C).Figure 2Sequence comparison of IL-1HY2 and other IL-1 family proteins.

To identify the cell types in immune tissues that express the IL-1HY2 protein, immunohistochemistry was performed on the tonsil (Fig. 6). From the staining data, the IL-1HY2 protein was expressed in the germinal center of the tonsil (Fig. 6 B). Using double labeling immunostaining, the IL-1HY2 protein was detected in a subset of B cells (CD-20-positive) (Fig. 6 C), most of which were proliferating (Ki67-positive) cells (Fig. 6 D). Furthermore, the IL-1HY2-positive cells did not react with the anti-CD45RO (T cell marker) antibody or the anti-CD14 (monocyte marker) antibody (data not shown), suggesting that the IL-1HY2 protein was not expressed in T cells or monocytes in the tonsil.Figure 5Analysis of IL-1HY2 protein expression in human skin by immunohistochemistry.

In this report, we describe the discovery of a novel IL-1 family gene,IL-1HY2, expanding the IL-1 family to include a total of 10 family members (IL-1α, IL-1β,IL-1ra, IL-18, IL-1HY1,FIL1ε, FIL1η, FIL1ζ,IL-1H1, and IL-1HY2). It would appear thatIL-1HY2 was derived from a duplication event from an ancestral gene common to the other IL-1 family members. This notion is evidenced by significant amino acid sequence homologies (19–41%) that the IL-1HY2 protein shares with the other IL-1 family members (Fig. 2,A and B) and by the high degree of conservation in the genomic organization of the IL-1HY2 gene with the other family member genes (Figs. 1 and 3). Based on the amino acid sequence homologies, IL-1HY2, IL-1HY1, and IL-1ra appeared to form a subfamily that evolved from a common ancestor (Fig. 2 C).The three-dimensional structural model of the IL-1HY2 protein was predicted based on a search of 4250 nonredundant Protein Data Bank structures. The known crystal structure of IL-1ra (21Vigers G.P. Caffes P. Evans R.J. Thompson R.C. Eisenberg S.P. Brandhuber B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12874-12879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was one of the best fit structures, was used as a template (Fig.7). The IL-1HY2 structural model displays a 12-β-stranded trefoil structure and is highly similar to the IL-1ra crystal structure (Fig. 7). The structural model of IL-1HY2 predicted based on the IL-1β crystal structure (22Finzel B.C. Clancy L.L. Holland D.R. Muchmore S.W. Watenpaugh K.D. Einspahr H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) also shares similarity to the IL-1β structure (data not shown). The similarity between the IL-1HY2 structural models and the IL-1ra and IL-1β structures provides more evidence that IL-1HY2 belongs to the IL-1 family.Figure 7Comparison of the three-dimensional structural model of IL-1HY2 with the crystal structure of IL-1ra.

A and C, the crystal structure of IL-1ra (blue) and the predicted 12-β-stranded trefoil structural model of IL-1HY2 (yellow) based on the IL-1ra template, respectively.

B, the superimposed crystal structure and the IL-1HY2 structural model.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The recombinant IL-1HY2 proteins expressed in mammalian (CHO) cells had two forms, a major form at 25 kDa and a minor form at 17 kDa (Fig.4 B), whereas the predicted molecular mass based on the amino acid sequence of IL-1HY2 is 17 kDa. The major form of the IL-1HY2 may be a result of post-translational modifications of the protein. However, the IL-1HY2 protein lacks any N-glycosylation consensus sites. Neither N-glycosylation norO-glycosylation on the recombinant IL-1HY2 protein expressed in CHO cells was detected using peptide N-glycosidase F andO-glycosidase deglycosylation analysis (data not shown). Thus, the difference between the apparent molecular mass and the predicted molecular mass of IL-1HY2 may be due to other post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation.Although IL-1HY2 lacks an obvious signal peptide, we have demonstrated that the recombinant IL-1HY2 protein is secreted from CHO cells (Fig.3 B), suggesting that IL-1HY2 may act as a secreted ligand. Other IL-1 family proteins, including IL-1β and IL-18, also lack a classical signal peptide and are still secreted. The secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 involves cleavage by the IL-1β converting enzyme (25Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B. Nelson N. Van Ness K. Greenstreet T.A. March C.J. Kronheim S.R. Druck T.

Immunol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The IL-1HY2 protein does not contain an apparent consensus site for the IL-1β converting enzyme cleavage. Thus, secretion of the IL-1HY2 protein may involve an alternative secretory mechanism.IL-1HY2 was shown to bind sIL-1RI, although it does not bind as avidly as IL-1β and IL-1ra to sIL-1RI (Table I). The KDvalues of IL-1ra and IL-1β binding to sIL-1RI presented here are higher than those reported by other groups (28Arend W.P. Malyak M. Smith M.F. Whisenand T.D. Slack J.L. Sims J.E. Giri J.G. Dower S.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4766-4774PubMed Google Scholar, 29Remick, D. G., and Friedland, J. S. (eds) (1997) Cytokines in Health and Disease, 2nd Ed., pp. 1-27, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). This may reflect the different methodology and instrumentation (IAsys affinity sensor) that we used. Thus, the binding affinities of IL-1HY2 can only be compared with those of IL-1ra and IL-1β determined using the same conditions. The affinity of IL-1HY2 binding to the IL-1 receptor was determined using the soluble form of the receptor. It has been shown that IL-1 receptor accessory protein plays a role in enhancing IL-1 receptor-ligand binding affinities and signaling activities (30Greenfeder S.A. Nunes P. Kwee L. Labow M. Chizzonite R.A. Ju G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13757-13765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 31Cullinan E.B. Kwee L. Nunes P. Shuster D.J. Ju G. McIntyre K.W. Chizzonite R.A. Labow M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5614-5620PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the IL-1 receptor accessory protein or another accessory protein may affect the binding affinity of IL-1HY2 to the IL-1 receptor. The fact that IL-1HY2 binds to sIL-1RI suggests that IL-1HY2 may play a role in regulating the IL-1 receptor function.The data presented in the current report indicate that IL-1HY2 is expressed in skin and activated B cells of the human tonsil. The tissue-specific expression pattern of IL-1HY2 suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of normal immune responses and inflammatory pathophysiology. Interleukin (IL)-1α,1IL-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and IL-18 belong to the IL-1 family of cytokines. IL-1 cytokines have been implicated in a wide range of pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and susceptibility to infections (1Dinarello C.A. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 457-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 2Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The balanced expression of the IL-1 family members has been postulated to be important in regulating inflammation and host defense responses. IL-1α and IL-1β signal through the IL-1 type I receptor, whereas IL-1ra functions as an antagonist by competitively binding to the same receptor without eliciting receptor signaling (1Dinarello C.A. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 457-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 3Arend W.P. Malyak M. Guthridge C.J. Gabay C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). IL-18 signals through the IL-18 receptor, inducing the production of γ-interferon from T cells (4Dinarello C.A. Novick D.

To identify novel cytokine genes expressed at low levels, a unique high throughput cDNA screening approach (10Drmanac S. Stavropoulos N.A. Labat I. Vonau J. Hauser B. Soares M.B. Drmanac R. Genomics. 1996; 37: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Drmanac R. Drmanac S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was employed. This approach utilizes a set of oligonucleotide probes to hybridize successively to arrays of human cDNAs from various tissues. Hybridization patterns allow the cDNA clones to be clustered into groups of similar or identical sequences. The number of clones in a particular cluster represents the relative expression level of a specific gene. Representative clones from clusters with low numbers of members were selected for sequencing. Novel cytokine family members were identified using various sequence analysis algorithms. TheIL-1HY1 gene was recently identified using this approach (5Mulero J.J. Pace A.M. Nelken S.T. Loeb D.B.

Because Ets factors are implicated in physiological and pathological ECM remodeling, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of Ets factors in collagen production. We demonstrate that the expression of collagenous proteins and collagen α2(I) (COL1A2) mRNA was inhibited following stable transfection of Fli-1 in dermal fibroblasts. Subsequent analysis of the COL1A2 promoter identified a critical Ets binding site that mediates Fli-1 inhibition. In contrast, Ets-1 stimulates COL1A2 promoter activity. In vitro binding assays demonstrate that both Fli-1 and Ets-1 form DNA-protein complexes with sequences present in COL1A2 promoter. Furthermore, Fli-1 binding to the COL1A2 is enhanced via Sp1-dependent interaction. Studies using Fli-1 dominant interference and DNA binding mutants indicate that Fli-1 inhibition is mediated by both direct (DNA binding) and indirect (via protein-protein interaction) mechanisms and that Sp1 is an important mediator of the Fli-1 function. Furthermore, experiments using the Gal4 system in the context of different cell types as well as experiments with theCOL1A2 promoter in different cell lines demonstrate that the direction and magnitude of the effect of Fli-1 is promoter- and cell context-specific. We propose that Fli-1 inhibitsCOL1A2 promoter activity by competition with Ets-1. In addition, we postulate that another factor (co-repressor) may be required for maximal inhibition after recruitment to the Fli-1-Sp1 complex. We conclude that the ratio of Fli-1 to Ets-1 and the presence of co-regulatory proteins ultimately control ECM production in fibroblasts.

However, in the majority of normal adult tissues only limited turnover of the ECM takes place. In contrast, in many pathological conditions the balance between ECM synthesis and degradation is disrupted, leading to abnormal ECM remodeling. Excessive ECM breakdown is associated with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and periodontitis as well as tumor invasion and metastasis (1Vincenti M.P. Clark I.M. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 2Malemud C.J. Goldberg V.M. Front.

Pathol. 1999; 189: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), whereas excessive ECM deposition occurs in fibrotic diseases such as scleroderma, liver cirrhosis, and glomerulosclerosis (5Trojanowska M. LeRoy E.C. Eckes B. Krieg T. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 6Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J.

The type I collagen, a product of two coordinately regulated genes, α1(I) and α2(I) (COL1A2), is a predominant ECM component of the fibrotic lesion. Studies using diverse experimental systems have indicated that transcriptional regulation of the type I collagen genes is species- and tissue-specific (5Trojanowska M. LeRoy E.C. Eckes B. Krieg T. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). TheCOL1A2 promoter has been extensively used as an experimental model system to delineate transcriptional regulation of the collagen gene in human tissues. This promoter constitutively exhibits high levels of expression in activated dermal fibroblasts, which are “turned on” by routine in vitro tissue culture conditions such as growth on plastic in the presence of serum. Previous studies have identified the ubiquitous factors, Sp1 and Sp3, and CAAT binding factor as primary activators of this promoter (9Ihn H. Trojanowska M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, very little is currently known about the nature of the transcriptional repressors that may counteract or modulate the potent stimulatory effects of Sp1 and Sp3 on this promoter. The activity of the COL1A2 promoter can be modulated further by transcriptional factors mediating cytokine responses. Thus, Smad3 in cooperation with p300/CREB-binding protein mediates activation of this promoter by TGF-β (8Zhang W. Ou J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

Moreover, recent studies provide evidence for Sp1 as a critical mediator of TGF-β induction of this promoter via interaction with Smad3 (8Zhang W. Ou J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 16Poncelet A.C. Schnaper H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 6983-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Ets proteins comprise a family of transcription factors with over 30 members identified to date that are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved DNA binding domain termed the Ets domain (17Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ets proteins are grouped into subfamilies based on the sequence similarity of the Ets domain and its location within the protein as well as additional sequence similarities (17Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fli-1 and the closely related Erg are the members of the ERG subfamily. Extensive in vitrostudies as well as the data obtained from various Fli-1 null mice support a crucial role for Fli-1 in hematopoiesis (18Spyropoulos D.D. Pharr P.N. Lavenburg K.R. Jackers P. Papas T.S. Ogawa M. Watson D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5643-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Fli-1 is also expressed in embryonic tissues at the sites of cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, suggesting additional functions during development (19Mager A.M. Grapin-Botton A. Ladjali K. Meyer D. Wolff C.M. Stiegler P. Bonnin M.A. Remy P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 561-572PubMed Google Scholar). It may be relevant that Fli-1 is an inducer of tenascin-C, an ECM molecule, which is also expressed at the sites of cell migration (20Shirasaki F. Makhluf H.A. LeRoy C. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7755-7764Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the specific role of Fli-1 in these processes is presently not well understood. Targeted disruption of the Fli-1 gene resulted in hemorrhage into the neural tube and the ventricles of the brain at E11, resulting in embryonic death shortly thereafter. In addition to hematopoietic defects, these mutant embryos demonstrated a disruption of basement membrane tissues (18Spyropoulos D.D. Pharr P.N. Lavenburg K.R. Jackers P. Papas T.S. Ogawa M. Watson D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5643-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that some Ets proteins, particularly the members of Ets-1 and E1AF/PEA3 subfamilies, play an important role in regulating transcriptional activation of ECM-degrading enzymes including serine proteases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (21Calmels T.P. Mattot V. Wernert N. Vandenbunder B. Stehelin D. Biol. Cell. 1995; 84: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,22Bolon I. Gouyer V. Devouassoux M. Vandenbunder B. Wernert N. Moro D. Brambilla C. Brambilla E. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1298-1310PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive previous studies of the polyoma virus enhancer as well as urokinase plasminogen activator and several MMP promoters have established a paradigm for the role of Ets in the regulation of this group of genes (23Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). These promoters contain functional Ets binding site(s) (EBS(s)) and AP-1 site(s). The members of the Ets and Jun families that bind to the Ets-AP-1 composite element are also targets of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (24Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Thus, the transcriptional activation of this group of genes depends on the nature of interacting proteins (both Ets and AP-1 are multiprotein families) as well as the exogenous stimuli activating the Ras cascade (25Cirillo G. Casalino L. Vallone D. Caracciolo A. De Cesare D. Verde P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6240-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Based on our recent observation that a matrix protein, tenascin-C, is also regulated by Ets factors (20Shirasaki F. Makhluf H.A. LeRoy C. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7755-7764Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we postulated that the role of Ets in ECM remodeling may not be limited to regulation of the degradative pathways but may also include regulation of synthesis of the ECM proteins (26Trojanowska M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6464-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we selected a well characterized system with physiological and pathological relevance, the humanCOL1A2 gene. In the present study we demonstrate that the collagen gene is indeed a target for Ets factors. Significantly, we provide evidence that Fli-1 acts as a transcriptional repressor of this gene, whereas Ets-1 acts as an activator. Furthermore, we show that cellular context plays an important role in defining both the magnitude and direction of response to Fli-1. Human dermal fibroblast cultures were established from newborn foreskins obtained from the delivery suits of local hospitals. Foreskin tissue was dissociated enzymatically by 0.25% collagenase type I (Sigma) and 0.05% DNase (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human mesangial cells were purchased from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). HepG2 and HeLa cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Fli-1 and control stable transfectants were generated in human foreskin fibroblasts transfected by the calcium phosphate technique with either pSG5 Fli-1 or pSG5 control vector and were grown in the presence of 100–200 μg/ml of geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Individual antibiotic-resistant colonies were expanded and analyzed for the expression of Fli-1 protein. The analysis of labeled proline incorporation into secreted protein was performed as described previously (27Ichiki Y. Smith E.A. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 90-95PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were plated in 12-well plates and grown to visual confluency. The medium was changed to serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 50 mg/ml ascorbic acid and 64 mg/ml β-amino propiontrile for the duration of the experiment. After a 24-h incubation in serum-free medium, 10 μCi/mll-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline (specific activity 3.6 TBq/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added for 24 h. The medium was harvested from each well, and the cells were trypsinized and counted. The medium was dehydrated in a SpeedVac (Savant) and resuspended in SDS/dithiothreitol sample buffer and boiled to denature. The volume of sample buffer added for resuspension was normalized according to the measured cell count of each well. After electrophoresis, gels were enhanced by immersion in 2,5-diphenyloxazole and visualized by autoradiography. To determine the levels of expression of Ets-1 and Fli-1 proteins, total cell lysates (100 μg/lane) were used. To detect Ets-2 protein, nuclear extracts (35 μg/lane) were used. Samples were electrophoresed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 5% milk, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and washing with Tris-buffered saline buffer. Immune complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The monoclonal anti-Ets-1 antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories, the polyclonal anti-Ets-2 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the polyclonal anti-Fli-1 antibody was described previously (18Spyropoulos D.D.

Total RNA was extracted from confluent fibroblasts and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (27Ichiki Y. Smith E.A. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 90-95PubMed Google Scholar). Filters were sequentially hybridized with radioactive probes for α2(I) procollagen and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The filters were scanned with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The −353 COL1A2 construct containing sequences between −353 and +58 linked to the CAT reporter gene was described previously (10Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The −353 COL1A2/LUC was generated by recloning the −353 to +58 promoter fragment into pGL2 basic (Promega). The EBS promoter mutants were constructed by replacing guanosine in the EBS core sequence with thymidine using the −353COL1A2 promoter construct as a template with the use of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's specifications (Table I). EBS mutations used in electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) contain EBS 1–4 mutations. The COL1A2 promoter AP-1 binding site mutation was generated as described previously (28Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Fli/W321R contains a single amino acid mutation that abolishes DNA binding. Fli/DBD contains DNA binding domain 267–384. pSG5Fli-1, pSG5Ets-1, and pSG5Ets-2 were described previously (20Shirasaki F.

Transfections were repeated at least four times using two different plasmid preparations. CAT and luciferase activities in aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were determined 48 h post-transfection. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Andrews and Faller (29Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar) with minor modifications.In vitro transcribed and translated human Fli-1, Ets-1, and Ets-2 proteins were prepared using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). EMSAs were performed with32P-labeled probes as described previously (30Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, 7 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min on ice in 24 μl of the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin) containing 50,000-cpm labeled probe and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some assays, double-stranded competitors (50-fold molar excess) or antibodies were preincubated with nuclear extracts 30 min prior to the addition of a radioactive nucleotide probe. Polyclonal anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and monoclonal anti-Ets-1 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal anti-Fli-1 antibody was characterized previously (18Spyropoulos D.D. Pharr P.N. Lavenburg K.R. Jackers P. Papas T.S. Ogawa M. Watson D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5643-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The separation of free radiolabeled DNA from DNA-protein complexes was carried out on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.5× Tris borate electrophoresis buffer at 250 V at 4 °C. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. The Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon test was used to determine statistical significance. In the first set of experiments we asked whether Fli-1 regulates ECM production by generating stable Fli-1 transfectants in human dermal fibroblasts. Several clones that exhibited elevated levels of Fli-1 protein were selected for further investigation (Fig. 1 A). Overexpression of Fli-1 in dermal fibroblasts did not affect their proliferative rate (Fig. 1 B). To assess the effect of Fli-1 on the production of collagenous proteins, conditioned medium from cells metabolically labeled with [3H]proline was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig.1 C, increased expression of Fli-1 protein inversely correlated with the production of collagenous proteins. These data indicate that elevated expression of Fli-1 has a potent inhibitory effect on the newly synthesized collagenous proteins. Decreased levels of the collagenous proteins in conditioned medium may result either from the activation of the degradative pathways (e.g. MMPs), decreased collagen synthesis, or both. To determine whether Fli-1 directly affects collagen gene expression, COL1A2 mRNA levels were compared in Fli-1 stable transfectants and control clones. As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, Fli-1 decreased COL1A2 mRNA levels by at least 1.5-fold, suggesting that its inhibitory effects occurs at least partially via regulating collagen mRNA expression levels. The effect of Fli-1 on the activity of the COL1A2 promoter was examined next. Consistent with the effect of Fli-1 on the COL1A2 mRNA levels, Fli-1 inhibited COL1A2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2, A and B). To map the Fli-1 response element in the COL1A2 promoter, we utilized previously generated promoter deletion constructs (10Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The strongest inhibition (2.8-fold) was observed with the −3.5-kilobaseCOL1A2 construct, whereas the −353 deletion was inhibited about 1.7-fold. The −264 deletion produced variable results, although the −186 and −108 deletions were modestly stimulated by Fli-1 (Fig.2 C). Thus, the inhibitory effect of Fli-1 was mediated by at least two separate COL1A2 promoter regions: one region located between bp −3500 and bp −772 and the second region located between bp −353 and bp −185. Because the proximal 353-bp region of the COL1A2 promoter is well characterized, we focused on this region to further delineate the molecular mechanism of theCOL1A2 repression by Fli-1. Inspection of the nucleotide sequence of this promoter region revealed the presence of five putative Fli-1 response elements (termed EBSs 1–5) located at bp −317, −307, −284, −244, and −200 (Fig. 2 D). Significantly, EBSs 1–3 are located within the previously identified 60-bp DNase-1-protected region (−322 to −262) that included three Sp1 binding sites (30Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine which of the EBSs were responsible for mediating the Fli-1 inhibition, the putative EBSs were mutated individually and in combination (as described under “Materials and Methods”; see Table I). The −353COL1A2/CAT constructs carrying mutated GGAA motifs were tested in transient transfection assays. Substitution mutation in the EBS 3 significantly reduced Fli-1 inhibition of theCOL1A2 promoter, whereas the mutations in other EBSs had no effect. (Fig. 3 A). Because Ets factors are known to cooperate with AP-1 in the regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator and several MMP promoters (31Crawford H.C. Matrisian L.M. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 20-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we asked whether the previously characterized AP-1 site (28Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) in the COL1A2promoter could be involved in the Fli-1 inhibition. The inhibitory effect of Fli-1 on the COL1A2 promoter was not affected by mutation of the previously characterized AP-1 response element. However, the COL1A2 promoter containing mutations in the three Sp1/Sp3 binding sites surrounding EBS 3 (see Fig. 2 D) become significantly less responsive to the inhibitory effects of Fli-1 (Fig. 3 B). This is unexpected because Sp1 and Sp3 have been shown to be potent activators of this promoter and their absence should have resulted in a further decrease of the promoter activity. In fact, promoter mutations in either Sp1/Sp3 or AP-1 binding sites result in a decrease of the basal promoter activity; however, only mutations in the Sp1/Sp3 binding sites affect the inhibitory response to Fli-1. This unexpected result suggests that Sp1 and Sp3, in this promoter context, may be considered co-repressors for Fli-1. To further examine the possible functional interactions between Fli-1 and Sp1/Sp3, we first evaluated whether Fli-1 could directly interfere with Sp1/Sp3 DNA binding. To test this potential mechanism, we compared binding of the Sp1 and Sp3 to the −307 to −269-bp COL1A2 promoter fragment (39-bp oligomer) carrying all three Sp1 binding sites and either wild-type or mutated EBS 3. EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts from human fibroblasts and a radiolabeled 39-mer probe (Fig.4 A). In agreement with previously published data (9Ihn H. Trojanowska M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), several specific DNA-protein complexes were formed that could be competed by an excess of unlabeled wild-type probe (lane 2). One of the complexes was not competed by an excess of probe harboring EBS 3 mutation (lane 3), suggesting that the binding protein(s) in this complex is related to Ets factor(s). Furthermore, formation of the same complex was diminished when 39-mer-containing mutated EBS 3 was used as a probe (lane 4). The presence of Sp1 and Sp3 in the complexes formed with the wild-type and mutated probes were directly analyzed by Western blotting with Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies. As shown in Fig.4 B, the EBS 3 mutation did not affect either Sp1 or Sp3 binding, suggesting that competition for DNA binding does not contribute to the inhibitory effect of Fli-1. To examine interaction of Fli-1 with the collagen promoter, we used the −348 to −234-bp fragment of theCOL1A2 promoter and nuclear extracts from human dermal fibroblasts. This promoter fragment was shown in our previous footprinting analyses to contain a large (over 60-bp) protected area, indicative of a multiprotein complex interacting with this promoter region. Sp1 and Sp3 have been identified as the components of this complex (9Ihn H. Trojanowska M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Using EMSA we confirmed interaction of Sp1 and Sp3 with the −348 to −234-bp promoter region (Fig.5 A, lane 3). Fli-1 also binds to this promoter region as indicated by a supershift with the anti-Fli-1 antibody (lane 4). The ability of the anti-Fli-1 antibody to shift Sp1 and Sp3 complexes in addition to the Fli-1 complex suggests the occurrence of protein-protein interaction between these proteins. To assess the effects of mutations in EBS on binding of Fli-1, we used the −348 to −234 fragment containing mutations in EBSs 1–4. Although functional assays indicated that EBS 3 mediates the Fli-1 response (Fig. 3), we chose to mutate other putative EBSs to test the possibility of binding to weaker potential sites. Neither Fli-1 nor Sp1 binding to this promoter region was affected by EBS 1–4 mutations (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 1 and3). Quantitation of the Fli-1 supershift band from nine independent experiments shows no significant difference between Fli-1 binding to the wild-type probe and the probe containing EBS mutations. To determine the role of Sp1/Sp3 in Fli-1 interactions with theCOL1A2 promoter, we used as a probe the promoter fragment in which all three Sp1 binding sites were mutated. As previously shown, these mutations abolish Sp1/Sp3 binding (Fig. 5 B, lane 5). Significantly, Fli-1 binding was also substantially decreased with this probe as indicated by diminished supershift with the anti-Fli-1 antibody (Fig. 5 B, lane 6). Quantitative analysis of six independent experiments shows a statistically significant 25% (p < 0.05) decrease in Fli-1 binding between the wild-type probe and the probe containing mutations in Sp1/Sp3 sites. Taken together, these in vitrobinding data indicate that Fli-1 interacts with the COL1A2promoter even in the absence of EBSs. On the other hand, the binding of Sp1/Sp3 to this promoter region seems to facilitate Fli-1 binding. To explore this dual mechanism further, we utilized two Fli-1 mutants: an Fli/W321R mutant harboring a single amino acid mutation in the Ets domain that abolishes its ability to bind DNA 2D. K. Watson, unpublished observations. (32Bailly R.A. Bosselut R. Zucman J. Cormier F. Delattre O. Roussel M. Thomas G. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and a deletion mutant containing only the Ets domain (Fli/DBD). The effects of overexpression of these two Fli-1 mutants on the COL1A2promoter were investigated (Fig. 6)."

The molecular targets of AVP on the surface of principal cells are heptahelical vasopressin V2 receptors coupled to the Gs/adenylyl cyclase system. Activation of this system by the hormone raises the level of intracellular cAMP and results in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) which then phosphorylates its substrates, one of which is AQP2. The phosphorylation of AQP2 by PKA and also the anchoring of PKA to subcellular compartments via protein kinase A anchoring proteins are prerequisites for AQP2 translocation to the cell membrane (2Klussmann E.

The cytoskeleton consists of various components, including microtubules and F-actin, both of which are involved in AVP-mediated changes of osmotic water permeability (2Klussmann E. Maric K. Rosenthal W. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 141: 33-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Brown D. Stow J.L. Physiol.

Microtubule-disrupting drugs like colchicine and nocodazole inhibit AVP-mediated increases in osmotic water permeability in renal collecting ducts by 65 and 72%, respectively (10Valenti G. Hugon J.S.

Disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin B or dihydrocytochalasin B inhibits the AVP-induced increase in osmotic water permeability in toad bladder epithelium by 25–50% (13Taylor A.

The F-actin cytoskeleton also undergoes rearrangements after stimulation of cells with cAMP-elevating agents. After stimulation with vasopressin, total F-actin decreases in toad bladders by 20–30% (15Ding G. Franki N. Condeelis J. Hays R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C9-C16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and apical F-actin in rat collecting duct principal cells by 26% (16Simon H. Gao Y. Franki N. Hays R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C757-C762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In CD8 cells, F-actin decreases in response to forskolin (17Valenti G. Procino G. Carmosino M. Frigeri A. Mannucci R. Nicoletti I. Svelto M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1985-1992PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying these changes of the F-actin cytoskeleton are not understood, and their influence on the fusion of AQP2-bearing vesicles with the cell membrane are not known. Valenti et al. (17Valenti G. Procino G. Carmosino M. Frigeri A. Mannucci R. Nicoletti I. Svelto M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1985-1992PubMed Google Scholar) recently suggested that the rearrangement of apical F-actin might be a prerequisite for promoting redistribution of AQP2-containing vesicles and a consequence of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes, mediated by PKA and protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, respectively. Proteins of the Rho family (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) of small GTP-binding proteins are active in their GTP-bound and inactive in their GDP-bound forms. They participate through their effectors in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. As initially shown in fibroblasts, activation of Rho triggers the assembly of actin stress fibers and formation of focal adhesions, activation of Rac leads to formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, and activation of Cdc42 induces surface protrusions designated filopodia (18Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 19Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 20Aspenström P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, Rho family proteins are involved in the regulation of vesicle motility (21Murphy C. Saffrich R. Grummt M. Gournier H. Rybin V. Rubino M. Auvinen P. Lutcke A. Parton R.G. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 384: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), endocytotic events like receptor-mediated endocytosis (22Lamaze C. Chuang T.H. Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20332-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and various exocytotic processes. For example, the inactivation of Cdc42 and Rac by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin inhibits the Ca2+-triggered release of hexoseaminidase from rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL 2H3 cells; Ref. 24Djouder N. Prepens U. Aktories K. Cavalie A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18732-18738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This finding was confirmed by expression of dominant negative forms of Cdc42 and Rac in these cells (25Hong-Geller E. Cerione R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Rho by Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin prevented Ca2+-triggered release of hexoseaminidase in permeabilized mast cells by 80% (26Sullivan R. Price L.J. Koffer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38140-38146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Conversely, constitutively active RhoA or Rac1 greatly enhanced Ca2+-induced secretion from permeabilized mast cells (27Price L.S. Norman J.C. Ridley A.J. Koffer A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 68-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These findings led to the hypothesis that Rho proteins may be involved in the control of AQP2 translocation to the cell membrane. A recently described primary cell culture model of rat IMCD cells (28Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-801PubMed Google Scholar) was utilized to test this hypothesis. The cells were incubated withClostridium difficile toxin B, which inhibits all members of the Rho family by glucosylation (Rho at Thr37, Rac and Cdc42 at Thr35; Ref. 29Lerm M. Schmidt G. Aktories K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 188: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or microinjected withClostridium limosum-derived C3-fusion toxin, which inactivates Rho by ADP-ribosylation at Asn41 but affects neither Rac nor Cdc42 (30Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IMCD cells were incubated with the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, and microinjected with a constitutively active mutant of RhoA. Surprisingly our data suggest tonic inhibition of AQP2 translocation by Rho, which is relieved by an increase in cAMP. C. difficile toxin B (29Lerm M. Schmidt G. Aktories K. FEMS Microbiol.

TRITC-conjugated phalloidin was purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) and Oregon green coupled to dextran from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). AQP2 was detected with a polyclonal antiserum raised against the C terminus of rat AQP2 (28Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-801PubMed Google Scholar, 33Liebenhoff U.

Dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP), present in the culture medium for maintenance of AQP2 expression, was removed 16 h prior to experiments with the exception of the experiments in which the influence of RhoA-V14 expression on AQP2 translocation was determined.

In brief, IMCD cells were seeded at a density of 7 × 104 per cm2 on type IV collagen-coated coverslips with grids. C3-fusion toxin (40 μg/ml; Ref. 30Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm KCl, 2.6 mmNaCl, 7.8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3, adjusted to 290 mosmol/kg with 1 m KCl) and co-microinjected (Eppendorf 5171 transjector) into the cytosol with Oregon green coupled to dextran (2.5 mg/ml) on days 4 or 5 after seeding. The cells were fixed 20 min after microinjection and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy (see below). The plasmid DNA encoding RhoA-V14-GFP (see above) was dissolved in the same buffer as C3-fusion toxin and microinjected into the nuclei of IMCD cells (100–200 copies/cell). Dibutyryl cAMP was permanently present during the procedure. After injection, the cells were kept under culture conditions (see above) for another 3 h to allow expression of the plasmids and subsequently processed for immunofluorescence microscopy (see below). For immunofluorescence microscopy IMCD cells were grown on coverslips. AQP2 was detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM 410; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany; Leica DMLB microscope with Sensicam 12 Bitled CCD camera, Bensheim, Germany) using specific antibodies and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (4Klussmann E. Maric K. Wiesner B. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4934-4938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-801PubMed Google Scholar). RhoA-V14-GFP expression was visualized by detection of GFP fluorescence using laser scanning microscopy. For visualization of F-actin, IMCD cells were grown, fixed, and permeabilized as described for the detection of AQP2 (4Klussmann E. Maric K. Wiesner B. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4934-4938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-801PubMed Google Scholar). They were incubated with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (100 μg/ml) for 30 min and subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline as described (4Klussmann E. Maric K. Wiesner B. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4934-4938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,28Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-801PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence signals were detected by conventional epifluorescence microscopy (Leica DMLB microscope with a Sensicam 12 Bitled CCD camera, Bensheim, Germany). For quantification of the effects of AVP, toxins, and RhoA-V14-GFP on AQP2 localization, the ratio of intracellular/cell membrane fluorescence signal intensities was calculated as described previously (4Klussmann E. Maric K. Wiesner B. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4934-4938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For all groups, mean and S.E. values were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance (4Klussmann E. Maric K. Wiesner B. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4934-4938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Prior to investigating the role of GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family in the translocation of AQP2, bacterial toxins which affect the activity of these proteins were tested for their ability to alter F-actin-containing cytoskeletal structures, i.e. actin stress fibers (Fig. 1). For this purpose IMCD cells were incubated with toxin B (4 μg/ml) for 3.5 h. C3-fusion toxin was microinjected (40 μg/ml) and the cells were prepared for detection of F-actin 20 min after microinjection. Cells were co-microinjected with Oregon green coupled to dextran (2.5 mg/ml). In addition, cells were incubated with Y-27632 (100 μm, 1 h). After these treatments the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and F-actin was detected by incubation with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (0.1 mg/ml, 30 min). F-actin was subsequently visualized by epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). Stimulation of IMCD cells with AVP (100 nm, 1 h) induced a slight decrease in F-actin compared with non-stimulated control cells (Fig. 1). A detailed analysis by optical sections of 1 μm through the cells indicated a decrease mainly of the cortical F-actin (data not shown; Ref. 16Simon H. Gao Y. Franki N. Hays R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C757-C762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In toxin B-, C3-fusion toxin-, and Y-27632-treated IMCD cells, the phalloidin staining was strongly reduced, indicating depolymerization of F-actin. At later time points (toxin B >4 h; C3-fusion toxin >1 h), the cells rounded up and detached from the surface of the culture dish (data not shown). Incubation with toxin B, Y-27632, or microinjection of C3-fusion toxin resulted in an apparently stronger staining of the cortical F-actin. This impression may be due to the disappearance of intracellular F-actin, blunting visualization of cortical F-actin in untreated cells. These data show that the toxins in the concentrations applied are effective in altering F-actin-containing structures, i.e.the actin stress fibers. Within the time frame indicated, shape changes were not detected in the majority of cells. Therefore these concentrations of the toxins were applied in subsequent experiments. Having established the effectiveness of toxin B in modulating F-actin-containing structures, the toxin was applied to investigate whether proteins of the Rho family are involved in the regulation of AQP2 translocation in IMCD cells (Fig.2). Incubations with toxin B were carried out as described above. The distribution of AQP2 was determined by laser scanning immunofluorescence microscopic analyses using specific antisera. Fig. 2 shows a mainly intracellular distribution of AQP2 in untreated IMCD cells (control). After stimulation of the cells with AVP, AQP2 staining was mainly observed at the basolateral cell membrane as shown by both xy and xz scans (see also: Refs.4Klussmann E. Maric K. Wiesner B. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4934-4938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and 28Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-801PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of the cells with toxin B alone was sufficient to invoke a strong redistribution of AQP2 (Fig. 2). Addition of AVP (100 nm) 1 h prior to the cessation of toxin B treatment resulted in a further translocation of AQP2 (Fig. 2), as is evident from the further decrease in intracellular fluorescence. To quantify the effects of AVP and toxin B, intracellular and cell membrane fluorescence signal intensities were related to nuclear fluorescence signal intensities by analysis of laser scanning microscopic images, and the ratios of intracellular/cell membrane fluorescence signal intensities were determined (Fig.3; Ref. 4Klussmann E. Maric K. Wiesner B. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4934-4938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A ratio >1, indicating a predominant intracellular localization of AQP2, was obtained for control cells (1.75 ± 0.06; mean ± S.E.). Ratios <1, statistically different from untreated control cells, were obtained for AVP-stimulated cells (0.53 ± 0.03) and for cells incubated with toxin B in the absence of AVP (0.70 ± 0.01), indicating a predominant localization of AQP2 at the cell membrane. These results suggest an inhibitory role of Rho proteins, whereby constitutive membrane localization of AQP2 is prevented in resting IMCD cells. The ratio of intracellular/cell membrane fluorescence signal intensities after stimulation of toxin B-pretreated cells was 0.54 ± 0.02. This ratio was significantly different from both untreated control cells and toxin B-pretreated cells. To identify the protein of the Rho family involved in the translocation of AQP2, C3-fusion toxin, which specifically inactivates Rho, was used (see “Experimental Procedures”; Ref. 30Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The toxin was microinjected into the cytosol together with Oregon green coupled to dextran. The dye was employed for identification of microinjected cells and had no effect on the intracellular localization of AQP2 (data not shown). Non-injected control cells surrounding the microinjected ones show a predominantly intracellular localization of AQP2 (Fig. 2). In microinjected cells, however, AQP2 staining at the cell membrane is considerably increased, indicating a redistribution of AQP2. Likewise, inhibition of the downstream effectors of Rho, the Rho kinases, by Y-27632 (31Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar, 32Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar) induced a translocation of AQP2 to the cell membrane (Fig. 2). Quantitative analysis of the effect of C3-fusion toxin and Y-27632 on IMCD cells (Fig. 3) yielded ratios of intracellular/cell membrane fluorescence signal intensities of 0.94 ± 0.04 and 0.77 ± 0.05, respectively, which were significantly different from those obtained for control cells. These data further support the notion that a Rho-dependent pathway prevents a constitutive membrane localization of AQP2 in resting IMCD cells. The effects of Rho inactivation described above prompted us to study the effect of constitutively active Rho on AQP2 redistribution in response to elevation of intracellular cAMP. For this purpose, IMCD cells were microinjected with a plasmid encoding a fusion protein (RhoA-V14-GFP) of constitutively active RhoA (RhoA-V14) and the green fluorescent protein (GFP; 100–200 copies/cell). RhoA-V14-expressing cells were visualized by the detection of GFP fluorescence. The activity of RhoA-V14 was assayed by its ability to induce actin stress fiber formation 3 h after microinjection of the cells (Fig. 4). Subsequently the effect of the microinjection of the plasmid encoding RhoA-V14-GFP on the localization of AQP2 was investigated in stimulated cells (i.e. in the presence of Bt2cAMP). Fig. 5 shows two microinjected IMCD cells expressing RhoA-V14-GFP (left panel) surrounded by non-injected cells. In non-injected cells, AQP2 is predominantly localized at the cell membrane (AQP2,middle panel). In contrast, microinjected cells in the same field exhibit a mainly intracellular localization of AQP2. Expression of GFP alone had no effect on the localization of AQP2 (data not shown). The overlay of both signals is shown in the right panel. Quantitative analysis of the effect of RhoA-V14 expression in IMCD cells (Fig. 3) showed an intracellular/cell membrane fluorescence signal intensity ratio of 1.89 ± 0.17. This value was not significantly different from that obtained for non-stimulated cells, indicating that constitutively active RhoA abolished AVP-mediated translocation of AQP2. It is therefore concluded that constitutively active RhoA-V14 prevents the translocation of AQP2 to the IMCD cell membrane. The data presented above show the involvement of Rho in the translocation of AQP2. To test whether this proceeds independently of the F-actin cytoskeleton or whether this is possibly mediated by Rho via the regulation of the F-actin-containing network, F-actin was depolymerized by incubation of the cells with cytochalasin D (2 μm) for 6, 11, 16, 25, and 30 min. This treatment induced a gradual decrease in F-actin content over 0–25 min (Fig. 6). After 16 min, a pronounced F-actin depolymerization was induced, and cell shape changes were observed. At 25 min, the cortical F-actin appeared thickened and the cells were clearly shrunken. The apparently stronger staining of the cortical F-actin may be due to the disappearance of intracellular F-actin which in the untreated control cells blunts visualization of cortical F-actin. After 30 min, F-actin acquired a punctate appearance, and holes in the monolayer appeared. At early time points, i.e. when cytochalasin D-mediated F-actin depolymerization had commenced (6–11 min), AQP2 translocated to the cell membrane (Fig. 7). The ratios of intracellular/membrane signal intensities were 0.87 ± 0.03 at 6 min and 0.67 ± 0.05 at 11 min, indicating a continuing translocation of AQP2 to the cell membrane (Fig. 3). The intracellular staining of AQP2 after 16 min of incubation with cytochalasin D appeared stronger compared with that at 11 min (Fig. 7); the ratio of intracellular/cell membrane signal intensities was 0.84 ± 0.05 (Fig. 3). As described above, longer incubation with cytochalasin D (25–30 min) severely affected the IMCD cells even to the point of cell death. Therefore no conclusive data could be obtained regarding the intracellular localization of AQP2 at these time points. These results clearly indicate that partial depolymerization of F-actin by cytochalasin D is sufficient to induce translocation of AQP2 to the cell membrane. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Rho influences AQP2 translocation via regulation of F-actin-containing cytoskeletal structures. Previous studies using toad bladders have demonstrated the involvement of the F-actin cytoskeleton in AVP-mediated increases in osmotic water permeability (13Taylor A. Mamelak M. Reaven E. Maffly R. Science. 1973; 181: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Pearl M. Taylor A. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: C28-C39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton by AVP is a consistent finding in both amphibian urinary bladder epithelia and mammalian renal principal cells (2Klussmann E. Maric K. Rosenthal W. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 141: 33-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Simon H. Gao Y. Franki N. Hays R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C757-C762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) are involved in the regulation of the F-actin cytoskeleton. The aim of this study was to investigate their possible involvement in the translocation of AQP2 to the cell membrane. Inactivation of all members of the proteins of the Rho family by incubation of IMCD cells with toxin B or selective inactivation of Rho by C3-fusion toxin induced the translocation of AQP2 in the absence of AVP. In addition, inhibition of effectors of Rho, the Rho kinases, induced a translocation of AQP2 to the cell membrane to a similar extent as C3-fusion toxin in the absence of AVP. Conversely, expression of a constitutively active mutant of RhoA (RhoA-V14) abolished the cAMP-mediated translocation of AQP2. These findings indicate that Rho plays an inhibitory role in the AQP2 shuttle. The inhibitory role of Rho in a cAMP-triggered exocytotic event (AQP2 translocation) is in contrast to the stimulatory role of Rho in Ca2+-triggered exocytosis in RBL 2H3 and mast cells (see Introduction). The inhibitory role of Rho in cAMP-triggered AQP2 translocation was confirmed using the permanent rabbit cortical collecting duct cell line CD8, stably transfected with rat AQP2. 2G. Tamma, E. Klussmann, K. Aktories, M. Svelto, W. Rosenthal, and G. Valenti, manuscript submitted. These cells respond to forskolin by translocation of AQP2 into the apical cell membrane (6Valenti G. Procino G. Liebenhoff U. Frigeri A. Benedetti P.A. Ahnert-Hilger G. Nürnberg B. Svelto M. Rosenthal W. J. Biol.

Chem.272, 26794): 24365-24370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Rho induced the translocation of AQP2 to the membrane of resting CD8 cells and expression of constitutively active Rho prevented the cAMP-triggered translocation. Compared with AVP, toxin B, C3-fusion toxin, and Y-27632 induced an incomplete translocation of AQP2. This effect may be explained by a partial inactivation of the inhibitory Rho family-dependent signaling pathway. This assumption is supported by the observation that longer incubations with the toxins (toxin B > 4 h; C3-fusion toxin > 1 h) induced cell shape changes and detachment of the cells from the culture dishes, indicating that the Rho family-dependent pathway is not completely inhibited by the toxins at earlier time points. In IMCD cells, toxin B caused a 2-fold increase in osmotic water permeability (Pf). This was shown by applying a new technique using laser scanning reflection microscopy, established for determining osmotic water permeability coefficient changes in single adherent cells (37Maric K. Wiesner B. Lorenz D. Klussmann E. Betz T. Rosenthal W. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1783-1790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data confirm the inhibitory role of the proteins of the Rho family in the translocation of AQP2 and show that this inhibition is functionally relevant. Incubation of IMCD cells with toxin B or Y-27632 and microinjection of C3-fusion toxin resulted not only in AQP2 translocation but also in depolymerization of F-actin containing stress fibers (Fig. 1). Similarly, cytochalasin D caused both depolymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton and translocation of AQP2 within 6–11 min of incubation (Figs. 6 and 7). Thus depolymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton is sufficient to induce the translocation of AQP2, and the F-actin cytoskeleton apparently prevents translocation of AQP2-bearing vesicles to the cell membrane of resting cells. Its depolymerization allows AQP2-bearing vesicles to translocate to the cell membrane. The molecular basis of this observation may be explained by different hypotheses. It is feasible that AQP2-bearing vesicles are linked directly to the F-actin cytoskeleton as postulated by Brown et al. (9Brown D. Katsura T. Gustafson C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F328-F331PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively an intermediate protein may be required, as postulated by Umenishi et al. (38Umenishi F. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1024-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). There are a few cell types in which the disassembly of the F-actin cytoskeleton can trigger exocytosis. However, the role of Rho has not been investigated in this context. In pancreatic acinar cells, the introduction of the actin monomer-binding protein β-thymosin, which induces limited F-actin depolymerization, into permeabilized cells, results in rapid amylase release without applying additional stimuli (39Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In alveolar epithelial type II cells (AET2 cells), C2 toxin, which depolymerizes the F-actin cytoskeleton, increased basal surfactant secretion (40Rose F. Kurth-Landwehr C. Sibelius U. Reuner K.W. Aktories K. Seeger W. Grimminger F. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results presented here may be explained by the following model: stimulation of IMCD cells with AVP results in an increase in intracellular cAMP, which in turn activates PKA. One of the substrates of PKA is Rho, which is phosphorylated at Ser188 (41Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Rho decreases the binding of RhoA to Rho kinases (42Dong J.-M. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22554-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The subsequent attenuation of Rho activity would favor depolymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton and allow translocation of AQP2 into the cell membrane. Consistent with this model, our results show that stimulation of IMCD cells with AVP induces a depolymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 1). Induction of polymerization of F-actin-containing stress fibers by expression of constitutively active RhoA (RhoA-V14) abolished the translocation of AQP2 in response to continuous stimulation of IMCD cells with Bt2cAMP (Fig.5). In addition, incubation of IMCD cells with cytotoxic necrotizing factor I, derived from pathogenic Escherichia coli, which activates all members of the Rho family by deamidation (29Lerm M. Schmidt G. Aktories K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 188: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), strongly induced the formation of actin stress fibers and inhibited AVP-mediated AQP2 translocation (data not shown). The increase in F-actin content may either increase the binding of AQP2-bearing vesicles to the F-actin cytoskeleton or the F-actin cytoskeleton might become a barrier for these vesicles similar to the barrier function of cortical F-actin in other exocytotic processes. For example, in chromaffin cells, pancreatic acinar cells and mast cells, cortical F-actin disassembly is considered a prerequisite for exocytosis (39Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 43Norman J.C. Price L.S. Ridley A.J. Hall A. Koffer A. J.

Biochimie ( Paris ). 2000; 82: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The model proposed above is further supported by the finding that RhoA and RhoB are present in particulate fractions prepared from non-stimulated IMCD cells (data not shown). Since activation of Rho is accompanied by a translocation from the cytosol to membranes, this finding may indicate that RhoA and RhoB are either active or in the process of activation (46Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Ohga N. Yamamoto J. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9373-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol.

The only other system in which Rho appears to inhibit exocytosis via F-actin is the bovine chromaffin cell (45Vitale N. Gasman S. Caumont A. Gensse M. Galas M. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bader M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 2000; 82: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Gasman et al.(49Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Popoff M.R. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol.

Activation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase may stabilize F-actin, thereby excluding secretory vesicles from exocytosis. For two reasons it is tempting to speculate that a similar mechanism underlies the inhibition of the AQP2 translocation: (i) mastoparan-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins of the Go/i family have been co-purified with AQP2-bearing vesicles from CD8 cells (6Valenti G. Procino G. Liebenhoff U. Frigeri A. Benedetti P.A. Ahnert-Hilger G. Nürnberg B. Svelto M. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22627-22634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and, (ii) the finding that Rho proteins are present in IMCD and CD8 cell fractions enriched for AQP2-bearing vesicles (data not shown). Final proof that Rho and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase reside on AQP2-bearing vesicles will require analysis of the protein pattern of immuno-isolated vesicles using AQP2-, Rho-, and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-specific antibodies. In summary, the data presented here show that active Rho prevents AQP2 translocation from intracellular vesicles to the cell membrane, presumably by stimulating the formation of the F-actin cytoskeleton. We are grateful to H. Barth for preparing C3-fusion toxin, A. Geelhaar, C. Bouchaala, and B. Oczko for excellent technical assistance and J. Dickson for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2039981219,"Recently identified laminin isoforms containing the α4 chain have been shown to be expressed in the basement membrane of restricted organs such as heart, skeletal muscle, and blood vessels, especially those in embryos. We screened 38 human cell lines for the expression of the laminin α4 chain by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and found that T98G glioblastoma cells express only α4, but not other α chains. Laminin-8, an isoform containing the α4 and β1 chains, was purified from conditioned medium of T98G cells by gel filtration and immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody against laminin β1 chain. The purified laminin isoform was composed of disulfide-linked 230-, 220-, and 200-kDa subunits, which immunoblot analysis identified as the β1, γ1, and α4 chains. Purified laminin-8 had cell adhesive activity comparable to laminin-1 but significantly weaker than laminin-5 and laminin-10/11. T98G cells adhering to laminin-8 became more elongated than those adhering to other laminin isoforms and extended multiple pseudopods. Cell adhesion to laminin-8 was abolished by an antibody against the integrin β1 subunit or a combination of antibodies against the integrin α3 and α6 subunits, but not by either anti-α3 or anti-α6 antibody alone, suggesting that both α3β1 and α6β1 integrins serve as adhesion receptors for laminin-8. Consistent with these observations, K562 erythroleukemic cells transfected with either integrin α3 or α6 cDNA were capable of adhering to laminin-8 when β1 integrins were stimulated by the β1-activating antibody 8A2. Despite its moderate cell adhesive activity, laminin-8 was significantly potent in promoting cell migration when compared with other laminin isoforms and fibronectin. Cell migration on laminin-8 was completely inhibited by a combination of antibodies against α3 and α6 integrins, and substantially inhibited by anti-α3 antibody alone, suggesting that laminin-8-mediated cell migration is predominantly mediated by α3β1 integrin. Given its potency to stimulate cell migration and preferential localization to the basement membrane of capillaries and embryonic tissues, laminin-8 may play a role in processes requiring enhanced cell migration during development, wound healing, and angiogenesis. Recently identified laminin isoforms containing the α4 chain have been shown to be expressed in the basement membrane of restricted organs such as heart, skeletal muscle, and blood vessels, especially those in embryos. We screened 38 human cell lines for the expression of the laminin α4 chain by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and found that T98G glioblastoma cells express only α4, but not other α chains.

Consistent with these observations, K562 erythroleukemic cells transfected with either integrin α3 or α6 cDNA were capable of adhering to laminin-8 when β1 integrins were stimulated by the β1-activating antibody 8A2. Despite its moderate cell adhesive activity, laminin-8 was significantly potent in promoting cell migration when compared with other laminin isoforms and fibronectin. Cell migration on laminin-8 was completely inhibited by a combination of antibodies against α3 and α6 integrins, and substantially inhibited by anti-α3 antibody alone, suggesting that laminin-8-mediated cell migration is predominantly mediated by α3β1 integrin. Given its potency to stimulate cell migration and preferential localization to the basement membrane of capillaries and embryonic tissues, laminin-8 may play a role in processes requiring enhanced cell migration during development, wound healing, and angiogenesis.

To date, five α, three β, and three γ chains have been identified, combinations of which have been shown to give rise to at least 12 different laminin isoforms (1Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 2Timpl R. Brown J.C. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 3Engvall E. Wewer U.M. J. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These laminin isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner, suggesting that they are functionally distinct (5Ekblom M. Falk M. Salmivirta K. Durbeej M. Ekblom P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 857: 194-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 6Aumailley M. Smyth N. J. Anat. 1998; 193: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The differences in biological activity among these isoforms, however, have yet to be defined. Laminins have many biological functions, including promotion of cell adhesion and migration, control of cell proliferation and gene expression, maintenance of differentiation phenotypes, and stimulation of neurite outgrowth. Laminins mediate these functions through binding to cell surface receptors, particularly the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules. So far, nine integrin types, including α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α6β1, α6β4, and α7β1, have been shown to bind to laminins with distinct specificities (6Aumailley M. Smyth N. J.

For example, cell adhesion to laminin-1, the “classical laminin” purified from mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor, is mainly mediated by α6β1 integrin, while adhesion to laminin-5 occurs through α3β1 and α6β4 integrins (8Aumailley M.

We purified laminin-10/11 from conditioned medium of lung carcinoma cells and showed that it interacts with α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4integrins (15Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol.

Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14853-14859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The α4 chain is a truncated version of the laminin α chains like α3A (19Iivanainen A. Sainio K. Sariola H. Tryggvason K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Richards A. Al-Imara L. Pope F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The α4 chain is predominantly expressed in capillaries in brain, muscle, and bone marrow (19Iivanainen A. Sainio K. Sariola H. Tryggvason K.

In the kidney, the α4 chain is present in nascent epithelial basement membrane of the renal vesicle and immature glomerular basement membrane, but is absent in the adult kidney (23Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J. Snider W.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 25Miner J.H. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 2016-2024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The α4 chain is also localized to muscle basement membrane during muscle formation, but is absent in adult muscles, except at neuromuscular junctions (26Patton B.L. Miner J.H. Chiu A.Y. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1507-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 27Gullberg D. Tiger C.-F. Velling T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 442-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similarly, laminin-8 is the major laminin isoform in developing bone marrow (24Gu Y. Sorokin L. Durbeej M. Hjalt T. Jonsson J.I. Ekblom M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2533-2542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its restricted expression and localizationin vivo, the biological activity of the α4 chain-containing laminins has not been explored thoroughly due to the unavailability of sufficient purified laminin-8 for biochemical and functional analysis. In this study, we purified laminin-8 from conditioned medium of human glioma cells and characterized its biological activities, including cell adhesive and cell migration promoting properties and integrin binding specificity in comparison with other laminin isoforms and fibronectin. Human glioblastoma cell line T98G, human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, human gastric cancer cell line AZ-521, human hepatoma cell line HLF, and human gastric carcinoma cell line MKN-45 were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). Human lung squamous carcinoma cell line RERF-LC-AI was purchased from RIKEN Gene Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). These cells were maintained in DMEM1containing 10% FBS. K562 human erythroleukemic cells transfected with cDNAs encoding human integrin α3A or α6A subunits were kindly provided by Dr. Arnoud Sonnenberg (The Netherlands Cancer Institute) and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and 1 mg/ml Geneticin (13Delwel G.O. de Melker A.A.

The mAb 8B12 against the human laminin α4 chain was produced by fusion of Sp2/O mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells from mice immunized with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the G1 domain of the laminin α4 chain (Ser835-Cys1028 (20Richards A. Al-Imara L. Pope F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). The mAb 8B12 was capable of binding to denatured laminin α4 chain on immunoblots, but not to intact α4 chain-containing laminin assembled with β1 and γ1 chains in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and was therefore unsuitable for immunoaffinity purification of intact laminins. The mAb 4F5 specific for the human laminin β1 chain was produced similarly to 8B12, except that spleen cells were obtained from mice immunized with human placental laminin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The specificity of 4F5 was determined by isolation and protein sequencing of peptides from a thermolysin digest of human placenta that selectively bound to 4F5-conjugated Sepharose 4B. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 4F5-binding 60-kDa fragment was ARQXDRXLPGHWGFP, identical to the sequence of the human laminin β1 chain (Ala848-Pro862 (28Vuolteenaho R. Chow L.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15611-15616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The mAb 5D6 against the human laminin α5 chain, was produced by immunizing mice with commercially available human laminin-10/11 (Chemicon) purified from a pepsin digest of human placenta by immunoaffinity chromatography using the anti-α5 chain mAb 4C7 (29Tiger C.-F.

Ekblom P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mAb 5D6 was selected by positive reactivity with purified human laminin-10/11 (15Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and negative reactivity with commercially available human laminin-2/4 (Chemicon). The mAb 2B10 against the laminin α3 chain was produced by immunizing mice with human laminin-5 purified from conditioned medium of MKN-45 cells (31Fukushima Y. Ohnishi T. Arita N. Hayakawa T. Sekiguchi K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). 2B10 was selected by reactivity with purified laminin-5 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, followed by specific binding to the laminin α3 chain as shown on immunoblots. mAbs against the human laminin α1 (5A3) and α5 (15H5) chains were produced in our laboratory as described previously (15Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A mAb against the laminin β1 chain (DG10) was kindly provided from Dr. Ismo Virtanen (University of Helsinki, Finland). A hybridoma secreting mAb against the laminin β2 chain (C4), developed by Dr. Joshua Sanes (Washington University School of Medicine), was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). MAbs against the human laminin α2 chain (5H2) and human integrin α2 (P1E6) were purchased from Chemicon. MAbs against the human laminin γ1 chain (2E8 and number 22) were obtained from Chemicon and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. A mAb against the human integrin α6 (GoH3) was purchased from Immunotech (Westbrook, ME). MAbs against the human integrin α3 (3G8), α5 (8F1), and β1 (4G2) chains were produced in our laboratory as described previously (16Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J.

A mAb against integrin β1 (8A2) which activates β1 chain-containing integrins, was a gift from Dr. Nicholas Kovach (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Mouse laminin-1 was purified from mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor tissues by the method of Paulssonet al. (33Paulsson M. Aumailley M. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Beck K. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Human laminin-5 was purified from conditioned medium of MKN45 cells by immunoaffinity chromatography using polyclonal antibodies against the human laminin γ2 chain (31Fukushima Y. Ohnishi T. Arita N. Hayakawa T. Sekiguchi K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Human laminin-10/11 was purified from conditioned medium of A549 cells according to Kikkawa et al. (15Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), except that mAb 5D6, instead of 4C7, was used to conjugate Sepharose 4B in the immunoaffinity matrix. Human laminin-1 was isolated from conditioned medium of RERF-LC-AI cells on a 4F5 immunoaffinity column and used only for immunoblot analysis. Human laminin-2/4 (also referred to as merosin) was purchased from Chemicon. Human plasma fibronectin was purified from outdated plasma by gelatin affinity chromatography (34Sekiguchi K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3967-3973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from 38 human cell lines (13 lung carcinomas, 5 gastric carcinomas, 3 gliomas, 2 kidney carcinomas, 2 cervix carcinomas, 2 tropoblastomas, 2 endothelial cell lines, and one each of oral carcinoma, salivary grand carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, leukemia, hepatoma, pancreatic carcinoma, epidermoid carcinoma, fibrosarcoma, and lung fibroblast) by the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate method (35Chomczynski P.

PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gels. T98G cells were grown in 1,700-cm2 roller bottles with DMEM containing 10% FBS. After the cells reached confluence, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 5% FBS and harvested every 6 days. The conditioned medium (about 4 liters) was clarified by centrifugation and then precipitated with 45% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitates were dissolved in 10 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, clarified by centrifugation, and subjected to gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-4B column (2.5 × 120 cm) equilibrated in PBS containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm EDTA. The Sepharose CL-4B column was calibrated prior to use with mouse laminin-1 (∼800 kDa), human plasma fibronectin (∼450 kDa), and mouse IgG (150 kDa). Fractions containing laminin-8 were detected by immunoblotting with anti-α4 mAb 8B12. These fractions were pooled and then applied to a 4F5-conjugated Sepharose 4B column equilibrated in PBS containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The bound proteins were eluted with 0.1m glycine-HCl (pH 2.4), immediately neutralized with 1.5m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and dialyzed against PBS containing 1 mm EDTA. Cell adhesion assays were performed as described previously (15Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Ninety-six-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) were coated with 50 μl of increasing concentrations of cell adhesive proteins overnight at 4 °C, and then blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. 100-μl aliquots of cell suspension (3 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free DMEM containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 0.5% BSA) were added to each well of the coated plates and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a CO2 incubator. After the plates were washed to remove unattached cells, attached cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, stained with Diff-Quik (International Reagents Corp., Kobe, Japan), and counted in three independent fields/well. For cell adhesion assays using K562 cells, cell suspensions (4 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 0.5% BSA) were preincubated with or without 8A2, an integrin β1-activating mAb, for 10 min at room temperature. 50-μl aliquots of preincubated cell suspension were added to 96-well microtiter plates coated with increasing concentrations of various laminin isoforms and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a CO2 incubator. Attached cells were counted as described above. Cell adhesion inhibition assays were performed based on the cell adhesion assays. Cell suspensions (4 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free DMEM containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 0.5% BSA) were incubated with 20 μg/ml mAbs against different integrin isoforms for 20 min at room temperature. 50-μl aliquots of preincubated cells were added to wells that had been coated with different cell adhesive proteins and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Attached cells were then counted as described above. Cell migration on substrates coated with laminins or fibronectin was examined by time lapse video microscopy using the image processing software Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Glass-bottom culture dishes fitted with φ 8-mm coverslips were coated with 250 μl of cell adhesive proteins overnight at 4 °C, and blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. 4-ml of cell suspension (1 × 104 cells/ml in DMEM containing 1% FBS) was added to each coated dish and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow the cells to attach. The dishes were then placed in a built-in CO2incubator on the stage of the Zeiss Axiovert 25 microscope, and subjected to time lapse video microscopy at 10-min intervals for 8 h. Cell migration was quantified by tracing the position of the nucleus of migration cells using Image-Pro Plus. For cell migration inhibition assays, cell suspensions (2 × 104 cells/ml in DMEM containing 1% FBS) were incubated with 20 μg/ml mAbs against different integrin isoforms for 20 min at room temperature. 2-ml of preincubated cell suspension was added to the precoated glass-bottom culture dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow cells to attach. Cell migration images were taken as described for cell migration assays for 8 h. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 4 or 5.5% acrylamide gels. Separated proteins were visualized by silver staining or transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were probed with mAbs against individual laminin chains, followed by visualization using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To purify laminin isoforms containing the α4 chain from conditioned medium of cultured cells, we screened 38 human cell lines for selective expression of the laminin α4 chain by RT-PCR. We found that one of the glioma cell lines, T98G, expresses only one of the five known laminin α chains, the α4 chain (Fig.1 A). Failure to detect RNA transcripts for other α chains was not due to inappropriate PCR conditions, since these transcripts were clearly detected in other cell lines, including the α1 chain in RERF-LC-AI, α2 and α3 chains in HLF, and α5 chain in AZ521. T98G cells also expressed β1 and γ1 chains, but only a low level of the β2 chain (Fig. 1 B), indicating that laminin-8 (α4β1γ1) is the major laminin isoform expressed in T98G cells. The expression of laminin-8 in T98G cells was confirmed at the protein level by immunoblot analysis of conditioned medium of T98G cells using mAb 8B12 produced by immunizing mice with a recombinant G1 domain of the human α4 chain. The mAb 8B12 specifically detected a ∼650-kDa band under nonreducing conditions, while reducing conditions resulted in a major 200-kDa band and a faint 180-kDa band (Fig. 1 C). The 200-kDa band is consistent with the molecular mass of the laminin α4 chain as predicted by its amino acid sequence (19Iivanainen A. Sainio K. Sariola H. Tryggvason K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Richards A. Al-Imara L. Pope F.M. Eur. J.

Laminin-8 secreted by T98G cells was purified from conditioned medium by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and immunoaffinity chromatography using mAb 4F5 specific for the laminin β1 chain. Conditioned medium of T98G cells was precipitated with 45% saturated ammonium sulfate, and the precipitates were subjected to gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-4B column (Fig. 2). Fractions containing trimeric laminin-8 were detected by immunoblotting with 8B12, an anti-α4 chain mAb, pooled, and subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography using 4F5. The eluate from the 4F5-Sepharose column was found by silver staining to contain a single 650-kDa species under nonreducing conditions (Fig.3 A). The ∼650-kDa band was stained with mAbs specific for the α4, β1, and γ1 chains, confirming that the purified protein was laminin-8. Under reducing conditions, three bands of 230, 220, and 200 kDa were resolved, each identified as the β1, γ1, and α4 chains, respectively, by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3 B). A faint 180-kDa band was also detectable by immunoblotting with anti-α4 mAb. Since the 180-kDa band was also detectable in fresh conditioned medium (Fig. 1 C), it could be a proteolytically processed α4 chain or an alternatively spliced variant. Since no bands near 150 kDa were detected by silver staining under reducing or nonreducing conditions, the purified laminin-8 seemed to be devoid of nidogen-1.Figure 3SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of purified laminin-8.

https://openalex.org/W1595429539,"The enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several disease processes, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, because of its ability to generate reactive oxygen species. The expression of XO and its precursor xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is regulated at pre- and posttranslational levels by agents such as lipopolysaccharide and hypoxia. Posttranslational modification of the protein, for example through thiol oxidation or proteolysis, has been shown to be important in converting XDH to XO. The possibility of posttranslational modification of XDH/XO through phosphorylation has not been adequately investigated in mammalian cells, and studies have reported conflicting results. The present report demonstrates that XDH/XO is phosphorylated in rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (RPMEC) and that phosphorylation is greatly increased (∼50-fold) in response to acute hypoxia (4 h). XDH/XO phosphorylation appears to be mediated, at least in part, by casein kinase II and p38 kinase as inhibitors of these kinases partially prevent XDH/XO phosphorylation. In addition, the results indicate that p38 kinase, a stress-activated kinase, becomes activated in response to hypoxia (an ∼4-fold increase after 1 h of exposure of RPMEC to hypoxia) further supporting a role for this kinase in hypoxia-stimulated XDH/XO phosphorylation. Finally, hypoxia-induced XDH/XO phosphorylation is accompanied by a 2-fold increase in XDH/XO activity, which is prevented by inhibitors of phosphorylation. In summary, this study shows that XDH/XO is phosphorylated in hypoxic RPMEC through a mechanism involving p38 kinase and casein kinase II and that phosphorylation is necessary for hypoxia-induced enzymatic activation.

In summary, this study shows that XDH/XO is phosphorylated in hypoxic RPMEC through a mechanism involving p38 kinase and casein kinase II and that phosphorylation is necessary for hypoxia-induced enzymatic activation. Xanthine dehydrogenase is the rate-limiting step in the catabolism of purines, where it catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. In this reaction, XDH1 utilizes NAD+ preferentially as the electron acceptor. However, when XDH is converted to XO, the preferred electron acceptor becomes molecular oxygen resulting in the formation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. This generation of reactive oxygen species is thought to be the basis of XDH/XO involvement in various pathological conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion injury. Reversible conversion of XDH to XO can occur after the oxidation of eight cysteine residues in the molecule into four cystines by agents such as pyrimidines or oxidized glutathione (1Battelli M.G. Lorenzoni E. Stripe F. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Harris C.M. Sanders S.A. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4561-4569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This conversion may be reversed upon the addition of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol. XDH can also be converted into XO irreversibly through proteolysis (3Amaya Y. Yamazaki K. Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental proteolysis by trypsin has allowed the identification of three different parts of the molecule: a 20-kDa N-terminal fragment, a 40-kDa flavin-binding fragment, and an 80-kDa molybdopterin-binding fragment, all of which remain attached after proteolysis (3Amaya Y. Yamazaki K. Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that both reversible and irreversible conversion of XDH to XO are due to conformational changes in the molecule that reduce its affinity for NAD+. The notion that XDH/XO is a phosphoprotein has been the subject of controversy. Initial reports of the presence of a phosphoserine in milk xanthine oxidase concluded that, in addition to two phosphates on the FAD and one phosphate in the molybdopterin cofactor, there was a phosphate covalently bound to a serine residue of the protein (4Davis M.D. Edmondson D.E. Muller F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Edmondson D.E. Davis M.D. Muller F. Bray R.C. Engel P.C. Mayhew S.G. Flavins & Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1984: 309-317Google Scholar). Later reports indicated that no covalently attached phosphate to milk XDH/XO could be detected by NMR or chemical analysis (6Johnson J.L. London R.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6493-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Howes B.D. Bennett B. Koppenhofer A. Lowe D.J. Bray R.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3969-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, using biochemical analysis of immunoprecipitated XDH from chick embryo hepatocytes, Schieber and Edmondson (8Schieber A. Edmondson D.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) demonstrated the incorporation of labeled phosphate into XDH and estimated 3 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. Although the latter report described the covalent phosphorylation of serine residues in chicken xanthine dehydrogenase (8Schieber A. Edmondson D.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of mammalian XDH remains to be demonstrated conclusively. In this report, evidence is provided that rat XDH/XO can be phosphorylated in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. Moreover, the phosphorylation of XDH is greatly increased in response to hypoxia, which is known to induce XDH/XO (9Hassoun P.M., Yu, F.S. Shedd A.L. Zulueta J.J. Thannickal V.J. Lanzillo J.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L163-L171PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in XDH/XO phosphorylation in hypoxia is accompanied by an increase in XDH/XO activity. Hypoxia-induced XDH/XO phosphorylation is partially blocked by inhibitors of p38 kinase. Furthermore, our data indicate that p38 is significantly activated in hypoxia. Hence, p38 kinase is postulated to be involved in the phosphorylation of XDH/XO in hypoxia. RPMI 1640, phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, dialyzed fetal bovine serum, penicillin G potassium, streptomycin, fungizone, and glutamine were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem. [32P] Orthophosphate was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. EDTA, Tris, and dithiothreitol were from Sigma. Rabbit anti-XO antibody was from LabVision, Fremont, CA, and anti p38 antibodies were from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and the chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate SuperSignal were from Pierce. Rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (RPMEC) were a gift from Dr. Una Ryan (Avant Immunotherapeutics, Needham, MA) and were cultured as previously described (10Cote C.G., Yu, F.S. Zulueta J.J. Vosatka R.J. Hassoun P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L869-L874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For hypoxic exposure, cells were placed in humidified airtight incubation chambers (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA) and gassed with 3% O2, 5% CO2, and balance N2. The hypoxic chambers were kept in a 37 °C incubator for the duration of the experiment. Normoxic cells were kept in a tissue culture incubator maintained at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. The activities of xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase in response to different treatments were assayed using a slight modification of a fluorimetric assay that measures both xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase activity (11Beckman J.S. Parks D.A. Pearson J.D. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The principle of the assay involves the conversion of pterin into the fluorescent product isoxanthopterin. The rate of product formation with oxygen as the electron acceptor represents the activity of xanthine oxidase, whereas the combined activities of xanthine oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase are measured with methylene blue as the electron acceptor. In brief, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped off the plate in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1.5 mg/ml dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture 3 (Calbiochem). The cells were sonicated for 5 s and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and assayed immediately or stored at −80 °C overnight. For testing the effect of phosphorylation on XDH or XO activity, lysates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.5 mg/ml dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture 3, and aliquots were treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) before the assay. Aliquots from the cell lysates prepared as described above were assayed for protein using the Bradford protein assay (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and then diluted with 2× Laemmli loading buffer for SDS-PAGE (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were then loaded in each well of 4–20% Tris/glycine gels. After electrophoresis for 90 min at 125 V constant voltage, the gel was blotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane by electrophoretic transfer at 25 V constant voltage overnight. The membrane was then washed, blocked with 5% milk, and probed with antibodies against xanthine oxidase (LabVision). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and a chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (SuperSignal, Pierce). The intensity of the bands was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer and ImageQuant software. For phosphoprotein analysis RPMEC, which had been passaged the day before, were incubated with 32PO4 at 0.5 mCi/ml in phosphate-free medium. The cells were exposed to normoxia, hypoxia, and/or kinase inhibitors for 1–18 h. At the end of the exposure, the cells were washed and lysed (0.3 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer/3.5-cm dish). XDH/XO was then immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-XDH/XO antibody as described (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 18.2.1-18.2.8Google Scholar) and run on SDS-PAGE. In brief, cell lysates were first precleared with protein A-Sepharose. Then they were incubated with anti-XDH/XO antibody at 4 °C overnight. Next, protein A-Sepharose was added to the samples, which were then rocked for 2 h at 4 °C. The complex was washed 10 times with 0.5 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and the specifically bound XDH/XO was eluted from the complex by heating in 2× Laemmli sample buffer followed by centrifugation. The samples were then run on SDS-PAGE as described above. The gels were dried on filter paper or electrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes. Phosphorylation of XDH/XO was detected by autoradiography and quantified by either phosphorimaging or by scanning and then quantifying the bands on film. The values plotted in all figures are means, and the error bars reflect the standard deviation from the mean. Statistical analysis was carried out using SigmaStat (Jandel Scientific). Student's t test was used to determine whether differences between normoxic and hypoxic enzyme activity were significant in Fig. 1. When comparisons between multiple groups were carried out, one-way analysis of variance was employed. Statistical significance was considered at p >0.05. Previous reports have indicated that exposure of endothelial cells to hypoxia increased XDH/XO activity (9Hassoun P.M., Yu, F.S. Shedd A.L. Zulueta J.J. Thannickal V.J. Lanzillo J.J. Fanburg B.L. Am.

An increase in protein expression has been reported in vivo after 24 h of exposure to hypobaric hypoxia (17Hassoun P.M., Yu, F.S. Cote C.G. Zulueta J.J. Sawhney R. Skinner K.A. Skinner H.B. Parks D.A. Lanzillo J.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and in vitroafter exposure to 48 h of hypoxia (16Terada L.S. Piermattei D. Shibao G.N. McManaman J.L. Wright R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The following experiments were designed to examine the effect of acute exposure (4 h) of cells to hypoxia on posttranslational modification of the XDH/XO protein. RPMEC were exposed to hypoxia for 4 h before XDH/XO activity was assayed. Because the changes in XDH and XO activities always occurred in parallel, total XDH/XO activity is reported for all experiments (nmol of isoxanthopterin formed/min/mg of protein). A significant increase in XDH/XO activity was observed by 4 h of exposure of RPMEC to hypoxia (Fig. 1), a finding that is consistent with an earlier report (9Hassoun P.M., Yu, F.S. Shedd A.L. Zulueta J.J. Thannickal V.J. Lanzillo J.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L163-L171PubMed Google Scholar). Because the increase in the XDH/XO enzyme activity in hypoxia was not due to a change in the amount of XDH/XO protein in hypoxia as determined by Northern blotting (data not shown), posttranslational modification of the protein was investigated as a mechanism of enzyme activation. Upon examining the primary sequence of XDH/XO, potential phosphorylation sites for several protein kinases were identified. Therefore, the possibility of XDH/XO phosphorylation was examined in cultured cells. RPMEC were metabolically labeled with 32P, and XDH/XO was immunoprecipitated at various time points (see “Experimental Procedures”). Bands that corresponded to XDH/XO incorporated a significant amount of 32P, indicating that XDH/XO was covalently phosphorylated (Fig. 2,Normoxia). The possibility that the observed increase in XDH/XO activity after 4 h of exposure to hypoxia could be due to posttranslational modification of the protein, specifically phosphorylation, was examined. When RPMEC were incubated with 32P and exposed to hypoxia for 1, 2, 4, and 24 h, there was a significant increase in XDH/XO phosphorylation as compared with normoxia with a maximum 50-fold increase at 4 h (Fig. 2). This increase was consistently observed in repeated experiments. The increase in phosphorylation was not due to an increase in the protein level because probing the same membrane with an anti-XDH/XO antibody after decay of the 32P radioactivity revealed no significant differences in the amount of XDH/XO between hypoxic and normoxic samples (data not shown). Upon demonstrating that hypoxia stimulated XDH/XO phosphorylation and enzyme activity, the effect of dephosphorylation on enzyme activity was investigated in normoxic and hypoxic samples. Samples were incubated with either alkaline phosphatase or inactivated alkaline phosphatase (control) and then assayed for XDH/XO enzyme activity. As shown in Fig.3, alkaline phosphatase treatment reduced the activity of both normoxic and hypoxic samples. However, only the reduction in enzyme activity in hypoxic samples (64%) was statistically significant. These results are consistent with a role for phosphorylation in modulating XDH/XO activity. To identify the kinase(s) or phosphatase(s) involved in XDH/XO phosphorylation, RPMEC were preincubated with various inhibitors prior to labeling and exposing to hypoxia. As shown in TableI, inhibitors of protein kinase A and protein kinase G reduced base-line XDH/XO phosphorylation but had no effect on hypoxia-stimulated phosphorylation. Inhibitors of protein kinase C had no effect on XDH/XO phosphorylation in either normoxic or hypoxic cells. A casein kinase II (CK2) inhibitor partially blocked hypoxia-stimulated XDH/XO phosphorylation (Fig.4). Inhibitors of p38 kinase, a stress-activated kinase reported to be activated in hypoxia (18Conrad P.W. Rust R.T. Han J. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23570-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19Seko Y. Takahashi N. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), also partially blocked hypoxia-stimulated phosphorylation of XDH/XO (Fig. 4). In conclusion, these results suggest that phosphorylation of XDH/XO in hypoxia involves p38 kinase and CK2.Table IPercent of inhibition of XDH/XO phospholabelingNormoxiaHypoxiaPKA inhibitor53 ± 50PKG inhibitor54 ± 20Calphostin58 ± 212 ± 5Bis53 ± 130Inhibitors of protein kinases A, G, and C reduce base-line phosphorylation of XDH/XO but do not affect hypoxia-stimulated phosphorylation.

Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors calphostin and bisindolylamide were used at 1 μm. Inhibitors of protein kinases A, G, and C inhibited XDH/XO phosphorylation in normoxia but had little or no effect on hypoxia-stimulated phosphorylation. Phosphatase inhibitors, cypermethrin and cyclosporin A, which inhibit protein phosphatase 2B or calcineurin, had no effect on XDH/XO phosphorylation in either normoxia or hypoxia (results not shown). Okadaic acid, which inhibits protein phosphatase 2A, was toxic to RPMEC at a concentration of 100 nm, and therefore, its effect could not be assessed. After identifying inhibitors that block hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of XDH/XO, the effect of these inhibitors on XDH/XO enzyme activity was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5, both p38 kinase and CK2 inhibitors blocked hypoxia-stimulated XDH/XO enzyme activity. Taken together, these results are consistent with a role for phosphorylation by p38 kinase and CK2 in modulating XDH/XO enzymatic activity. The MAP kinase p38 has been reported to be induced in hypoxia in PC12 and other cell types (18Conrad P.W. Rust R.T. Han J. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23570-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19Seko Y. Takahashi N. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This enzyme is involved in stress-activated pathways responding to stressors such as hyperosmolarity, ultraviolet radiation, and inflammatory cytokines. Because inhibitors of p38 kinase partially prevented hypoxia-stimulated phosphorylation of XDH/XO, the effect of hypoxia on activation of p38 kinase in pulmonary endothelial cells was examined. Because p38 kinase becomes phosphorylated upon activation, antibodies that recognize phosphorylated (activated) p38 were used to probe Western blots from normoxic and hypoxic cells. To ensure that the changes in phosphorylated p38 immunolabeling were due to increased phosphorylation of the protein rather than total amount of p38, duplicate blots were probed with antibodies that recognize total p38 protein (both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated). For quantification, films were scanned with a densitometer, and the intensities of the phosphorylated p38 kinase bands were normalized to the intensities of the corresponding total p38 kinase bands. Hypoxia resulted in an increase in phosphorylated p38 kinase after 30 min of hypoxia with a peak (a 4-fold increase over normoxic cells) at 1 h (Fig.6, A and B). By 24 h of hypoxia there was no difference in phosphorylated p38 kinase between normoxic and hypoxic cells. These results indicate that hypoxia causes the activation of p38 kinase in pulmonary endothelial cells, a phenomenon that chronologically precedes the peak of XDH/XO phosphorylation observed at 4 h of hypoxia. Because inhibitors of p38 kinase reduce the phosphorylation of XDH/XO in hypoxia and because p38 becomes activated in RPMEC in hypoxia, experiments were performed to determine whether p38 kinase activators other than hypoxia stimulate XDH/XO phosphorylation. When RPMEC were exposed to hyperosmolar sorbitol (400 mm) or sodium arsenite (0.5 mm), both of which have been reported to activate p38 kinase in other cell types (20Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Ito H. Okamoto K. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), there was activation of p38 kinase by both agents within 15 min (Fig.7). However, when RPMEC were prelabeled with 32P and then treated with sorbitol or arsenite for 30 min, no significant increase in XDH/XO phosphorylation over control cells was observed (Fig. 8). Taken together, these results indicate that activation of p38 kinase in hypoxia might be necessary but not sufficient to cause the phosphorylation of XDH/XO.Figure 8Sorbitol and arsenite do not increase XDH/XO phosphorylation. Cells were labeled with 32P as in Fig. 2 and exposed to sorbitol (400 mm), sodium arsenite (0.5 mm), or hypoxia for 1 and 4 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This study demonstrates that XDH/XO is a phosphoprotein. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of phosphorylation of XDH/XO in mammalian cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of XDH/XO is greatly increased in hypoxia and is accompanied by an increase in XDH/XO enzyme activity. A causal relationship between increased phosphorylation and increased XDH/XO enzyme activity is supported by the finding that dephosphorylating XDH/XO reduces the hypoxia-stimulated enzyme activity and the finding that kinase inhibitors that block hypoxia-stimulated XDH/XO protein phosphorylation also block hypoxia-stimulated enzyme activity. These results also implicate p38 in the mechanism of XDH/XO phosphorylation by demonstrating that p38 kinase is induced in hypoxia and that an inhibitor of this enzyme partially blocks the phosphorylation of XDH/XO. The possible implications of these findings in regard to the regulation of XDH/XO by hypoxia are discussed below. Up-regulation of XDH/XO has been reported in several diseases. For example, XDH/XO has been implicated in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (22Grum C.M. Ragsdale R.A. Ketai L.H. Simon R.H. J. Crit. Care. 1991; 2: 22-26Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Quinlan G.J. Lamb N.J. Tilley R. Evans T.W. Gutteridge J.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 155: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the multisystem organ failure (24Galley H.F. Davies M.J. Webster N.R. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 24: 1649-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and reexpansion pulmonary edema (25Jackson R.M. Curtis F.V. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1989; 298: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ability of XDH/XO to generate reactive oxygen species is believed to be the basis for the role of this enzyme in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The production of reactive oxygen species by XDH/XO is significantly increased upon the conversion of XDH to XO either through proteolysis or through posttranslational modification (26Stirpe F. Della Corte E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3855-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Both proteolysis and oxidation of the cysteines in XDH cause conformational changes in the molecule, which reduce its affinity for NAD+ leaving molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor instead (3Amaya Y. Yamazaki K. Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In animal models of lung injury, XDH/XO has been shown to be greatly increased (400-fold) in the bronchoalveolar lavage and serum of mice infected with the influenza virus (28Akaike T. Ando M. Oda T.

Using an in vivo model of acute lung injury, our laboratory has demonstrated an increase in lung XDH/XO activity and gene expression in response to hypoxia, lipopolysaccharide, and interleukin-1β treatment (17Hassoun P.M., Yu, F.S. Cote C.G. Zulueta J.J. Sawhney R. Skinner K.A. Skinner H.B. Parks D.A. Lanzillo J.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibition of XDH/XO prevents the development of pulmonary edema in this animal model further supporting a role for this enzyme in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Hypoxia is known to trigger a series of events that has been likened to an inflammatory reaction. Some of these events involve the activation of transcription through the action of transcription factors such as HIF-1 (29Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Guillemin K.

Ratcliffe P.J. Oncol. Res. 1997; 9: 327-332PubMed Google Scholar). Other events, however, are considered too rapid to be due to transcriptional processes. One example of a nontranscriptional hypoxic response is the mobilization of P-selectin and its release from membranous organelles, which allows it to bind and activate neutrophils (32Pinsky D.J. Naka Y. Liao H. Oz M.C. Wagner D.D. Mayadas T.N. Johnson R.C. Hynes R.O. Heath M. Lawson C.A. Stern D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The present data suggest another nontranscriptional endothelial response to hypoxia, namely the phosphorylation of XDH/XO and subsequent up-regulation of its enzymatic activity. Two kinases, CK2 and p38 kinase, were shown to be involved in hypoxia-stimulated phosphorylation of XDH/XO. CK2, a ubiquitously expressed protein kinase, is believed to play an important role in regulating DNA replication and transcription as well as in regulating cell growth and metabolism. Upon examination of the primary sequence of XDH/XO using a phosphorylation site prediction program (33Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), several CK2 sites were identified. Although there is no information related to the effect of hypoxia on CK2, hypoxia is known to increase the levels of polyamines in the lung (34Longo L.D. Packianathan S. McQueary J.A. Stagg R.B. Byus C.V. Cain C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which in turn are strong activators of CK2 (35Leroy D. Filhol O. Delcros J.G. Pares S. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1242-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1983; 30: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our finding that the CK2 inhibitor partially blocks hypoxia-stimulated XDH/XO phosphorylation and hypoxia-stimulated XDH/XO activity strongly suggests a role for this kinase in mediating the effects of hypoxia on XDH/XO. p38 kinase was also found to be important in mediating the phosphorylation of XDH/XO in hypoxia. This enzyme, which belongs to the family of MAP kinases, can be activated by a variety of stresses including hyperosmolarity and UV radiation. Recently, p38 kinase was found to be activated by hypoxia as well (18Conrad P.W. Rust R.T. Han J. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23570-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19Seko Y. Takahashi N. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The partial blocking of hypoxia-induced XDH/XO phosphorylation by p38 kinase inhibitor implicates this kinase in the XDH/XO phosphorylation pathway. The involvement of p38 kinase in hypoxia-stimulated XDH/XO phosphorylation is further supported by the finding that p38 is activated in hypoxic RPMEC. However, the inability of other p38 kinase stimulators, such as sorbitol and arsenite, to significantly increase XDH/XO phosphorylation suggests that p38 kinase activation alone is not sufficient to cause the XDH/XO phosphorylation and that other components are involved in the activation pathway. Although it is yet unclear how the two kinases, p38 kinase and CK2, interact in the XDH/XO phosphorylation pathway, a recent report demonstrated that stress-activated p38 kinase directly interacts with CK2 causing its activation in HeLa cells (37Sayed M. Kim S.O. Salh B.S. Issinger O.G. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16569-16573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which phosphorylation leads to increased enzyme activity need further investigation and are beyond the scope of the current study. However, one might speculate that the negative charges in the XDH/XO molecule introduced by phosphorylation might affect the affinity of the enzyme for its substrates (for example, see Ref. 38Nakai T. Konishi T. Zhang X.Q. Chollet R. Tonouchi N. Tsuchida T. Yoshinaga F. Mori H. Sakai F. Hayashi T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 1337-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Alternatively, these charges might alter protein-protein interactions either between different XDH/XO molecules affecting their tendency to dimerize or between XDH/XO and other unidentified proteins. An example of the latter mechanism of enzyme regulation involves the reactive oxygen species-producing neutrophil NADPH oxidase. This enzyme is believed to become activated during oxidative burst through the phosphorylation of one of its subunits, p47phox. Upon phosphorylation p47phox is translocated from the cytosol to the membrane where it associates with other subunits to activate the enzyme (39Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33644-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that p38 kinase has been shown to cause the phosphorylation of p47phox as well as the redistribution of other oxidase components, such as flavocytochromeb558, from vesicles to the plasma membrane through exocytosis resulting in activation of the enzyme (40Ward R.A. Nakamura M. McLeish K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36713-36719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Another example of phosphorylation indirectly affecting enzyme activity involves spinach nitrate reductase, which belongs to the same family of molybdopterin-FAD oxidoreductases that includes XDH/XO. Phosphorylation of nitrate reductase causes it to bind the protein 14-3-3, resulting in the inhibition of the enzyme activity (41Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Liao P.C. Gage D.A. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 42Moorhead G. Douglas P. Morrice N. Scarabel M. Aitken A. MacKintosh C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1104-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 is a family of proteins known to be involved in protein-protein interactions with various signal transduction components (for review, see Ref. 43Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the phosphorylation of XDH/XO might alter XDH/XO subcellular localization by modulating its interaction with other proteins. Further studies are required to decipher the consequences of XDH/XO phosphorylation at the molecular level such as its potential role in the interaction of the enzyme with other proteins and in modulating its subcellular localization. In conclusion, the findings that XDH/XO becomes phosphorylated and activated in hypoxia and that this phosphorylation is mediated by kinases known to be involved in signal transduction processes in inflammation and hypoxia implicate XDH/XO as an important component of the inflammatory reaction. Furthermore, the findings point to kinases as novel potential targets in regulating XDH/XO physiology. For instance, the p38 kinase inhibitor SB 203580 has been shown to reduce inflammation and lipopolysaccharide-induced mortality in animals (44Badger A.M. Bradbeer J.N. Votta B. Lee J.C. Adams J.L. Griswold D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 1453-1461PubMed Google Scholar). One possible action of this inhibitor might include modulating XDH/XO phosphorylation.

The role of PI3K/Akt in Ras-mediated transformation of intestinal epithelial cells is currently not clear. Here we demonstrate that inducible expression of oncogenic Ha-Ras results in activation of PKB/Akt in rat intestinal epithelial cells (RIE-iHa-Ras), which was blocked by treatment with inhibitors of PI3K activity. The PI3K inhibitor, LY-294002, partially reversed the morphological transformation induced by Ha-Ras and resulted in a modest stimulation of apoptosis. The most pronounced phenotypic alteration following inhibition of PI3K was induction of G1phase cell cycle arrest. LY-294002 blocked the Ha-Ras-induced expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, and increased the levels of p27kip. Both LY-294002 and wortmannin significantly reduced anchorage-independent growth of RIE-iHa-Ras cells. Forced expression of both the constitutively active forms of Raf (ΔRaf-22W or Raf BXB) and Akt (Akt-myr) resulted in transformation of RIE cells that was not achieved by transfection with either the Raf mutant construct or Akt-myr alone.

These observations strongly suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway is oncogenic and widely involved in the neoplastic transformation of mammalian cells. Understanding the role of Akt/PKB in malignant transformation has been greatly enhanced by recent work on the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN/MMACI. A large body of evidence demonstrates that PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) suppresses tumor formation by restraining the PI3K/Akt pathway (Refs. 19Sun H. Lesche R.

PTEN has been shown to dephosphorylate the 3-position of both phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-P3 and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-P2 to reverse the reaction catalyzed by PI3K, which leads to activation of Akt/PKB (23Cantley L.C.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death related to cancer in the United States. About 50% of colorectal carcinomas contain Ki-ras mutations (26Bos J.L.

The stained cells were washed with PBS, mounted, and observed under fluorescent microscopy with appropriate filters. RIE-iHa-Ras cells were grown to confluence in 60-mm plates. IPTG, PD-98059 (50 μm), or LY-294002 (20 μm) was added to the culture medium. The cells were incubated for another 48 h, after which floating and attached cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in 20 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The supernatant containing fragmented DNA was clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 1600 × g.

Stable clones were selected by growth in media containing hygromycin (100 μg/ml), and expression was verified by measuring increased levels of Raf protein. To establish RIE-RasVal12cells, RIE parental cells were stably transfected with the pcDNA3/Ha-RasVal12 expression vector and were selected by growth in neomycin (600 μg/ml). Oncogenic Ras is known to activate Akt/PKB through direct binding and activation of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K (33Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to elucidate whether expression of mutated Ha-Ras activates Akt/PKB in intestinal epithelial cells, we evaluated the effect of inducible expression of Ha-RasVal12in RIE cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, the expression of Ha-RasVal12 in RIE-iHa-Ras cells is detectable 4 h following treatment with IPTG and markedly increased within 24 h. The levels of phosphorylated extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt were coincidentally induced following induction of Ras expression. Following Ras induction, RIE cells acquired a transformed appearance characterized by growth in overlapping clusters and formation of colonies in soft agarose (Fig. 1 B). To block the Ras-induced activation of Akt/PKB a specific inhibitor for PI3K, LY-294002 (20 μm) (34Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the RIE-iHa-Ras cells prior to IPTG treatment. The Ras-induced phosphorylation of ERKs was not affected by the treatment with LY-294002. In contrast, treatment with LY-294002 almost completely blocked the activation of Akt/PKB following induction of oncogenic Ha-Ras, but pAkt was maintained at a basal level (Fig. 1 C). Akt/PKB has been shown to promote cell survival in a variety of different cell lines (12Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar, 13del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the role of Akt/PKB in programmed cell death of Ras-transformed intestinal epithelial cells. As demonstrated in Fig.2 A, RIE-iHa-Ras cells underwent apoptosis when they reached confluence as indicated by their DNA banding pattern. In contrast, programmed cell death was almost completely inhibited following induction of Ha-RasVal12 and DNA fragmentation was barely detected in IPTG-treated RIE-iHa-Ras cells. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) with PD-98059 (50 μm) greatly increased DNA fragmentation despite the induction of oncogenic Ha-Ras. Surprisingly, inhibition of Akt/PKB activation by LY-294002 only partially blocked the Ras-induced increase in cell survival. Treatment with PD-98059 resulted in an increased fraction of apoptotic floating cells (Fig. 2 B,left panel) as determined by fluorochrome staining (Fig. 2 B, right panel). Non-induced RIE-iHa-Ras cells displayed the same non-transformed morphology as the parental RIE-1 cells, which grew as monolayer cultures with contact inhibition (Fig.3 A, panel a). Morphological transformation of the RIE-iHa-Ras cells was observed between 24 and 48 h after IPTG treatment (Fig.3 A, panel b). Inhibition of MEK/ERK activity by PD-98059 completely blocked the Ras-induced transformation in RIE-iHa-Ras cells (Fig. 3 A, panel c). Inhibition of Akt/PKB activity resulted in a partial suppression of Ras-mediated transformation. The spindly appearance of cells and overlapping growth was still observed in some areas (Fig.3 A, panel d). Fluorescent staining with rhodamine-phalloidin clearly demonstrated stress fibers in uninduced RIE-iHa-Ras cells. Induction of Ha-RasVal12resulted in diffusion of stress fibers (compare Fig. 3 B,panels a and b). Treatment with LY-294002 restored well organized stress fibers (Fig. 3 B,panel c). Induction of oncogenic Ha-Ras also increased focal adhesion complexes, as determined by immunostaining for focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Normally, FAK was localized at the ends of stress fibers (Fig. 3 B, panel d), but, following induction of Ras, the proteins diffusely accumulated in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 B, panel e). Treatment with LY-294002 restored the FAK expression to the similar pattern in uninduced RIE-iHa-Ras cells (Fig. 3 B,panel f). The rate of cell turnover is determined by the balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Akt/PKB activity is known to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation (3Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate whether Akt/PKB activity was required for the growth of Ras-transformed RIE cells, their growth rates following different treatments were determined. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 A, when uninduced RIE-iHa-Ras cells reached confluence (at day 6), further growth was inhibited by cell-cell contact. Induction of oncogenic Ras significantly increased the cell density, and at the end of the experiment, the number of Ras-induced cells was 2.3-fold greater than the number of uninduced RIE-iHa-Ras cells. Both PD-98059 (50 μm) and LY-294002 (20 μm) completely blocked Ras-induced growth stimulation. LY-294002 inhibited the growth of Ras-transformed RIE-iHa-Ras cells in a concentration-dependent manner and reduced the cell number by 35%, 55%, and 76% at 5, 10, and 20 μm respectively (Fig. 4 B). Next, we determined the effect of Akt/PKB on cell cycle regulation using flow cytometry. Induction of Ha-RasVal12 accelerated the G1/S transition (Fig. 4 C). Addition of LY-294002 led to an accumulation of Ras-induced RIE-iHa-Ras cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, treatment with PD-98059 barely altered cell cycle progression in these cells. Growth inhibition that resulted from blocking the activation of Akt/PKB was also observed when RIE-iHa-Ras cells were grown in an anchorage-independent manner. Induction of oncogenic Ras led RIE-iHa-Ras cells to form colonies in soft agarose, and both PD-98059 and LY-294002 reduced the colony number by > 80% (Fig.5 A). To confirm that the growth-inhibitory effect of LY-294002 was mediated through inhibition of Akt/PKB activity, a structurally unrelated PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, was employed. Both 0.1 and 1 μm wortmannin reduced the number of Ras-induced RIE-iHa-Ras colonies by >50%. To further elucidate the mechanism by which Akt/PKB regulates cell cycle progression, we analyzed the regulation of cell cycle proteins in RIE-iHa-Ras cells. Induction of oncogenic Ras increased levels of cyclin D1 and CDK2, but had less of an effect on expression of CDK4, cyclin E, and p27kip (Fig.6 A). Treatment with LY-294002 inhibited the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B), and 20 μm LY-294002 completely blocked the Ras-induced expression of cyclin D1 and CDK2. LY-294002 also increased the expression of p27kip. In contrast, treatment with PD-98059 blocked Ras-induced expression of cyclin D1 and increased the levels of p27kip but did not inhibit the Ras-mediated induction of CDK2. PI3K/Akt/PKB is thought to represent an oncogenic signaling pathway. In the present study, we demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of Akt/PKB significantly inhibited the Ras-induced transformation in RIE-iHa-Ras cells. It was important to determine whether Akt/PKB truly contributes to Ras-mediated transformation of intestinal epithelial cells. Oldhamet al. (30Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ectopic expression of active Raf (ΔRaf-22W) was not sufficient to transform RIE cells. We stably transfected the RIE/ΔRaf-22W cells with an expression vector containing myristoylated form Akt (Akt-myr). The vector-transfected RIE/ΔRaf-22W cells did not form colonies in soft agarose (Fig.7 A). In contrast, the RIE cells that expressed both ΔRaf-22W and Akt-myr grew in an anchorage-independent fashion. None of the clones that were selected from vector-transfected cells grew in soft agarose, whereas 50% of the clones isolated from Akt-myr-transfected RIE/ΔRaf-22W cells formed colonies in soft agarose. To confirm the finding that ectopic expression of both active Raf kinase and Akt kinase was sufficient to cause RIE cell transformation, we first transfected the parental RIE-1 cells with an Akt-myr expression vector and found that this did not result in a significant phenotypic alteration. Interestingly, introduction of a constitutively active Raf mutant, Raf BXB (35Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1636-1640PubMed Google Scholar), into the Akt-myr-transfected RIE cells resulted in morphological transformation of these cells. The morphological appearance of RIE/Akt-myr/Raf BXB cells was similar to Ha-RasVal12-transformed RIE cells with a spindly appearance and overlapping growth (Fig. 7 B, upper panels). RIE/Akt-myr/Raf BXB cells grew in soft agarose and formed colonies that were relatively smaller than the colonies formed by RIE-RasVal12 cells (Fig. 7 B,bottom panels). Previous reports indicate that an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent autocrine growth loop is required for Ras-mediated transformation (36Oldham S.M. Cox A.D. Reynolds E.R. Sizemore N.S. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Sizemore N. Cox A.D. Barnard J.A. Oldham S.M. Reynolds E.R. Der C.J. Coffey R.J. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 567-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TGFα levels were increased in Ras-induced RIE-iHa-Ras cells and treatment with LY-294002 abolished Ras induction of TGFα (Fig. 7 C, upper panel). The expression of TGFα was elevated in RIE/ΔRaf-22W cells and co-expression of ΔRaf-22W and Akt-myr further increased the level of TGFα in RIE cells (Fig. 7 C,lower panel). Treatment with an EGFR inhibitor (1 μm of PD-153035) for 48 h almost completely reversed the transformed appearance of RIE/ΔRaf-22W/Akt-myr cells (Fig.7 D). PD-153035-treated RIE/ΔRaf-22W/Akt-myr cells acquired a cuboidal appearance, and cell-cell contact inhibition was restored in these cells. As expected, PD-98059 (50 μm) reversed the transformed morphology of RIE/ΔRaf-22W/Akt-myr cells by 24 h. A previous study by Oldham et al. (36Oldham S.M. Cox A.D. Reynolds E.R. Sizemore N.S. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reports that Ras(12V/35S) and Ras(12V/37G) mutants that have an impaired ability to activate PI3K are able to transform RIE cells, suggesting that activation of PI3K is not required for Ras-mediated transformation. Our data reported here clearly demonstrate that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in RIE cell transformation following induction of oncogenic Ha-RasVal12. Inhibition of Akt/PKB activity following treatment with LY-294002 exerted a complex anti-neoplastic effect on Ras-expressing intestinal epithelial cells, which included stimulation of apoptosis, reversal of morphological transformation, and accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. It is generally accepted that LY-294002, at low concentrations (5–20 μm), specifically targets PI3K activity (34Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that both LY-294002 and wortmannin (a structurally unrelated PI3K inhibitor) significantly blocked the Ha-RasVal12-mediated transformation indicates that PI3K was the likely target of these compounds in RIE-iHa-Ras cells (reviewed in Refs. 38Ward S.G.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt pathway is known to be oncogenic in other circumstances. Ectopic expression of active Akt/PKB leads to transformation of NIH 3T3 and chicken embryo fibroblasts (17Cheng J.Q. Altomare D.A. Klein M.A. Lee W.C. Kruh G.D. Lissy N.A. Testa J.R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6151-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, suppresses tumor formation by restraining the PI3K/Akt pathway (Refs. 19Sun H. Lesche R. Li D.M. Liliental J. Zhang H. Gao J.

Several reports indicate that expression of wild type PTENthat down-regulates Akt/PKB activity results in G1 growth arrest (19Sun H. Lesche R. Li D.M. Liliental J. Zhang H. Gao J. Gavrilova N.

Interestingly, a high incidence of aberrant transcripts of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene has been observed in colorectal neoplasia (40Chang J.G. Chen Y.J. Perng L.I. Wang N.M. Kao M.C. Yang T.Y. Chang C.P. Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 647-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that Akt activity might play some role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Mounting evidence suggests that Akt/PKB mediates growth factor-induced cell survival and blocks programmed cell death (11Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 12Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Induction of oncogenic Ras promoted cell survival and resulted in loss of contact inhibition. We sought to determine which Ras effector was responsible for this effect and found that, in Ras-induced RIE-iHa-Ras cells, inhibition of Akt/PKB activity only partially restored the effect on programmed cell death, whereas inhibition of ERK activity completely blocked the Ras-induced increase in cell survival. On the other hand, Akt/PKB appears to play an extremely important role in cell cycle progression. Inhibition of Akt/PKB activity led to an accumulation of RIE-iHa-Ras cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This effect was not observed in PD-98059-treated RIE-iHa-Ras cells. These findings suggest that Akt/PKB activity might play a role in overcoming cell cycle blocks that are necessary to prevent cells from uncontrolled proliferation and eventual transformation. Progression through the mid to late G1 phase of the mammalian cell cycle is dependent upon the cyclin D1-mediated activation of CDK4 or the related CDK6 (41Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4975) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that cyclin D1 is regulated via the Ras signaling pathway. Activation of ERK1 and ERK2 up-regulates cyclin D1 (42Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that cyclin D1 is also regulated by the Akt/PKB pathway at both the transcriptional (43Gille H. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22033-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and post-transcriptional levels (44Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29864-29872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Akt/PKB stabilizes cyclin D1 protein through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β kinase (45Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). We recently reported that induction of Ras activates Akt, inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and increases the level of cyclin D1 in RIE-iHa-Ras cells (31Shao J. Sheng H. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22916-22924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that inhibition of Akt/PKB completely blocked Ras-induced expression of cyclin D1, indicating that both ERK and Akt/PKB are essential for Ras-mediated induction of cyclin D1. Interestingly, forced expression of a stable mutant of cyclin D1 (T286A) (46Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) failed to override LY-294002-induced G1 growth arrest in RIE-iHa-Ras cells (data not shown). Treatment with PD-98059 decreased the levels of cyclin D1 to a similar extent but did not cause growth arrest at the G1 phase, suggesting that inhibition of cyclin D1 alone is not sufficient for LY-294002-induced G1 growth arrest. G1-S transition also requires the activity of cyclin E/CDK2 which accelerates the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein initiated by the cyclin D/CDK complex and prevents its inhibition of transcription factors (including the E2Fs). In the present study, we found that induction of oncogenic Ras increased the levels of CDK2, which was dependent on the activation of Akt/PKB, but not MEK/ERK activity. p27kip, which represses the activity of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex, is thought to be directly involved in restriction point control (47Polyak K.

Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) demonstrated that expression of AFX-like forkhead transcription factors blocks cell cycle progression at the G1 phase through up-regulation of p27kip. Activation of Akt/PKB results in phosphorylation of AFX and FKHR-L1 and a reduction of p27kip expression. In agreement with previous findings, we observed that inhibition of Akt/PKB resulted in growth arrest at the G1 phase, which was associated with an increased expression of p27kip in RIE-iHa-Ras cells. Oncogenic mutations in ras result in activation of multiple downstream signaling proteins including Raf/MEK/ERKs (50McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet.

These findings suggest that downstream effectors that are required for Ras-induced transformation are cell type-dependent and that additional Raf-independent pathway(s) are required to complete Ras-mediated morphological and growth transformation in intestinal epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that ectopic expression of activated Akt/PKB did not cause significant phenotypic alterations in intestinal epithelial cells; however, expression of both active Raf and active Akt is sufficient to induce transformation of RIE cells. Our data suggest that, in cooperation with Raf, PI3K/Akt signaling promoted the EGFR-dependent autocrine growth loop that is thought to be essential for the morphological transformation of RIE cells (36Oldham S.M.

Although it has been shown that Raf may be activated by Akt (57Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), there is no evidence to support direct activation of PI3K/Akt signaling by the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, suggesting that they play different roles in Ras-mediated transformation. Indeed, we observed that the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway predominantly enhances cell survival and that the PI3K/Akt pathway predominantly promotes loss of contact inhibition of cell growth. Since ras mutations are found in a wide variety of human malignancies and in 50% of colorectal adenocarcinomas (26Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar), our results are of particular interest in understanding the changes in molecular signaling pathways that occur during colorectal carcinogenesis and may have clinical significance by providing additional therapeutic targets. protein kinase B rat intestinal epithelial phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside epidermal growth factor receptor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline transforming growth factor cyclin-dependent kinase"

Numerous viruses have been reported to escape from apoptotic mechanism to maintain persistent infection. In the present study, we characterized the effect of HCV proteins on the Fas signal using HCV transgenic mice, which expressed core, E1, E2, and NS2 proteins, regulated by the Cre/loxP switching system. The transgene expression of HCV transgenic mice caused resistance to Fas antibody stimulated lethality. Apoptotic cell death in the liver of HCV protein expressing mice was significantly reduced compared with nonexpressing mice. Histopathological analysis and DNA fragmentation analysis revealed that the HCV proteins suppressed Fas-mediated apoptotic cell death. To identify the target pathway of HCV proteins, we characterized caspase activity. The activation of caspase-9 and -3/7 but not caspase-8 was inhibited by HCV proteins. Cytochromec release from mitochondria was inhibited in HCV protein expressing mice. These results indicated that the expression of HCV proteins may directly or indirectly inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis and death in mice by repressing the release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria, thereby suppressing caspase-9 and -3/7 activation. These results suggest that HCV may cause persistent infection, as a result of suppression of Fas-mediated cell death.

The expression of HCV proteins is reported to influence apoptosis. HCV proteins have been variously found to suppress or activate anti-Fas antibody and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mediated cell death (1Ray B.R. Meyer K. Ray R.

Chiba T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tai D. Tsai S. Chen Y. Chuang Y. Peng C. Sheen I. Yeh C. Chang K. Huang S. Kuo G. Liaw Y.

The effects of cell death by HCV proteins are not fully understood because several discrepancies have been observed in the activation and repression of Fas or TNF-α related cell death. A transgenic mouse model using a stable expression system causes immunotolerance to transgene products. Therefore, an HCV protein switching expression system may be suitable for in vivoassay of HCV protein effects. Using the Cre/loxP system, we developed a transgenic mouse model with efficient conditional transgene activation of HCV cDNA (core, E1, E2, and NS2) (8Wakita T. Taya C. Katsume A. Kato J. Yonekawa H. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Hayashi Y. Koike M. Kohara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9001-9006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HCV proteins were mainly detected in the liver of conditionally expressing transgenic mice. These methods allowed us to investigate the importance of HCV proteins in apoptotic signaling pathways by the conditional expression of HCV proteins in vivo. Fas-mediated cell death appears to induce hepatic injury (9Kondo T. Suda T. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Fas-mediated liver injury is likely to play a critical role in some forms of immune-mediated hepatitis. It has become evident that activated T lymphocytes have the ability to kill Fas-bearing targets through membrane expression of Fas ligand (Fas-L) (10Nagata S. Goldstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar). Experimental liver injury models have demonstrated the important roles of this molecule: intraperitoneal administration of agonistic anti-Fas antibodies damages the liver by massive hepatocyte apoptosis, with (11Ogasawara J.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 307-316Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The involvement of the Fas/Fas-L system has been shown in many injury models (10Nagata S. Goldstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar). In addition, involvement of the Fas/Fas-L system in liver homeostasis was suggested by a report that Fas-deficient mice show substantial liver hyperplasia (13Adachi M. Suematsu S. Kondo T. Ogasawara J. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Nagata S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The Fas protein CD95 is a homotrimeric molecule and Fas-L causes clustering of the Fas death domains. An adapter protein called FADD then binds through its own death domain to the clustered receptor death domains (14Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Upon recruitment by FADD, caspase-8 is activated through self-cleavage and oligomerization (15Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 then activates downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3/7 (16Jones R.A. Johnson V.L. Buck N.R. Dobrota M. Hinton R.H. Chow S.C. Kass G.E.N. Hepatol. 1998; 27: 1632-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 family proteins play a pivotal role in controlling cell life and death, with some members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, inhibiting apoptosis, and others such as Bax, inducing cell death (17Tujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we establish an experimental system in which the effects of HCV protein on Fas-mediated apoptosis can be examined. Some of the potential target pathways of HCV proteins are also characterized. HCV transgenic mice CN2 (BALB/c, 9–13 weeks old) were used in experiments. The CN2 transgenic mouse is the HCV genotype 1b transgenic mouse regulated by the Cre/loxP conditional switching system (8Wakita T. Taya C. Katsume A. Kato J. Yonekawa H. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Hayashi Y. Koike M. Kohara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9001-9006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). AxCANCre and AxCAw1 recombinant adenoviruses were replication-deficient, lacking the E1A, E1B, and E3 regions (18Kanegae Y. Takamori K. Sato Y. Lee G. Nakai M. Saito I. Gene ( Amst .). 1996; 181: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). AxCANCre expressed recombinase Cre, and AxCAw1, which was used as the control adenovirus, lacked the insertedcre gene. AxCANCre or AxCAw1 (2 × 109 pfu) were intravenously injected into transgenic or nontransgenic female mice between 9 and 13 weeks of age. The CN2-8 mice were intravenously injected with AxCANCre and AxCAw1 virus and killed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days after the injection. The liver tissue was stained with anti-core polyclonal antibody RR8 using TSA direct method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Four days after the inoculation of recombinant adenovirus, mice were administered anti-Fas antibody (clone Jo2; PharMingen) intravenously, at a dose of 0.14 μg/g. The animals (6–10 mice) were observed for mortality over 24 h, and sacrificed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after anti-Fas antibody administration for liver histology and biochemical studies. Animal care was in accordance with institutional guidelines. Mouse liver was homogenized in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl). HCV core protein concentration of the liver lysates was quantified by fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (FEIA) (19Kashiwakuma T. Hasegawa A. Kajita T. Takata A. Mori H. Ohta Y. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Tanaka T. Tanaka S. Hattori N. Kohara M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 190: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The FEIA is based on two high-affinity monoclonal antibodies directed against the HCV core protein. These two monoclonal antibodies, 5E3 and 5F11, recognize amino acids 21–40 and 41–60, respectively. These pretreated samples were added to EIA tubes precoated with monoclonal antibody 5F11. The tube was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Monoclonal antibody 5E3 conjugated to β-d-galactosidase was added after washing with buffers, and the mixture was incubated for 9 min at 37 °C. 4-Methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactopyranoside was used as a substrate. After incubation for 9 min at 37 °C, the relative fluorescence intensity was determined using a fluorometer after addition of 0.1 m glycine-NaOH (pH 10.3). HCV core protein concentration in the liver samples was divided by the total protein concentration and expressed as nanograms/mg of total protein. Blood samples were collected from the supra orbital veins at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h after Fas antibody administration or heart puncturing of sacrificed mice, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were assayed by enzyme reaction with Transnase Nissui kit (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan). The cytosolic fraction of liver tissues was isolated as previously reported, with partial modification (20Chandler J.M. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10815-10818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, liver tissue was homogenized in a Dounce glass homogenizer (loose type) with lysis buffer (0.3 m mannitol, 5 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm KH2PO4, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and fractionated into pellet, heavy membrane, light membrane, and cytosolic fractions. The lysates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris or fiber. The supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the pellets collected as the heavy membrane fraction. The supernatants were again centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C and collected as the cytosolic fraction. The activities of caspase-8, -9, and -3/7 were measured using Ac-LETD-AFC, Ac-LQTD-AFC, Ac-LEHD-AFC, or Ac-DEVD-AFC (Enzyme Systems Products) as substrates, respectively. Substrates were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in reaction buffer composed of 20 μm substrate, 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.5), and 0.1% CHAPS (21MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). After preincubation, 100 μg of lysate was added to 1.25 ml of reaction buffer and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence of released 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) was detected by a fluorescence spectrometer (model F2000; Hitachi). Excitation wavelength was 400 nm and emission wavelength was 505 nm. Specific caspase-3/7 or -8 activity was determined by subtracting the values obtained in the presence of 10 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO or Ac-IETD-CHO (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan), inhibitors of caspase-3/7 or -8, respectively. One unit corresponds to the activity required to cleave 1 pmol of the substrate in 60 min. The liver was perfused with phosphate-buffered saline(−) at 37 °C through the portal vein to remove monocytes, sectioned, and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liver tissue was homogenized in a Dounce glass homogenizer using five complete up and down cycles of a glass loose-type pestle in a homogenate buffer composed of 1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 1 × complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and used as liver lysate. Lysates (30 or 50 μg) were separated via 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Tris Tricine buffer (Daiichi Pure Chemicals) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was incubated in blocking buffer composed of 5% skim milk in TBST (20 mmTris (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) followed by primary antibody; anti-Caspase-8 (T-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Bcl-XL (S-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bid (R&D Systems), Bax (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bcl-2 (4C-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Bad (New England Biolabs, Inc.). Liver tissue was minced and washed once in ice-cold homogenizing buffer composed of 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EGTA, 300 mmsucrose, 5 mm MOPS, 5 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.4), and 1 × complete inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The minced liver was gently homogenized in the homogenate buffer in a Dounce glass homogenizer using five complete up and down cycles of a glass loose-type pestle (22Gross A. Yin X. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet, representing the heavy membrane fraction, was washed once with homogenization buffer and denatured with SDS sample buffer (67 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). The protein concentration of the lysates was measured using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad DC protein assay). Lysates (30 μg) were electrophoresed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Tris Tricine Buffer (Daiichi Pure Chemicals), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST. The membrane was washed with TBST for 5 min and incubated with anti-cytochromec rabbit polyclonal antibody 2F. Shibasaki, manuscript in preparation. in 5% skim milk in TBST for 16 h at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with TBST three times and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Life Science) for 2 h at room temperature. The signal was detected by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Histopathological analysis of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained tissue sections was undertaken. The liver tissues were frozen with O.C.T. compound (Tissue Tech) for immunohistochemical analysis. The sections were fixed with a 1:1 solution of acetone:methanol at −20 °C for 10 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline(−). Subsequently, the sections were incubated with the IgG fraction of an anti-HCV core rabbit polyclonal antibody (RR8) (8Wakita T. Taya C. Katsume A. Kato J. Yonekawa H. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Hayashi Y. Koike M. Kohara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9001-9006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in blocking buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. The sections were incubated with secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, for 2 h at room temperature. Immunohistochemical staining was completed using tyramide signal amplification (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For cytochrome c staining, the sections were incubated in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with rabbit anti-cytochrome c antibodies for 3 h at room temperature. The sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline(−). Primary antibodies were detected by Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (CAPPEL). Fluorescently labeled sections were stained with 0.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 dye (Molecular Probes) for 1 min at room temperature before coverslipping to stain cell nuclei. Fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cytofluorometry was performed by FACS Calibur (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Primary hepatocytes were stained with an optimal dilution of anti-Fas-FITC antibody (06134D, PharMingen, San Diego, CA), and examined by FACScan. Data represent the mean ± S.D. All statistical analysis was performed using Student's ttest. Statistical significance was established at p < 0.05. HCV proteins were expressed in the liver of HCV transgenic mice. Expression of core protein in AxCANCre adenovirus-injected CN2-8 transgenic mice liver was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Core protein was expressed in 50–60% of hepatocytes in the lobule of the liver section at day 4, and 70–80% of hepatocytes at 7 days after AxCANCre injection (Fig. 1 A). The genomic DNA was prepared from liver 4 or 5 days after the injection of adenovirus and analyzed by Southern blot analysis. Transgene recombination occurred in the livers of the transgenic mice (Data not shown). In contrast, core protein was not expressed in liver sections from transgenic mice without AxCANCre injection or in AxCAw1-injected CN2 mice (Fig. 1 A). The core protein levels in hepatocytes were measured by FEIA. The mean level of core protein was 5.7 ng/mg total protein in the HCV transgenic mice liver 4 days after the administration of AxCANCre adenovirus (Fig. 1 B). The expression of core, E1 and E2 proteins was detected in AxCANCre-injected mouse liver by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The livers of CN2 mice, 5 days after administration of AxCANCre and AxCAw1, did not show infiltration of mononuclear cells or an increase in serum ALT levels (Fig. 1 C). A significant liver injury was not evoked until day 5. Therefore, 4 days after the administration of AxCANCre or AxCAw1 was a suitable time point to characterize the effect of HCV proteins on Fas-mediated cell death. Mice not expressing HCV were treated with 0.14 μg/g mice body weight of anti-Fas antibody, which killed 50% of the mice over the initial 24 h (n = 6). In contrast, all of the HCV protein expressing transgenic mice were resistant to Fas stimulated lethality over the initial 24 h (Fig.2 A). Another transgenic mice strain, CN2-29 (8Wakita T. Taya C. Katsume A. Kato J. Yonekawa H. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Hayashi Y. Koike M. Kohara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9001-9006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was also analyzed to better understand the effects of the transgene integration site. CN2-29 mice expressed an average of 0.54 μg/mg core protein on day 4 after AxCANCre administration. Ten of the AxCAw1 adenovirus-injected CN2-29 mice were administered 0.14 μg/g anti-Fas antibody and observed for 24 h (Fig.2 B). Half of the AxCAw1 adenovirus-infected CN2-29 mice died. In contrast, 80% of the AxCANCre adenovirus-injected CN2-29 mice survived after the administration of anti-Fas antibody (n = 10). To investigate the effects of adenovirus, AxCANCre and AxCAw1 adenovirus-injected nontransgenic BALB/c mice were administered 0.14 μg/g anti-Fas antibody. Within 24 h of administration, 50% AxCAw1 and 50% AxCANCre injected nontransgenic BALB/c mice died (n = 10) (Fig. 2 C). Expression of HCV proteins appeared to inhibit the progression of death after the injection of anti-Fas antibody. Serum ALT levels dramatically increased within 3 h of injection of the anti-Fas antibody in AxCAw1-injected CN2-8 mice (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, significantly lower ALT levels were observed in HCV protein expressing CN2-8 transgenic mice 3 and 6 h after injection of the anti-Fas antibody (p = 0.0352, and p = 0.0266 respectively). Liver tissue of anti-Fas antibody-treated mice was sampled from 0 to 4 h after the intravenous injection for histological examination (Fig. 3 B). Four h after the anti-Fas antibody injection, hepatic injury was observed predominantly in the liver of mice not expressing HCV proteins (Fig. 3 B) and fragmented nuclei were observed in over 80% of the hepatocytes. In contrast, histological analysis of livers from HCV protein expressing transgenic mice revealed that liver injury was suppressed and cell death was far less prevalent than in the liver of mice not expressing HCV proteins (Fig.3 B). The nuclear shrinkage and fragmentation observed in hepatic cell death resembled apoptotic cell death. Therefore, DNA fragmentation was assessed in the livers of anti-Fas antibody injected mice by genomic DNA laddering. Ladder formation was much more moderate in the HCV protein expressing transgenic hepatocytes than in the hepatocytes in the HCV-nonexpressing mice at 5, 6, 8, and 12 h after the injection of anti-Fas antibody (Fig.4). These findings indicate that expression of HCV proteins inhibited the progress of apoptotic hepatocyte death caused by anti-Fas antibody injection. To clarify the mechanism of Fas-mediated apoptosis inhibition by HCV proteins, expression of Fas antigen on hepatocytes and activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3/7 proteases were examined in liver samples. Four h after the administration of anti-Fas antibody, Fas protein levels in hepatocytes and expression on the cell surface did not differ significantly between HCV-positive and HCV-negative mice (Fig. 5, A andB). Caspase-8 was similarly activated within 1 h in both HCV-negative and HCV-positive transgenic mice treated with anti-Fas antibody (Fig.6). The active form of the caspase-8 subunit (p18) appeared within 1 h after anti-Fas antibody injection (Fig. 6 A). No significant difference was observed in p18 patterns between HCV protein expressing and nonexpressing CN2-8 mice (Fig. 6 A). To determine the activity of caspase-8, -9, and -3/7, the fluorogenic substrates with the cleavage site by each caspase were used. The results were consistent with the results from Western blot analysis (Fig. 6 A). Caspase-8 was similarly activated in the liver tissue of HCV protein expressing and nonexpressing mice within 1 h after anti-Fas antibody injection (Fig. 6 B). HCV proteins expression did not repress substrate cleavage activity by caspase-8 as shown by the substrate cleavage assay using both Ac-LETD-AFC and Ac-LQTD-AFC, which are the known cleavage sites of Bid (22Gross A. Yin X. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). After 3 and 4 h of Fas antibody administration, caspase-8 activity decreased in liver tissues from mice not expressing HCV proteins (Fig. 6 B). The results suggested that the greater damage to liver tissue observed in mice not expressing HCV proteins contributed to the decrease in caspase-8 activity itself in HCV-negative livers. In contrast, activation of caspase-3/7 and -9 was suppressed in HCV protein expressing liver tissue, 3 and 4 h after antibody administration (Fig. 6 B). The inhibitory mechanism of Fas-mediated cell death by HCV genome expression was analyzed further. We examined expression levels of the Bcl-2 protein family, which localize in the mitochondria and regulate the progression of apoptotic cell death. Bcl-2 family protein level, including Bid, Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, Bad, and Bax was analyzed by immunoblot (Fig. 7, A and B). Caspase-8 activity of Bid cleavage was not inhibited by HCV proteins. Translocation of the C-terminal of Bid protein into mitochondria was not repressed by HCV proteins 4 h after the administration of anti-Fas antibody in HCV transgenic mice (Fig. 7 A). Bcl-2 protein increased gradually after the administration of anti-Fas antibody in liver tissue of both HCV protein expressing and nonexpressing mice (Fig. 7 B). Bcl-XL protein was consistently expressed in liver tissue of HCV protein expressing mice after 3 h (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, the Bcl-XL protein decreased to the basal level over 3 h in nonexpressing mouse liver tissue (Fig. 7 B). HCV protein did not contribute to the degradation of Bad protein after anti-Fas antibody-mediated cell death. Bax was consistently expressed even after the administration of anti-Fas antibody in both HCV protein expressing and nonexpressing mice. Bax protein level was analyzed by Western blot in four fractions, including the soluble, light membrane, heavy membrane (mitochondria rich), and low speed pellet fractions in liver lysates taken 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after the administration of anti-Fas antibody. Bax protein translocated similarly from the cytosolic fraction to the mitochondria-rich fraction within 1 h of the administration of anti-Fas antibody in both HCV nonexpressing and expressing mice (Fig.7 C). This translocation of Bax has also been reported in some cell lines (23Wolter K.G. Hsu Y. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). To clarify HCV mediated-inhibitory mechanisms on the Apaf-1/caspase-9 amplification loop, the distribution pattern of cytochrome c was examined by immunohistochemistry. The originally prepared anti-cytochrome cantibody 3F. Shibasaki et al., manuscript in preparation. strongly detected cytochrome c in cytoplasm released from mitochondria, and weakly detected cytochrome c in mitochondria in a spotty pattern. Liver sections of pretreated mice showed a spotty staining pattern in the cytoplasm (Fig.8 A). Immunoreactivity of cytoplasmic cytochrome c increased in HCV-negative hepatocytes after 4 h of Fas antibody administration (Fig.8 A), reflecting the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. In contrast, staining of cytochrome c was much weaker in HCV protein expressing hepatocytes (Fig. 8 A). Therefore, HCV protein inhibited the release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria. To further examine the localization of cytochrome c, the liver lysates were fractionated by centrifugation into supernatant, heavy membrane, and nuclear fractions. The heavy membrane fraction was a mitochondria-rich fraction that contained cytochrome c, as indicated by immunoblot analysis with anti-cytochrome cantibody (Fig. 8 B). The mitochondrial fraction of liver tissue was collected 0, 1, 3, and 4 h after anti-Fas antibody administration from both HCV protein expressing and nonexpressing mice. The quantity of cytochrome c in the heavy membrane fraction of HCV protein expressing mice liver after 4 h of Fas antibody administration was not significantly reduced compared with HCV nonexpressing mice (Fig. 8 B). Hence, the cytoplasmic fraction after both 3 and 4 h in HCV protein expressing mice liver had 3–4-fold decrease of cytochrome c than that of hepatocytes in HCV nonexpressing mice (Fig. 8 C). These results indicated that the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm in hepatocytes was suppressed by HCV protein expression. A part of the defense mechanism against virus infection is induced to initiate apoptotic cell death by signals delivered from CTL. On the other hand, numerous viruses have been reported to escape from apoptotic mechanism to maintain persistent infection (24Derfuss T. Fickenscher H. Kraft M.S. Henning G. Lengenfelder D.

Moreover, NF-κB has an antiapoptotic function against anti-Fas antibody and TNF-α-induced cell death. It was recently shown that HCV core protein activated NF-κB-associated signal (5Marusawa H. Hijikata M. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tai D. Tsai S. Chen Y. Chuang Y. Peng C. Sheen I. Yeh C. Chang K. Huang S. Kuo G. Liaw Y.

Hepatology. 2000; 32: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It may be that the core has multifunctional roles in the apoptotic signaling. This discrepancy may be explained by the possibility that it was caused by using established cell lines and clonically selected permanent transfectant cells in the previous studies. To avoid the artificial effects in cell lines and transgenic mouse with persistent expression of HCV protein, we examined the transgenic mouse using conditional transgene expression system (8Wakita T. Taya C. Katsume A. Kato J. Yonekawa H. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Hayashi Y. Koike M. Kohara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9001-9006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These hepatocytes of transgenic mouse retain original sensitivity to the apoptosis mediated by Fas signal. The conditional transgene expressed mouse makes it possible to examine native effect of HCV protein to Fas-mediated apoptosis. The results of the present study revealed that Fas-mediated apoptotic cell death was suppressed by the expression of HCV proteins (core, E1, E2, and NS2) in vivo. In the presence of HCV proteins, lethality after the administration of anti-Fas antibody significantly decreased (Fig. 2). The survival rate correlated to HCV protein expression levels in transgenic mice (CN2-8 and 2-29) (Fig. 2,A and B). These results revealed that apoptosis was inhibited by HCV protein expression, as shown by DNA ladder examination of mouse liver (Fig. 4). Expression of Fas on the surface of hepatocytes did not differ significantly among AxCANCre- or AxCAw1-injected mice and untreated mice (Fig. 5). Therefore, the downstream target of Fas signaling pathway was characterized. Many caspases were involved in the downstream of Fas signaling pathway (Fig. 9). Each caspase has a specific function, for example, as an initiator or effector. The initial caspase-8 cascade was activated in both HCV protein expressing mice and nonexpressing mice (Fig. 6, A and B). Caspase-9 and -3/7 activities were down-regulated in liver tissue of HCV protein expressing mice (Fig. 6). Apoptosis of hepatocytes requires effector caspases such as caspase-3/7 (16Jones R.A.

Patterson B.J. Mak T.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that caspase-9 and -3/7 activation were inhibited by HCV proteins and/or that the mitochondria amplification loop of the Fas-mediated signaling pathway is inhibited by HCV proteins (Fig. 9). Bcl-2 family proteins are involved in progression of apoptotic cell death in response to Fas signal (30Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Bid is likely the activator of the mitochondrial pathway through cleavage by caspase-8 and translocation into the mitochondria. Bid then interacts with Bcl-2 and/or Bax protein causing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm (31Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 32Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). In the present study, distribution of Bid protein in the cytosol and heavy membrane fraction did not differ significantly between HCV protein expressing and nonexpressing mice (Fig. 7 A). Therefore, the Bid pathway was not influenced by HCV protein. Bcl-2, Bad, and Bax protein quantities did not differ between HCV protein expressing and nonexpressing mice (Fig. 7, A and B). On the other hand, in the presence of HCV protein, Bcl-XL protein did not decrease 3 and 4 h after the administration of Fas antibody. This may have resulted from the down-regulation of caspase-3/7 activity (Fig.7 A) (16Jones R.A. Johnson V.L. Buck N.R. Dobrota M. Hinton R.H. Chow S.C. Kass G.E.N. Hepatol. 1998; 27: 1632-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Woo M. Hakem A. Elia A.J. Hakem R. Duncan G.S. Patterson B.J. Mak T.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the Bcl-2 family may not be significantly influenced by HCV proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis of affected liver regions confirmed the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria of HCV nonexpressing mice and expressing mice by anti-Fas antibody administration. The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to cytoplasm was suppressed in the HCV protein expressing mice liver compared with the HCV nonexpressing mice liver (Fig.8 A). Consistent with this result, cytochrome creleased 5.2–6.6-fold increase from heavy membrane fraction to cytoplasmic fraction in the HCV nonexpressing liver tissue after 3 and 4 h of Fas antibody administration (Fig. 8, B andC). In contrast, cytochrome c was mainly present in the heavy membrane fraction, and the release of cytochromec from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm was suppressed in the presence of HCV after 3 and 4 h of Fas antibody administration (Fig. 8, B and C). These results indicated that the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm was inhibited by the expression of HCV proteins in transgenic mice. The inhibition of the activation of effector caspase-3/7 resulted from the suppression of the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 amplification loop by HCV and decreased lethality after Fas antibody administration. Further experiments are needed to determine whether the inhibition of cytochrome c from mitochondoria is due to the direct interaction of particular HCV proteins with a cellular protein. Or, it is possible that the interaction of expression of HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins may induce a more general cellular response, stimulating chaperones and delaying the entry into apoptosis (33Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 34Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Meriin A.B. Sherman M.Y. Morimoto R.I. Massie B. Mol. Cell.

Two forms of C/EBPβ, liver-activating protein (LAP) and liver inhibitory protein (LIP), are dephosphorylated in GH-treated 3T3-F442A fibroblasts. GH-induced dephosphorylation of LAP and LIP is reduced when cells are preincubated with phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. GH activates Akt and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Lithium, a GSK-3 inhibitor, increases GH-dependent dephosphorylation of LAP and LIP. Both arein vitro substrates of GSK-3, suggesting that GSK-3 inactivation contributes to GH-promoted dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ. Alkaline phosphatase increases binding of LAP homodimers and decreases binding of LIP homodimers to c-fos, suggesting that dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ modifies their ability to bind DNA. Both alkaline phosphatase- and GH-mediated dephosphorylation comparably increase binding of endogenous LAP in 3T3-F442A cells. In cells overexpressing LAP and GSK-3, LAP binding decreases, suggesting that GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation interferes with LAP binding. Expression of constitutively active GSK-3 reduced GH-stimulated c-fos promoter activity. These studies indicate that PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 mediates signaling between GH receptor and the nucleus, promoting dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ.

The CCAAT/Enhancer-Binding Proteins (C/EBPs) have recently been shown to participate in GH-regulated transcription of c-fos (14Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L. MacDougald O.A.

C/EBPs, which include C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, C/EBPε, and C/EBPζ/CHOP, belong to the bZIP family of transcription factors characterized by a C-terminal dimerization domain (leucine zipper) adjacent to a basic DNA binding domain. The N-terminal region of C/EBPs contains the transcription activation and inhibitory domains. C/EBPβ, the prominent GH-regulated form (14Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L.

The 32- and 35-kDa forms of C/EBPβ, also known as liver-activating proteins (LAP), are potent transactivators. The 20-kDa form of C/ΕBPβ, known as liver inhibitory protein (LIP), possesses a truncated transactivation domain and inhibits transcription (15Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). LIP inhibits the transactivating potential of LAP, even at relatively low molar ratios (15Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that overexpression of LIP in hepatocytes overcomes LAP-mediated cell cycle arrest (16Buck M. Turler H. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the adipocyte differentiation program, C/EBPβ appears to play an important role in the transition between cell cycle progression and terminal differentiation (17Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L.

GH increases the binding of C/ΕBPβ and C/EBPδ to the c-fos C/EBP site, which lies −295 to −303 bp relative to the transcription start site, and overlaps the c-fos serum response element (SRE) (14Liao J.

GH promotes a rapid and transient dephosphorylation of LAP and LIP in 3T3-F442A cells, in addition to increasing binding of C/EBPβ to the C/EBP site in c-fos(14Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E.

It is well established that modulation of target gene expression can be achieved through regulation of the phosphorylation state of transcription factors, which can positively or negatively alter their DNA binding affinity and/or their capacity to activate gene transcription (20Hunter T.

The focus of the present study was to identify signaling events by which GH regulates the dephosphorylation of LIP and LAP and to determine whether dephosphorylation of LAP and LIP modulates their ability to bind to DNA. These studies implicate PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 signaling in the regulation of the dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ by GH, thereby identifying PI3K as a signaling intermediate between the GH receptor and the nucleus. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that GH-induced dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ dramatically increases binding of LAP complexes to the c-fos promoter and may thereby modulate transcriptional activation of c-fos by C/EBPβ in response to GH. 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were provided by Dr. H.

An aliquot of the sample was subjected to immunoblot analysis to identify C/EBPβ in the immunoprecipitate. Confluent 3T3-F442A cells were deprived of serum overnight and incubated for the indicated times with hormone or vehicle as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (14Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol.

Complexes formed by LAP and/or LIP were separated by nondenaturing 7% PAGE followed by autoradiography. For analysis of LAP or LIP, 293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate coprecipitation (28Chen D. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4815) Google Scholar) with plasmids CMV-LAP (1 μg) or CMV-LIP (l μg) with or without CMV-GSK-3 S9A (8 μg). 48 h later, cell lysates enriched in nuclear proteins were prepared using high salt buffer (420 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 50% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture) and were stored at −80 °C. In some experiments, the enriched lysates were incubated with or without 200 units of alkaline phosphatase, in the presence or absence of orthovanadate (30 mm), for 1 h at 37 °C prior to EMSA or immunoblotting. CHO-GHR (1 × 105cells/35-mm well) were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (28Chen D. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4815) Google Scholar) with wt-fos-Luc (0.4 μg) and the RSV β-galactosidase plasmid (0.1 μg), with or without a plasmid encoding a constitutively active GSK-3 (GSK-3 S9A 0.8 μg), in the presence or absence of CMV-LAP DNA (1 ng) or corresponding amounts of pcDNA3.1 vector per 35-mm well. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were deprived of serum by incubation in medium containing 1% BSA for 18 h prior to treatment as indicated. Cell lysates were prepared in reporter lysis buffer (100 mmpotassium phosphate, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol), and luciferase or β-galactosidase activity was measured using an Opticomp luminometer. The luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Each condition was tested in duplicate or triplicate in each experiment. Analysis of variance with factorial Scheffe F test was used to analyze data as indicated. GH causes a rapid and transient dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ, as indicated by an increased mobility on SDS-PAGE (14Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31597-31604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GH is known to activate PI3K and MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 in several cell types, including 3T3-F442A fibroblasts (29Ridderstrale M. Tornqvist H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30VanderKuur J.A. Butch E.R. Waters S.B. Pessin J.E. Guan K.-L. Carter-Su C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6074-6080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate whether either of these signaling pathways mediates GH-regulated dephosphorylation of LAP and LIP, we tested the effect of PI3K or MEK inhibitors on the ability of GH to promote dephosphorylation of LAP and LIP. Treatment of the cells with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (30 min) prior to treatment with GH (60 min) markedly impaired the GH-promoted dephosphorylation of LIP (Fig. 1 A, band b, lane 4 versus lane 2) and LAP (not shown). Similar inhibition of GH-promoted dephosphorylation was obtained when cells were treated with LY294002, another PI3K inhibitor, prior to GH (Fig. 1 A, band b, lane 8 versus lane 6). Taken together these results suggest a role for PI3K in the GH-promoted dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD098059 (40 μm, 30 min) prior to GH did not interfere with the GH-promoted dephosphorylation of LIP and LAP (not shown), indicating that the MEK-ERK pathway is unlikely to be a major contributor to this response to GH. Similar changes in phosphorylation in response to GH were observed for LAP and LIP throughout these studies. Because activation of PI3K is known to lead to phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3, involvement of GSK-3 in GH-induced dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ was examined. Cells were pretreated with LiCl, a GSK-3 inhibitor (34Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar, 35Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which slightly increased the intensity of the rapidly migrating LIP band in control cells (Fig.1 B, band b, lane 3). Notably, the GH-dependent shift to the rapidly migrating form of LIP was further enhanced in the presence of LiCl (Fig. 1 B,band b, lane 4 versus lane 2), suggesting that inhibition of GSK-3 favors the presence of the dephosphorylated form of C/EBPβ. Treatment with LiCl increased dephosphorylation of LAP similarly to the increase observed for LIP in GH-treated and untreated cells. In contrast, neither wortmannin nor LiCl altered the pattern of phosphorylation of ERK-1 or -2 in the absence or presence of GH (data not shown), indicating that wortmannin and LiCl do not affect the MAPK pathway under the conditions of these experiments. These data are consistent with GH utilizing a PI3K pathway to modulate dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ and suggest that GSK-3 may be involved downstream of PI3K. Akt is a downstream effector of PI3K (36Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar, 37Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar, 38Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The ability of GH to stimulate phosphorylation of Akt was examined by immunoblotting, using an antibody that specifically recognizes a peptide of Akt phosphorylated on Ser-473 (anti-P-Akt). GH was found to increase the amount of Ser-phosphorylated Akt within 5 min (Fig. 2, A, B, andC, upper panels, lanes 1,2). The stimulation of Akt by GH subsided from 15 to 60 min (Fig. 2, A, B, and C, upper panels, lanes 3–6). The lower panels show total Akt. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin completely blocked the GH-stimulated activation of Akt (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7–12), consistent with GH-mediated activation of Akt being dependent on PI3K. When 3T3-F442A cells were pretreated with PD098059, the appearance of phosphorylated Akt in response to GH was not altered (Fig.2 B, lanes 7–12), suggesting that the MEK-ERK pathway is not involved in GH activation of Akt. Lithium, a GSK-3 inhibitor, also failed to alter Akt phosphorylation in response to GH (Fig. 2 C, lanes 7–12), as expected, because GSK-3 lies downstream of Akt. Taken together, these results indicate that, in 3T3-F442A cells, GH promotes phosphorylation and activation of Akt downstream of PI3K. GSK-3 activity is inhibited by growth factors that activate PI3K and Akt in several cell types (39Cross M.J. Stewart A. Hodgkin M.N. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25352-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 40Hurel S.J. Rockford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Wells A.M. Vandenheede J.R. Turnbull D.M. Yeaman S.J.

GSK-3 is inactivated when it is phosphorylated downstream of Akt (39Cross M.J. Stewart A. Hodgkin M.N. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25352-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Hence, it would be predicted that activation of Akt by GH would be associated with inhibition of GSK-3. The activity of GSK-3 was measured by its ability to phosphorylate a synthetic peptide containing a GSK-3 consensus sequence in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (42Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14063-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Treatment of 3T3-F442A cells with GH resulted in a 30–40% inhibition of GSK-3 activity within 15 min (Fig.3 A). The GH-mediated inhibition of GSK-3 was transient, and GSK-3 activity returned to baseline within 30 min. Akt-dependent phosphorylation of the GSK-3α isoform on Ser-21 or of GSK-3β on Ser-9 results in partial inactivation of the kinase (43Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar). Consistent with GH-mediated inactivation of GSK-3, GH was found to increase the amount of serine-phosphorylated GSK-3, as detected by immunoblotting in lysates from 3T3-F442A cells with an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Ser-21 of GSK-3α. The increase was evident within 5 min of GH treatment (Fig.3 B, lane 2), and subsided progressively (15–90 min)(Fig. 3 B, lanes 3-6). As expected, pretreatment with wortmannin reduced the GH-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7–12 versus 1–6). These results indicate that GH stimulates phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK-3 most likely by a mechanism involving PI3K. Because inhibition of GSK-3 by GH might contribute to the ability of GH to promote dephosphorylation of LAP and LIP, and because both LAP and LIP contain a putative consensus sequence for GSK-3, the possibility that LAP and/or LIP are GSK-3 substrate(s) was tested. LAP and LIP were immunoprecipitated from 3T3-F442A cells and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of recombinant GSK-3. When anti-C/EBPβ immunoprecipitates were incubated with GSK-3 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, autoradiography revealed prominent phosphorylated proteins (Fig.4 A, lane 4) with the sizes appropriate for LAP and LIP (Fig.5 B, lane 6). No phosphoproteins were detected when the incubation was performed in the absence of GSK-3 (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) indicating that other kinase activity did not co-precipitate with C/EBPβ. When non-immune serum was used instead of anti-C/EBPβ, labeled proteins were not detected in the absence or presence of GSK-3 (lanes 1 and 3). These results indicate that in vitro LAP and LIP are substrates of GSK-3.Figure 5Dephosphorylation of LAP, but not LIP, increases DNA binding. A, extracts from 293T cells overexpressing LAP or LIP were mixed and incubated in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of antiserum specific for C/EBPβ (anti-β), and complexes containing LAP and/or LIP were identified by EMSA using wt C/EBP-SRE as probe.

Here, we describe a mutual repression and selective dominance between PTEN and the androgen receptor (AR) in the growth and the apoptosis of prostatic cancer cells. On the one hand, PTEN and an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase repressed the transcriptional activity of the AR as well as androgen-induced cell proliferation and production of prostate-specific antigen. On the other hand, androgens protected prostate cancer cells from PTEN-induced apoptosis in an AR-dependent manner. Whereas the repression of the transcriptional activity of the AR by PTEN is likely to involve the down-regulation of AKT, androgens protected prostate cancer cells from PTEN-induced apoptosis without an effect on AKT activity, demonstrating a differential involvement of AKT in the interaction between PTEN and the AR. Our data suggest that the loss of PTEN function may induce tumorigenesis through unopposed activity of the AR as well as contribute to the resistance of prostate cancers to androgen ablation therapy.

Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2699) Google Scholar). Like other members of the family, the AR protein is modular in nature and composed of an amino-terminal A/B region, a DNA-binding domain and a “hinge” region in the middle, and a hormone-binding domain at the carboxyl terminus. Whereas the amino-terminal A/B region contains the major transcriptional activation function, a weaker activation function in the hormone-binding domain also contributes to the total transcriptional activity. The hormone-binding domain represses the activation functions until androgens bind to it and relieve the repression by inducing the formation of a conformation suitable for the interaction with transcriptional cofactors (6Onate S.A.

Besides their established physiological functions, androgens are implicated in multiple pathological processes including prostate cancer (PCa), which is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and second only to lung cancer in the mortality rate of American males (12Boring C.C. Squires T.S. Tong T. Cancer J. Clin. 1993; 43: 7-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Chronically maintained androgen level sustains the total prostate cell number by both stimulating the rate of proliferation and inhibiting the rate of death of prostate epithelial cells (13Isaacs J.T. Prostate. 1984; 5: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar); both lead to an increase in the cell number. To maintain the homeostasis of prostate epithelium, there must exist a “brake” system that opposes these effects of androgens.

Partial human AR cDNA was excised from pCMVhAR with BamHI andEagI. Because EagI cuts the AR cDNA at an internal position close to the initiator ATG, the digestion yield a partial AR cDNA fragment. The partial AR cDNA was ligated to a synthetic linker that extended the AR cDNA sequence from the internal EagI site to a designed BamHI site immediately upstream of the initiator ATG. The full-length AR cDNA was inserted into the BamHI site of pLEN vector in the correct orientation for mammalian expression. PC3 cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and LNCaP cells were plated in RPMI 1640 at 4 × 105 cells/well. One day after plating, cells were transfected with a LipofectAMINE plus-mediated transfection procedure following the protocol from Life Technologies, Inc. Transfected cells were treated with synthetic androgens or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors in medium containing 1% charcoal-stripped FBS for 24 h and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell lysate was prepared by directly adding lysis buffer (25 mmTris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N′,N′,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100) to the cells on ice. Luciferase activity was determined using luciferase assay systems from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI) following the company's protocol. β-gal activity was determined as previously described (31Bai W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12801-12806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells were plated in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS at 1 × 105 cells/well in 96-well plates for MTT assays. After cells attached, they were starved in RPMI 1640 with 1% charcoal-stripped FBS for 48 h and treated with synthetic androgens or PI3K inhibitors. The medium was collected and PSA levels were determined using the Tandem-E PSA ImmunoEnzyMetric Assay Kit (Hybritech Inc., San Diego, CA) following manufacturer's protocols. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a UV spectrophotometer. PSA concentration (ng/ml) was determined based on a standard curve generated with PSA controls of known concentrations provided by the kit. MTT assays were performed as described (32Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46496) Google Scholar). The plates were read on a MRX microplate reader (DYNEX Technologies, Chantilly, VA) using a test wavelength of 595 nm. Transfected cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 10 min. The viability of transfected cells in each well was determined by counting the total number of green cells in each well under a fluorescence microscope. For the demonstration of apoptotic cells, fixed cells were stained at room temperature for 15 min with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml in the VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Green and blue fluorescence were observed with a Leitz Orthoplan 2 Microscope. Representative micrographs were captured by a CCD camera with the Smart Capture Program (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL). The apoptotic index of GFP-positive cells was determined by scoring 300 GFP-positive cells for chromatin condensation and apoptotic body formation. LNCaP cells were transfected as described above for transcriptional assays, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH. 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μmNa3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml). After centrifugation, half of the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals Corp., Indianapolis, IN). Kinase reactions were performed at 30 °C in 30 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate, 20 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μm Na3VO4, 10 μmATP, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP with 3 μg of H2B as substrate. After incubation for 30 min, reactions were terminated by adding 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. To determine the expression of AR, duplicate wells of PC3 cells transfected in parallel to the cells prepared for transcriptional assays were pooled and lysed in the same buffer as described above for kinase assays. The lysate was mixed with one-sixth of 6× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated for 10 min at 100 °C, and separated on 8% SDS-PAGE. To determine the expression of HA-AKT, half of the cell lysate prepared for kinase assays was processed similarly as for AR and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. After separation on SDS-PAGE, samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with the PG-21 anti-AR (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or the 12CA5 anti-HA antibodies, and visualized using ECL as described (28Lee H. Jiang F. Wang Q. Nicosia S.V. Yang J. Su B. Bai W. Mol. Endocrinology. 2000; 14: 1882-1896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether PTEN inhibits AR transcriptional activity, we transfected into AR-negative, PTEN-null PC3 cells (22Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Vazquez F. Batt D.B. Perera S. Roberts T.M. Sellers W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2110-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) an AR expression vector, pLENhAR, together with a PTEN expression vector or a control vector expressing a phosphatase-inactive PTEN. The transcriptional activity of AR was measured by assaying the luciferase activity from a co-transfected AR reporter, AREe1bLuc, in which luciferase expression is under the control of synthetic androgen response elements (AREs) placed in front of the simple adenovirus E1b promoter. The effect of PTEN on the AR activity was measured by comparing the AR activity in cells transfected with PTEN to those transfected with the control vector. Because of the concern that co-transfected PTEN may alter the expression of AR by affecting the activity of the promoter or the enhancer of the AR expression vector, the reporter activity was normalized with β-gal activity from co-transfected pLENβgal vector in which β-gal expression is under the control of human metallothionin-II promoter and SV40 enhancer, the same regulatory sequences used by the AR vector. As shown in Fig.1 A, AR basal activity was low but the activity was significantly induced by treatment with R1881, a stable synthetic androgen agonist. Whereas the basal activity was not affected, R1881-induced AR activity was repressed, but not abolished, by PTEN in a dosage-dependent manner. Because both AR and β-gal were expressed using the same vector, the way we normalize the reporter activity should have eliminated the potential interference caused by either variation in transfection efficiency or PTEN-induced alterations in the promoter activity of the AR expression vector. However, the lower AR activity in the presence of PTEN could arguably be because of lower level of AR protein as a result of decreased protein stability or reduced efficiency of protein translation. To test whether the level of AR protein was altered by PTEN, PC3 cells were transfected with pCMVhAR and pCMVβ, which express the receptor and β-gal, respectively, under the control of the stronger cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, permitting the analysis of AR protein level and transcriptional activity in the same experiment. The AR activity from pCMVhAR was decreased by PTEN to the same degree as demonstrated for pLENhAR (Fig. 1 A). Parallel Western blotting demonstrated that PTEN, in the presence of R1881, did not decrease the AR protein level (Fig. 1 B). These data demonstrate that PTEN repressed the transcriptional activity of the AR per molecule. In the absence of R1881, PTEN expression caused a decrease in the level of AR protein. The decrease, based on later studies, was evidently because of the death of transfected cells that expressed PTEN to high levels. To further substantiate the AR repression by PTEN, we performed a time course study as shown in Fig. 2. In cells transfected with mutant PTEN, R1881-induced a dramatic AR activation at times as early as 12 h post-transfection and the continuous treatment proportionally increased the AR activity over time. Whereas the basal AR activity in the absence of R1881 was not affected, the proportional increase in AR activity as a result of prolonged R1881 treatment was almost eliminated by PTEN. In theory, the AR repression could be mediated through either the protein or lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN. Because the lipid phosphatase activity has a well established role in tumor suppression, we decided to first investigate the role of the lipid phosphatase activity in the AR repression. PTEN lipid phosphatase is known to decrease the level of PI(3,4,5)P3 by catalyzing its dephosphorylation. Thus, we examined whether the decrease of PI(3,4,5)P3 by other means such as inhibition of its synthesis will have the same effect on AR activity as PTEN expression. AR was transfected into PC3 cells and treated with either R1881 alone or co-treated with LY294002, a synthetic inhibitor for PI3K. As shown in Fig. 3 A, LY294002 repressed the AR activity in a dosage-dependent manner. A time course study showed that the percentage of AR repression by LY294002 was best observed at the shortest time point (Fig. 3 B). This is different from the PTEN data (Fig. 2) and probably reflects the fact that LY294002 exerts its effect through PI3K-mediated signaling pathways (which usually takes just minutes), and the effectiveness of synthetic drugs decreases over time because of the issue of stability and active clearance by cells. These studies indicate that the PTEN-induced AR repression is most likely mediated through the PI(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase activity of PTEN. Because AKT is the major downstream target of PI(3,4,5)P3, we next examined the involvement of AKT in PTEN-induced AR repression. PC3 cells were transfected with PTEN, AR, and a dominantly active AKT of which the activity cannot be repressed by PTEN or a kinase-inactive AKT. The AR repression by PTEN was analyzed as shown in Fig.4. Whereas PTEN-induced AR repression occurred in the presence of the kinase-inactive AKT, co-expression of the dominantly active AKT blocked the AR repression by PTEN. These data suggest that the down-regulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 by PTEN lipid phosphatase, and the subsequent inactivation of AKT kinase mediated the AR repression, establishing the role of the PTEN lipid phosphatase in AR repression. So far, we have demonstrated an inhibitory effect of PTEN and the PI3K inhibitor on the activity of transiently transfected AR with a reporter constructed with synthetic AREs. To determine whether PTEN also represses endogenous AR activity with natural promoters, we transfected PSALuc into PTEN-null but AR-positive LNCaP cells (22Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Vazquez F. Batt D.B. Perera S. Roberts T.M. Sellers W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2110-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and examined the effect of PTEN and the PI3K inhibitor on endogenous AR activity. PSALuc is an AR reporter in which luciferase expression is under the control of the promoter of human PSA, a PCa marker, which is transcriptionally regulated by AR through complex AREs (29Snoek R. Bruchovsky N. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Gleave M. Sato N. Mawji N.R. Rennie P.S. Prostate. 1998; 36: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, the transcriptional activity of the endogenous AR in cells transfected with the PSALuc was increased by R1881, and R1881 induction was blocked by PTEN. This demonstrates that PTEN represses endogenous AR activity on natural promoters and thus is not limited to ectopic AR or synthetic AREs. To rule out the possibility that the AR repression was caused by nonspecific repression of LNCaP cell transcription by PTEN, we transfected into LNCaP cells a Gal-VP16 expression vector and a Gal4 reporter and measured the activity of the fusion activator in the presence or absence of PTEN. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the reporter was inactive in the absence of Gal-VP16, and the co-expression of the fusion activator induced the activity dramatically. More importantly, the Gal-VP16 activity was not inhibited by PTEN. These data demonstrate that the AR repression was not caused by a nonspecific effect of PTEN on LNCaP cell transcription. To determine the biological consequence of the observed repression of AR transcriptional activity, the effect of PI3K inhibitor on androgen-induced PSA production and cell proliferation was examined in LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were treated with either R1881 alone or co-treated with LY294002 for indicated times. Culture medium from the treated cells was collected and analyzed for PSA level by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 6 A, R1881 treatment stimulated PSA production and the stimulation was inhibited by the co-treatment with LY294002. Similar to PSA production, R1881 induced an increase in cell number as measured by MTT assays, and this increase was blocked by co-treatment with LY294002 (Fig.6 B). LY294002 did not consistently decrease the basal PSA level or LNCaP cell numbers in the absence of R1881. These analyses demonstrate that the repression of AR transcriptional activity by the PI3K inhibitor impaired the biological functions of endogenous AR. Our data so far have established a functional relationship between PTEN and AR by showing that PTEN or a PI3K inhibitor opposed AR function in PCa cells. We next investigated whether androgen also opposes the function of PTEN. Because the expression of PTEN in LNCaP cells induced apoptosis (25Davies M.A. Koul D. Dhesi H. Berman R. McDonnell T.J. McConkey D. Yung W.K. Steck P.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2551-2556PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effect of androgens on PTEN-induced apoptosis. LNCaP cells were transfected with a green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression vector and the PTEN expression vector or the control vector expressing the mutant PTEN. The transfected cells were then treated with or without R1881, and the viability of transfected cells was determined. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the viability of PTEN-transfected cells in the absence of R1881 was only about 15% of the cells transfected with the control vector. Treatment with R1881 restored the viability of PTEN-transfected cells to the level of controls. This decrease in the viability of PTEN-transfected cells as well as its blockage by R1881 was more directly shown by the number of GFP-positive cells in representative micrographic fields (Fig. 7 B, panels 1–3). To confirm that the decreased viability of PTEN-transfected cells is the result of cell apoptosis, cells were fixed after transfection and stained with DAPI, and the nuclear morphology of transfected cells was examined for features of apoptosis under a fluorescence microscope that permits the simultaneous visualization of both blue and green fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 7 B, panels 4–6, as representative micrographs, cells transfected with the control vector displayed a normal morphology similar to surrounding non-transfected cells (Fig. 7 B, panel 4). Cells transfected with PTEN without R1881 treatment frequently displayed an apoptotic morphology (Fig. 7 B, panel 5). Similar to controls, most cells transfected with PTEN but treated with R1881 showed a normal morphology (Fig. 7 B, panel 6). Apoptotic index, as determined by counting apoptotic cells in 300 green cells per sample 24 h after treatment, was 5% for controls, 20% for cells transfected with PTEN without R1881 treatment, and 5% for cells transfected with PTEN but treated with R1881 (Fig. 7 C). These analyses show that PTEN induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, and this PTEN function was blocked by androgen treatment. Because of the presence of endogenous AR in LNCaP cells, LNCaP cell experiments did not show that the androgen protection of PTEN-induced apoptosis is mediated through the AR. To determine whether the androgen effect on apoptosis is AR-dependent, AR-negative PC3 cells were transfected with or without AR, and the effect of androgen on PTEN-induced apoptosis was examined as in LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig. 8 A, R1881 had no effect on the viability of PTEN-transfected cells in the absence of ectopic AR expression. After co-transfection with AR, both PTEN-induced decreases in cell viability (Fig. 8 A) and increases in apoptotic index (Fig. 8 B) were blocked by R1881, demonstrating that the androgen protection of PTEN-induced apoptosis was mediated through the AR. To further analyze the anti-apoptotic function of AR, a time course study was performed (Fig. 8 C). In this study, the number of transfected (green) cells peaked at 24 h post-transfection, and R1881 protected PC3 cells from PTEN-induced death similarly at all three tested time points, presumably because of the synchronized expression of AR and PTEN proteins in co-transfected cells. Our data in Fig. 1 showed that the PTEN repression of AR depended on the down-regulation of AKT activity. In addition, co-expression of the dominantly active AKT blocked PTEN-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells (Fig. 9 A), demonstrating that PTEN-induced apoptosis was mediated through AKT down-regulation. So we investigated the possibility that androgens might protect apoptosis by regulating AKT activity. Western blotting with anti-[phospho-Ser437]AKT antibody did not detect an androgen effect on endogenous AKT activity in LNCaP cells (data not shown). LNCaP cells are PTEN-null and contain high levels of endogenous AKT activity. Although androgens do not have a direct effect on endogenous AKT activity, it may affect the negative regulation of AKT by PTEN. So we next examined whether androgen treatment blocked PTEN-induced AKT down-regulation. We transfected a HA-tagged wild-type AKT into LNCaP cells with the PTEN expression vector and analyzed the AKT activity byin vitro immunocomplex kinase assays. As shown in Fig.9 B, in either the presence or absence of R1881, the kinase activity of AKT was dramatically decreased by PTEN expression whereas the level of AKT protein was slightly reduced (Fig. 9 B). The data demonstrate that R1881 did not block the down-regulation of AKT activity by PTEN in LNCaP cells. Our studies demonstrated an antagonistic interaction and selective dominance between PTEN and AR in the proliferation and apoptosis of PCa cells as well as a differential involvement of AKT in the interaction. The lack of an androgen effect on both AKT activity and its down-regulation by PTEN in PCa cells suggests that androgens protect PTEN-induced apoptosis either by activating a survival pathway that is independent of AKT as suggested by a previous study (33Carson J.P. Kulik G. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1449-1453PubMed Google Scholar) or by activating the same survival pathway at steps downstream of AKT. It appears paradoxical that PTEN-or LY294002-induced repression of AR transcriptional activity was sufficient to block androgen-induced proliferation and PSA production but unable to override the protective effect of androgens on apoptosis. One possibility is that AR-dependent protection of apoptosis by androgens might be mediated through non-genomic effects of the receptor. Our data clearly showed that the androgen effect on PTEN-induced apoptosis is AR-dependent. Consistent with our data, reported studies demonstrated that the “decoy” of ARE triggered apoptosis in LNCaP cells (34Kuratsukuri K. Sugimura K. Harimoto K. Kawashima H. Kishimoto T. Prostate. 1999; 41: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting that the anti-apoptotic effect of androgens is mediated through the genomic effect of the AR. Because the AR transcriptional activity was repressed but not abolished by PTEN or LY294002 in our experiments, it is likely that the androgen induction of genes involved in promoting cell proliferation, and those in apoptosis protection require different amounts of AR transcriptional activity. Because our studies indicate that androgen target genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis protection may have a differential sensitivity to cellular status of PI(3,4,5)P3 signal pathway, it would be interesting to determine whether AR could still mediate the induction of anti-apoptotic genes under conditions when androgen-induced cell proliferation is blocked by the suppression of PI(3,4,5)P3 signaling. Unfortunately, genes mediating the anti-apoptotic effect of androgens in PCa cells remain to be identified. Under the same conditions when PTEN-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells was blocked by androgens, we did not detect any androgen effect on Bcl-2 expression (data not shown), although Bcl-2 up-regulation by androgens in LNCaP cells had been described in previous studies (35Berchem G.J. Bosseler M. Sugars L.Y. Voeller H.J. Zeitlin S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 735-738PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is known to regulate the transcriptional activity of steroid receptors including AR (10Zhou Z.X. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 605-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on the consensus sequence for AKT phosphorylation (37Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), there are two potential AKT phosphorylation sites in AR: Ser212 in the A/B region and Ser782 in the ligand-binding domain. Therefore, it is conceivable that AR activation may need the phosphorylation of these sites by AKT and that AR repression by PTEN might be caused by the inhibition of the AKT phosphorylation. However, transfection of the dominantly active AKT into DU145 cells that contain wild type PTEN and low endogenous AKT did not cause either ligand-independent activation nor enhanced the androgen-induced activity of co-transfected AR (data not shown), suggesting that PTEN repression of AR activity may involve more complex processes than a simple inhibition of AR phosphorylation at the potential AKT sites. Our data are the first to clearly demonstrate a mutual antagonism between PTEN and AR in PCa cells. The mutual antagonism implies that the balance between the function of PTEN and AR may maintain the homeostasis of prostate epithelium in adult males. The demonstration that AR is more active in the absence of functional PTEN suggests that the loss of PTEN function may induce prostatic tumorigenesis by exposing prostatic epithelial cells to unopposed AR activity. Similarly, excessive androgens may induce prostatic tumorigeneis by blocking the apoptosis-promoting function of PTEN. The induction of apoptosis by the restored PTEN expression in LNCaP cells only occurred in the absence of androgen, implying that PTEN mutation or decreased expression may contribute to the resistance of PCa to androgen ablation and that the combinational inhibition of both PI3K/AKT and androgen signals could be an effective approach for the treatment of AR-positive PCa.

Blood. 1998; 92: 894-900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial adhesion may be mediated primarily through selectins and glycoproteins. BMEC-associated chemokines such as SDF-1 (stromal-derived factor) can then stimulate integrin ligation, leading to progenitor arrest (16Peled A. Grabovsky V. Habler L. Sandbank J.

Kanz L. Blood. 1998; 91: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Because the bone marrow microvasculature presents the first site of interaction for circulating tumor cells metastasizing to the bone marrow, it is likely that mechanisms of metastasis may parallel those employed by homing progenitors. In fact, tumor cells have been shown to bind and transmigrate through BMEC (17Mohle R. Bautz F. Rafii S. Moore M.A. Brugger W. Kanz L.

The adhesion molecules implicated in these processes, CD44/hyaluronan, VLA-4/VCAM, and LFA-1/ICAM, are also involved in homing and extravasation of circulating lymphocytes and progenitor cells.Hyaluronan (HA) is a ubiquitous high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan polymer required for growth, development, cell motility, and cushioning of joints (20Fraser J.R.

Cell Biol. 1996; 74: A1-A7Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of HA are associated with various pathologies, such as arthritis, inflammation, and several cancers (22Bertrand P. Girard N. Delpech B. Duval C. d'Anjou J. Dauce J.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Anttila M.A. Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. Syrjanen K.J. Saarikoski S.V. Kosma V.M.

Urol. 1984; 131: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Melanoma cells selected for high expression of HA were more metastatic when injected into nude mice than cells that expressed low amounts of HA (27Zhang L. Underhill C.B. Chen L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of HA biosynthetic enzymes in tumor cell lines has been shown to increase tumorigenicity and metastatic potential (28Kosaki R. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1141-1145PubMed Google Scholar, 29Itano N. Sawai T. Miyaishi O. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2499-2504PubMed Google Scholar).To investigate the molecular mechanism of initial adhesion to bone marrow endothelium, we modeled adhesion in vitro using the bone marrow endothelial cell lines BMEC-1 and trHBMEC and four prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines, PC3, PC3M-LN4, DU145, and LNCaP. Highly metastatic PC3 and PC3M-LN4 cells adhered rapidly to BMEC-1 but not to large vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). DU145 and LNCaP cells, in contrast, were poorly adherent to endothelial cells. Maximal BMEC adhesion was inhibited by addition of excess exogenous hyaluronan, and by hyaluronidase digestion of pericellular HA, found assembled specifically on PC3 and PC3M-LN4 cells. Presence of pericellular HA was correlated with elevated levels of HA synthesis and expression of HA synthase. Our data relate HA synthase overexpression to metastatic potential of prostate tumor cells and represent the first report of such a correlation. Collectively, our results implicate tumor cell-associated HA and up-regulation of HA synthase in prostate cancer progression and may directly impact metastatic potential or preferential tissue colonization of individual tumor cells.DISCUSSIONBone metastasis is an eventuality of advanced stage prostate cancer that results in severely reduced quality of life and ultimate morbidity. Metastasis is preceded by initial adhesion of circulating tumor cells to endothelial cells lining the vasculature of the secondary site. Because prostate carcinoma metastasizes to bone, we modeled this initial event using prostate carcinoma cell lines and the transformed bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial cell lines, trHBMEC and BMEC-1. In this study we demonstrate that highly metastatic prostate carcinoma cells adhere to bone marrow endothelial cells through pericellular hyaluronan (HA). Unlike reports of other model system interactions requiring this molecule, we find that the prostate carcinoma cells present the HA recognized by the BMEC. The HA-mediated adhesion shows endothelial source specificity, because PC3M-LN4 cells do not adhere rapidly to HUVEC, another endothelial cell type. Furthermore, HA-mediated adhesion exhibits specificity among bone-derived cell types: Although adhesion of PC3M-LN4 cells to bone marrow stromal cells is rapid, HA does not appear to be involved, suggesting other receptor interactions contribute to this process. Up-regulation of HA synthase in prostate tumor cells may promote bone marrow metastasis by specifically arresting those cells on the bone endothelium.The bone marrow microvasculature is a specialized network of venules and fenestrated sinusoids permeable to low molecular weight fluorophores but impenetrable by larger macromolecular conjugates and cellular bodies (10Mazo I.B. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Frenette P.S. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, the bone marrow as the site of hemopoiesis must be capable of progenitor cell flux across its protective endothelial layer, a function not required or desirable in other types of endothelium. Endothelial cell types exhibit heterogeneity in cytokine response (11Schweitzer K.M. Vicart P. Delouis C. Paulin D. Drager A.M. Langenhuijsen M.M. Weksler B.B. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 25-36PubMed Google Scholar, 37Favaloro E.J. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 571-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), receptor expression (9Schweitzer K.M. Drager A.M. van der Valk P.

Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the absence of specific stimuli, endothelial heterogeneity alone is able to influence homing of circulating progenitor cells to the bone marrow through differential expression of selectins (10Mazo I.B. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Frenette P.S. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 39Naiyer A.J. Jo D.Y. Ahn J. Mohle R. Peichev M.

Blood. 1985; 65: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and VCAM-1 and CD44 (15Vermeulen M. Le Pesteur F. Gagnerault M.C. Mary J.Y. Sainteny F. Lepault F. Blood. 1998; 92: 894-900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor expression and adhesion of circulating leukocytes to sites of inflammation is further regulated through endothelial activation by inflammatory cytokines (41DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. Siegelman M.H. Science. 1997; 278: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 42Siegelman M.H. DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These cell surface differences may translate into preferential adhesion of circulating tumor cells to endothelial cells in specific tissues.Transformed BMEC lines recently developed have facilitated exploration of the mechanisms by which endothelial adhesion receptors may dictate tumor preference for specialized endothelia. Results presented in this study demonstrate that prostate cancer cells adhere rapidly to bone marrow but not large vein endothelial cells. This is in agreement with observations by other investigators that prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines adhere preferentially to cell cultures enriched for BMEC over components of the bone marrow or hepatic endothelial cells (2Haq M. Goltzman D. Tremblay G. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4613-4619PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, adhesion of prostate carcinoma cells to a cell line immortalized from isolated BMEC was shown to be inhibited by preincubation of BMEC with monoclonal anti-LFA-1 antibodies or polyclonal anti-galectin-3 (43Lehr J.E. Pienta K.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), but it was unclear which cell type expressed LFA-1 because neither has been previously reported to do so. We have used two transformed bone marrow endothelial cell lines, BMEC-1 (30Candal F.J. Rafii S. Parker J.T. Ades E.W. Ferris B. Nachman R.L. Kellar K.L. Microvasc. Res. 1996; 52: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and trHBMEC (11Schweitzer K.M. Vicart P. Delouis C. Paulin D. Drager A.M. Langenhuijsen M.M. Weksler B.B. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 25-36PubMed Google Scholar), which express the same cell adhesion molecules and synthesize the same cytokines as the primary endothelial cells with minor differences in level of expression, to determine that HA on the prostate tumor cells mediates adhesion to BMEC. However, this does not exclude the possibility of other interactions. We expect that, like progenitor arrest, adhesion and migration of prostate tumor cells on BMEC involves multiple adhesive interactions that may or may not be interdependent.HA is a ubiquitous polysaccharide component of extracellular and cell-associated matrices (44Reed R.K. Lilja K. Laurent T.C. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1988; 134: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 45Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar), essential for growth and motility. HA is required for normal ductal branching in the developing prostate gland (46Gakunga P. Frost G. Shuster S. Cunha G. Formby B. Stern R. Development. 1997; 124: 3987-3997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), underscoring its vital role in cell migration (47Fujimoto T. Hata J. Yokoyama S. Mitomi T. J. Pediatr. Surg. 1989; 24: 550-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In some cell types, this requirement entails assembly of an HA pericellular matrix for proliferation and migration (33Knudson C.B. Toole B.P. Dev. Biol. 1985; 112: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 48Evanko S.P. Angello J.C. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Cell-associated HA may facilitate growth and motility by stimulating detachment of rounded, dividing cells and the trailing edges of migrating cells, respectively. HA exhibits further functional complexity as an adhesion molecule involved in recruitment of circulating lymphocytes to inflamed tissues through the action of cell surface HA receptors (38Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arizpe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The structure of HA, consisting of many thousand repetitions of a disaccharide motif, is well-suited to serve as a multivalent ligand for coordinate binding by many simultaneous adhesion receptors or for providing a scaffold for cellular movement.Cellular behaviors contributing to cancer progression include unrestricted growth, motility, and ability to circulate and colonize new tissues. Because HA is a normal component of such processes, it is not surprising that elevated levels correlate with cancer progression (21Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. Fraser J.R. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: A1-A7Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 49Delpech B. Girard N. Bertrand P. Courel M.N. Chauzy C. Delpech A. J. Intern.

High levels of serum HA, for example, correlated with disseminated carcinoma in general (51Manley G. Warren C. J. Clin. Pathol. 1987; 40: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 52Wilkinson C.R. Bower L.M. Warren C. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 256: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and, specifically, with tumor progression to metastatic disease in malignant lymphoma (53Hasselbalch H. Hovgaard D. Nissen N. Junker P. Am. J. Hematol. 1995; 50: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and breast carcinoma (54Delpech B. Chevallier B. Reinhardt N. Julien J.P. Duval C. Maingonnat C. Bastit P. Asselain B. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 46: 388-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In human breast carcinoma, HA is more concentrated in areas where the tumor is invading into the surrounding tissue (22Bertrand P. Girard N. Delpech B. Duval C. d'Anjou J. Dauce J.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and elevated stromal and cell-associated HA correlates with malignancy (55Auvinen P. Tammi R. Parkkinen J. Tammi M. Agren U. Johansson R. Hirvikoski P. Eskelinen M. Kosma V.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 529-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Elevated stromal and epithelial HA are also indicative of poor survival rate in patients with ovarian and colorectal cancers (23Anttila M.A. Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. Syrjanen K.J. Saarikoski S.V. Kosma V.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 150-155PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ropponen K. Tammi M. Parkkinen J. Eskelinen M. Tammi R. Lipponen P. Agren U. Alhava E. Kosma V.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 342-347PubMed Google Scholar). In animal models, tumor cells with high levels of HA expression were more metastatic than cells expressing lower levels of HA (27Zhang L. Underhill C.B. Chen L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar, 29Itano N. Sawai T. Miyaishi O. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2499-2504PubMed Google Scholar, 56Kimata K. Honma Y. Okayama M. Oguri K. Hozumi M. Suzuki S. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1347-1354PubMed Google Scholar, 57Turley E.A. Tretiak M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5098-5105PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, both high and low HA-expressing cells have the same growth rate in vitro and at the primary injection site (27Zhang L. Underhill C.B. Chen L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar). This correlation of HA with metastasis but not growth rate suggests that HA may be more critical to endothelial adhesion and/or the infiltration of the cells into tissues.PC3M-LN4 cell adhesion to BMEC in vitro was both enhanced and inhibited by the addition of high molecular weight HA. At low concentrations comparable to those secreted into the culture medium of the cells during growth, adhesion of hyaluronidase-treated tumor cells to BMEC was significantly enhanced by HA preincubation. HA prebinding by the BMEC may restore adhesion by replacing the cross-bridging ligand normally presented by the prostate tumor cells via its own cell surface HA receptors. When BMEC were precoated with higher levels of HA, PC3M-LN4 cell adhesion was almost entirely precluded, regardless of HAase treatment. This suggests that BMEC and prostate HA receptors have been saturated and are no longer able to cross-link. HA has been previously reported to enhance/inhibit intercellular adhesion in this fashion in development of chick limb buds (58Maleski M.P. Knudson C.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Rapid intercellular adhesion was synergistically inhibited by HAase treatment and high exogenous HA, suggesting the incomplete HAase effect is probably due to HA resynthesis during the assay. By contrast, DU145 cell adhesion was not affected by addition of HA at any concentration, and therefore, these cells most likely lack active cell surface HA binding proteins.PC3 (59Ware J.L. Paulson D.F. Mickey G.H. Webb K.S. J. Urol. 1982; 128: 1064-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and PC3M-LN4 (35Pettaway C.A. Pathak S. Greene G. Ramirez E. Wilson M.R. Killion J.J. Fidler I.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1627-1636PubMed Google Scholar) prostate carcinoma cells are highly metastatic in mouse models and are shown in this report to produce a dense pericellular HA matrix that mediates adhesion to bone marrow endothelial cells. DU145 (60Powell W.C. Knox J.D. Navre M. Grogan T.M. Kittelson J. Nagle R.B. Bowden G.T. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) and LNCaP (61Dumont P. Petein M. Lespagnard L. Tueni E. Coune A. In Vivo. 1993; 7: 167-170PubMed Google Scholar) cell lines, by contrast, are poorly metastatic in mice, produce very little HA, and do not adhere well to BMEC. It is worth noting the origins and characteristics of the four cell types: PC3 is from a human bone metastasis; its derivative, PC3M-LN4, metastasizes to mouse bone; DU145 and LNCaP are from a human brain and a human lymph node metastasis, respectively, and their interaction with bone has never been documented. The correlation between high metastatic potential as reported in the literature, up-regulated HA synthesis and expression of HA biosynthetic enzymes is summarized in Table II. This correlation is consistent with a putative role for HA as a component of prostate cancer metastasis. In fact, HA overproduction is thought to be directly involved in prostate cancer progression. Histological sections of normal adult prostate tissue demonstrate the presence of HA in the prostate stroma (25De Klerk D.P. Prostate. 1983; 4: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 46Gakunga P. Frost G. Shuster S. Cunha G. Formby B. Stern R. Development. 1997; 124: 3987-3997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cancerous human prostates, HA expression levels are increased on the carcinoma cells and correspond to dedifferentiation of the cancer (25De Klerk D.P. Prostate. 1983; 4: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,26De Klerk D.P. Lee D.V. Human H.J. J. Urol. 1984; 131: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Synthesis and secretion of HA is catalyzed in vertebrates by a family of three HA synthases: Has1 (62Shyjan A.M. Heldin P. Butcher E.C. Yoshino T. Briskin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23395-23399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), Has2 (63Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22945-22948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and Has3 (64Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), each of which is capable of conferring HA synthesis and pericellular HA retention to transfected cells (for a review of HA synthases, see Ref.65Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). HAS expression is ubiquitous, but isoforms exhibit temporal and tissue-specific distribution. Targeted disruption of thehas2 gene is an embryonic lethal mutation in mice, which fail to produce HA essential for pericardial endothelial cell migration and endothelial/mesenchymal transformation during cardiac development (66Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T. Biesterfeldt J. Augustine M.L. Calabro Jr., A. Kubalak S. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Has2 is also specifically up-regulated in response to wounding in a mesothelial cell model (67Yung S. Thomas G.J. Davies M. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1953-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because HAS expression is critical during periods of normal tissue remodeling, understanding its dysregulation in tumors may be important in controlling tumor growth and metastasis. HAS expression is regulated by glucocorticoids (68Zhang W. Watson C.E. Liu C. Williams K.J. Werth V.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (69Jacobson A. Brinck J. Briskin M.J. Spicer A.P. Heldin P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), transforming growth factor β1 (70Usui T. Amano S. Oshika T. Suzuki K. Miyata K. Araie M. Heldin P. Yamashita H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3261-3267PubMed Google Scholar), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (71Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 4079-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of HAS appears to correlate directly to HA synthesis (69Jacobson A. Brinck J. Briskin M.J. Spicer A.P. Heldin P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), suggesting regulation occurs at the level of transcription. To date, there is no evidence for post-transcriptional mechanisms. Elevated HA in tumor cells is, therefore, probably a reflection of HAS gene expression. In support of this, we have determined that Has2"
https://openalex.org/W2045190167,"A large body of experimental and clinical data have documented the damaging effects of light exposure on photoreceptor cells although the identities of the biologically relevant molecular targets of photodamage are still uncertain. Several lines of evidence point to retinoids or retinoid derivatives as chromophores that can mediate light damage. We report here that ABCR, a photoreceptor-specific transporter involved in the recycling of all-trans-retinal, is unusually sensitive to photooxidation damage mediated by all-trans-retinal in vitro. Partial loss of ABCR function is responsible for Stargardt macular dystrophy, which is associated with accumulation of A2E, a diretinoid adduct within the retinal pigment epithelium. Photodamage to ABCR causes it to aggregate in SDS gels and results in the loss of retinal-stimulated ATPase activity. Peripherin/RDS and ROM-1, two structural proteins that colocalize with ABCR at the outer segment disc rim, are also significantly more susceptible to all-trans-retinal-mediated photodamage than are the major proteins from the rod outer segment. These observations imply that there may be specific protein targets of photodamage within the outer segment, and they may be especially relevant to assessing the risk of light exposure in those individuals who already have diminished ABCR activity due to mutation in one or both copies of the ABCRgene. A large body of experimental and clinical data have documented the damaging effects of light exposure on photoreceptor cells although the identities of the biologically relevant molecular targets of photodamage are still uncertain. Several lines of evidence point to retinoids or retinoid derivatives as chromophores that can mediate light damage. We report here that ABCR, a photoreceptor-specific transporter involved in the recycling of all-trans-retinal, is unusually sensitive to photooxidation damage mediated by all-trans-retinal in vitro. Partial loss of ABCR function is responsible for Stargardt macular dystrophy, which is associated with accumulation of A2E, a diretinoid adduct within the retinal pigment epithelium. Photodamage to ABCR causes it to aggregate in SDS gels and results in the loss of retinal-stimulated ATPase activity. Peripherin/RDS and ROM-1, two structural proteins that colocalize with ABCR at the outer segment disc rim, are also significantly more susceptible to all-trans-retinal-mediated photodamage than are the major proteins from the rod outer segment. These observations imply that there may be specific protein targets of photodamage within the outer segment, and they may be especially relevant to assessing the risk of light exposure in those individuals who already have diminished ABCR activity due to mutation in one or both copies of the ABCRgene. The retina is the only part of the central nervous system that is directly exposed to light, and it has long been known that excessive light exposure leads to retinal damage (1Verhoeff F.H. Bell L. Proc. Am. Acad. Arts Sci... 1916; 51: 630-818Google Scholar). Acute light toxicity, for example that incurred by directly viewing a solar eclipse, has been recognized since antiquity; in Plato's Phaedo, Socrates advises that such injuries can be avoided by viewing the eclipse via its reflection in water (2Duke-Elder S. Textbook of Ophthalmology, Volume VI ..C. V. Mosby. 1954; : 6494-6517Google Scholar). Indirect exposure to sunlight can also impair visual function if it occurs over an extended period. Among military personnel exposed to bright sunlight and its reflection from water or sand, temporary elevations in the threshold for dark adaptation have been reported in individuals exposed without sunglasses for 3–4 h each day over a 2-week period (3Clark B. Johnson M.L. Dreher R.H. Am. J. Ophthalmol... 1946; 29: 828-836Google Scholar), and decreased visual acuity and macular pigmentary changes have been reported following several months of exposure (4Cordes F.C. Am. J. Ophthalmol... 1944; 27: 803-816Google Scholar, 5Smith H.E. U. S. Naval Med. Bull... 1944; 42: 675-680Google Scholar, 6Borley W.E. McAlester A.W. Lower R.A. U. S. Naval Med.

Ophthalmol... 1973; 12: 5-16Google Scholar). Of potentially greater significance to public health is the effect that decades of exposure to ‘normal’ light levels may have on the retina and underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)1 (9Young R.W. Surv. Ophthalmol... 1988; 32: 252-269Google Scholar). The clinical relevance of this exposure is suggested by two recent epidemiological studies showing a positive correlation between light exposure and age-related macular degeneration, the most common cause of visual impairment in the elderly (10Taylor H.R. Munoz B. West S. Bressler N.M. Bressler S.B. Rosenthal F.S. Trans. Am. Ophthalmol. Soc... 1990; 88: 163-178Google Scholar, 11Taylor H.R. West S. Munoz B. Rosenthal F.S. Bressler S.B. Bressler N.M.

An extensive body of work has documented the damaging effects of acute and chronic light exposure in laboratory animals (reviewed in Refs.13Lanum J. Surv. Ophthalmol... 1978; 22: 221-249Google Scholar, 14Oranisciak D.T. Winkler B.S. Prog. Retinal Eye Res... 1994; 13: 1-29Google Scholar, 15Reme C.E. Hafezi F. Marti A. Munz K. Reinboth J.J. Marmor M.F. Wolfensberger T.J. The Retinal Pigment Epithelium.Oxford University Press. 1998; : 563-586Google Scholar). Most of these studies have assessed the appearance of the retina and RPE through the ophthalmoscope and in tissue sections using light or electron microscopy; some studies have also assessed retinal function via the electroretinogram. These studies have employed a variety of animal species and light exposure protocols and, as a result, have produced a number of disparate conclusions regarding the initial cellular targets for light damage, the sensitivity of those targets to different wavelengths and intensities, and the natural history of tissue injury and repair. Despite the lack of a detailed consensus, several broad themes have emerged, and these are summarized below. Acute light damage involves both the photoreceptors and RPE, but the relative susceptibilities of each cell layer and the subcellular compartments within which damage occurs vary with wavelength (13Lanum J. Surv. Ophthalmol... 1978; 22: 221-249Google Scholar, 14Oranisciak D.T. Winkler B.S. Prog. Retinal Eye Res... 1994; 13: 1-29Google Scholar, 15Reme C.E. Hafezi F. Marti A. Munz K. Reinboth J.J. Marmor M.F. Wolfensberger T.J. The Retinal Pigment Epithelium.Oxford University Press. 1998; : 563-586Google Scholar). Experiments in which rodents or monkeys are exposed to intense light over a period of minutes to hours, as well as clinical data from humans exposed to intense lights as an occupational hazard (e.g.arc welders), indicate that light at the blue end of the visible spectrum is ∼50-fold more potent in producing acute damage than is light from the midspectral region (2Duke-Elder S. Textbook of Ophthalmology, Volume VI ..C. V. Mosby. 1954; : 6494-6517Google Scholar, 16Ham W.T. Mueller H.A. Sliney D.H. Nature.. 1976; 260: 153-155Google Scholar, 17Rapp L.M. Tolman B.L.

Sci... 1992; 33: 3367-3377Google Scholar, 19Gorgels G.M.F. van Norren D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 1995; 36: 851-863Google Scholar). By contrast, chronic exposure to relatively low light levels over a period of weeks or months produces photoreceptor damage with an action spectrum that peaks at ∼500 nm and coincides with the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin (20Noell W.K. Walker V.S. Kang B.S. Berman S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 1966; 5: 450-473Google Scholar, 21Williams T.P. Howell W.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 1983; 24: 285-287Google Scholar, 22Noell W.K. Vision Res... 1980; 20: 1163-1171Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that visual pigment activation and/or release of the all-trans-retinal chromophore plays a role in light damage. A role for retinal or other retinoids in light damage is further supported by the observations that (a) photoexcited all-trans-retinal can generate singlet oxygen (23Lion Y. Delmelle M. van de Vorst A. Nature.. 1976; 263: 442-443Google Scholar, 24Delmelle M. Photochem. Photobiol... 1978; 27: 731-734Google Scholar) and mediate photooxidative damage of lipids (25Delmelle M. Photochem. Photobiol... 1978; 28: 357-360Google Scholar, 26Pogozheva I.D. Federovich I.B. Ostrosvskii M.A. Emanual N.M. Biofizika.. 1981; 26: 398-403Google Scholar), proteins (26Pogozheva I.D. Federovich I.B. Ostrosvskii M.A. Emanual N.M.

Chem... 2000; 275: 2003-2008Google Scholar) in vitro (reviewed in Ref. 29Ostrovskii M.A. Fedorovich I.B. Biofizika.. 1994; 39: 13-25Google Scholar), (b) dietary vitamin A depletion partially protects the retina from chronic light damage (30Noell W.K. Delmelle M.C. Albrecht R. Science.. 1971; 172: 72-75Google Scholar, 31Noell W.K. Albrecht R. Science.. 1971; 172: 76-80Google Scholar), and (c) the retinas of RPE65(−/−) mice, which have little or no rhodopsin secondary to defective production of 11-cis-retinal in the RPE, are highly resistant to acute light toxicity (32Grimm C. Wenzel A. Hafezi F., Yu, S. Redmond T.M. Reme C. Nat. Genet... 2000; 25: 63-66Google Scholar). Although the identities of the biologically significant molecular targets of photodamage are not yet known, the mechanisms by which they are damaged have been inferred from experiments in which damage to the retina is abrogated when an antioxidant or free radical scavenger is administered prior to light exposure (33Organisciak D.T. Darrow R.M. Jiang Y. Marak G.E. Blanks J.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 1992; 33: 1599-1609Google Scholar, 34Reme C.E. Braschler U.F. Roberts J. Dillon J. Photochem. Photobiol... 1991; 54: 137-142Google Scholar). These experiments indicate that photooxidative mechanisms play a significant role in the generation of light damage. Consistent with this idea, a number of investigators have documented photooxidation of lipids in photoreceptor outer segments (OSs) following irradiation in vivo orin vitro (25Delmelle M. Photochem. Photobiol... 1978; 28: 357-360Google Scholar, 35Kagan V.E. Shvedova A.A. Novikov K.N. Kozlov Y.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1973; 330: 76-79Google Scholar, 36Wiegand R.D. Giusto N.M. Rapp L.M. Anderson R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 1983; 24: 1433-1435Google Scholar). By contrast, only a few studies have addressed the question of protein targets of light damage within the photoreceptor. These studies have demonstrated oxidation of the rhodopsin sulfhydryl groups following irradiation of rod outer segments (ROSs) in vitro (26Pogozheva I.D. Federovich I.B. Ostrosvskii M.A. Emanual N.M. Biofizika.. 1981; 26: 398-403Google Scholar, 27Starostin A.V. Federovich I.B. Ostrovskii M.A. Biofizika.. 1985; 30: 995-999Google Scholar) and an ∼2-fold decline in ROS retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) activity 20 h after exposure of rats to intense visible light (37Darrow R.A. Darrow R.M. Organisciak D.T. Curr. Eye Res... 1997; 16: 144-151Google Scholar). One or more chromophores distinct from those involved in photoreceptor damage are presumed to be responsible for light-mediated RPE damage. In searching for the relevant chromophore(s) a number of investigators have focused on the large quantities of age-dependent pigments, lipofuscin, that accumulate within the RPE (38Gaillard E.R. Atherton S.J. Eldred G. Dillon J. Photochem. Photobiol... 1995; 61: 448-453Google Scholar, 39Rozanowska M. Jarvis-Evans J. Korytowski W. Boulton M.E. Burke J.M. Sarna T. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 18825-18830Google Scholar, 40Eldred G.E. Lasky M.R. Nature.. 1993; 361: 724-726Google Scholar, 41Eldred G.E. Marmor M.F. Wolfensberger T.J. The Retinal Pigment Epithelium.Oxford University Press. 1998; : 651-668Google Scholar). One major component of human RPE lipofuscin is a diretinal adduct, A2E, that appears to form within the photoreceptor OS from the spontaneous condensation of phosphatidylethanolamine and the all-trans-retinal released from photoactivated rhodopsin (42Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 14609-14613Google Scholar, 43Mata N.L. Weng J. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 7154-7159Google Scholar, 44Liu J. Itagaki Y. Ben-Shabat S. Nakanishi K. Sparrow J.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 29354-29360Google Scholar). Phagocytosis of OSs by the RPE results in accumulation of A2E within the RPE where it appears to be trapped within phagolysosomes. A2E efficiently absorbs blue light and is phototoxic to RPE cells in culture (45Sparrow J.R. Nakanishi K. Parish C.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 2000; 41: 1981-1989Google Scholar); its progressive accumulation within the RPE suggests that with age the RPE may become increasingly susceptible to phototoxic damage. Thus both photoreceptor and RPE photodamage may be mediated, at least in part, by retinoids or retinoid derivatives. The most recent line of evidence suggestive of a role for retinoids in photodamage comes from the study of autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. In Stargardt disease the cycling of retinoids between photoreceptors and RPE, a process referred to as the visual cycle, is defective. Stargardt disease arises from a partial loss of function of ABCR (46Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H. Shroyer N.F. Hutchinson A. Chidambaram A. Gerrard B. Baird L. Stauffer D. Peiffer A. Rattner A.

ABCRgene mutations leading to partial loss of function can also cause recessive cone-rod dystrophy (62Cremers F.P.M. van de Pol D.J.R. van Driel M. den Hollander A.I. van Haren F.J.J. Knoers N.V.A.M.

J. Hum. Genet... 2000; 67: 487-491Google Scholar). Purified and reconstituted ABCR exhibits all-trans-retinal-stimulated ATP hydrolysisin vitro (51Sun H. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Nat. Genet... 2000; 26: 242-246Google Scholar, 66Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 8269-8281Google Scholar, 67Ahn J. Wong J.T. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 20399-20405Google Scholar), and ABCR knockout mice exhibit an acute light-dependent accumulation ofall-trans-retinal within the OS and a progressive light-dependent accumulation of A2E in the RPE (43Mata N.L. Weng J. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 7154-7159Google Scholar, 68Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.D. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell.. 1999; 98: 13-23Google Scholar). Based on these data, ABCR appears to function as an all-trans-retinal transporter/flippase that delivers all-trans-retinal to RDH, the OS enzyme responsible for conversion of released all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol prior to its delivery to the RPE. In this paper, we report that in vitro ABCR is unusually sensitive to photooxidative damage mediated by all-trans-retinal. If this type of photodamage also occursin vivo it would diminish the rate of reduction of all-trans-retinal in the OS, and the resulting increase in all-trans-retinal would be predicted to lead to further phototoxic damage and an accelerated accumulation of A2E. Photodamage of this type may be particularly relevant to understanding pathophysiological mechanisms and assessing the risk of light exposure in those individuals with inherited retinal diseases caused by partial loss of ABCR function. Dark-adapted bovine ROSs were prepared by the method of Papermaster (69Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol... 1982; 81: 48-52Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all ROS preparations were used at a concentration of 1 mg/ml rhodopsin. For depletion of both free and opsin-bound retinal, ROSs were exposed to visible light for 60 min at room temperature in the presence of 10 mm hydroxylamine. An equal volume of BSA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 4% BSA) was added to the irradiated ROS suspension, and the ROSs were incubated on ice for 20 min and recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pelleted ROSs were resuspended and subjected to a second incubation in BSA buffer, recovered by centrifugation, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Human ABCR was produced in transiently transfected 293 cells and azido-[32P]ATP labeling was performed with 302 nm irradiation from a Spectrolyne TR-302 transilluminator as described in Ref. 51Sun H. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Nat. Genet... 2000; 26: 242-246Google Scholar. For immunoblot assays of light damage, 293 membranes containing ABCR or dark-adapted bovine ROSs in resuspension buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2) were added to a 0.3-ml glass vial or a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and either all-trans-retinal (>95% pure by high pressure liquid chromatography; Sigma) in ethanol or ethanol alone was added to a final ethanol concentration of 1%. In a typical irradiation experiment, each 20 μl of reaction contained 0.5 mg/ml rhodopsin for ROS samples or 1 mg/ml total protein for 293 membrane samples as determined by the Bradford assay (BioRad). For UV damage, samples in glass vials or uncapped microcentrifuge tubes were placed 5 cm from a longwave UV lamp (peak emission 366 nm; irradiance 2 mW/cm2; model UVL-56, UVP, Inc.) and irradiated from above for the indicated length of time. For exposure to visible light, samples in uncapped microcentrifuge tubes were placed in a room temperature water bath and irradiated at a distance of 2 cm for 2 h from above with a fluorescent light source (F15T8-CW cool white 15 watt lamp; irradiance 1.5 mW/cm2; General Electric) filtered through a 420-nm cut-off filter (GG-420, 1 mm thick, Schott Glass Technologies, Inc.). Light sources were calibrated with a United Detector Technologies model 61 optometer. After irradiation, an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer was added, and the samples were immediately loaded onto a 6% (see Figs. 3, 5, upper panel, and 6) or 10% (see Figs. 1, 4 , and 5, lower panel) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolving gel with a 5% stacking gel without sample heating. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose at 140 volts for 1 h at 4 °C. ABCR was detected by immunoblotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against human ABCR (ABCR1156–1258; Ref. 53Sun H.

Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Nat. Genet... 2000; 26: 242-246Google Scholar). Each complete GTPase reaction contained 5 μl of ROSs and 100 μl of 1× GTPase buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 μm GTP containing 106 cpm [γ-32P]GTP). Prior to addition of 1× GTPase buffer, 10 mm all-trans-retinal in ethanol was added to an aliquot of dark-adapted ROSs to give a final all-trans-retinal concentration of 100 μm. A control aliquot of ROSs received only ethanol. The ROS samples were then exposed to room light for 1 min, an exposure sufficient to bleach >90% of the rhodopsin. Half of each sample was further exposed to 366 nm light as described for ABCR assays for 10 min at room temperature while the other half was kept in the dark. The GTPase reaction was initiated by the addition of 1× GTPase buffer and incubated at 37 °C under dim red light. At 5 min intervals, 15 μl of aliquots were removed from each reaction and vigorously mixed with a 200-μl suspension of activated charcoal; released 32P was measured in the supernatant after removing the charcoal by centrifugation. 10 mmall-trans-retinal in ethanol was added to retinoid-depleted ROSs in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl to give a final all-trans-retinal concentration of 100 μm. Control ROSs received only ethanol. Following incubation in the dark or exposure to 366 nm light for 10 min as described for ABCR assays, 30 μl of aliquots of the ROS samples were added to 400 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.05% BSA, 0.6% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS), and 50 μm 11-cis-retinal, and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 min. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that under these conditions reconstitution with 11-cis-retinal proceeds with a half-life of less than 1 min. Hydroxylamine was then added to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the incubation continued for an additional 10 min at which point the samples were frozen on dry ice. Photobleaching difference spectra were obtained in a water-jacketed cuvette by bleaching with an intense visible light delivered to the cuvette by a fiber optic cable. All spectra were recorded with a Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer and analyzed using Cricket Graph software. Recombinant bovine RDH was prepared by transient transfection of 293 cells with a RDH expression plasmid followed by membrane purification as described in ref. 70Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 11034-11043Google Scholar. ROS RDH activity was measured starting with retinoid-depleted ROSs. All-trans-retinal addition to a final concentration of 100 μm and irradiation with 366 nm light for 10 min were performed with the 293 and ROS membranes as described above for the ROS GTPase assays. The RDH reaction was initiated by solubilizing the 293 or ROS membranes, which had been stored on dry ice following the pretreatment regimen in 400 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.05% BSA, 0.6% CHAPS, 100 μm NADPH, and 50 μm all-trans-retinal. The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically as described in Ref. 70Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 11034-11043Google Scholar. A control reaction containing 100 μm NADH in place of NADPH showed barely detectable RDH activity. The investigation reported here began with an experiment to determine whether all-trans-retinal affects the affinity of ABCR for ATP. To this end we asked whether all-trans-retinal alters the efficiency of photo-cross-linking of azido-[α-32P]ATP to ABCR expressed in 293 cells. As seen in Fig. 1 A, all-trans-retinal produces a dose-dependent loss in 32P labeling of ABCR at the expected mono"

Inappropriate HGF signaling occurs in several human cancers, and the ability of HGF to initiate a program of protease production, cell dissociation, and motility has been shown to promote cellular invasion and is strongly linked to tumor metastasis. Upon HGF binding, several tyrosines within the intracellular domain of its receptor, c-Met, become phosphorylated and mediate the binding of effector proteins, such as Grb2. Grb2 binding through its SH2 domain is thought to link c-Met with downstream mediators of cell proliferation, shape change, and motility. We analyzed the effects of Grb2 SH2 domain antagonists on HGF signaling and observed potent blockade of cell motility, matrix invasion, and branching morphogenesis, with ED50 values of 30 nm or less, but only modest inhibition of mitogenesis. These compounds are 1000–10,000-fold more potent anti-motility agents than any previously characterized Grb2 SH2 domain antagonists. Our results suggest that SH2 domain-mediated c-Met-Grb2 interaction contributes primarily to the motogenic and morphogenic responses to HGF, and that these compounds may have therapeutic application as anti-metastatic agents for tumors where the HGF signaling pathway is active.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)1 stimulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, and morphogenesis in a wide range of cellular targets including epithelial and endothelial cells, hematopoietic cells, neurons, melanocytes, as well as hepatocytes (reviewed in Refs.1Michalopoulos G.K.

These pleiotropic effects play fundamentally important roles during development, organogenesis, and tissue regeneration. For example, HGF is essential for the normal development of both liver and placenta (reviewed in Ref. 4Birchmeier C. Gherardi E.

The biological responses to HGF are mediated by its cell surface receptor, c-Met, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase. Upon HGF binding, several tyrosines residues within the c-Met intracellular domain are phosphorylated, some of which are essential for catalytic activity, and some of which mediate the binding of signaling proteins such as the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C-γ, Shc, Gab1, and Grb2 (reviewed in Ref. 9Bardelli A. Comoglio P.M. Ciba Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 133-144PubMed Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, PI3K activity is required for both HGF-stimulated scatter and mitogenesis (10Royal I. Park M. J. Biol.

The small GTP-binding proteins Ras, Rho, and Rac are required for HGF-stimulated cytoskeletal rearrangements and subsequent cell motility (16Hartmann G. Weidner K.M. Schwarz H. Birchmeier W. J. Biol.

In addition to its critical roles in normal development and adult homeostasis, HGF signaling is strongly linked to cancer, including colon, breast, lung, thyroid, and renal carcinomas; melanoma; and several sarcomas; as well as glioblastoma (reviewed in Ref. 18Vande Woude G.F. Jeffers M. Cortner J. Alvord G. Tsarfaty I. Resau J. Ciba Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar). The inappropriate expression of c-Met in certain mesenchymal cells can lead to a carcinogenic transformation in which the tumor cells express both mesenchymal and epithelial markers (19Tsarfaty I. Rong S. Resau J.H. Rulong S. da Silva P.P. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1994; 263: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Inherited mutations in c-Met that result in constitutive activation of the HGF signaling pathway are associated with human renal papillary carcinoma (20Schmidt L. Duh F.M. Chen F. Kishida T. Glenn G.

A. 1997; 94: 11445-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Importantly, in addition to its mitogenic activity, the ability of HGF to initiate a program of cell dissociation and increased cell motility coupled with increased protease production has been shown to promote cellular invasion through extracellular matrix substrates, and is correlated with tumor metastasis in vivo (reviewed in Refs. 6Birchmeier W. Brinkmann V. Niemann C. Meiners S. DiCesare S. Naundorf H. Sachs M. Ciba Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 230-240PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bardelli A. Comoglio P.M. Ciba Found.

Increased extracellular matrix proteolysis, cell dissociation, and increased cell motility are essential for tumor metastasis, and HGF may be unique among extracellular signaling molecules in its ability to initiate all of these events. Artificial inhibitors of protein and lipid kinases, phosphatases, and protein-protein interactions have been used extensively to examine the roles of individual intracellular effector molecules in specific HGF-stimulated activities, and to explore their potential as anticancer drugs. Many intracellular effectors interact with receptor tyrosine kinases through conserved amino acid sequence modules, such as the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (reviewed in Refs. 23Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar and 24Pawson T. Saxton T.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 675-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). SH2 domains directly recognize phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) (25Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), with additional secondary binding interactions within two or three amino acids C-proximal to the Tyr(P) residue introducing differential affinity toward SH2 domain subfamilies (26Cantley L.C.

Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). These and other observations have led to the development of potent tripeptide inhibitors of SH2 domain interactions. Modification of the Tyr(P) residue to phosphonomethyl phenylalanine, or related structures, protects this moiety from phosphatases (28Marseigne I. Roques B.P. J. Org. Chem. 1988; 53: 3621-3624Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Burke Jr., T.R. Smyth M. Nomizu M. Otaka A. Roller P. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 1336-1340Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas other modifications have been identified that increase inhibitor affinity and the potential for cell membrane penetration (30Yao Z.-J. King C.R. Cao T. Kelley J. Milne G.W.A. Voigt J.H. Burke Jr., T.R. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study we describe the effects of several artificial tripeptide-based inhibitors of the Grb2 SH2 domain on HGF-stimulated mitogenesis, motogenesis, and extracellular matrix invasion in epithelial and hematopoietic target cell models. Grb2 is thought to link HGF-stimulated c-Met activation with the activation of Rho, Ras, and Rac (17Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and to regulate critical steps in early embryonic development, as well as in malignant transformation (31Cheng A.M. Saxton T.M. Sakai R.

We show that these compounds potently block HGF-stimulated cell motility, matrix invasion, and branching morphogenesis, but not HGF-stimulated mitogenesis, with ED50 values of 1–30 nm. The anti-motility and anti-invasion effects were characterized using four different assay systems, with no evidence of toxicity, or loss of contractility required for cellular functions other than locomotion. The active compounds did not alter HGF-stimulated c-Met tyrosine kinase activation, and their potency for inhibiting HGF-stimulated motility correlated well with their affinity for binding to Grb2 in vitro. Overall, our results suggest that c-Met-Grb2 interaction contributes primarily to the motogenic and morphogenic cellular responses to HGF, and that these compounds may have therapeutic application as anti-metastatic drugs in tumors where the HGF signaling pathway is active. Human HGF protein and the cDNA for human c-Met in the pMOG vector were gifts from Dr. G. Vande Woude. The truncated HGF isoform HGF/NK1 was produced in a bacterial expression system, purified, and refolded as previously described (32Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Kaufman J.D. Pannell L.K. Cioce V.

The human leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-LMS-1 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in DMEM + 10% FBS. TAC-2 (38Soriano J.V. Pepper M.S. Nakamura T. Orci L. Montesano R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 413-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a normal mammary gland epithelial cell line, was cultured in high glucose DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS. c-Met autophosphorylation was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as described (32Stahl S.J.

Briefly, intact cells were serum-deprived for 16 h in the presence or absence of Grb2 antagonists. Cells were then growth factor-treated for 10 min as indicated, and lysed in cold buffer containing non-ionic detergents and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After immunoprecipitation for 2 h on ice, immunocomplexes were washed, eluted with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore), and detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HGF/NK1-stimulated PI3K activation in intact cells after 16 h of incubation in the presence or absence of Grb2 antagonists was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation of the p85 subunit of PI3K with agarose-conjugated anti-Tyr(P), followed by immunoblot detection using antibodies against PI3K (Upstate Biotechnology). Cells were treated similarly to assess Akt and MAP kinase activation, except that SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-resolved whole cell lysates were immunoblotted using anti-phospho-Akt and anti-Akt, or anti-phospho-MAP kinase (New England Biolabs), respectively. Mitogenic assays were performed using 184B5 cells or 32D/c-Met cells as described (35Rubin J.S. Chan A.M.L. Bottaro D.P. Burgess W.H. Taylor W.G. Cech A.C. Hirshfield D.W. Wong J. Miki T. Finch P.W.

Briefly, cells were serum-deprived for 24 h (184B5) or 4 h (32D/c-Met) before the addition of growth factors and/or antagonists for 16 h (184B5) or 36 h (32D/c-Met). Cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine for 6 h, and DNA synthesis was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The migration of Okajima, 184B5, and SK-LMS-1 cells in modified Boyden chambers was measured using Biocoat Cell Environment control inserts (8-μm pore size; Becton Dickinson). Lower chambers contained DMEM + 0.1% bovine serum albumin, to which HGF (50 ng/ml) and/or Grb2 inhibitors were added. Cells were trypsinized, washed in DMEM + 0.1% bovine serum albumin, added to upper chambers (2 × 105 cells/ml) with growth factors and/or inhibitors, and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells on the upper surface of each filter were removed with a cotton swab, whereas cells that had traversed to the bottom surface of the filter were fixed and stained using Diff-Quik (Dade Diagnostics), and counted using brightfield microscopy. Mean values from 10 randomly selected unit areas were calculated for each of triplicate wells. The ratio of growth factor-treated to control migrating cells is designated on they axis as “migration (-fold increase).” 32D/c-Met cell migration was assayed using a modified Boyden chamber with 5-μm pore size Nucleopore filters (Corning). HGF/NK1 (300 ng/ml) and/or Grb2 inhibitors were added to both chambers, and cells were applied to the upper chamber at a final density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. After incubation for 8 h at 37 °C, cells that migrated to the lower chamber were counted with an automated cell counter (Coulter, Inc.), and migration was expressed as described for Okajima cells. SK-LMS-1 cell invasion was analyzed using Matrigel Invasion Chambers (Becton Dickinson) and quantitated essentially as described for Okajima cell migration across uncoated membranes. Briefly, SK-LMS-1 cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/chamber in DMEM + 5% FBS. Chambers were placed into 24-well culture plates containing DMEM + 5% FBS alone, or with HGF (10 ng/ml) and/or compounds 1–4 as indicated for 40 h at 37 °C. The ratio of growth factor-treated to control invading cells is designated on the y axis as “invasion (-fold increase).” MDCK cell invasion into three-dimensional collagen gels was analyzed as described (39Montesano R. Schaller G. Orci L. Cell. 1995; 66: 697-711Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Briefly, type I collagen (1.5 mg/ml; Cohesion Technologies) was mixed with 10× minimal essential medium and sodium bicarbonate (11.76 mg/ml) at a ratio of 8:1:1 (v/v/v) on ice, and 0.4-ml aliquots were dispensed into 16-mm tissue culture wells and allowed to gel at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were seeded onto gels (1 × 104 cells/well) in 0.4 ml of growth medium containing HGF and/or compounds 1 or 4 as indicated. After 5 days, cells were fixed in situ, and cells that had invaded the gel below the surface monolayer in 10 randomly selected fields (1 × 1.4 mm) were counted microscopically using a 20× phase contrast objective. Depth of cellular invasion into the collagen gel was quantitated in the same 10 fields per treatment group using a calibrated fine focusing micrometer.

MDCK cell scatter, observed as the dispersion of single cells from tightly grouped colonies, was assayed as described (32Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Kaufman J.D. Pannell L.K. Cioce V. Sakata H. Taylor W.G. Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded into 24-well plates (2 × 10 4 cells/well) in DMEM containing various concentrations of inhibitors and/or HGF (30 ng/ml). Cells were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The scatter of fixed and stained cells was observed by brightfield microscopy; images were captured at 12.5× total magnification. TAC-2 cells were suspended in three-dimensional collagen gels as described (38Soriano J.V. Pepper M.S. Nakamura T. Orci L. Montesano R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 413-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 1 × 104 cells/ml in collagen and incubated in complete medium containing HGF and/or Grb2 inhibitors as indicated. After 3 days, the cultures were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mcacodylate buffer, and brightfield microscopic images of three or more randomly selected fields per experimental condition were digitally recorded in each of three separate experiments. The total length of the tubular structures (cord length) in each colony present in each optical field was measured using IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc.). Cord length was considered “0” for spheroid colonies and for elongated colonies with length to diameter ratios less than 2. The mean values for each experimental condition were compared with controls using Student's unpaired t test. The structures of the Grb-2 SH2 domain binding antagonists used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The affinity of these compounds for binding to Grb2 SH2 domainsin vitro have been described (30Yao Z.-J. King C.R. Cao T. Kelley J. Milne G.W.A. Voigt J.H. Burke Jr., T.R. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Gao Y. Luo J. Yao Z.-J. Guo R. Zou H. Kelley J. Voigt J.H. Yang D. Burke Jr., T.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Each compound contains a common backbone structure corresponding to the invariant Grb2 SH2 domain binding motif pY-X-N, with distinct modifications to the Tyr(P)-mimetic moiety that render each resistant to phosphatases, but maintain the net charge (−2) of this moiety. Compound 4 also has these features, but differs from the others in that it has greater than 100-fold lower affinity for binding to Grb2 SH2 domains in vitro (30Yao Z.-J. King C.R. Cao T. Kelley J. Milne G.W.A. Voigt J.H. Burke Jr., T.R. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The similar charge and overall structure of compound 4 to compounds 1–3 thus made it an excellent negative control throughout the course of the biological characterization of the effects of these compounds on HGF signaling. To rule out the possibility that the Grb2 antagonists might interfere with HGF binding or receptor activation, we examined HGF-stimulated c-Met autophosphorylation in intact Okajima cells in the presence and absence of various concentrations of compound 1 (Fig.2). As shown in panel A, HGF/NK1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the 145-kDa c-Met β subunit was well above the level observed in control, untreated cells (compare left and right upper panels). The lower panels confirm that equal amounts of c-Met protein were present in each lane (Fig. 2 A). No differences in the level of HGF/NK1-stimulated c-Met autophosphorylation were observed in cells treated with up to 1 μm compound 1 (Fig. 2 A). Identical results were obtained for compound 2, as well as for both compounds on HGF-stimulated c-Met activation in intact 32D/c-Met cells (data not shown). Additional evidence that these compounds did not block HGF-c-Met interaction or subsequent c-Met activation is provided in the analysis of HGF-stimulated mitogenesis described below. Direct evidence that these compounds blocked c-Met-Grb2 interaction was obtained from co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis (Fig.2 B). Intact Okajima cells were treated with Grb2 inhibitors for 16 h, then briefly stimulated with HGF/NK1 before lysis, immunoprecipitation with anti-Grb2 antibodies, and immunoblotting with anti-c-Met, anti-Tyr(P), or anti-Grb2 (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with previous studies describing the phosphorylation-dependent binding of Grb2 to Tyr-1356 in c-Met (14Zhu H. Naujokas M.A. Fixman E.D. Torossian K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29943-29948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HGF/NK1 stimulated the co-immunoprecipitation of the 145 kDa c-Met β subunit with Grb2 (Fig. 2 B). When cells were pretreated for 16 h with 30 nm compound 1 prior to HGF/NK1 stimulation, the amount of HGF receptor that was co-immunoprecipitated with Grb2 was reduced by ∼50% (Fig.2 B, right lanes). Thus, the effective concentration of this compound for blocking c-Met/Grb2 interaction was almost identical to its relative affinity for Grb2 SH2 domain binding measured in vitro (34Gao Y. Luo J. Yao Z.-J. Guo R. Zou H. Kelley J. Voigt J.H. Yang D. Burke Jr., T.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). At 300 nm compound 1, Grb2-c-Met interaction was completely abolished (Fig. 2 B). The lower panel of Fig. 2 B confirms that equal amounts of Grb2 protein were present in each lane. Similar results were obtained using compound 2 (data not shown). Despite complete inhibition of Grb2-c-Met interaction by the active compounds in intact cells, other SH2 domain-mediated interactions such as HGF-stimulated PI3K activation were not affected (Fig.2 C). The ability of HGF/NK1 to stimulate anti-Tyr(P)-immunoprecipitability of the PI3K p85 subunit, as well as activation of the downstream effector Akt, was identical in 32D/c-Met cells treated with compound 1 at 300 nm for 16 h and control cells (Fig. 2 C). Consistent with their known dependence on PI3K, HGF-stimulated activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 was also completely unaffected by compound 2 after incubation of intact 32D/c-Met cells for 16 h with antagonist concentrations as high as 1 μm (Fig. 2 D). Together, our data demonstrate that these antagonists act selectively on Grb2 SH2 domain binding interactions in vivo at concentrations more than 100-fold over biologically effective doses. To characterize the mechanism by which the Grb2 SH2 domain antagonists entered intact cells, we analyzed HGF/NK1-stimulated Grb2-c-Met interaction by co-immunoprecipitation following treatment of cells with compound 1 for varying time periods (Fig. 2 E). Very short (10 min) exposure of cells to 300 nm compound 1 had no effect on Grb2-c-Met interaction (data not shown). With increasing time of exposure to this treatment, Grb2-c-Met association diminished gradually over 6 h; association was inhibited by more than 50% after 2–4 h (Fig. 2 E). Similar experiments using 10-fold lower concentrations of compound 1 also revealed a gradual increase in inhibition, reaching 50% inhibition after 8 h (data not shown). Although these experiments are not definitive, the simple time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of Grb2-c-Met interaction observed is consistent with passive diffusion of these compounds across the plasma membrane. Three well established cultured cell systems representing hematopoietic and epithelial HGF targets were used to evaluate the effects of the Grb2 SH2 domain antagonists on HGF-stimulated DNA synthesis: 32D/c-Met cells (37Day R.M.

https://openalex.org/W1528290531,"Severe congenital neutropenia is a heritable human disorder characterized by neutropenia and acute myelogenous leukemia. We recently determined that the majority of cases result fromde novo or autosomal dominantly inherited heterozygous mutations in ELA2, encoding neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is a chymotryptic serine protease localized in granules of neutrophils and monocytes and is the major target of inhibition of the serpin α1-antitrypsin. The mutations causing severe congenital neutropenia consist of amino acid missense substitutions, in-frame deletion, splice donor mutation producing a deletion, splice acceptor mutation causing insertion of novel residues, and protein truncating mutations of the carboxyl terminus resulting from nonsense substitutions and deletions leading to frameshifts. We have expressed 14 mutant forms of neutrophil elastase in vitro and have characterized their biochemical properties. The mutations have variable effects on proteolytic activity, eliminating the possibility that the disease results from haploinsufficiency. There is no evidence that the mutant enzymes are cytotoxic. The mutant enzymes retain vulnerability to inhibition by α1-antitrypsin, but demonstrate variable avidity for interaction with this serpin. Somewhat surprisingly, the mutant enzymes inhibit the wild type enzyme when both are coexpressed within the same cell, suggesting the potential to interfere with normal subcellular trafficking or post-translational processing.

Commencing at birth, the human disorder severe congenital neutropenia (sometimes known as “Kostmann syndrome”) is typified by circulating neutrophil counts of less than 200 μl− 1 (normal >1,800 μl− 1) but generally normal quantities of other blood cells. Since neutrophils are the primary phagocyte of the blood responsible for defending against sepsis, affected individuals develop chronic infections. The bone marrow in SCN1 is characterized by a promyelocytic maturation arrest (1Kostmann R. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1975; 64: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). About 10% of individuals with SCN develop acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplasia (2Freedman M.H. Bonilla M.A. Fier C. Bolyard A.A. Scarlata D. Boxer L.A. Brown S. Cham B. Kannourakis G. Kinsey S.E. Mori P.G. Cottle T. Welte K. Dale D.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar), often with characteristic bone marrow cytogenetic abnormalities comprised of monosomy 7 and trisomy 21. SCN was first described in consanguineous Swedish families, where it results from autosomal recessive inheritance (1Kostmann R. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1975; 64: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). More commonly, however, the illness results from apparent autosomal dominant inheritance or arises sporadically in the absence of a family history, presumably as a consequence of new dominant mutations (3Dale D.C. Guerry D.T. Wewerka J.R. Bull J.M. Chusid M.J. Medicine. 1979; 58: 128-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). SCN was once thought to be caused by constitutional mutations of the gene encoding the GCSF receptor (GCSFR) (4Dong F. Brynes R.K. Tidow N. Welte K. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), but it is now known thatGCSFR mutations are not the cause of SCN, instead occurring somatically in the bone marrow of some patients in association with leukemia (5Avalos B.R.

Horwitz M. Blood. 2000; 96: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an autosomal dominant illness with a 21-day cycle of oscillating neutropenia, and about 75% of cases of SCN (11Dale D.C. Person R.E. Bolyard A.A. Aprikyan A.G. Bos C. Bonilla M.A. Boxer L.A. Kannourakis G. Zeidler C. Welte K. Benson K.F. Horwitz M. Blood. 2000; 96: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) result from heterozygous, autosomal dominant mutations in ELA2, encoding neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase (EC 3.4.21.37) is a monomeric polypeptide of about 25 kDa synthesized in promyelocytes and promonocytes and predominantly localized in azurophilic cytoplasmic granules (reviewed in Refs. 12Bieth J.G. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 54-60Google Scholar and13Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It possesses activity toward a wide variety of proteins, including matrix components, clotting factors, immunoglobulins, and complement. Released from neutrophils migrating to sites of inflammation, it is thought responsible for tissue destruction in pulmonary emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, and the adult respiratory distress syndrome, among other illnesses. Consequently, its activity is counteracted by a variety of endogenous inhibitors, including the serpins α1-antitrypsin and ELANH2 and the nonserpin elafin. Neutrophil elastase was once purified as “medullasin” based on its cytokine activity. It induces activated killer lymphocytes (14Lindemann R.A. Lala A. Miyasaki K.T. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 9: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), cleaves aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to yield one polypeptide with interleukin-8-like activity and another promoting leukocyte and monocyte chemotaxis (15Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and further modulates the expression of components of the inflammatory response, including ICAM-1 (16Champagne B. Tremblay P. Cantin A. St. Pierre Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6398-6405PubMed Google Scholar). Given the plurality of its activities and hence myriad potential pathogenic mechanisms, we here undertake to biochemically characterize the properties of the variety of mutant forms of neutrophil elastase causing SCN. We have considered three genetic hypotheses compatible with the autosomal dominant inheritance of SCN resulting from mutant forms of neutrophil elastase. First, it is possible that the mutations merely disable protease activity, and the disease is a result of haploinsufficiency. We have therefore measured enzymatic activity of each of the mutants. Second, the mutant enzymes could gain a novel function. We examine two potential gain of function activities, toxic gain of function and loss of inhibition by α1-antitrypsin. Third, the mutant enzymes may have the potential to be a dominant negative inhibitor of the wild type protease; we address this hypothesis through coexpression of both wild type and mutant enzymes. cDNAs of neutrophil elastase and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I (DPPI) were reverse transcribed from total RNA of human HL-60 leukemia cells (10Horwitz M. Benson K.F. Person R.E. Aprikyan A.G. Dale D.C. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). By designing appropriate polymerase chain reaction primers, the Kozak consensus leader sequence for maximum translational efficiency was introduced, and the flanking restriction enzyme sites EcoRI and XbaI were included for subsequent subcloning into the PCS2+ expression vector (17Rupp R.A.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) containing a simian cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer. Individual clones were isolated and sequenced to verify the integrity of reading frame and confirm that polymerase chain reaction introduced no mutations. The α1-antitrypsin cDNA (19Barr D. Tubb J.

Site-directed mutagenesis employing oligonucleotide cassettes was used to construct each of the neutrophil elastase mutations and the M358R α1-antitrypsin negative control.

Laurie Milner (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) and Thalia Papayannopoulou (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Media for RBL-1 cells consisted of minimal essential medium supplemented with 12.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. 32D cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium with 15% FBS, with the addition of 1% essential amino acids, 0.5% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% glutamine, 15 mg/mll-asparagine, 5 mg/ml l-serine, 0.4% minimal essential medium vitamins, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% WEHI-3 conditioned medium. WEHI-3 conditioned medium was generated by growing WEHI-3 cells, a gift of Dr. Papayannopoulou, in RPMI medium containing 2% FBS. 106 or half that quantity of cells were seeded onto 10-cm cell culture dishes for enzymatic assays and immunoprecipitation or microscope coverslips in 6-cm cell culture dishes for immunofluorescent staining and apoptosis assays, respectively, then transiently transfected by LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 4 or 2 μg of DNA, respectively (unless stated otherwise), following the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of a β-galactosidase (encoded by thelacZ gene in pCS2+C-β-gal (22Li F.Q. Coonrod A. Horwitz M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5129-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) expression plasmid was included in each transfection as an internal control for enzymatic assays. 24 h after transfection, neutrophil elastase and β-galactosidase activities were measured, with normalization of neutrophil elastase activity to β-galactosidase activity. Transfections were performed in triplicate, repeated at least three times, and the mean and standard error for a representative set of triplicates were reported. A modification of a prior protocol (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.M. Nilsson E. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was used to prepare cell extracts. 106 transfected cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cell pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of 250 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. 30 μl was aliquoted for β-galactosidase assay, performed as described previously (24Li F.Q. Coonrod A. Horwitz M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The concentration was adjusted to 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1m MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 in a 300-μl volume. Cells were lysed with one freeze-thaw cycle, followed by homogenization for 20 s at position 3 using an ultrasonicator (Model W185F, Heat Systems-Ultrasonics). The lysate was then diluted to a 500-μl volume with a concentration of 700 mm NaCl, 60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 600 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C for 1 h (to remove DNA). The collected supernatant was adjusted to a final volume of 600 μl at a concentration of 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 1 mNaCl, 500 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 and mixed with 20 μl of substrate: 100 mm suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA (Elastin Products Co.)

Chem. 1979; 254: 4027-4032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with all substrates dissolved in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 40 °C and terminated with the addition of 300 μl of 200 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and spectrophotometrically measured absorbance at 405 nm. Activities were blanked against sample extracts prepared from cells transfected with the empty expression vector. Neutrophil elastase enzymatic activity was also determined with the EnzChek elastase assay kit (Molecular Probes). Cell extracts were mixed with DQ-elastin labeled with BODIPY FL dye in the presence or absence of 30 μm of the selective inhibitor MeOsuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone. Fluorescence intensity was measured following incubation of the reaction in the dark for 1 h at room temperature at excitation/emission of 485/530 nm. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with transfer to nitrocellulose membranes was used for separation of cell extracts. Primary antibodies were 1:1,000 rabbit polyclonal antibody to human neutrophil elastase (Calbiochem) or 1:600 murine monoclonal antibody AHN-10 to α1-antitrypsin (Research Diagnostics) diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, plus 5% nonfat dry milk. Secondary detection used a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory) or 1:1,500 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was stripped and reprobed with mouse monoclonal antibody 6C5 to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Biodesign International) to standardize for variations in protein loading. Following transient cotransfection of either wild type or mutants of neutrophil elastase with α1-antitrypsin expression constructs, cells were lysed in 400 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 135 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol followed by a 10-s sonication. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, normalized for protein concentration, and incubated using 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-neutrophil elastase antiserum (Calbiochem) at 4 °C overnight on a rotating platform, followed by addition of 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry (Sigma) and an additional 1-h incubation. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by brief centrifugation and then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Western blot conditions described above were then used for detection. Cells were fixed and stained as described previously (22Li F.Q. Coonrod A. Horwitz M. Mol. Cell.

Nuclei were counterstained for 1 min in 0.5 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescence and phase contrast photomicroscopy were performed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine filter sets with 15–30-s exposure on Kodak Elitechrome 400. Transparencies were scanned onto a Kodak Photo CD and composited with Adobe Photoshop software (to adjust size, brightness, and contrast). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad Radiance system. RBL-1 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and then transiently transfected with wild type or mutant neutrophil elastase constructs. The ApoAlert DNA fragmentation kit (CLONTECH) was used with these modifications; cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 25 min and permeabilized by incubation for 5 min in ice-cold 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After incorporating fluorescein-dUTP at the 3′-hydroxyl termini of the fragmented DNA from apoptotic cells, staining was performed using 1:500 diluted rabbit polyclonal antibody to human neutrophil elastase (Calbiochem) and 1:200 dilution of rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory) in PBS. The ApoAlert Annexin V apoptosis kit (CLONTECH) was used following manufacturer's directions. The ELA2 mutations responsible for SCN are depicted in Fig. 1. We list here an additional person with the G185R mutation, whom we have not previously reported. Among 22 unique patients we have identified 17 different mutations, predicted to result in 16 distinctive mutant neutrophil elastase polypeptides, comprising eight single-base amino acid missense substitutions (A28T, I31T, C42S, V72M, S97L, P110L, G181V, and G185R), three single-base nonsense mutations (G192ter, S196ter, and Y199ter), two single-base deletion mutations causing frameshifts with premature termination near the carboxyl terminus (P200fs and P205fs), one 24-base pair in-frame deletion of exon 4 (ΔV145-C152), two single-base substitutions leading to splicing errors (11Dale D.C.

Four of the mutations occur in SCN patients who have developed acute myelogenous leukemia (I31T, V72M, and IVS3–8SA/Q93+PQ) or myelodysplasia (ΔV145-C152). We have elected to express the mutant proteins in vitro, rather than purifying the enzymes from patient neutrophils, because the mutations occur heterozygously, in which case it would prove difficult to purify the mutant away from the wild type protein, and because many of the patients with this rare disease are no longer living or reside in geographically disperse locales. The rat basophilic/mast cell line RBL-1 does not demonstrate endogenous neutrophil elastase activity and has previously been used successfully to express human neutrophil elastase (23Gullberg U.

Persson A.M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We engineered expression vectors for the wild type, 14 of the 16 different mutant polypeptides, and a negative control (S173A), in which the catalytic serine residue was substituted. (We did not analyze the second premature termination mutation, G196ter, because this mutation is adjacent to the other two premature termination mutants, G192ter and G199ter. We also did not analyze the truncating mutation P200fs, because this mutation is adjacent to Y199ter, which similarly prematurely terminates the polypeptide.) We then transiently transfected each of this panel expressing the 16 different versions of neutrophil elastase in RBL-1 cells (Fig. 2 A). To ensure that each of the mutants was appropriately expressed, we immunofluorescently stained the cells with a polyclonal neutrophil elastase antiserum. Each of the mutants, except ΔV145-C152 and G185R, can be detected by immunofluorescent staining in about 12% of cells following transfection. We did not observe immunofluorescent staining of ΔV145-C152 and G185R; however, all of the mutants, including ΔV145-C152 and G185R, can be detected by Western blot following denaturing PAGE (see Fig. 3 E). Presumably these two mutations, in concert with the fixation process, disrupt the epitope recognized by the antiserum for immunofluorescent staining but not Western blots. Because each of the mutants can be expressed as efficiently as the wild type enzyme, as shown by either immunofluorescent staining, Western blot, or both, we can conclude that the mutations are unlikely to grossly alter protein stability and that expression of the mutants is unlikely to prove toxic to cells.Figure 3Activity of neutrophil elastase mutations causing SCN.

We therefore also attempted to determine whether the mutant forms of the enzyme were intracellularly mislocalized by examining the transfected cells with confocal microscopy. Although it can be seen that the wild type enzyme translocates to the granules of RBL-1 cells (Fig.1 B), as has been reported previously (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.M. Nilsson E. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), light microscopic resolution proves inadequate to determine conclusively whether the mutants were similarly correctly localized (data not shown). We are addressing this problem in more extensive, pending experiments employing biochemical methods to subfractionate the cellular compartments. The first hypothesis is that the effect of the neutrophil elastase mutations is to merely inactivate enzymatic activity, thereby causing the SCN phenotype through haploinsufficiency. To test this possibility, we transfected the panel of mutant neutrophil elastase constructs into RBL-1 cells and assayed their activity in a post-nuclear supernatant on peptide substrates. We first tested activity (Fig. 3 A) on suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA (25Bieth J. Spiess B. Wermuth C.G. Biochem. Med. 1974; 11: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), as it is perhaps the most commonly employed experimental substrate. As an internal control, we cotransfected a lacZexpression vector, simultaneously assayed for β-galactosidase activity, and normalized neutrophil elastase activity to β-galactosidase activity. (Given relatively uniform β-galactosidase activity, normalization did not significantly change the specific activity of the mutants, however.) Most of the mutations result in reduced levels of proteolytic activity, but two mutations (G199ter and P205fs) retain near wild type levels of activity, while others (S97L and V72M) demonstrate about a third as much activity, and still others (C42S) have levels of activity no different from the S173A negative control. To confirm this result, we repeated the transfection and cell extract preparat"

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeexpresses enzymes that can synthesize and degrade S1P and related molecules, but their possible role in calcium signaling has not yet been tested. Here we examine the effects of S1P accumulation on calcium signaling using a variety of yeast mutants. Treatment of yeast cells with exogenous sphingosine stimulated Ca2+accumulation through two distinct pathways. The first pathway required the Cch1p and Mid1p subunits of a Ca2+ influx channel, depended upon the function of sphingosine kinases (Lcb4p and Lcb5p), and was inhibited by the functions of S1P lyase (Dpl1p) and the S1P phosphatase (Lcb3p). The biologically inactive stereoisomer of sphingosine did not activate this Ca2+ influx pathway, suggesting that the active S1P isomer specifically stimulates a calcium-signaling mechanism in yeast. The second Ca2+influx pathway stimulated by the addition of sphingosine was not stereospecific, was not dependent on the sphingosine kinases, occurred only at higher doses of added sphingosine, and therefore was likely to be nonspecific. Mutants lacking both S1P lyase and phosphatase (dpl1 lcb3 double mutants) exhibited constitutively high Ca2+ accumulation and signaling in the absence of added sphingosine, and these effects were dependent on the sphingosine kinases. These results show that endogenous S1P-related molecules can also trigger Ca2+ accumulation and signaling. Several stimuli previously shown to evoke calcium signaling in wild-type cells were examined in lcb4 lcb5 double mutants. All of the stimuli produced calcium signals independent of sphingosine kinase activity, suggesting that phosphorylated sphingoid bases might serve as messengers of calcium signaling in yeast during an unknown cellular response.

In RBL-2H3 cells, for example, the clustering of the IgE receptor FcεRI activates sphingosine kinase, resulting in S1P production. Inhibitors of sphingosine kinases block the agonist-stimulated accumulation of S1P and also suppress the normal mobilization of Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (2Choi O.H. Kim J.H.

In permeabilized cells, S1P also triggers the release of Ca2+ through a mechanism independent of the known Ca2+ release pathways, suggesting that S1P activates a novel type of a Ca2+ release channel (3Mattie M.

The enzymes in yeast responsible for phosphorylation of endogenous phytosphingosine and exogenous long chain bases such as sphingosine have recently been identified. Two related sphingosine kinases were identified in yeast as the products of the LCB4 and LCB5 genes (7Nagiec M.M. Skrzypek M. Nagiec E.E. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol.

Mutants lacking S1P lyase (dpl1/bst1 mutants) accumulate phyto-S1P and dihydro-S1P at slightly elevated levels (9Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J.

These effects are further exacerbated in dpl1 lcb3 double mutants lacking both S1P lyase and the major S1P phosphatase with 500 times greater levels of phyto-S1P and dihydro-S1P relative to wild type (7Nagiec M.M.

However, homologs of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase-type Ca2+ pump and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or ryanodine receptors, which supply and release Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum in animal cells, are not evident in the yeast genome. Nevertheless, the yeast endoplasmic reticulum accumulates sufficient Ca2+ to facilitate protein folding and secretion, in part through Pmr1p, a member of the secretory pathway calcium ATPase family (21Strayle J.

Sequences of the mammalian S1P-receptor involved in Ca2+ release from microsomes have not been reported. Here we show that conversion of exogenously added sphingosine to sphingosine 1-phosphate stimulates Ca2+ influx, accumulation, and signaling in yeast. Similar to the CCE-like mechanism of yeast (15Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the calcium channel subunit Cch1p was required for the majority of S1P-stimulated Ca2+ accumulation. Therefore, yeast may retain S1P-regulated calcium-signaling mechanisms analogous to those of mammalian cells. All yeast strains (TableI) were maintained on either YPD medium or synthetic complete medium (SC) lacking leucine or uracil.

Exogenous sphingosine added to culture medium can be taken up by yeast cells and phosphorylated to S1P by sphingosine kinases (13Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). S1P can be dephosphorylated by the phosphatase Lcb3p or degraded by the lyase Dpl1p (11Mandala S.M.

To determine whether S1P accumulation can evoke calcium signaling in yeast, we first monitored the accumulation of 45Ca2+ from the medium into growing yeast cells treated with a wide range of exogenous sphingosine. The addition of sphingosine to the culture medium at concentrations >25 μm stimulated 45Ca2+ accumulation in wild-type yeast strains up to 2× the basal level (Fig.1 A). Mutants lacking the S1P phosphatase (lcb3 mutants) were indistinguishable from wild type in this assay. In contrast, dpl1 mutants lacking S1P lyase accumulated 5-fold higher amounts of45Ca2+ after treatment with only 10–15 μm sphingosine. These results show that exogenous sphingosine can stimulate Ca2+ accumulation and that this response can be inhibited by the S1P lyase Dpl1p. If phosphorylation of exogenous sphingosine was required to promote Ca2+ influx, mutants lacking the sphingosine kinases would exhibit less Ca2+ accumulation after treatment with sphingosine. Indeed, the 5-fold increase in45Ca2+ accumulation seen in a dpl1mutant at 12.5 μm sphingosine was abolished in dpl1 lcb4 lcb5 triple mutants (Fig. 1 B, left), indicating that this dramatic increase in Ca2+ accumulation was dependent on the S1P produced by Lcb4p and Lcb5p. However, thelcb4 lcb5 double mutants exhibited wild-type sensitivity to sphingosine (Fig. 1 B, right). Thus, exogenous sphingosine produced two separable calcium responses in yeast, one that was relatively small and independent of sphingosine kinases and another larger response that was dependent on sphingosine kinases and sensitive to S1P lyase and phosphatase. All future experiments will examine the properties of the latter S1P-specific response, which is prominent indpl1 mutants. Sphingosine kinases typically phosphorylate the naturald-isomer of sphingosine and are unable to act on thel-isomer (8Lanterman M.M. Saba J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The addition of l-sphingosine to yeast cultures stimulated 45Ca2+ accumulation in dpl1 mutants only at very high concentrations similar to those effective in dpl1 lcb4 lcb5 triple mutants (Fig.1 C). Thus, l-sphingosine failed to stimulate Ca2+ accumulation through the pathway involving sphingosine kinases even in the supersensitive dpl1 strain. The results confirm the existence of two separable responses to added sphingosine, one that is not stereospecific or dependent on sphingosine kinases and one that is specific for the biologically active d-isomer of sphingosine, dependent on sphingosine kinases, and sensitive to S1P lyase and phosphatase. Yeast and other fungi synthesize phytosphingosine rather than sphingosine, as well as its precursor dihydrosphingosine. These molecules differ in the level of saturation and hydroxylation at C-4 (35Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Exogenous phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine stimulated the nonspecific Ca2+ response much like sphingosine but only weakly stimulated the specific Ca2+ response indpl1 mutants (Fig.2 A). The weaker effects of exogenous phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine might be explained if they are poorer substrates than sphingosine for the kinases (7Nagiec M.M. Skrzypek M. Nagiec E.E. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19437-19442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Lanterman M.M. Saba J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or if their phosphorylated products are better substrates than S1P for Lcb3p. The lcb3 single mutants accumulate approximately 10-fold higher levels of phyto-S1P and dihydro-S1P than wild type during vegetative growth (9Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but they do not accumulate more45Ca2+ than wild type with or without added sphingosine (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, a higher threshold level of the native S1Ps may be necessary to stimulate Ca2+influx. To evaluate the possible roles of phyto-S1P and dihydro-S1P more carefully, we measured 45Ca2+ accumulation into a dpl1 lcb3 double mutant. A dpl1 lcb3double mutant that is also auxotrophic for certain amino acids is inviable in standard medium unless sphingosine kinases are also inactivated (9Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a prototrophic dpl1 lcb3 double mutant is viable and accumulates ∼500 times higher levels of phyto-S1P and dihydro-S1P than wild type (14Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that the viable dpl1 lcb3 double mutant accumulated45Ca2+ from the medium at a constitutively high rate in the absence of added sphingolipids and also showed even greater sensitivity to added sphingosine than dpl1 mutants (Fig.1 A). The high rate of 45Ca2+accumulation in dpl1 lcb3 double mutants was not observed indpl1 lcb3 lcb4 lcb5 quadruple mutants (Fig. 2 B), which fail to accumulate detectable levels of dihydro-S1P and phyto-S1P (9Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results confirm that accumulation of S1P-related molecules native to yeast can stimulate 45Ca2+ influx and accumulation and suggest that Dpl1p inhibits the response more potently than Lcb3p. Cch1p was identified previously as the probable pore-forming subunit of a plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channel that is activated by a variety of stimuli (22Paidhungat M. Garrett S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Fischer M. Schnell N. Chattaway J. Davies P. Dixon G. Sanders D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To determine whether S1P stimulates Cch1p activity, we monitored Ca2+ accumulation in adpl1 mutant and a cch1 dpl1 double mutant after the addition of sphingosine. The dpl1 cch1 double mutant displayed sensitivity to sphingosine, which was similar to that of thedpl1 single mutant, but the maximal level of45Ca2+ accumulation was lower in the cch1 dpl1 double mutant than in the dpl1 single mutant (Fig.3, A and B). The residual effect of sphingosine in the cch1 dpl1 double mutant was not observed in cch1 dpl1 lcb4 lcb5 quadruple mutants. Therefore, the Cch1p channel was required for the major component of the S1P-stimulated 45Ca2+accumulation under these conditions. The kinetics of the S1P-specific response were monitored using cells expressing the calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin in the cytoplasm. Treatment of a dpl1 mutant with 12.5 μm sphingosine produced a detectable increase in aequorin luminescence within 60–80 min of treatment that rose sharply and reached a plateau for at least 1 h (Fig. 4, A andB) (data not shown). Treatment of a dpl1 lcb4 lcb5 triple mutant in a parallel experiment resulted in little aequorin luminescence over this time frame, indicating that S1P accumulation elevates cytosolic-free Ca2+([Ca2+]c) primarily via the specific pathway. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide completely abolished the response of dpl1 mutants to sphingosine (Fig.4 B), suggesting that protein synthesis was necessary for Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]c elevation in response to sphingosine. Aequorin luminescence in dpl1mutants was also abolished by the addition of the Ca2+ ion chelator BAPTA to the culture medium, suggesting that the [Ca2+]c elevation observed was the result of extracellular Ca2+ influx and not intracellular Ca2+ release (Fig. 4 A). In summary, the specific response to S1P stimulated Ca2+ influx through Cch1p and elevated [Ca2+]c. To determine whether [Ca2+]c elevation in response to S1P could activate downstream signaling pathways, the expression of a calcineurin-dependent reporter genePMC1-lacZ was quantitated in cells treated with sphingosine. Sphingosine treatment induced the expression of PMC1-lacZ in a dpl1 mutant but not in dpl1 lcb4 lcb5 triple mutants (Fig. 5 A). The induction of PMC1-lacZ in dpl1 mutants was completely blocked by treatment with either FK506, a cell-permeant inhibitor of calcineurin, or membrane-impermeant BAPTA (Fig.5 B). Therefore, the S1P-specific response activated the calcineurin-signaling pathway in yeast by a mechanism requiring influx of extracellular Ca2+. In dpl1 lcb3 double mutants, PMC-lacZ expression was constitutively high in the absence of added sphingosine. This expression still required the function of the sphingosine kinases Lcb4p and Lcb5p and was sensitive to calcineurin inhibitors (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that accumulation of S1P and related endogenous molecules can stimulate calcium influx and signaling in yeast. Several external stimuli lead to the generation of calcium signals in yeast. Although none of these stimuli has been shown to affect metabolism of S1P-related molecules, it is conceivable that one or more of these stimuli causes increased accumulation of S1Ps, which then triggers calcium signaling. To test whether endogenous S1P-related molecules are required for generating calcium signals in response to known physiological stimuli, we compared the calcium responses of wild type or dpl1 mutant cells to those oflcb4 lcb5 or dpl1 lcb4 lcb5 mutant cells lacking sphingosine kinases over a wide range of conditions. The first stimulus tested, α-mating factor, triggers Ca2+ influx and signaling after a time lag similar to that of sphingosine (18Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10482-10486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that α-mating factor stimulated Ca2+ influx and calcineurin-dependent induction of PMC1-lacZ inlcb4 lcb5 double mutants to the same degree as in wild type (Fig. 6 A) (data not shown). Thus, the sphingosine kinases (and presumably their products) were not required for Ca2+ signaling invoked in response to α-mating factor. The second stimulus tested, high salt, also induced the calcineurin-dependent expression ofFKS2-lacZ to an equal extent in wild type and in lcb4 lcb5 double mutants (Fig. 6 B). Next, the acute heat shock produced by shifting cells grown at 25–39 °C stimulated a transient elevation of [Ca2+]c in bothdpl1 and dpl1 lcb4 lcb5 mutants as detected by aequorin luminescence (Fig. 6 C). Hypotonic shock produced by diluting cells grown in standard medium with hypotonic medium (36Batiza A.F. Schulz T. Masson P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23357-23362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) also stimulated aequorin luminescence in both wild type and lcb4 lcb5 double mutants (data not shown). Depletion of Ca2+ from secretory organelles using pmr1mutants was shown to stimulate Ca2+ accumulation in yeast (20Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Strayle J. Pozzan T. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4733-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, 45Ca2+ accumulation inpmr1 lcb4 lcb5 triple mutants was similar to that ofpmr1 mutants (Fig. 6 D). Chlorpromazine treatment stimulates Ca2+ influx and accumulation in wild-type cells (37Eilam Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 733: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and to an equal degree in lcb4 lcb5 double mutants (Fig. 6 E). Finally, Ca2+ accumulation inpgm2 mutants stimulated by growth in galactose medium (17Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) also occurred in pgm2 lcb4 lcb5 triple mutants (Fig.6 F). In summary, the sphingosine kinases Lcb4p and Lcb5p were not required for calcium-signaling events triggered by any of the seven known stimuli. Therefore, it appears that the upstream stimulus for S1P signaling in yeast defines a novel event in yeast calcium signaling. The results reported here suggest that accumulation of S1P or related molecules in yeast can stimulate Ca2+ influx via Cch1p and other factors, resulting in the elevation of [Ca2+]c and activation of calcineurin signaling. Several conditions shown previously to accumulate S1P or the native derivatives phyto-S1P and dihydro-S1P were found to stimulate Ca2+ influx and signaling in a manner requiring the homologous sphingosine kinases Lcb4p and Lcb5p. Dpl1p, the S1P lyase, potently blocked the Ca2+ influx responses with or without Lcb3p, the major S1P phosphatase. Lcb3p was less effective in this regard and only significant in dpl1 mutants, possibly because of the activity of Ysr3p, a minor S1P phosphatase homologous to Lcb3p (11Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Tu Z. Kurtz M.B. Nickels J. Broach J. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The direct targets or derivatives of S1P that lead to Ca2+ influx and signaling have not been determined. However, the 1-h lag time after the addition of sphingosine observed before the onset of Ca2+ influx and the sensitivity to cycloheximide suggests that the response might reflect the time necessary for expressing new proteins involved in Ca2+influx and sufficient buildup of S1P. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+ chelators such as BAPTA, sphingosine was completely unable to elevate [Ca2+]c (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, no evidence for S1P-triggered Ca2+ release was obtained in yeast thus far. Exogenous d-sphingosine also stimulated Ca2+accumulation to a smaller degree independent of the sphingosine kinases Lcb4p and Lcb5p. This kinase-independent response may be nonphysiological because a similar effect was detected using the biologically inactive isomer l-sphingosine and because of the very high doses necessary to achieve the response. We have noticed similar responses of yeast cells to low levels of other membrane active compounds such as lyso-phosphatidic acid and detergents. 3C. J. Birchwood, J. D. Saba, and K. W. Cunningham, unpublished observations. Unlike these nonspecific effects, the involvement of the Ca2+ channel protein Cch1p and the requirement for S1P biosynthesis and accumulation underscore the existence of specific mechanism for S1P-dependent calcium signaling in yeast. Cch1p activity was stimulated in pmr1 mutants (lacking the secretory pathway Ca2+ATPase) upon depletion of Ca2+ from secretory organelles (24Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Treatment of mammalian cells with thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase that rapidly depletes Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum and stimulates CCE mechanisms, was shown to stimulate sphingosine kinase activity (38Olivera A. Edsall L. Poulton S. Kazlauskas A. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, it seems improbable that accumulation of S1Ps serves as a messenger of CCE in yeast cells, because pmr1 lcb4 lcb5 triple mutants lacking the sphingosine kinases exhibited as much Ca2+ accumulation as pmr1 mutants (Fig. 6 D). Additionally, the injection of S1P in mammalian RBL cells failed to stimulate the CCE channel known as ICRAC, and inhibitors of sphingosine kinase failed to prevent ICRAC activation by thapsigargin (39Mathes C. Fleig A. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25020-25030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A more reasonable explanation is that accumulation of S1Ps stimulates CCE in animal and fungal cells by first triggering Ca2+ release from secretory organelles. S1P rapidly stimulates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells followed by stimulation of Ca2+ influx at the plasma membrane and signaling (3Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3181-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Gill D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1653-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The receptor for S1P has not been identified, but evidence suggests the Ca2+ release channel in the endoplasmic reticulum is distinct from the well characterized IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor (3Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3181-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these routes of Ca2+ release can rapidly deplete the endoplasmic reticulum of Ca2+ and activate CCE pathways. The yeast genome lacks sequences orthologous to the IP3 and ryanodine receptors, but nevertheless, yeast cells may utilize a mechanism resembling CCE to supply Ca2+to secretory organelles (24Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Our data do not rule out the possibility that S1P activates a new class of Ca2+ release channels in yeast that is potentially related to the unidentified S1P-receptor in animal cells. Support for this hypothesis might be obtained through the identification of new factors required for S1P-stimulated Ca2+ signaling in yeast. What is the purpose of S1P-stimulated Ca2+ influx and signaling in yeast? That yeast would encounter either high sphingosine environments or conditions inactivating both S1P lyase and phosphatase seems improbable. Therefore, we examined a number of previously described stimuli that lead to Ca2+ signaling in wild type and in lcb4 lcb5 double mutants and found no evidence for the involvement of S1P or its derivatives in any of the processes. It is possible that a significant contribution of S1Ps to Ca2+signaling was masked by the action of functionally redundant pathways, similar to what has been previously proposed for the sphingosine kinases in the heat stress response (35Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an untested stimulus may be found that causes S1P accumulation and stimulation of Ca2+ signaling. It seems probable that the stimulation of calcium influx and signaling by S1P is the result of a physiological phenomenon because of the similar responses to S1P in animal cells and the strong conservation of sphingosine kinases, S1P lyases, and S1P phosphatases among animals, fungi, and plants. Furthermore, sphingolipid perturbations have previously been shown to affect calcium homeostasis (32Tanida I. Takita Y. Hasegawa A. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 40Beeler T. Gable K. Zhao C. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7279-7284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps indicating cross-regulation of the two systems. The analysis of yeast mutants lacking S1P synthesis and degradation factors has produced few insights into their physiological roles. Mutants lacking Dpl1p and Lcb3p exhibit enhanced tolerance of acute heat shock, whereas mutants lacking the sphingosine kinases exhibit slightly enhanced sensitivity (8Lanterman M.M. Saba J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The levels of dihydro-S1P and phyto-S1P also increase transiently (∼10 min) after heat shock (14Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the degree of heat tolerance or sensitivity conferred by these mutants varies significantly with the conditions used (35Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We observed a transient elevation of [Ca2+]c after heat stress, but the kinetics and magnitude were similar in dpl1and dpl1 lcb4 lcb5 double mutants (Fig. 6 C). Thus, the activity of the sphingosine kinases (and hence the ability to make S1Ps) had no effect on known calcium-signaling pathways under the conditions tested. Endogenous S1P may also participate in the normal diauxic shift of yeast cultures (8Lanterman M.M. Saba J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Gottlieb D. Heideman W. Saba J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have not yet detected significant Ca2+ signaling events during the transition to diauxic growth. Therefore, S1P-mediated calcium signaling represents a novel calcium-signaling pathway in yeast that is, thus far, potentially activated by undiscovered stimuli.

Lipid Res. 1973; 14: 215-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are also formed during the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from excess surface material. In addition, lipid-free apoA-I can mediate the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipid from cells generating preβ-migrating nascent HDL (7Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) appears to play a key role in this process although the exact mechanism is unclear (9Young S.G. Fielding C.J. Nat.

Cholesterol that is transferred to nascent HDL is esterified by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) to cholesteryl esters, which by virtue of their hydrophobicity move into the core of the HDL particle resulting in the formation of α-migrating spherical HDL. HDL cholesteryl esters are cleared from plasma mainly by the liver (13Pittman R.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor Jr., C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Goldberg D.I. Beltz W.F. Pittman R.C. J. Clin.

Meidell R.S. Hobbs H.H. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1483-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDL cholesteryl ester uptake by the liver is mediated by the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), which selectively transports HDL cholesteryl esters resulting in an HDL particle of reduced size and cholesteryl ester content (17Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4077-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In species with cholesteryl ester transfer protein, a portion of HDL cholesteryl ester is transferred to lower density apoB-containing lipoproteins and ultimately cleared mainly by the liver via the LDL receptor pathway (19Bruce C. Chouinard Jr., R.A. Tall A.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 297-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The final step in the RCT pathway is excretion of cholesterol from the liver into bile, either directly or after conversion to bile acids. Although individual steps in the RCT pathway have been studied in detail, little is known about what regulates cholesterol flux through the entire pathway. The main obstacle to such studies has been the inability to directly quantify cholesterol flux in the RCT pathwayin vivo. One approach that has been used in animal models is to quantify the rate of cholesterol acquisition in extrahepatic tissues as a measure of cholesterol flux through the RCT pathway because in a steady state the rate of cholesterol acquisition by extrahepatic tissues (from de novo synthesis and lipoproteins) equals the rate of cholesterol return to the liver for excretion (with the exception of cholesterol that is converted to steroid hormones or lost when cells are sloughed from the gastrointestinal tract or skin). Studies using this approach have shown that plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations can be varied over a wide range as a result of diet or genetic manipulation with no change in the rate of reverse cholesterol transport (20Osono Y. Woollett L.A. Herz J. Dietschy J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1124-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 21Woollett L.A. Kearney D.M. Spady D.K. J.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1384-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of the current studies was to determine if enhancing individual steps in the RCT pathway increases cholesterol flux through the entire pathway. The RCT pathway involves a series of steps beginning with cholesterol efflux from cells in extrahepatic tissues and ending with the excretion of this cholesterol by the liver and its loss in the feces. If one of these steps is rate-limiting, then up-regulation of this step may result in increased cholesterol flux through the entire pathway. Conversely, if all steps are functioning at maximal capacity or if cholesterol can be diverted out of the pathway at one or more points then up-regulating individual steps may not increase cholesterol flux through the RCT pathway.

Animals were subjected to light cycling for at least 2 weeks before specific experiments, which were performed during the mid-dark phase of the light cycle. All experiments were performed in nonfasting male mice that were within the age range of 3–6 months. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. The recombinant adenovirus AdCMV-LCAT, carrying a gene encoding mouse LCAT expressed from a human cytomegalovirus promoter, was generated by homologous recombination in 293 cells as described previously (26Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M. Meidell R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding murine LCAT was generously provided by Dr. Catherine Hedrick (University of Virginia).

Meidell R.S. Circulation. 1994; 90: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were described previously. Large scale production of recombinant adenovirus was performed by infecting confluent monolayers of 293 cells grown in 15-cm tissue culture plates with primary stock at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1–1.0 (28Kopfler W.P. Willard M.N. Betz T. Willard J.E. Gerard R.D. Meidell R.S. Circulation. 1994; 90: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Infected monolayers were lysed with Nonidet P-40 when >90% of the cells showed cytopathic changes, and recombinant virus was purified by precipitation with polyethylene glycol 8000, centrifugation on a discontinuous CsCl density gradient, and desalting by chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B. Purified virus eluting in the void volume was collected, snap frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until used. Virus titer was determined by plaque assay in monolayer cultures of 293 cells. Rates of cholesterol synthesis were measured in vivo using [3H]water. Mice were administered ∼25 mCi of [3H]water intraperitoneally and then returned to cages under a fume hood as previously described (16Spady D.K. Woollett L.A. Meidell R.S. Hobbs H.H. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1483-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two hours after the injection of [3H]water, the animals were anesthetized and exsanguinated through the inferior vena cava. Aliquots of plasma were taken for the determination of body water specific activity, and samples of liver and various extrahepatic tissues were taken for the isolation of digitonin-precipitable sterols. The entire remaining carcass was also taken for the isolation of digitonin-precipitable sterols. Rates of sterol synthesis are expressed as the nanomoles of [3H]water incorporated into digitonin-precipitable sterols per h per g wet weight of tissue (nmol/h per g). Mouse HDL was isolated in the density range of 1.07–1.21 g/ml using sequential preparative ultracentrifugation and standard techniques (29Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6476) Google Scholar) and labeled with either the intracellularly trapped [1α,2α-3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether (18Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B.

Taylor Jr., C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hough J.L. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 792: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Rates of HDL cholesteryl ether transport were determined using a primed infusion protocol as previously described (16Spady D.K. Woollett L.A. Meidell R.S. Hobbs H.H. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1483-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were administered a priming dose of [3H]cholesteryl ether-labeled HDL intravenously followed by a continuous infusion of the same radiolabeled lipoprotein at a rate determined in preliminary studies to maintain a constant plasma specific activity. The primed infusions of [3H]cholesteryl ether-labeled HDL were continued for 4 h at which time each animal was administered [14C]cholesteryl ester-labeled HDL intravenously (as a marker of the volume of plasma within each tissue) and sacrificed 10 min later. Plasma and tissue samples were assayed for their3H and 14C content as previously described (16Spady D.K. Woollett L.A. Meidell R.S. Hobbs H.H. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1483-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue spaces achieved by the labeled HDL at 10 min (14C dpm/g of tissue divided by the 14C dpm/μl of plasma) and at 4 h and 10 min (3H dpm/g of tissue divided by the steady-state 3H dpm/μl of plasma) were then calculated and have the units of microliters/g. The increase in tissue space over the 4-h experimental time period equals the rate of radiolabeled HDL cholesteryl ether movement into each organ and is expressed as the microliters of plasma cleared of its HDL cholesteryl ether content/h/g of tissue (16Spady D.K. Woollett L.A. Meidell R.S. Hobbs H.H. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1483-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Feces were collected daily for 4 days beginning immediately after the intravenous administration of rHDL. Feces were dried, weighed, and ground. A 1-g aliquot of this material was used to determine total bile acid content by an enzymatic method as previously described (33Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M.D. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 399: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). A second 1-g aliquot was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis at 120–130 °C for 12 h. After drying the sample, 10 ml of water and 10 ml of ethanol were added. The sample was extracted in 15 ml of petroleum ether to which 1.0 mg of 5-cholestene (Sigma) had been added as an internal standard. The amount of cholesterol, coprostanol, epicoprostanol, and cholestanone in the extracts was quantified by gas chromatography (33Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M.D. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 399: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The daily excretion rates of both bile acid and neutral sterol are expressed as micromole/day per 100 g of body weight. Tissue SR-BI, LDL receptor, ABCA1, LCAT, apoA-I, and 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels were determined using a ribonuclease protection assay. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or β-actin was used as an internal control. Species-specific 32P-labeled riboprobes were synthesized using MAXIscript in vitro transcription kits (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) in the presence of 3 μm(SR-BI, LDL receptor, ABCA1, LCAT, and 7α-hydroxylase) or 100 μm (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin) labeled nucleotide. Samples of liver were homogenized in RNA STAT-60 (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Total RNA (40 μg) was hybridized with32P-labeled riboprobes simultaneously at 68 °C using the HybSpeed RPA protocol (Ambion Inc). Following RNase digestion, the mRNA-protected 32P-labeled probes were separated on 8m urea, 5% polyacrylamide gels together with32P-labeled MspI-digested pBR322 size standards. The radioactivity in each band, as well as background radioactivity, was quantified using a phosphorimaging system (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Plasma lipoproteins were separated by FPLC using a Superose 6 HR column (Sigma). Two-hundred-μl aliquots were collected and used for apoA-I and lipid assays. The following assays were performed on plasma and FPLC column fractions: total cholesterol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, catalogue number 1127771), free cholesterol (Wako Chemicals, USA, catalogue number 274-47109), phospholipid (Wako Chemicals, catalogue number 990-54009), and apoA-I (Sigma, catalogue number 356-A). Liver cholesterol was quantified by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. The data are presented as mean ± 1 S.D. To test for differences among groups, one-way analysis of variance was performed. Significant results were further analyzed using the Tukey multiple comparison procedure. These studies were undertaken to determine if cholesterol flux through the RCT pathway can be increased by up-regulating individual steps in the pathway. The initial step in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway is efflux of cholesterol to circulating acceptor particles. Extrahepatic tissues acquire cholesterol mainly fromde novo synthesis (21Woollett L.A. Kearney D.M. Spady D.K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2289-2302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is tightly regulated by cholesterol availability (34Nakanishi M. Goldstein J. Brown M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4518) Google Scholar) and the rate of cholesterol synthesis or the cholesterol content of a tissue will be altered in response to changes in sterol influx or efflux. We therefore measured cholesterol synthesis rates and cholesterol concentrations in the extrahepatic tissues under conditions in which individual steps in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway were accelerated. Working backwards from the liver, the final step in the RCT pathway is the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids and their excretion into bile. We stimulated this step in the RCT pathway by overexpressing hepatic 7α-hydroxylase and determined the effect on cholesterol synthesis rates and concentrations in the extrahepatic tissues. Rates of cholesterol synthesis were measured in vivo 3 days after the intravenous injection of 109 pfu of recombinant adenovirus expressing 7α-hydroxylase from the CMV promoter (AdCMV-7α) or control virus (AdCMV-Luc) into C57BL/6 mice. Administration of AdCMV-7α increased hepatic 7α-hydroxylase activity by ∼15-fold as previously described (26Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M. Meidell R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 36Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M.N. Meidell R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Overexpression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase lowered plasma VLDL/IDL/LDL cholesterol concentrations but had little effect on plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations as shown in Fig.1 A and no effect on hepatic HDL cholesteryl ether clearance (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig.1 C, overexpression of 7α-hydroxylase increased hepatic cholesterol synthesis by 4.5-fold but had no effect on rates of cholesterol synthesis in the extrahepatic tissues. Although not shown, overexpression of hepatic 7α-hydroxylase had no effect on the cholesterol content of extrahepatic tissues. The liver takes up HDL cholesteryl esters directly (via SR-BI) or after CETP-mediated transfer to apoB-containing lipoproteins (via the LDL receptor pathway). In the mouse, which lacks CETP, HDL cholesteryl esters are delivered to the liver mainly through the SR-BI pathway. SR-BI transgenic mice have been created that manifest marked overexpression of SR-BI in the liver, rapid clearance of HDL cholesteryl ester by the liver, and a marked reduction in plasma HDL concentrations (25Wang N. Takeshi A. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We confirmed that liver-specific overexpression of SR-BI markedly lowers plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations (Fig.2 A) as a result of enhanced clearance of HDL cholesteryl ester by the liver (Fig. 2 B). The rate of hepatic HDL cholesteryl ether clearance in SR-BI transgenic mice was 21-fold higher than that of SR-BI wild type mice. The marked increase in HDL cholesteryl ether clearance by the liver was due in part to the reduced concentration of HDL cholesteryl ester in plasma; however, clearance rates were still increased 9-fold in SR-BI transgenic mice in which plasma HDL concentrations were normalized by an infusion of unlabeled mouse HDL. As shown in Fig. 2 C, rates of cholesterol synthesis were not increased in the extrahepatic tissues of SR-BI transgenic mice; indeed, rates of cholesterol synthesis were significantly suppressed in several tissues. Although not shown, the cholesterol concentration in the extrahepatic tissues shown in Fig. 2 C were not altered in SR-BI transgenic animals. These data indicate that liver-specific overexpression of SR-BI does not enhance reverse cholesterol transport and may reduce the rate of cholesterol efflux from some tissues into plasma. It should be noted that we did not specifically look at the adrenal glands in these studies. RCT from the adrenal glands may not be necessary as they convert cholesterol to steroid hormones. Because mouse adrenal glands derive the majority of their cholesterol from HDL, it is likely that cholesterol synthesis is increased in the adrenal glands of SR-BI transgenic mice to compensate for the decrease in HDL cholesteryl ester uptake that results from the near absence of HDL in the plasma of these mice (25Wang N. Takeshi A. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Free cholesterol that is transferred from tissues to nascent discoidal HDL is esterified by LCAT leading to the generation of mature spherical HDL. We accelerated this step in the RCT pathway by overexpressing mouse LCAT in the liver using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and determined the effect on cholesterol synthesis rates and concentrations in the extrahepatic tissues. Rates of cholesterol synthesis were measured 3 days after the intravenous injection of 1 × 109 or 2 × 109 pfu of recombinant adenovirus expressing mouse LCAT (AdCMV-LCAT) or control virus into C57BL/6 mice. Administration of AdCMV-LCAT resulted in the accumulation of large amounts of LCAT mRNA in the liver (not shown) and in the accumulation of cholesteryl ester-rich HDL particles in plasma that contained mainly apoA-I and apoE (Fig.3 A). However, overexpression of LCAT in the liver had no significant effect on the rate of cholesterol synthesis (Fig. 3, B and C) or the cholesterol concentration (not shown) in extrahepatic tissues. The initial step in RCT is cholesterol efflux from the plasma membranes of cells in extrahepatic tissues to nascent HDL particles in the interstitial space. We employed two protocols aimed at increasing the availability of nascent HDL. In the first we increased plasma apoA-I concentrations by overexpressing apoA-I in the liver using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. ApoA-I−/− mice were administered 109 pfu of recombinant adenovirus expressing human apoA-I from the CMV promoter (AdCMV-apoA-I) or control virus, and the plasma concentration of apoA-I, cholesterol, and phospholipid was determined at 24-h intervals for 3 days. As shown in Fig.4 A, administration of AdCMV-apoA-I increased plasma apoA-I concentrations from 0 to 309 mg/dl; plasma HDL phospholipid and cholesterol concentrations increased to 221 and 119 mg/dl, respectively, with 91% of HDL cholesterol being esterified. In the second protocol, animals were infused with discoidal complexes of phospholipid and apoA-I. These particles (referred to as rHDL) contained human apoA-I and phospholipid in a ratio of ∼1:5 (w/w) (37Nanjee M.N. Doran J.E. Lerch P.G. Miller N.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and were generously provided by Dr. Peter G. Lerch, ZLB Central Laboratory, Swiss Red Cross, Bern, Switzerland. ApoA-I−/− mice were administered a primed infusion of rHDL at a rate of 1 mg of rHDL apoA-I/h for 3 days through an in-dwelling internal jugular vein catheter that exited the body through a tether and was attached to a fluid swivel. This system allowed the animals free range of motion and access to food and water. As shown in Fig. 4 B plasma apoA-I concentrations were similar to those in animals administered AdCMV-apoA-I, whereas plasma phospholipid concentrations were much higher (∼1,400 mg/dl). Plasma cholesterol concentrations increased during the 3-day infusion to nearly 1,000 mg/dl with 87% of the cholesterol that accumulated in plasma being unesterified. Fig. 5 shows rates of cholesterol synthesis in the extrahepatic tissues of apoA-I−/− mice after 3 days of overexpressing apoA-I or infusing rHDL. As shown in Fig. 5 A, overexpressing apoA-I had no significant effect on cholesterol synthesis in any extrahepatic tissue. In contrast, infusion of rHDL markedly increased rates of cholesterol synthesis in most of the extrahepatic tissues that were examined as well as the remaining carcass (Fig. 5 B). The greatest relative increases in cholesterol synthesis were seen in lung (6-fold), heart (9-fold), and skeletal muscle (10-fold). Tissue cholesterol concentrations were measured at 3 days and were not altered by the overexpression of apoA-I (not shown) or the infusion of rHDL (Fig. 5 C). These studies show that for the same elevation in plasma apoA-I concentrations, an infusion of apoA-I·phospholipid complexes is far more effective than overexpressing apoA-I at stimulating cholesterol movement from tissues to plasma. Further studies were undertaken to characterize the effect of an intravenous bolus of rHDL on plasma lipids and parameters of RCT. We performed these studies in apoA-I−/− mice, which have very low background levels of total and HDL cholesterol, and in CETP transgenic mice, which more closely mimic the human situation. Fig.6 shows changes in plasma lipid and human apoA-I concentrations following the intravenous injection of 6 mg of rHDL apoA-I to apoA-I−/− or CETP transgenic mice. In apoA-I−/− mice, plasma concentrations of human apoA-I and phospholipid equaled 1,662 and 429 mg/dl 1 h after administration of rHDL and had returned to near normal levels by 24 h (Fig.6 A). As shown in Fig. 6 C, plasma cholesterol concentrations peaked at ∼6 h at which time 88% was unesterified. Free cholesterol concentrations returned to near normal values by 24 h although total cholesterol (and thus esterified cholesterol) was still elevated. Basal plasma lipid levels were higher i"

Expression of rat SP-D (rSP-D) in distal respiratory epithelium of the lung completely corrected the pulmonary lipid accumulation and abnormalities in alveolar macrophages seen in SP-D null mice, whereas the targeted increased expression of wild-type rat SP-D in normal mice had no effect on endogenous SP-D, lung morphology, or surfactant phospholipid content (28Fisher J.H.

Biol. 1999; 21: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Based in part on these observations, we hypothesized that the covalent oligomerization of trimeric subunits is required to mediate the effects of SP-D on surfactant homeostasis and macrophage function in vivo. For the present studies, transgenic mice were generated that expressed single trimeric subunits by targeting the expression of RrSP-Dser15/20 to peripheral respiratory epithelial cells of the lung using the human surfactant protein-C promoter (33Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. McWilliams K.M. Vorbroker D.K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L349-L356PubMed Google Scholar). The RrSP-Dser15/20 mutant protein did not correct lung phospholipids, alveolar macrophage abnormalities, or emphysema in SP-D−/− null mice. Expression of the mutant protein in wild-type mice interfered with the normal covalent oligomerization of the endogenous mSP-D and caused emphysema and the accumulation of foamy alveolar macrophages similar to that observed in SP-D null animals.DISCUSSIONThe expression of a mutant RrSP-Dser15/20 protein was directed to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells with the human SP-C promoter in wild-type and SP-D−/− null mice. Mutations of the two amino-terminal cysteine residues resulted in the secretion of a protein that bound to maltose and migrated exclusively as monomers on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of reduction. These findings are consistent with the results described by Brown-Augsburger et al. (15Brown-Augsburger P. Chang D. Rust K. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18912-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) for transfected CHO-K1 cells. Given that interchain bonds are required for the stability of dodecamers at 37 °C in vitro (16Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Fliszar C. Welgus H.G. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13724-13730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the absence of disulfide cross-linked oligomers is consistent with the absence of dodecamers in vivo. Because expression of the RrSP-Dser15/20 mutant protein failed to correct phospholipid accumulation, foamy macrophage production, or emphysema, the findings strongly suggest that oligomerization of trimeric subunits is required for these SP-D-dependent functions in vivo.In both transgenic mouse lines, expression of RrSP-Dser15/20 failed to rescue the histological and biochemical phenotypes of SP-D−/− mice. The characteristic phenotype of mSP-D null mice, with the increased pool size of alveolar phospholipids, abnormal foamy macrophages, and emphysema, persisted despite high levels of RrSP-Dser15/20 proteins. In contrast, a previous study demonstrated that expression of the normal rSP-D at high levels rescued all aspects of the pulmonary abnormalities seen in mSP-D−/− null mice using the same human SP-C promoter used in this study (28Fisher J.H. Sheftelyevich V. Ho Y.S. Fligiel S. McCormack F.X. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Ikegami M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L365-L373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the findings suggest that multivalency of trimeric subunits is required, it remains possible that cysteines 15 and 20 or more subtle local conformational perturbations render the protein defective with respect to its ability to rescue the SP-D null phenotype. In this regard, thermal stability of the collagen domain of RrSP-Dser15/20 is decreased, presumably secondary to the absence of interchain disulfide cross-links (16Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Fliszar C. Welgus H.G. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13724-13730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).In RrSP-Dser15/20 transgenic mouse line 75, in which normal disulfide cross-linked oligomers of SP-D were undetectable by Western blot analysis, lung morphology was similar to that characteristic of mSP-D−/− null mice, with enlarged foamy macrophages and emphysema. The expression of RrSP-Dser15/20 protein did not disrupt lung morphology in line 52, in which the mutant protein was expressed at levels that did not eliminate the formation of disulfide cross-linked oligomers of the endogenous mSP-D. These results suggest that overexpression of chains lacking the capacity to participate in interchain disulfide bonds may interfere with the function of SP-D, causing a dominant negative effect through formation of heteropolymers of wild-type mouse and mutant rat chains that are unable to participate in the formation of stable dodecamers. Given that the mouse and rat proteins are identical in length and domain structure, it is likely that folding of the carboxyl-terminal CRDs and neck domains of the heteropolymers is unaltered. Indeed, the lectin activity of the mutant SP-D was retained, supporting the likelihood that the folding of the CRDs was maintained. However, it is unclear whether differences in functions of the mutant SP-D molecules are related to activities determined by the serine at positions 15 and 20 or to the effect of the mutant protein on oligomerization of the wild-type SP-D, leaving the lung relatively deficient in functional disulfide-linked oligomeric forms. Alternatively, heteropolymeric SP-D could be degraded, resulting in selective secretion of mutant SP-D. Although the lungs of wild-type mice expressing the mutant SP-D at high levels (line 75) contained numerous foamy macrophages and developed emphysema, pulmonary Sat PC concentrations were not increased significantly, suggesting that some function of the endogenous mSP-D was maintained. It was possible that a very small amount of appropriately assembled endogenous mSP-D was present in the BALF but was undetectable by Western blot. It remains possible that various activities of SP-D may be concentration-dependent. For example, the concentrations of SP-D inducing neutrophil chemotaxis (20Cai G.-Z. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. Longmore W.J. Moxley M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L131-L136PubMed Google Scholar) are 100–1,000 times lower than those required for aggregating particles (16Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Fliszar C. Welgus H.G. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13724-13730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).In summary, the present findings strongly support the concept that the dodecameric structure of SP-D is essential for some of its homeostatic functions in vivo. Increased expression of the mutant SP-D in wild-type mice decreased the concentration of the normal disulfide cross-linked oligomeric forms of mouse SP-D and caused emphysema and foamy macrophage accumulation in the absence of alterations in alveolar phospholipid concentrations. Thus, some aspects of the SP-D null phenotype, namely the pulmonary emphysema and production of foamy alveolar macrophages, are not likely caused by increased surfactant phospholipids. Although the human lung contains a predominance of highly oligomerized SP-D, trimeric species have been identified in the lungs of some patients with alveolar proteinosis (37Crouch E.C. Persson A. Chang D. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 241-248PubMed Google Scholar), and less highly aggregated SP-D forms may be generated by proteolytic degradation in the setting of infection or lung injury. Polymorphisms in nucleotide sequences of the collagen domain of the serum mannose binding lectin altered oligomerization that was associated with defects in its host defense function (38Matsushita M. Ezekowitz R.A. Fujita T. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We therefore speculate that increased levels of mutant SP-D forms that interfere with higher order oligomerization may influence the function of SP-D that might contribute to the pathogenesis of certain lung diseases.

Analyses of the SP-D gene-targeted mice indicated an important role of SP-D in the regulation of surfactant lipid homeostasis and macrophage function (24Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Jobe A.H. Ross G.

Lungs of SP-D null mice have increased surfactant phospholipid pools associated with abnormally enlarged and foamy alveolar macrophages and hyperplastic type II cells with an increased size of lamellar bodies (25Korfhagen T.R.

SP-D−/− mice also develop progressive pulmonary emphysema and subpleural fibrosis, associated with chronic inflammation and increased matrix metalloproteinase and increased oxidant production by alveolar macrophages (27Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.F. Fisher J.H. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5972-5977Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Expression of rat SP-D (rSP-D) in distal respiratory epithelium of the lung completely corrected the pulmonary lipid accumulation and abnormalities in alveolar macrophages seen in SP-D null mice, whereas the targeted increased expression of wild-type rat SP-D in normal mice had no effect on endogenous SP-D, lung morphology, or surfactant phospholipid content (28Fisher J.H. Sheftelyevich V. Ho Y.S. Fligiel S. McCormack F.X. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Ikegami M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L365-L373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SP-D dodecamers bind to specific surfactant lipids and influence their state of aggregation (29Poulain F.R. Akiyama J. Allen L. Brown C. Chang R. Goerke J. Dobbs L. Hawgood S. Am. J. Respir.

Based in part on these observations, we hypothesized that the covalent oligomerization of trimeric subunits is required to mediate the effects of SP-D on surfactant homeostasis and macrophage function in vivo. For the present studies, transgenic mice were generated that expressed single trimeric subunits by targeting the expression of RrSP-Dser15/20 to peripheral respiratory epithelial cells of the lung using the human surfactant protein-C promoter (33Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. McWilliams K.M. Vorbroker D.K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L349-L356PubMed Google Scholar). The RrSP-Dser15/20 mutant protein did not correct lung phospholipids, alveolar macrophage abnormalities, or emphysema in SP-D−/− null mice. Expression of the mutant protein in wild-type mice interfered with the normal covalent oligomerization of the endogenous mSP-D and caused emphysema and the accumulation of foamy alveolar macrophages similar to that observed in SP-D null animals. DISCUSSIONThe expression of a mutant RrSP-Dser15/20 protein was directed to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells with the human SP-C promoter in wild-type and SP-D−/− null mice. Mutations of the two amino-terminal cysteine residues resulted in the secretion of a protein that bound to maltose and migrated exclusively as monomers on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of reduction. These findings are consistent with the results described by Brown-Augsburger et al. (15Brown-Augsburger P. Chang D. Rust K. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18912-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) for transfected CHO-K1 cells. Given that interchain bonds are required for the stability of dodecamers at 37 °C in vitro (16Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Fliszar C. Welgus H.G. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13724-13730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the absence of disulfide cross-linked oligomers is consistent with the absence of dodecamers in vivo. Because expression of the RrSP-Dser15/20 mutant protein failed to correct phospholipid accumulation, foamy macrophage production, or emphysema, the findings strongly suggest that oligomerization of trimeric subunits is required for these SP-D-dependent functions in vivo.In both transgenic mouse lines, expression of RrSP-Dser15/20 failed to rescue the histological and biochemical phenotypes of SP-D−/− mice. The characteristic phenotype of mSP-D null mice, with the increased pool size of alveolar phospholipids, abnormal foamy macrophages, and emphysema, persisted despite high levels of RrSP-Dser15/20 proteins. In contrast, a previous study demonstrated that expression of the normal rSP-D at high levels rescued all aspects of the pulmonary abnormalities seen in mSP-D−/− null mice using the same human SP-C promoter used in this study (28Fisher J.H. Sheftelyevich V. Ho Y.S. Fligiel S. McCormack F.X. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Ikegami M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L365-L373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the findings suggest that multivalency of trimeric subunits is required, it remains possible that cysteines 15 and 20 or more subtle local conformational perturbations render the protein defective with respect to its ability to rescue the SP-D null phenotype. In this regard, thermal stability of the collagen domain of RrSP-Dser15/20 is decreased, presumably secondary to the absence of interchain disulfide cross-links (16Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Fliszar C. Welgus H.G. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13724-13730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).In RrSP-Dser15/20 transgenic mouse line 75, in which normal disulfide cross-linked oligomers of SP-D were undetectable by Western blot analysis, lung morphology was similar to that characteristic of mSP-D−/− null mice, with enlarged foamy macrophages and emphysema. The expression of RrSP-Dser15/20 protein did not disrupt lung morphology in line 52, in which the mutant protein was expressed at levels that did not eliminate the formation of disulfide cross-linked oligomers of the endogenous mSP-D. These results suggest that overexpression of chains lacking the capacity to participate in interchain disulfide bonds may interfere with the function of SP-D, causing a dominant negative effect through formation of heteropolymers of wild-type mouse and mutant rat chains that are unable to participate in the formation of stable dodecamers. Given that the mouse and rat proteins are identical in length and domain structure, it is likely that folding of the carboxyl-terminal CRDs and neck domains of the heteropolymers is unaltered. Indeed, the lectin activity of the mutant SP-D was retained, supporting the likelihood that the folding of the CRDs was maintained. However, it is unclear whether differences in functions of the mutant SP-D molecules are related to activities determined by the serine at positions 15 and 20 or to the effect of the mutant protein on oligomerization of the wild-type SP-D, leaving the lung relatively deficient in functional disulfide-linked oligomeric forms. Alternatively, heteropolymeric SP-D could be degraded, resulting in selective secretion of mutant SP-D. Although the lungs of wild-type mice expressing the mutant SP-D at high levels (line 75) contained numerous foamy macrophages and developed emphysema, pulmonary Sat PC concentrations were not increased significantly, suggesting that some function of the endogenous mSP-D was maintained. It was possible that a very small amount of appropriately assembled endogenous mSP-D was present in the BALF but was undetectable by Western blot. It remains possible that various activities of SP-D may be concentration-dependent. For example, the concentrations of SP-D inducing neutrophil chemotaxis (20Cai G.-Z. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. Longmore W.J. Moxley M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L131-L136PubMed Google Scholar) are 100–1,000 times lower than those required for aggregating particles (16Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13724-13730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).In summary, the present findings strongly support the concept that the dodecameric structure of SP-D is essential for some of its homeostatic functions in vivo. Increased expression of the mutant SP-D in wild-type mice decreased the concentration of the normal disulfide cross-linked oligomeric forms of mouse SP-D and caused emphysema and foamy macrophage accumulation in the absence of alterations in alveolar phospholipid concentrations. Thus, some aspects of the SP-D null phenotype, namely the pulmonary emphysema and production of foamy alveolar macrophages, are not likely caused by increased surfactant phospholipids. Although the human lung contains a predominance of highly oligomerized SP-D, trimeric species have been identified in the lungs of some patients with alveolar proteinosis (37Crouch E.C. Persson A. Chang D. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 241-248PubMed Google Scholar), and less highly aggregated SP-D forms may be generated by proteolytic degradation in the setting of infection or lung injury. Polymorphisms in nucleotide sequences of the collagen domain of the serum mannose binding lectin altered oligomerization that was associated with defects in its host defense function (38Matsushita M. Ezekowitz R.A. Fujita T. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We therefore speculate that increased levels of mutant SP-D forms that interfere with higher order oligomerization may influence the function of SP-D that might contribute to the pathogenesis of certain lung diseases.

Because conditions required for membrane insertion coincide with those for oligomerization of PA63 in mammalian cells, residues constituting the 2β2–2β3 loop were replaced with the residues of the amphipathic membrane-inserting loop of its homologue iota-b toxin secreted by Clostridium perfringens.

Science. 2000; 289: 382-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The toxic action has been attributed to anthrax toxin produced by the bacterium. The anthrax toxin can be resolved into three distinct protein components: protective antigen (PA),1lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF). The combination of EF and PA (an edema toxin) produces skin edema, whereas LF and PA (a lethal toxin) are lethal to animals (2Stanley J.L. Smith H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1961; 26: 49-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three proteins are individually non-toxic (2Stanley J.L. Smith H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1961; 26: 49-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas EF is a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that acts by increasing the intracellular cAMP levels in eukaryotic cells (3Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).According to the current model of anthrax toxin action, PA binds to an as yet unknown cell surface receptor and gets proteolytically activated by cell surface protease furin to PA63. This allows oligomerization and binding of LF/EF. The toxin complex is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and is exposed to acidic pH inside the endosome. This change in pH triggers both membrane insertion by PA63 and translocation of LF/EF into the cytosol (recently reviewed in 9).Membrane insertion and channel formation are brought about by a large 2β2–2β3 loop (amino acid residues 302–325) in the domain II of PA (10Benson E.L. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3941-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The loop shows a conserved pattern of alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid residues similar to that observed inClostridium perfringens iota-b toxin andStaphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin (11Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). PA also has been shown to possess a high degree of homology with the iota-b toxin secreted by C. perfringens (12Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5147-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Translocation of LF or EF to the cytosol is believed to occur through a channel formed by insertion of heptameric PA63 into the membrane (11Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The formation of ion-conductive channels by PA63 has been demonstrated in both artificial lipid membranes (13Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Mol.

Acidic pH triggers oligomerization, membrane insertion by PA63, and translocation of LF into the cytosol of mammalian cells (10Benson E.L. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J.

In this paper, we show that a mutant PA protein, in which amino acid residues comprising the 2β2–2β3 loop of PA (PA-I) were substituted with the residues of the amphipathic loop of the homologous iota-b toxin, is defective in its ability to insert into the membrane and completely inhibits the lethal effect of the wild-type toxin at equimolar concentrations.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrior work showed that proteolytic cleavage of PA at the sequence164RKKR167 in solution or on the surface of mammalian cells results in the removal of the N-terminal 20-kDa fragment (PA20) that leads to heptamer formation (11Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The heptamer has been assumed to insert into membranes at acidic pH (15Milne J.C. Furlong D. Hanna P.C. Wall J.S. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acidic pH inside the endosome leads to insertion of PA63 into the membrane by forming a β-barrel composed of an amphipathic 2β2–2β3 loop consisting of an alternating arrangement of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids (11Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar).Because acidic pH is necessary for both oligomerization and membrane insertion by PA63 (15Milne J.C. Furlong D. Hanna P.C. Wall J.S. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the functional significance of the correlation between the conditions required for both of the events to occur. Mutant PA protein (PA-I) was produced in which residues constituting the 2β2–2β3 loop were replaced with the corresponding residues of iota-b toxin, a closely related toxin secreted byC. perfringens (12Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5147-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so that the alternating arrangement of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids was retained. PA and PA-I were purified from the culture supernatant of B. anthracis (Fig.1 A). PA-I was tested by immunoblot analysis for reactivity against anti-PA polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1 B). The results suggested that PA-I was purified to more than 90% homogeneity and was reactive to anti-PA rabbit polyclonal antibodies like wild-type PA. The typical yield of the proteins was 10 mg/l. PA-I did not aggregate in solution and behaved similar to wild-type PA.Purified PA-I was tested for its ability to lyse J774A.1 macrophage cells in combination with LF. Whereas wild-type PA lysed 50% of the cells at a concentration of 0.04 μg/ml in 3 h (Fig.2 A), PA-I was completely non-toxic to J774A.1 cells at the highest concentration tested (100 μg/ml) (Fig. 2 A). The data suggest that PA-I is inactive in exhibiting a lethal effect to macrophage cells as compared with wild-type PA. A more sensitive assay to measure the toxic activity of PA is to study the PA-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis in combination with LF-(1–254)·TR·PE-(398–613) (16Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Sharma M. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29039-29046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion protein is comprised of the N-terminal 254 amino acids of LF (LF-(1–254); LFn) fused to the ADP-ribosylating domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin (16Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Sharma M. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29039-29046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity in this assay is measured by the inhibition of protein synthesis catalyzed by Pseudomonas exotoxin and resulting from the ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (22Arora N. Klimpel K.R. Singh Y. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15542-15548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas wild-type PA (0.1 μg/ml) showed 90% inhibition in protein synthesis when administered in combination with LF-(1–254)·TR·PE-(398–613) (1 ng/ml) to CHO-K1 cells as measured by the percent incorporation of [3H]leucine, no inhibition in protein synthesis was detected with PA-I when used even at a concentration of 100 μg/ml (Fig. 2 B). The marked inhibition of the biological activity of the mutant PA protein confirmed the functional significance of 2β2–2β3 loop of PA for the biological activity of anthrax toxin.Figure 2Cytotoxicity assay with PA and mutant PA proteins. A, J774A.1 cells were cultured in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated with LF (1 μg/ml) in combination with varying concentrations of PA and PA-I for 3 h at 37 °C. At the end of the experiment, toxicity was determined by MTT assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, CHO-K1 cells were incubated with varying concentrations of PA or PA-I together with LF-(1–254)·TR·PE-(398–613) (1 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 3 h. At the end of the incubation, medium was replaced with medium containing [3H]leucine (1 μCi/ml) and the extent of protein synthesis was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as percent of [3H]leucine incorporation by viable cells in the absence of added proteins.

Analysis of the mutant PA protein for sensitivity toward trypsin showed that the mutant was equally susceptible to trypsin as wild-type PA (TableI). The mutation introduced did not affect the ability of PA-I to bind LFn on cell surface (Table I) and, therefore, did not alter the ability of PA to bind to the receptor.Table ICharacteristics of mutant PA proteinExperiments with cultured cellsExperiments with Fischer 344 ratsPAPA-I 1-aSequence at 2β2–2β3 loop: 302TVGVSISAGYQNGFTGNITTSAG324.PALFPA-IPA-DTTD 1-bTTD is the time to death of Fischer 344 rats after administration of proteins.μgμgμgμgToxicity1-cToxicity was determined by dye oxidation assay (19) and inhibition of protein synthesis (16).+−40−−−Survived−8−−SurvivedTrypsin cleavage 1-dPA and PA-I (1 mg/ml) were incubated with trypsin (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at 22 °C and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue.

Open table in a new tab Purified PA63 forms SDS and boiling-resistant oligomers when exposed to acidic pH on mammalian cells (15Milne J.C. Furlong D. Hanna P.C. Wall J.S. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We, thus, determined whether PA-I retained the ability to form SDS-resistant oligomers in solution as well as when incubated with mammalian cells. PA-I was equally as effective in oligomerizing in solution as was wild-type PA (Table I). Electron microscopy data confirmed the formation of heptamers by PA-I as well as wild-type PA (Fig. 3,A and B). These results suggest that PA-I retained the ability to perform intermolecular interaction leading to oligomerization.Figure 3Electron microscopy of the oligomeric 63-kDa fragments of PA and PA-I. Samples (40 μg/ml) were negatively stained with 1% uranyl formate and analyzed by electron microscopy.A, PA; B, PA-I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined the ability of PA-I to insert into the plasma membrane of CHO-K1 cells at acidic pH. Membrane insertion was tested by measuring the ability of PA-I to form ion-conductive channels in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. PA63 forms ion-conductive selective channels in artificial membranes and plasma membrane of mammalian at acidic pH (13Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Milne J.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have correlated the ability of PA to insert into membranes with the extent of86Rb+ released at acidic pH (16Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Sharma M. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29039-29046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells preloaded with 86Rb+ were incubated with trypsin-nicked PA or PA-I at 4 °C and placed into acidic medium, and release of 86Rb+ was measured. Incubation of trypsin-nicked wild-type PA (2 μg/ml) induced release of 70%86Rb+, whereas trypsin-nicked PA-I did not cause leakage of 86Rb+ (Fig.4). The result suggests that PA-I is unable to form ion-conductive channels and that integrity of the 2β2–2β3 loop is essential for proper membrane insertion by PA63.Figure 4Ion channel formation by PA and PA-I.CHO-K1 cells preloaded with 86Rb+ were incubated with trypsin-nicked PA or PA-I at 4 °C for 2 h and subjected to acidic pH shock. The leakage of86Rb+ into the medium was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as percent of 86Rb+ associated with cells in the absence of added proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the ability of PA-I to translocate LF into the cytosol of mammalian cells, we employed the previously described in vitro translocation assay (20Wesche J. Elliott J.L. Falnes P.φ. Olsnes S. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15737-15746Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) that uses the in vitrotranscribed and translated LFn labeled with [35S]methionine. We measured the ability of PA-I to translocate radiolabeled LFn across the plasma membrane of CHO-K1 cells upon treatment with low pH buffer. As shown in Fig.5, whereas wild-type PA translocated 45% of the bound LFn at pH 5.0, PA-I showed no translocation of LFn. Insignificant translocation of LFn was observed with wild-type PA at pH 7.0 consistent with the earlier reports that showed that acidic pH is a prerequisite for the translocation event to occur (20Wesche J. Elliott J.L. Falnes P.φ. Olsnes S. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15737-15746Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the mutant PA protein is inactive in translocation. The results confirm the previous propositions that membrane insertion by PA63 is a prerequisite for the translocation of LF into the cytosol but do not, in any way, suggest that LF passes through the lumen of the channel formed by the 2β2–2β3 loop.Figure 5In vitro translocation assay.CHO-K1 cells were chilled in ice for 15 min and incubated with trypsin-nicked PA or PA-I for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were further incubated for 1 h with 35S-labeled LFn at 4 °C. After another washing step, the pH of the medium was either maintained at 7.0 or lowered to 5.0. The cells were either lysed directly or treated with Pronase E to remove surface bound proteins. Cell-associated radioactivity was then counted. Results are expressed as percent 35S-labeled LFn translocated of the total bound to cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next investigated whether mixing of the mutant PA protein and wild-type PA at varying ratios resulted in alterations in the cytotoxic activity of the wild-type toxin. When the mutant and wild-type PA were present at equimolar concentrations, complete inhibition in protein synthesis of CHO-K1 cells was observed (Fig.6). A significant inhibition could be detected when the ratio of PA-I to PA was 1:4. These data suggest that the PA-I inhibits wild-type PA-mediated cellular intoxication.Figure 6Inhibition of toxic activity of PA in combination with LF -(1–254)·TR·PE-(398–613). CHO-K1 cells were incubated with PA-I or PA-D mixed with varying concentrations of wild-type PA at 37 °C for 3 h in combination with LF-(1–254)·TR·PE-(398–613). At the end of 3 h, cells were incubated with medium containing [3H]leucine (1 μCi/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of the experiment, the amount of [3H]leucine incorporation was measured. Results are expressed as percent of [3H]leucine incorporated by viable cells in the absence of added proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been reported previously that a mutant form of PA, in which the furin cleavage site 164RKKR167 was deleted (PA-D), blocked the anthrax toxin effect in vitroand in vivo (17Singh Y. Chaudhary V.K. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19103-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because this molecule cannot be cleaved with trypsin or furin, does not form oligomers, and can only inhibit the action of wild-type PA by competing for cellular receptor, this molecule was employed as a control in our experiments to investigate whether inhibition in the cytotoxic activity was due to the competition for binding to the receptor. PA-D failed to inhibit the cytotoxic effect when mixed with wild-type PA in all the ratios tested (Fig. 6). It has been shown previously that PA-D, rather than wild-type PA, inhibits the lethal toxin activity when present at a 10-fold excess concentration (17Singh Y. Chaudhary V.K. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19103-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, a substantial excess of mutant protein is required to inhibit the binding of an active ligand to cell surface receptors, and PA-I more likely inhibits the action of anthrax toxin by interacting with wild-type PA to form an inactive hetero-heptameric complex and thus, is a more potent inhibitor of anthrax toxin action. This model is consistent with the ability of purified PA-I to inhibit wild-type PA-mediated cytotoxic activity when the ratio of PA-I to PA is 1:4. Purification of active homoheptamers of PA and PA-I to homogeneity was not successful due to the presence of lower order oligomers as well.To confirm the hypothesis that wild-type PA and PA-I might assemble to form non-functional oligomeric structures, the trypsin-nicked proteins (2 μg/ml each) were mixed together at neutral pH and incubated with CHO-K1 cells preloaded with 86Rb+ at 4 °C. After 2 h, the cells were washed to remove unbound proteins and incubated with isotonic buffer of pH 5.0 or 7.0 for 30 min at 37 °C. Whereas wild-type PA released 62% of the radiolabel from cells, equimolar mixture containing PA and PA-I showed insignificant release of 86Rb+ (Fig.7). The results suggest that there is complete inhibition of channel-forming ability of PA by PA-I. Indeed, the capacity of PA-I to dramatically alter the channel-forming ability of wild-type PA provides evidence that these two species can interact to form dysfunctional hetero-oligomeric structures. A dominant negative mutant of VacA toxin secreted by Helicobacter pylori has recently been reported that inhibits the vacuolating activity of wild-type toxin when present at a 5-fold-less concentration than wild-type VacA (23Vinion-Dubiel A.D. McClain M.A. Czajkowsky D.M. Iwamoto H. Ye D. Cao P. Schraw W. Szabo G. Blanke S.R. Shao Z. Cover T.L. J. Biol.

CHO-K1 cells, preloaded with86Rb+, were incubated with trypsin-cleaved PA and PA-I mixed in equimolar ratios at neutral pH for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were subjected to acidic pH shock as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The leakage of86Rb+ into the medium was then determined. Results are expressed as percent of 86Rb+associated with cells in the absence of added proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of such a dominant negative inhibitor might be valuable for treatment of anthrax toxin action. Animal experiments were thus initiated to test the efficacy of PA-I to act as a dominant negative inhibitor of lethal toxin action in vivo. Whereas wild-type lethal (40 μg of PA + 8 μg of LF) resulted in the death of male Fischer 344 rats in ∼60 min (Table I), a 1:1 mix containing wild-type PA and PA-I (40 μg of PA + 40 μg of PA-I + 8 μg LF) protected rats, and no symptoms were evident even after 48 h. Equimolar ratio of wild-type PA and PA-D resulted in the death of rats within 70 min (Table I). Taken together, these data confirm that PA-I can act as a dominant negative and a potent inhibitor of anthrax toxin actionin vivo.Use of B. anthracis as a bioweapon has become the bane of the defense establishments in various countries (1Marshall E. Science. 2000; 289: 382-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Keeping in view the potent activity of PA-I both in vitro and in vivo it has the potential to be used as therapeutic agent for use in neutralizing anthrax toxin action in individuals infected withB. anthracis. Bacillus anthracis, the etiologic agent of anthrax, is a potential agent of bioterrorism (1Marshall E. Science. 2000; 289: 382-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The toxic action has been attributed to anthrax toxin produced by the bacterium. The anthrax toxin can be resolved into three distinct protein components: protective antigen (PA),1lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF). The combination of EF and PA (an edema toxin) produces skin edema, whereas LF and PA (a lethal toxin) are lethal to animals (2Stanley J.L. Smith H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1961; 26: 49-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three proteins are individually non-toxic (2Stanley J.L. Smith H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1961; 26: 49-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas EF is a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that acts by increasing the intracellular cAMP levels in eukaryotic cells (3Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, when residues key to the recognition of P1 by αMβ2-bearing cells were mutated in the γ-module, γ148–411, this recombinant fragment was as active as its wild-type counterpart in supporting αMβ2-mediated adhesion (12Ugarova T.P.

This observation led to the search for additional αMβ2 recognition sites within the γ-chain, and ultimately the P2 peptide, corresponding to γ377–395, was identified (12Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A.

Indeed, in comparative analyses, P2 was 10–15-fold more potent than P1 in inhibiting adhesion of the αMβ2-expressing cells to the D fragment of Fg. Further analyses of the adhesion-promoting activity of overlapping peptides showed that its COOH-terminal part, γ383TMKIIPFNRLTIG395, designated P2-C, was the primary site of its biological activity (12Ugarova T.P.

Within the heterodimeric αMβ2 receptor, the I-domain, a region of ∼200 amino acid residues, inserted in the αM subunit, contributes broadly to the recognition of ligands by αMβ2 (14Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbı́ A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 120: 1031-1043Google Scholar) and specifically to the binding of Fg to this integrin (14Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J.

In addition to Fg, this region also was implicated in the binding of ICAM-1(15), iC3b (16Ueda T. Rieu P. Brayer J. Arnaout M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 10680-10684Google Scholar), and neutrophil inhibitory factor, NIF (17Rieu P. Ueda T. Haruta I. Sharma C.P. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol... 1994; 127: 2081-2091Google Scholar, 18Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 26419-26423Google Scholar). We have shown previously that P2 interacts with the recombinant αMI-domain and that NIF partially blocked this interaction (12Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 22519-22527Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that overlapping but not identical sites are involved in the recognition of iC3b, NIF, and Fg (19Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 18211-18216Google Scholar). However, although the binding sites for iC3b and NIF in the αMI-domain were mapped extensively (20Rieu P. Sugimori T. Griffith D.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 15858-15861Google Scholar, 21McGuire S.L. Bajt M.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 25866-25871Google Scholar, 22Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

Cell Biol... 1998; 143: 1523-1534Google Scholar), the recognition site for Fg has not been studied. Recently, sequences key to the binding of NIF and iC3b to the αMI-domain were mapped using a homolog scanning mutagenesis strategy (22Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 17558-17564Google Scholar, 24Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Google Scholar). This approach is based upon the structural similarity of the I-domains of αM and αL and the differences in their ligand recognition;i.e. the crystal structures of the I-domains of αM and αL are very similar (25Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell.. 1995; 80: 631-638Google Scholar, 26Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure.. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Google Scholar, 27Qu A. Leahy D.J.

Structure.. 1996; 4: 931-942Google Scholar), but only the I-domain of αM binds NIF with high affinity (17Rieu P. Ueda T. Haruta I. Sharma C.P. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol... 1994; 127: 2081-2091Google Scholar,18Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 26419-26423Google Scholar). Fg, together with NIF and iC3b, does not bind to αLβ2, suggesting that differences in the structure of the αMI- and αLI-domains may be responsible for their distinction in ligand binding specificity. In this study, we have sought to localize the binding site for the P2-C sequence of Fg within the αMI-domain. The strategy developed was based on the differences in the binding of P2-C to the αMI-, αXI-, and αLI-domains and involved several independent approaches, including screening of mutant cells, synthetic peptides, site-directed mutagenesis, and the gain-in-function analyses. The binding site for P2-C was localized within the segment αM(Lys245-Arg261), a site of the major structure divergence between αMI-, αXI-, and αLI-domains. The grafting of this segment into the αLI-domain converted it to the P2-C-binding protein. Thus, a small amino acid sequence, P2-C, with a defined structure within a crystallized domain of fibrinogen (29Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Cote H.C.F. LeTrong I. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure.. 1997; 5: 125-138Google Scholar) is shown to interact with a small segment that also has a defined structure within the αMI-domain. Human kidney 293 cells expressing wild-type and the mutant forms of the αMβ2 receptor were described and characterized in detail previously (19Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 18211-18216Google Scholar, 22Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 17558-17564Google Scholar). These cells were grown as adherent monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES, and antibiotics. Human Fg was purified from fresh human blood by differential ethanol precipitation (30Doolittle R.F. Schubert D. Schwartz S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys... 1967; 118: 456-467Google Scholar) or obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The D100 (Mr 100,000) fragment was prepared by digestion of human Fg with plasmin (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and purified as described (31Ugarova T.P. Budzynski A.Z. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 13687-13693Google Scholar). The D98 fragment (Mr 98,000) was produced by digestion of the D100 with plasmin. This fragment lacks 5–15 amino acid residues from the COOH terminus of the γ-chain and will be described elsewhere. 2T. P. Ugarova, V. P. Yakubenko, B. Kudzyk, E. F. Plow, and V. C. Yee, manuscript in preparation. D98was biotinylated with EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. P1 (γ190–202), P2 (γ377–395), P2-C (γ383–395), H19 (γ340–357), H2O (γ350–374), L10 (γ402–411), and H12 (γ400–411) peptides were synthesized and purified as described (12Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 22519-22527Google Scholar). In addition, an analog of P2-C, P2-Ce, a peptide with the extended COOH-terminal end, γ384–402, was also synthesized to test for direct binding to αMI-domain peptides. The following peptides duplicating selected sequences within the αMI-domain were synthesized: 147PHDFRR152(Pro147- Arg152),201PITQLLGRTHTATGIRK217(Pro201-Lys217),245KFGDPLGY252(Lys245-Tyr252),253EDVIPEADR261(Glu253-Arg261),245KFGDPLGYEDVIPEADREG263(Lys245-Gly263), and223FITNGARKN232(Phe223-Asn232). The numbers indicate the positions of the residues within the αM subunit (numbered according to Arnaout et al. (32Arnaout M.A. Gupta S.K. Pierce M.W. Tenen D.G. J. Cell Biol... 1988; 106: 2153-2158Google Scholar)). NIF (a gift from Corvas International, San Diego) was labeled with EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin according to the manufacturer's protocol. mAbs OKM1, 44a, and 904 were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). mAb 4-2 (33Procyk R. Kudryk B. Callender S. Blomback B. Blood.. 1991; 77: 1469-1475Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. B. Kudryk, the New York Blood Center, and mAb 4A5 (34Matsueda G.R. Bernatowicz M.S. Mosesson M.W. Amrani D. Siebenlist K.R. DiOrio P. Fibrinogen 3: Biochemistry, Biological Functions, Gene Regulation and Expression.Elsevier Science Publishers. 1988; : 133-136Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. G. Matsueda (Bristol-Meyers Squibb). The I-domains were expressed as fusion proteins with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and purified from soluble fractions of Escherichia coli lysates by affinity chromatography. The coding regions for the αMI-domain (residues Asp132-Ala318) and αLI-domain (Gly153-Ile333) were amplified by polymerase chain reactions using as template plasmids pCIS2m-αM (19Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 18211-18216Google Scholar) and pCIS2m-αL, which contain the cDNA fragments coding for the full-length of αM and αL, respectively. The primers used for the αMI-domain were 5′-TGTCCTGGATCCGATAGTGACATTGCCTTCTTGA (forward) and 5′-TGAGTACCCGCGGCCGCCGCAAAGATCTTCTCCC (reverse). The primers used for the αLI-domain were 5′-CAGGAAGGATCCAAGGGCAACGTAGACCTGGTATT (forward) and 5′-GTCCTGTTTGCGGCCGCCCTCAATGACATAGA (reverse). The underlined nucleotides are BamHI and NotI recognition sequences that were introduced in the primers. The fragments were digested with BamHI and NotI and cloned in the expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The accuracy of the DNA sequence was verified by sequencing. The plasmid was transformed in E. coli strain BL-21(DE3)pLysS competent cells, and expression was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–5 h at 37 °C. To express the αXI-domain, the following primers were used to amplify a cDNA fragment encoding the αXI-domain (residues Glu148-Ala335) from a randomly primed cDNA library of U937 monocytoid cell line: 5′-AGGCTACCGGGATCCAGACAGGAGTGCCCAAGA (forward) and 5′-CATCTCCCAATTTGGCGGCCGCACTGCTTGTGGTC (reverse). The product was digested with BamHI and NotI and cloned into pGEX-4T-1. The plasmid was transformed in E. coli BL-21(DE3)pLysS cells, and the correctness of the αXI-domain insertion was confirmed by sequencing. The αXI-domain was expressed and purified from the cell lysates as a fusion protein with GST under the conditions used for the αMI- and αLI-domains. Site-directed mutagenesis of the αMI-domain was performed by using QuickChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego). The pGEX-4T-1 construct containing DNA encoding the αMI-domain was modified by site-directed mutagenesis using two mutagenic primers containing the desired mutation. The mutations introduced in the αMI-domain and the primers used are listed in Table I. The oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the vector, were extended during temperature cycling by usingPfuTurbo TM DNA polymerase. Following temperature cycling, the product was treated with DpnI endonuclease to digest the parental DNA template. The nicked vector DNA incorporating the desired mutations was then transformed into the Epicurian Coli® XL1-Blue supercompetent cells, and cDNA from individual bacterial clones was analyzed by sequencing. The E. coli BL-21(DE3)pLysS host cells were then transformed with the mutant plasmids, and the mutant αMI-domains were prepared as described above for the recombinant wild-type αMI-domain. The immunoreactivity of wild-type and mutant recombinant I-domains was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with mAbs 44a and 904 using our standard protocol (35Ugarova T.P. Budzynski A.Z.

Open table in a new tab The segment corresponding to the sequence Ala267-Asp278 within the αLI was exchanged to the homologous segment of the αMI-domain Lys245-Arg261. The segment switch was created by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using polymerase chain reaction. The construction of the chimera was based on the observation that oligonucleotide sequence corresponding to αM(Lys245-Arg261) contains a unique restriction site for Eco81I (SauI), whereas the second site for this enzyme is present between 4760 and 4761 of the pGEX-4T-1 sequence. To switch the Lys245-Arg261 from αM to αL, the mutagenic primers were designed to contain theEco81I site within the αM(Lys245-Arg261) segment and additional unchanged αL bases: 5′-CATCCCTGAGGCAGACAGAATCATCCGCTACATCATCG (forward), 5′-GCTGCCTC AGGGGATCACATCTTCATAACCCAATGGATCTCCAAACTTCTCCCCATCCGTGATGATGATAAG (reverse) (the αM sequences are in bold, and the restriction site for Eco81I is underlined). The pGEX-4T-1 vector containing DNA encoding the αLI-domain was modified by polymerase chain reaction using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase with the following cycling parameters: 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 11.5 min. Following temperature cycling, the product was treated with DpnI to digest the parental DNA template. The linear product was purified and digested with Eco81I to produce the two cDNA fragments with cohesive ends. These fragments were ligated and transformed into Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. The accuracy of the DNA sequence and the correctness of the I-domain direction were verified by sequencing. The E. coli BL-21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with the mutated plasmid, and the chimeric molecule was prepared following the procedure described above for the wild-type and mutant I-domains. FACS analyses were performed to assess the expression of αMβ2 on the surface of the cells transfected with wild-type and mutant forms of the receptor. The cells were harvested, and 106 cells were incubated with αM-specific mAbs OKM1 or 44a at 15 μg/200 μl of cell suspension for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse IgG (at a 1:1,000 dilution) for additional 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the cells were washed and analyzed in a FACS Star (Beckton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Populations of cells expressing a similar amount of the receptor were selected by FACS. A clonal population of each mutant was isolated by limiting dilution. After propagation in culture, the amount of the αMβ2 was again evaluated by FACS analysis with mAb OKM1. The wells of tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with 6.1, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml P2-C peptide or 1, 5, and 25 μg/ml of D100 fragment for 3 h at 37 °C. The amount of peptides immobilized onto the wells was measured by utilizing radiolabeled peptides (12Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 22519-22527Google Scholar). The coated wells were postcoated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone for 1 h at 22 °C. The 293 cells expressing wild-type or mutated forms of αMβ2 were harvested with cell-dissociating buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 min at 22 °C and washed twice in HBSS/HEPES solution containing 10 mg/ml BSA, and resuspended at 5 × 105/ml in HBSS (without phenol red)/HEPES supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ and 10 mg/ml BSA. 100-μl aliquots of the cells were added to each well and incubated on the adhesive substrates for 25 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The nonadherent cells were removed by three washes with colorless HBSS. The adherent cells were frozen overnight at −20 °C, then thawed and lysed by the addition of a buffer containing the CyQuant dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The fluorescence was measured in a Cytofluorimeter (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framington, MA), and the number of adherent cells was determined from a reference standard curve prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Additionally, several experiments were performed using our established protocol with 51Cr-labeled cells (12Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 22519-22527Google Scholar), and the results were found to be identical with those obtained using the CyQuant reagent (see “Results”). To test the interaction of the wild-type αM, αX, αL, mutant αM, and chimeric I-domains, 96-well plates (Immulon 4BX, Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA) were coated with P2-C or P2-Ce at 50 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C and postcoated with 3% BSA or 0.5% polyvinyl alcohol for 2 h. The GST-I-domains in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% glycerol were added to the wells and incubated for 3 h at 22 °C. After washing, bound I-domains were detected with an anti-GST mAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at a 1:5,000 dilution. After washing, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was added for 1 h, and the binding of the I-domains was measured by reaction with p-nitrophenyl phosphate. As a control, the binding of GST to immobilized P2-C was typically ∼5–10% that of wild-type αMI-domain, and background binding to BSA or polyvinyl alcohol was subtracted. To examine the interaction of the D fragment with the I-domain peptides, 96-well plates (Immulon 2 HB, Dynex Technologies Inc.) were coated with peptides Pro147-Arg152, Pro201-Lys217, Lys245-Tyr252, and Glu253-Arg261 at 100 μm (0.1 ml/well) overnight at 4 °C and postcoated with 3% BSA for 1 h at 22 °C. 10 μg/ml biotinylated D98 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 0.05% Tween 20 were added to the wells and incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C. In parallel, the same amount of the D98 was mixed with different concentrations of P1, P2 peptides, or NIF and added to the wells with immobilized αMI-domain peptides. After washing, streptavidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Pierce) was added and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. D98 binding was detected by reaction with p-nitrophenyl phosphate, measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. To demonstrate the direct binding of the P2-C region (γ383–395) to the αMI-domain peptides, experiments were performed as follows. Different concentrations of the P2-Ce peptide, γ384–402, in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 0.05% Tween 20 were added to wells with immobilized αMI-domain peptides and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After washing, the binding of the γ384–402 was detected with mAb 4-2. The mAb 4-2 recognizes an epitope within this peptide, although it reacts poorly with authentic P2-C. 3V. P. Yakubenko and T. P. Ugarova, unpublished observation. The binding of this mAb to γ384–402 was measured by reaction with goat anti-mouse IgG, conjugated to alkaline-phosphatase (Pierce) and usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate for detection. Values of adherent cells bound to substrates are given as means ± S.E. and are based on two to six independent experiments with each αMβ2 cell line, performing triplicates at each experimental point. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the P2-C peptide binds directly to the recombinant αMI-domain (12Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 22519-22527Google Scholar). αXβ2 also recognizes P2-C (13T. P. Ugarova V. P. Yakubenko Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; Google Scholar); but the role of the αXI-domain in this interaction was not evaluated, and the recognition of P2-C by the αLI-domain had not been tested. Therefore, the three I-domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins and tested for their ability to interact with the immobilized P2-C peptide. As shown in Fig.1, the recombinant αXI-domain exhibited a dose-dependent and saturable binding to the P2-C peptide similar to that of the recombinant αMI-domain. In contrast, the recombinant αLI-domain did not interact with P2-C even at the highest concentration of the αLI-domain added (200 μg/ml maximal testable concentration). The binding characteristics of the isolated I-domains parallel the binding properties of the corresponding intact receptors on cell surfaces, i.e. the αMβ2- and αXβ2-expressing cells adhere to Fg and P2-C, whereas the αLβ2-bearing cells do not (see Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, these data confirm that binding of P2-C to two highly homologous integrins, αMβ2 and αXβ2, is mediated by αMI- and αXI-domains, respectively, and further suggest that the lack of binding of P2-C to αLβ2 may be the result of sequence and/or structural differences.Figure 2Adhesion of the αM(K231NAF) mutant and the cells expressing wild-type αMβ2and αLβ2to different adhesive substrates. 0.1-ml aliquots of 5 × 104 cells expressing αM(K231NAF) (●), wild-type αMβ2 (▾), and αLβ2 (▪) in HBSS/HEPES, supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mmMg2+, were incubated in the wells of 48-well plates coated with different concentrations of P2-C. Adhesion of αM(K231NAF)-expressing cells to H19 is shown for comparison (dashed line). After 25 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, the nonadherent cells were removed by three washes with HBSS, and the amount of adherent cells was determined using the fluorescent dye CyQuant as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as a percentage of added cells and are the mean ± S.E. of four individual experiments. The actual amounts of P2-C and H19 immobilized onto the plastic wells were determined as described (12Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

Adhesion was performed as described in Fig. 2. Adhesion of each mutant reached the maximal level at 25 pmol of P2-C and at 5 μg/ml of the D100 fragment.

https://openalex.org/W1601868493,"Previous studies in our laboratory have provided direct evidence for the existence of distinct cholesterol domains within the plasma membranes of human ocular lens fiber cells. The fiber cell plasma membrane is unique in that it contains unusually high concentrations of cholesterol, with cholesterol to phospholipid (C/P) mole ratios ranging from 1 to 4. Since membrane cholesterol content is disturbed in the development of cataracts, it was hypothesized that perturbation of cholesterol domain structure occurs in cataracts. In this study, fiber cell plasma membranes were isolated from both normal (control) and cataractous lenses and assayed for cholesterol and phospholipid. Control and cataractous whole lens membranes had C/P mole ratios of 3.1 and 1.7, respectively. Small angle x-ray diffraction approaches were used to directly examine the structural organization of the cataractous lens plasma membrane versus control. Both normal and cataractous oriented membranes yielded meridional diffraction peaks corresponding to a unit cell periodicity of 34.0 Å, consistent with the presence of immiscible cholesterol domains. However, comparison of diffraction patterns indicated that cataractous lens membranes contained more pronounced and better defined cholesterol domains than controls, over a broad range of temperature (5–40 °C) and relative humidity (52–92%) levels. In addition, diffraction analyses of the sterol-poor regions of cataractous membranes indicated increased membrane rigidity as compared with control membranes. Modification of the membrane lipid environment, such as by oxidative insult, is believed to be one potential mechanism for the formation of highly resolved cholesterol domains despite significantly reduced cholesterol content. The results of this x-ray diffraction study provide evidence for fundamental changes in the lens fiber cell plasma membrane structure in cataracts, including the presence of more prominent and highly ordered, immiscible cholesterol domains.

Modification of the membrane lipid environment, such as by oxidative insult, is believed to be one potential mechanism for the formation of highly resolved cholesterol domains despite significantly reduced cholesterol content. The results of this x-ray diffraction study provide evidence for fundamental changes in the lens fiber cell plasma membrane structure in cataracts, including the presence of more prominent and highly ordered, immiscible cholesterol domains. The human ocular lens is an optical tissue that contributes to normal visual physiology by providing a means of light refraction and accommodation (variable refraction). The utility of these basic functions is critically dependent on lens transparency, which is subserved by several unique features of the lens. First, the mammalian lens is comprised almost entirely of a large number of elongated, prismatic cells, known as fibers or fiber cells, that are deposited throughout life in highly ordered concentric lamellae. These fiber cells have a very regular cell shape and cell volume, and their very tight structural arrangement in the lens body minimizes extracellular space (a potential light scattering region). Second, fiber cell precursors lose all nuclei and other cytosolic organelles during their elongation and differentiation into mature fiber cells (1Bassnett S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1793-1803PubMed Google Scholar, 2Benedetti E.L. Dunia I. Bentzel C.J. Vermorken A.J. Kibbelaar M. Bloemendal H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 457: 353-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, potential intracellular light scattering elements are removed as fiber cells migrate into more optically significant positions in the lens. Third, a direct consequence of fiber cell differentiation is that plasma membrane becomes the principal organelle of the lens and contains essentially all lens lipid (3Rafferty N.S. Maisel H. The Ocular Lens. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1985: 1-60Google Scholar). Since plasma membrane is thesine qua non of lens organization, it is conceivable that the molecular and structural organization of the lens membrane itself is essential to lens transparency. Indeed, numerous studies suggest that cataractogenesis is associated with perturbation of lens membrane composition (4Broekhuyse R.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Eye Res. 1997; 16: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes of the human ocular lens are distinguished from other eukaryotic cell membranes by their unique lipid composition. Lens plasma membranes contain very high relative concentrations of long-chain saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids (18Anderson R.E. Maude M.B. Feldman G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 187: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Li L.K. So L. Curr. Eye Res. 1987; 6: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); polyunsaturated fatty acids are present only in trace amounts (20Broekhuyse R.M. Soeting W.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1976; 22: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Rosenfeld L. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 35: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, sphingomyelin and sphingomyelin derivatives make up greater than 50% of the total lens membrane phospholipid composition (22Byrdwell W.C. Borchman D. Porter R.A. Taylor K.G. Yappert M.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 4333-4343PubMed Google Scholar, 23Byrdwell W.C. Borchman D. Ophthalmic Res. 1997; 29: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A deficit of polyunsaturated fatty acids and an abundance of sphingomyelin are believed to contribute to lens membrane rigidity and structural order. Another remarkable feature of the lens plasma membrane is its unusually high relative concentration of cholesterol. The cholesterol to phospholipid (C/P)1 mole ratio of the human fiber cell plasma membrane ranges from 1 to 4, with the greatest concentration of cholesterol found in the central or nuclear region of the lens (24Li L.K. So L. Spector A. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 600-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Li L.K. So L. Spector A. Biochim. Biophys.

Membrane cholesterol levels of this magnitude have raised the speculation that the lipid organization of the lens membrane is highly specialized, consisting of cholesterol-poor and cholesterol-rich planar regions. Using small angle x-ray diffraction approaches, we recently provided direct evidence that cholesterol is organized into discrete clusters or domains within normal, non-cataractous lens plasma membranes (27Jacob R.F. Cenedella R.J. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31613-31618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These cholesterol domains were identified by prominent scattering signals corresponding to a reproducible unit cell periodicity of 34.0 Å, consistent with a bilayer structure comprised of cholesterol monomers arranged in a tail-to-tail orientation (28Craven B.M. Nature. 1976; 260: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 29Harris J.S. Epps D.E. Davis S.R. Kezdy F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 34: 3851-3857Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cholesterol domains were observed in both native and reconstituted lens membranes and remained stable over a broad range of temperature and relative humidity levels (27Jacob R.F. Cenedella R.J. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31613-31618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These findings were consistent with the idea that pure cholesterol phases form within cell membranes at C/P mole ratios in excess of 1.0 (30Houslay M.D. Stanley K.K. Dynamics of Biological Membranes: Influence on Synthesis, Structure and Function. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1982Google Scholar), as confirmed by a number of experiments employing theoretical, model, and native membrane systems (31Bach D. Borochov N. Wachtel E. Chem. Phys.

Little is known about the structure and molecular organization of the lens fiber cell plasma membrane in cataracts. The presence of cholesterol domains in normal lens membranes would suggest that they are important in maintaining lens transparency. If cholesterol domain formation in normal lens membranes is a biophysical necessity given such extremely high levels of cholesterol, it would be reasonable to expect that perturbation of the cholesterol content of the lens plasma membrane would result in disturbance of cholesterol domain and lens membrane structure. Thus, changes in membrane cholesterol composition and structural organization could contribute to cataractogenesis. In this study, small angle x-ray diffraction approaches were used to examine the relationship between cataracts and the structural organization of cholesterol in the lens fiber cell plasma membrane. Whole lens plasma membranes were isolated from normal and cataractous human lenses for these experiments. Cholesterol and phospholipid quantitation revealed that the C/P mole ratio of cataractous lens membranes was ∼54% lower than that of normal lens membranes. Immiscible cholesterol monohydrate domains were present in both normal and cataractous whole lens plasma membranes and remained stable over a broad range of temperature and relative humidity conditions. However, the diffraction peaks corresponding to cholesterol domains in the cataractous lens membranes were more intense as compared with controls, suggesting that membrane-restricted cholesterol domains are a more prominent feature of this disease. These results were quite surprising since it was initially hypothesized that the lower C/P mole ratio in the cataractous membranes would yield relatively weaker or smaller cholesterol domains. Data collected in this study suggest that lower levels of cholesterol paradoxically produce more stable domains in cataractous lens membranes. The presence of prominent and more stable cholesterol domains in the cataract lens membrane may reflect changes in phospholipid content and distribution as a function of aging and cataractogenesis. Modification of the lens membrane by age-related insults, such as oxidative stress, may also promote cholesterol domain formation. Three normal, control lenses were obtained from the Kentucky Lions Eye Foundation and Eye Bank (Louisville, KY). Donors ranged in age from 73 to 80 years. Two lenses containing mixed cortical and nuclear mature cataracts were kindly provided by Dr. Vittorio Rasi (Udine, Italy). Donors were 78 and 80 years of age. Control and cataractous lenses were decapsulated and separately homogenized in 3 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) using a glass Dounce homogenizer. Plasma membranes were isolated using an approach based on the method of Russell et al. (38Russell P. Robison Jr., W.G. Kinoshita J.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 32: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the homogenates were initially centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 8 °C. Sample pellets were washed three times with buffer A using the same centrifugation settings. The pellets were then extracted twice with 7 m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), extracted twice with NaOH buffer (0.1n NaOH + 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and washed twice with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 (buffer B). Final control and cataract sample pellets were each resuspended in 1–2 ml of buffer B. Small aliquots of the lens membrane preparations were taken for protein quantitation using a modified Lowry protein assay (39Lees M.B. Paxman S. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations for both control and cataractous lens membranes samples are listed in Table I. Main intrinsic protein of 26 kDa and its degradation product of 22 kDa were the principle proteins present in both control and cataractous membrane samples, as characterized using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown).Table IComposition of whole lens membrane samplesProteinCholesterolPhospholipidC/P1-aCholesterol-to-phospholipid mole ratio; the molecular weight of phospholipid is estimated at 760 g/mol.μg/μlμg/μlμg/μlmolNormal lens membrane1.3230.5920.3703.14Cataractous lens membrane0.8800.2150.2501.691-a Cholesterol-to-phospholipid mole ratio; the molecular weight of phospholipid is estimated at 760 g/mol. Open table in a new tab Total lipids from approximately one-third of each lens membrane suspension were Folch extracted as previously described (40Fleschner C.R. Cenedella R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dissolved in chloroform. Aliquots of these lipid extracts were taken for gas-chromatograph quantitation of cholesterol (41Cenedella R.J. Lipids. 1982; 17: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and colorimetric assay of phospholipid (42Pollet S. Ermidou S. Le Saux F. Monge M. Baumann N. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 916-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compositions of the control and cataract membrane suspensions are listed in Table I. Control and cataractous lens plasma membrane samples were oriented for x-ray diffraction analysis as described previously (27Jacob R.F. Cenedella R.J. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31613-31618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 43Mason R.P. Shoemaker W.J. Shajenko L. Chambers T.E. Herbette L.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma membrane samples (in buffer B) were loaded into Lucite sedimentation cells using sample volumes to achieve 230 μg of phospholipid per aliquot. Each sedimentation cell contained an aluminum foil substrate upon which the membrane pellets were collected. The membrane samples were centrifuged in a Sorvall AH-629 swinging bucket ultracentrifuge rotor (DuPont Corp., Wilmington, DE) at 35,000 × g for 50 min at 5 °C. Samples were washed three times with diffraction buffer (0.5 mm HEPES + 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3). After the final washing cycle, the supernatants were aspirated and the aluminum foil substrates, supporting the membrane pellets, were removed from the sedimentation cells and mounted on curved glass slides. The samples were then placed in hermetically sealed brass canisters in which temperature and relative humidity were controlled during x-ray diffraction experiments. The oriented lens plasma membrane samples were aligned at grazing incidence with respect to a collimated, monochromatic x-ray beam produced by a Rigaku Rotaflex RU-200, high-brilliance microfocus generator (Rigaku USA, Danvers, MA). Analytical x-rays are generated by electron bombardment of a rotating copper anode and filtered through a thin nickel foil to provide monochromatic CuKα radiation (Kα1 and Kα2unresolved; λ = 1.54 Å). Collimation of the x-ray beam is achieved using a double-focusing Franks mirror (diffraction camera). Diffraction data were collected on a one-dimensional, position-sensitive electronic detector (Innovative Technologies, Newburyport, MA) using a sample to detector distance of 150 mm. Representative two-dimensional diffraction patterns for each sample were also collected on Kodak storage phosphorscreen film (europium matrix, Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) and analyzed using a computerized PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Two-dimensional data were collected at a sample to detector distance of 80 mm. Crystalline cholesterol monohydrate was used to verify the calibration of the detectors. The unit cell periodicity, or d-space, of the membrane lipid bilayer is the measured distance from the center of one lipid bilayer to the next, including surface hydration. The d-spaces for the membrane multibilayer samples were calculated using Bragg's Law, hλ=2dsinθEquation 1 in which h is the diffraction order number, λ is the wavelength of the x-ray radiation (1.54 Å), d is the membrane lipid bilayer unit cell periodicity, and θ is the Bragg angle equal to one-half the angle between the incident beam and scattered beam. Saturated salt solutions were used to define the relative humidity (RH) levels employed in these x-ray diffraction analyses. The following salt solutions (with associated RH in parentheses) were used in these experiments: Mg(NO3)26H2O (52%), K2C4H4O6½H2O (74%), NaKC4H4O64H2O (87%), and Na2C4H4O62H2O (92%). Small angle x-ray diffraction approaches were used to characterize the structural organization of fiber cell plasma membranes isolated from both normal and cataractous human lenses. Representative x-ray diffraction profiles obtained from oriented normal and cataractous lenses at 30 °C, 87% RH are shown in Fig.1. These meridional diffraction patterns are consistent with a biphasic structural organization in which cholesterol monohydrate domains, corresponding to diffraction orders 1′ and 2′, exist within a cholesterol-poor liquid crystalline membrane bilayer phase, corresponding to diffraction orders 1 and 2 (where present). Comparison of normal versus cataractous lens membrane diffraction patterns reveals that the overall membrane resolution is greater in the cataractous preparations, with diffraction peaks that are more intense and better resolved. The relative intensities of the diffraction peaks corresponding to cholesterol domains are also significantly greater in cataractous lens membranes, suggesting a more ordered lipid membrane structure. These data were confirmed with two-dimensional diffraction analysis as shown in Fig.2.Figure 2Two-dimensional diffraction patterns obtained from oriented clear and cataractous human lens fiber cell plasma membrane samples. Data were collected on x-ray film at 20 °C, 87% RH. Meridional diffraction patterns were generated from whole lens membranes isolated from normal control lenses (A) and cataractous lenses (B). Diffraction bands are labeled as for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Control and cataractous lens membranes were examined over a broad range of relative humidity levels (Fig.3). Diffraction peaks corresponding to cholesterol domains (periodicity of 34.0 Å) were observed in control membranes at each relative humidity level, with the greatest cholesterol peak intensity occurring at 52% RH. The periodicity of the cholesterol-poor phospholipid membrane bilayer increased by 43% (57.3 to 82.1 Å) as a function of increasing relative humidity. Cholesterol domains were also identified in cataractous lens plasma membranes and the scattering peaks associated with these domains were noticeably more intense as compared with control profiles. As for the normal lens membranes, the calculated periodicity of the cholesterol domains in cataractous lenses was unaffected by relative humidity, with a reproducible d-space of 34.0 Å. The periodicity of the phospholipid bilayer phase in the cataractous membrane sample increased by 25% (51.2 to 64.0 Å) over the same relative humidity range used for control lens membranes. Cholesterol domains were also observed in normal and cataractous lens plasma membranes over a broad range of temperature levels (Fig. 4). With relative humidity held constant at 87%, diffraction peaks corresponding to cholesterol domains were more intense in cataractous membrane profiles as compared with controls. A general decrease in phospholipid bilayer periodicity was observed for control membranes as a function of increasing temperature, although lower temperatures resulted in some attenuation of phospholipid bilayer scattering intensity. The phospholipid bilayerd-space of the cataractous lens membranes decreased from 81.4 to 71.3 Å as the temperature was increased from 15 to 40 °C. Control and cataractous lens membrane x-ray scattering data were also collected at 52% RH over the same temperature range. As observed at 87% RH, cholesterol peak intensities were greater in cataractous membranes as compared with controls. The d-spaces associated with the phospholipid bilayer regions decreased by 8.9 Å (15%) and 1.2 Å (2%), control and cataractous lens membranes respectively, as temperature was increased from 5 to 40 °C. Among its several unique properties, the lens fiber cell plasma membrane is particularly noted for its unusually high relative concentrations of cholesterol. Lens plasma membranes have C/P mole ratios that range from 1.0 to 4.0, with higher cholesterol content found in the lens nucleus (24Li L.K. So L. Spector A. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 600-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Li L.K. So L. Spector A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Several reports have provided evidence that the C/P mole ratio increases with age (25Li L.K. So L. Spector A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but changes in the C/P mole ratio in cataractous lens membranes are not well understood. The amount of cholesterol present in whole lenses has been measured in cataracts, but with disparate results. Some reports provide evidence that the relative amount of cholesterol in cataractous lenses is not significantly different than the amount of cholesterol in normal lenses (6Rosenfeld L. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 33: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Li L.K. So L. Spector A. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 600-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Fleschner C.R.

However, some investigators have found increased cholesterol levels (5Cotlier E. Obara Y. Toftness B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45Roy D. Rosenfeld L. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 35: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 46Zigman S. Paxhia T. Marinetti G. Girsch S. Curr. Eye Res. 1984; 3: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), while others have reported decreased cholesterol content in cataracts (4Broekhuyse R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 187: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There is some evidence to suggest that cholesterol depletion or restriction of cholesterol availability may be associated with the development of cataracts. Pharmacologic inhibition of lens cholesterolgenesis has been shown to induce cataracts in dogs (47Gerson R.J. MacDonald J.S. Alberts A.W. Chen J. Yudkovitz J.B. Greenspan M.D. Rubin L.F. Bokelman D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), rats (48Cenedella R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1979; 29: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 49Cenedella R.J. Bierkamper G.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1979; 28: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 50Mizuno G.R. Chapman C.J. Chipault J.R. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 644: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and humans (51Kirby T.J. Acher R.W.P. Perry H.O. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1962; 68: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 52Kirby T.J. Trans. Am. Ophthalmol. Soc. 1967; 65: 493Google Scholar, 53Laughlin R.C. Carey T.F. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1962; 182: 129Google Scholar). Treatment of rats with U18666A, an inhibitor of 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase (an enzyme upstream of cholesterol in its biosynthetic pathway), has been shown to decrease cholesterol synthesis in the lens (54Cenedella R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1983; 37: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), reduce the cortical C/P mole ratio (55Cenedella R.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1985; 4: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), disrupt the ultrastructure of lens fiber cell membranes (11Kuszak J.R. Khan A.R. Cenedella R.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 261-267PubMed Google Scholar), and promote the development of irreversible nuclear cataracts (49Cenedella R.J. Bierkamper G.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1979; 28: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, congenital defects in cholesterol metabolism (e.g. Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and cerebrotendinous xanthamatosis) have also been associated with increased risk of cataracts (reviewed by Cenedella (56Cenedella R.J. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1996; 40: 320-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). Collectively, these data suggest that reduction or other changes in lens cholesterol content can have deleterious effects on lens function (i.e.transparency). However, the relationship between cataracts, altered cholesterol content, and lens plasma membrane structural organization has not been adequately characterized. In this study, small angle x-ray diffraction approaches were used to directly examine the structure of plasma membranes isolated from cataractous lens fiber cells. The C/P mole ratio measured for these membranes was 54% lower than that of controls (TableI), which is consistent with cholesterol depletion in cataracts or to selective loss of other membrane fractions due to lens membrane disintegration and vesiculation (6Rosenfeld L. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 33: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the C/P mole ratio measured in these cataractous whole lens plasma membranes or membrane fractions is still sufficient to induce cholesterol domain formation, since C/P mole ratios in excess of 1.0 have been shown to promote the formation of separate cholesterol domains in cell membranes (30Houslay M.D. Stanley K.K. Dynamics of Biological Membranes: Influence on Synthesis, Structure and Function. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1982Google Scholar). However, it was hypothesized that the lower C/P mole ratio of the cataractous lens membrane would result in less stable cholesterol domains and diminished x-ray scattering intensity as compared with control lens membranes. The principal finding of this study is that cataractous lens plasma membranes, contrary to our initial hypothesis, contained prominent cholesterol domains. Bragg peaks corresponding to cholesterol domains were more intense and better resolved in the cataract diffraction profiles than cognate peaks in control profiles, suggesting that cholesterol domains are better defined and more ordered in the cataractous lens membrane. These comparative effects were consistent across all experimental conditions (temperature and relative humidity). Cholesterol domains in the cataractous lens membrane were stable over a broad range of temperature and relative humidity levels, as were cholesterol domains in normal lens membranes. In both normal and cataractous fiber cell plasma membranes, cholesterol domains were observed to coexist with a phospholipid, liquid crystalline bilayer phase that was significantly influenced by changes in temperature and humidity. Such broad changes in the sterol-poor membrane bilayer environment may be due to complex acyl chain, lipid head group, and protein composition of the lens membrane. Several additional and interesting features of the sterol-poor membrane bilayer were observed in this study. First, the relative intensities of the cholesterol peaks were inversely related to relative humidity levels; maximal cholesterol peak intensities were obtained at 52% RH. This relationship was observed in both normal and cataractous lens membranes (see Figs. 3 and 4) and is also consistent with earlier findings from x-ray diffraction analyses of non-cataractous, nuclear and cortical lens membranes (27Jacob R.F. Cenedella R.J. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31613-31618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One possible explanation of this phenomenon is that optimum structural organization in the lens is achieved at a lower water content. The average water content of the human lens is ∼65% (57Maraini G. Mangili R. CIBA Found. Symp. 1973; 19: 79-97Google Scholar), and maintenance of proper hydration levels is crucial for optimal refractive power and lens function (58Zink J.M. Koenig J.L. Williams T.R. Ophthalmic Res. 1997; 29: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). At 52% RH, the water space between the sample membrane bilayers would be diminished, perhaps imitating the minimized extracellular spaces between the tightly juxtaposed cells of the ocular lens. Second, the sterol-poor component of cataractous lens membranes was more resistant to humidity and temperature modulations than were normal membranes. Over a range of 52 to 92% RH, cataractous membrane periodicity changed by only 25% as compared with 43% for normal membrane periodicity. Similar differences in response to temperature fluctuations were also observed. This may reflect an increase in membrane rigidity associated with these cataracts. The anisotropy or rigidity of lens fiber cell plasma membranes has been shown to increase with aging (59Liang J.N. Rossi M.R. Andley U.P. Curr. Eye Res. 1989; 8: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 60Borchman D. Byrdwell W.C. Yappert M.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 3938-3942PubMed Google Scholar, 61Sato H.

Sci. 1998; 39: 1053-1058PubMed Google Scholar). What qualities of the cataractous lens fiber cell membrane would account for more prominent cholesterol domain formation in the presence of diminished levels of cholesterol? One obvious answer would be that these structural changes are a result of extensive modification of lens membrane components, including phospholipids and sterols. For example, membrane lipid oxidation has been shown to be increased in cataract but not normal lens tissue (63Bhuyan K.C. Bhuyan D.K. Podos S.M. Life Sci. 1986; 38: 1463-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and lipid oxidation products accumulate in the lens as a function of aging (62Borchman D. Yappert M.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1053-1058PubMed Google Scholar). If phospholipid-cholesterol interactions are assumed to keep cholesterol domain formation within certain limits, oxidative insult to lens membrane phospholipids may result in reduced phospholipid-cholesterol interaction and increased cholesterol self-association. This hypothesis is supported by experiments conducted in our laboratory showing that oxidative stress independently induces the formation of well defined cholesterol domains in model membrane systems, an effect that is attenuated by treatment with vitamin E. 2R. F. Jacob and R. P. Mason, unpublished data. Lenticular enrichment of sphingomyelin and its lens-specific derivative, 4,5-dihydrosphingomyelin, may also contribute to maximization of cholesterol domain structures in lens plasma membranes. Sphingophospholipids account for greater than 50% of total lens phospholipids (22Byrdwell W.C. Borchman D. Porter R.A. Taylor K.G. Yappert M.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 4333-4343PubMed Google Scholar) and increase even more substantially with age and cataract development (4Broekhuyse R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 187: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5Cotlier E. Obara Y. Toftness B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 61Sato H.

Eye Res. 1976; 23: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Age-related accumulation of sphingomyelin is also correlated with membrane rigidity (60Borchman D. Byrdwell W.C. Yappert M.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 3938-3942PubMed Google Scholar). The exact role of sphingomyelin and dihydrosphingomyelin in cholesterol domain formation remains to be elucidated, but it can be speculated that their rigid molecular structure may resist strong cholesterol interactions, thus promoting cholesterol clustering. The biological or functional significance of decreased cholesterol content and increased cholesterol domain structural organization in cataracts is not completely understood. Previous studies demonstrating the presence of cholesterol domains in normal lens membranes suggest that cholesterol domains are necessary for transparency or are at least conductive to transparency at some level (27Jacob R.F. Cenedella R.J. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31613-31618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Perhaps excessive cholesterol domain formation contributes to cataractogenesis by permitting the binding of soluble lens proteins (crystallins) to the fiber cell plasma membrane. Although a certain basal level of crystallin association with fiber cell membranes occurs in normal lenses, massive binding of crystallins to lens membranes occurs in human cataracts (65Chandrasekher G. Cenedella R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, similar crystallin binding effects were observed for lens membranes isolated from rats treated with U18666A (66Cenedella R.J. Fleschner C.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 801-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 67Chandrasekher G. Cenedella R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that changes in membrane lipid composition were related to crystallin-membrane binding. Tang et al. (68Tang D. Borchman D. Yappert M.C. Cenedella R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that increasing the cholesterol content of model membranes enriched with sphingomyelin attenuated the binding of α-crystallin; however, lens membrane-crystallin binding properties associated with cholesterol domains have not been examined. These data suggest a relationship between cataracts, low membrane cholesterol levels, and the abnormal or excessive association of soluble lens protein with fiber cell plasma membranes. The structural state of cholesterol in this process has not yet been identified. Based on available data, it is hypothesized that recruiting cholesterol out the phospholipid regions of the membrane bilayer to form larger sterol domains may result in a net increase in crystallin association with total lens membrane. Finally, it should be noted that these findings represent developments in mature cortical or nuclear cataracts and may not reflect all the changes that occur in earlier and later stages of cataract progression. Accurate measurement of changes in membrane structural organization at later stages of cataract may be complicated by the fact that extensive membrane vacuolization and disintegration have been reported to occur in advanced forms of cataract (10Garner M.H.

However, structural analyses of fiber cell membranes derived from younger, healthy lenses as well as from more progressively diseased lenses will be important in providing further insights into the pathogenesis of cataracts.

Determining the chemical structure of 10E4 antigen is, therefore, an important aspect of structure elucidation of scrapie lesions, and a prerequisite for designing experiments to understand its role in scrapie pathogenesis. Toward this aim, we have examined preparations of heparan sulfate, with differing sulfate contents, for binding by 10E4 antibody. The highest antigenicity was observed in a preparation (HS-1) with the lowest sulfate content. HS-1 was partially depolymerized with heparin lyase III, and oligosaccharide fragments examined for 10E4 antigen expression by the neoglycolipid technology. An antigen-positive and two antigen-negative tetrasaccharides were isolated and examined by electrospray mass spectrometry. The antigen-positive tetrasaccharide sequence on heparan sulfate was thus deduced to contain a unique unsulfated motif that includes an N-unsubstituted glucosamine in the sequence, UA-GlcN-UA-GlcNAc. Antibody binding experiments with neoglycolipids prepared from a series of heparin/heparan sulfate disaccharides, and the trisaccharide derived from the antigen-positive tetrasaccharide after removal of the terminal hexuronic acid, show that both the penultimate glucosamine and the outer nonsulfated hexuronic acid are important for 10E4 antigenicity.

Science (Wash. D. C.). 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4014) Google Scholar). There is considerable progress in knowledge of the molecular and cellular biology of prions, but precise details of the mechanism of conversion to the disease-associated form, PrPSc, remain to be elucidated (2Harris D.A. Prions. Molecular and Cellular Biology. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK1999Google Scholar). Much interest has been stimulated in the interactions of PrP with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate and heparin. This has arisen as a result of the finding (3Snow A.D. Wight T.N. Nochlin D. Koike Y. Kimata K. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 601-611PubMed Google Scholar) that amyloid plaques, which occur in the clinically manifest stage of experimental scrapie (as in the human transmissible encephalopathies and Alzheimer's disease) are rich in heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs).1 The effects of administering heparin and heparan sulfate and other highly acidic materials have been investigated on the course of experimental scrapie infections (4Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5Caughey B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1994; 343: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been shown that such acidic compounds can “cure” infected cells or lengthen the survival of scrapie-infected animals. It is not yet known, however, whether these effects are mediated by direct binding to PrPC and PrPSc, or by indirect mechanisms. Nor is it known whether endogenous glycosaminoglycans or proteoglycans are involved in the normal physiological interactions with prion protein or in pathological interactions as has been suggested (5Caughey B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1994; 343: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It will be important to elucidate at the molecular level any such interactions as a lead to rational therapeutic designs. heparan sulfate proteoglycans N-aminoacetyl-N-(9-anthracenylmethyl)-1,2-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine collision-induced dissociation electrospray-mass spectrometry glucuronic acid glucosamine N-acetylglucosamine N-sulfated glucosamine high performance liquid chromatography high performance thin layer chromatography heparan sulfate neoglycolipid phosphate-buffered saline normal cellular prion protein abnormal scrapie prion protein strong anion exchange Tris-buffered saline hexuronic acid 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid Heparan sulfates are major components of the proteoglycans in nervous tissue occurring at the surface of cells and in the extracellular matrix (6Ruoslahti E.

The carbohydrate chains are negatively charged polymers containing disaccharide units of hexuronic acid andN-acetylated or N-sulfated glucosamine. There are diverse patterns of sulfation along the oligosaccharide chains, there being less sulfation overall in heparan sulfates relative to heparin (9Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Evidence has been forthcoming for the possible involvement of a specific carbohydrate sequence of heparan sulfate in scrapie pathogenesis. In an immunohistochemical study aimed at examining the temporal relationship between HSPGs and the known sites of PrP pathology, a mouse model of scrapie was selected, which is characterized by both fibrillar amyloid and nonamyloid PrPSc (10McBride P.A. Wilson M.I. Eikenlenboom P. Tunstall A. Bruce M.E. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 149: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Six monoclonal antibodies to HSPGs were investigated of which three were directed to core proteins and three to the carbohydrate chains. The presence of one of the carbohydrate antigens, detected with 10E4 antibody (but not with the other antibodies), correlated strikingly with the areas of abnormal PrP deposition, not only in the amyloid plaques, but also in the earliest detectable lesions in the brain of the infected mice. In particular, the presence of the 10E4 antigen in proximity to the diffuse forms of PrPSc in neuro-anatomically defined target sites, suggests a close relationship between this determinant on heparan sulfate and the formation of the scrapie lesions. We are investigating the carbohydrate sequence of the 10E4 determinant by the neoglycolipid (NGL) technology (11Feizi T. Stoll M.S. Yuen C.-T. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 484-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) in conjunction with electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS). A recent advance involving the generation of oligosaccharide probes in the form of fluorescent NGLs (12Stoll M.S. Feizi T. Loveless R.W. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Yuen C.-T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) has enhanced the power of the technology in pinpointing and isolating bioactive oligosaccharides among highly heterogeneous populations. Here we describe the identification by this means and the assignment of an unusual carbohydrate sequence in the 10E4 antigen. Mouse monoclonal antibody 10E4, IgMκ (13David G. Bai X.M. Van Der, Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van Der, Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) was from Seikagaku (Japan). Rabbit anti-mouse Ig-peroxidase was from Dako (Denmark). Protein LA-peroxidase was from Actigen (Cambridge, UK). FASTTM 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-sulfonic acid) were from Sigma (Poole, UK). Heparan sulfate fractions, HS-1, -2, -3, and -4 with sulfur contents of around 5, 8, 9, and 10%, respectively, from porcine intestinal mucosa (14Griffin C.C. Lindhardt R.J. Van Gorp C.L. Toida T. Hileman R.E. Schubert R.L. Brown S.E. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 276: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) were from Celsus Laboratories (Cincinnati, OH). Recombinant heparin lyase III (heparinase III, E.C. 4.2.2.8) was from IBEX Technologies (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Heparin/heparan sulfate disaccharides (I-, II-, III-, and IV-A; I-, II-, III-, and IV-S; I-, II-, III-, and IV-H), chondroitin sulfate A and poly-l-lysine (150–300 kDa) were from Sigma. HS-1 was partially depolymerized by limited digestion with heparin lyase III essentially as described (15Chai W. Luo J. Lim C.K. Lawson A.M. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2060-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the reaction stopped at around 40% completion. Briefly, the heparan sulfate (150 mg) was incubated with heparin lyase III (300 mU) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1, 6 ml) containing 0.1m NaCl at 30 °C for 8.5 h. The digestion mixture was desalted on a Sephadex G-10 column (1.6 × 36 cm) eluted with water at a flow rate of 20 ml/h, lyophilized, and fractionated on a gel filtration column of Bio-Gel P-6 (1.6 × 90 cm) eluting with 0.2m NH4Cl (pH 3.5) at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. The eluate was monitored on-line by refractive index and UV at 232 nm. The pooled fractions were lyophilized and desalted on a Sephadex G-10 column (1.6 × 36 cm). HPLC of HS fragments was carried out on an analytical strong anion exchange (SAX) column, S5-SAX (4.6 × 250 mm, Phase Separations Ltd., Clwyd, UK) using a titanium-lined Gilson liquid chromatograph system fitted with a variable wavelength UV detector monitor at 232 nm. Elution was carried out with a gradient of NaCl (solvent A: 0.2m NaCl and solvent B: 1.5 m NaCl; pH 3.5): 0–5% B in 15 min followed by 5–10% B in 15 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The major fractions were collected, desalted on a Sephadex G10 column, and lyophilized. Fluorescent NGLs were prepared and resolved by high performance (HP) TLC essentially as described previously (12Stoll M.S. Feizi T. Loveless R.W. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Yuen C.-T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, the following were added to lyophilized HS fragments, typically 50 nmol: 3 μl of water, 50 μl ofN-aminoacetyl-N-(9-anthracenylmethyl)-1,2-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (ADHP) stock solution (7 nmol/μl CHCl3/MeOH 1:3, v/v) and 10 μl of freshly prepared tetrabutylammonium cyanoborohydride solution (20 μg/μl of methanol). The mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 90 h. Reaction mixtures were resolved by HPTLC using a solvent mixture of chloroform/methanol/water, 60:35:8. The fluorescent NGLs were visualized under UV light at 366 nm. The fluorescent NGLs were fractionated on an amide column (TSK-amide 80, 4.6 × 250 mm) using a gradient of 10 to 70% B in solvent A (solvent A: chloroform/methanol/water 130:70:9 and solvent B: chloroform/methanol/water 10:20:8, both containing 0.1% formic acid) in 30 min and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluates were monitored with a fluorescence detector at 256 nm (excitation) and 405 nm (emission). The 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic residue (ΔUA) at the nonreducing terminus of the HS-1 tetrasaccharides was removed by oxymercuration (16Chai W. Kogelberg H. Lawson A.M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, to a solution of 25 nmol of tetrasaccharide in 18 μl H2O was added 2 μl of Hg reagent (20 mm mercuric acetate in 130 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0). The reaction mixture was kept at room temperature for 30 min and immediately lyophilized. Conjugation of the lyophilized reaction product to ADHP was essentially as described above, but the incubation time was limited to 24 h. Preparative TLC (11Feizi T. Stoll M.S. Yuen C.-T. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 484-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was performed to isolate the major NGL products from the two reaction mixtures, and to remove the Hg reagent salts, excess lipid and side reaction products. NGLs were resolved by HPTLC using as solvent chloroform/methanol/water, 60:35:8, by volume. Binding of monoclonal antibody 10E4 to NGLs chromatographed on aluminum-backed HPTLC plates (Merck) was assayed essentially as described previously (17Stoll M.S. Mizuochi T. Childs R.A. Feizi T. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) except that Plexigum was not used. In brief, after blocking nonspecific binding sites with 1% casein (Pierce) in Tris-buffered saline, 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (TBS), the chromatogram was overlaid with 10E4 antibody (10 μg/ml) in 1% casein; antibody binding was detected using protein-LA-peroxidase (1/500 of stock) in 1% casein followed by FASTTM 3,3′-diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate. For comparing intensities of antibody binding, immunostained bands were scanned, and the derived peak areas scored using a Shimadzu CS-9000 scanner (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) with a flying-spot reflectance absorption mode at 460 nm. Microwell binding assays were performed essentially as described (18Loveless R.W. Floyd-O'Sullivan G. Raynes J.G. Yuen C.-T. Feizi T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) except that Immulon 4 microwells (Dynex Technologies, Billingshurst, UK) were first precoated by applying to each, 50 μl of a 50 μg/ml solution of poly-l-lysine in phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm phosphate buffer, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS) and incubating for 2 h at 37 °C. Glycosaminoglycans in PBS were added at the indicated concentrations and allowed to dry at 37 °C for 16 h. After blocking with 3% w/v bovine serum albumin in PBS, binding of 10E4 (10 μg/ml) was detected using peroxidase-labeled rabbit antibodies to mouse immunoglobulins (25 μg/ml) followed by 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-sulfonic acid) peroxidase substrate. Absorbance was read at 405 nm. Negative-ion ES-MS and collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS were carried out with a Q-Tof instrument (Micromass Ltd., Altrincham, UK). NGLs were dissolved in chloroform/methanol/water 25:25:8, by volume, typically at a concentration of 10 to 20 pmol/μl, of which 5 μl was loop-injected. Mobile phase (acetonitrile/0.5 mm aq. NH4HCO3 1:1, v/v) was delivered by a syringe pump at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Cone voltage was maintained at 30 V whereas capillary voltage was at 3 kV. CID spectra were obtained using argon as the collision gas at a pressure of 1.7 bar. The source temperature was kept at 80 °C. The collision energy was optimized for maximal structural information, ranging between 25 and 35 V. Analysis of NGLs resolved on TLC plates was carried out in situ by liquid secondary-ion mass spectrometry on a VG ZAB2-E mass spectrometer (Micromass) as described previously (19Chai W. Rosankiewicz J.R. Lawson A.M. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 269: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Initial binding experiments revealed that the preparation of heparan sulfate, HS-1, that had the lowest sulfate content elicited the greatest binding signal with 10E4 antibody (Fig.1, inset). No binding signals were detected with chondroitin sulfate A, which has a sulfate content similar to that of HS-1. The HS-1 preparation was selected for further investigation. Partial depolymerization of HS-1 was carried out using heparin lyase III, and this was followed by gel filtration (Fig. 1). Pooled fractions containing the smaller fragments, fractions 1 to 6, were subjected to ES-MS analysis (TableI), and thereby found to be di- to octasaccharides with various N-acetyl and sulfate contents.Table IDetermination by ES-MS analysis of the monosaccharide contents and substitutions with acetyl and sulfate groups in oligosaccharides within the pooled HS-1 oligosaccharide fractions 1–6FractionMonosaccharide contentSubstitutionObserved massCalculated massAcetylSulfateDaDa1Di-01417.2417.12Di-10379.2379.13Tetra-11796.4796.212876.4876.110716.4716.24Tetra-20758.5758.25Hexa-211175.61175.3221255.61255.3201095.51095.36Octa-231672.51672.3241752.51752.3221592.51592.3131630.51630.3141710.61710.2Hexa-301137.41137.3 Open table in a new tab HS-1 oligosaccharide fractions 3 to 6 were converted to fluorescent NGLs, resolved by HPTLC, and examined for 10E4 antibody binding (Fig. 2, A andA′). Although little or no inhibitory activity could be detected in the free oligosaccharides at the highest concentrations tested (3 mg/ml, results not shown), antigen-positive components were detected among the NGLs of fractions 3, 5, and 6, but not in fraction 4. Those in fractions 5 and 6 were clearly minor components as they were barely detectable by fluorescence. Fraction 3, which contained tetrasaccharides (Table I) and in which the antigen-positive components appeared relatively more abundant (Fig. 2 A), was selected for further study. The nonderivatized fraction 3 oligosaccharides were further resolved by SAX HPLC (Fig.3 A) and the five most abundant subfractions, 3-1, -2, -3, -5, and -8, were converted into fluorescent NGLs and examined for 10E4 antibody binding (Fig. 2, B andB′). A duplex of strongly immunoreactive components was revealed in fraction 3-1, but no immunoreactivity was detected in the four other fractions tested. The mixture of NGLs in fraction 3-1 was resolved by HPLC (Fig. 3 B), and peaks designateda and b were found by chromatogram binding (not shown) to correspond to the respective immunoreactive componentsa and b in Fig. 2, B andB′.Figure 3HPLC profiles of HS-1 fragments and of NGLs derived from them. The oligosaccharides in HS-1 fraction 3 were resolved on a S5-SAX column (panel A) and the fluorescent NGLs derived from fraction 3-1 were resolved on a TSK-amide 80 column (panel B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ES mass spectrum of the NGL component a established the molecular mass as being 1610.8 Da ([M−2H]2−: m/z 804.4 and [M−3H]3−: m/z 535.9) (results not shown). This corresponds to the NGL of a nonsulfated tetrasaccharide containing a single acetyl group, as was detected also among the nonderivatized oligosaccharides in fraction 3 (Table I). The second immunoreactive component b was deduced to be a dehydrated form of component a (molecular mass of 1592.6 Da). The dehydration, a common occurrence in the derivatization of oligosaccharides having N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at the reducing end (11Feizi T. Stoll M.S. Yuen C.-T. Chai W. Lawson A.M.

CID MS/MS of the above-mentioned, doubly charged ion atm/z 804.4 from component a showed, in the low mass region (Fig. 4 A), C- and B-type fragment ions (20Domon B. Costello C.E. Glycoconj.

Thus the sequence of the tetrasaccharide could be deduced as follows. The C-type fragment ion atm/z 175 clearly identifies a ΔUA residue at the nonreducing end. The fragment ion at m/z 336 represents a mass increment of 161, corresponding to anN-unsubstituted glucosamine (GlcN) residue. The B-type fragment ion at m/z 494 represents a mass increment of 158, corresponding to a hexuronic acid (UA) and serves to identify unambiguously the sequence ΔUA-GlcN-UA-. The remaining mass of 1115 Da (1609 minus 494 Da) is in accord with the presence of a GlcNAc residue linked to the lipid moiety. Thus, the sequence of the antigen-positive NGL, a, is ΔUA-GlcN-UA-GlcNAc-ADHP.Knowing that the predominant cleavage site of the highly purified recombinant heparin lyase III is at a glucuronic acid (GlcA) residue (21Linhardt R.J.

The sequence of the tetrasaccharide was deduced from the CID MS/MS ions (Fig. 4 A) that arose from fragmentation of the NGL. The second immunoreactive neoglycolipid, with a measured molecular mass of 1592.6 Da, was deduced to be a dehydrated analog in which the elements of water are lost from the reducing end GlcNAc or lipid tail (11Feizi T. Stoll M.S. Yuen C.-T. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 484-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) during neoglycolipid formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The main components in the antigen-negative NGL fractions 3-3 and 3-5 were similarly analyzed by ES-MS (spectra not shown). The main component in fraction 3-3, molecular mass of 1652.8 Da ([M−2H]2−:m/z 825.4 and [M−3H]3−:m/z 549.9), is deduced to contain a nonsulfated tetrasaccharide with two acetyl groups. Here also, the carbohydrate sequence could be assigned from the fragment ions produced by CID MS/MS of the doubly charged ion m/z 825.4 (Fig.4 B). The fragment ion at m/z 175 indicated a ΔUA residue at the nonreducing end. The fragment ion atm/z 378 (a mass increment of 203) corresponds to a GlcNAc residue linked to the ΔUA and that atm/z 536 (a mass increment of 158) corresponds to an additional UA. The three fragment ions identify the sequence ΔUA-GlcNAc-UA-. The remaining mass (1115 Da) indicates a GlcNAc residue at the reducing terminal linked to the lipid. From these results, the sequence of this antigen-negative tetrasaccharide is deduced to be: ΔUA-GlcNAc-UA-GlcNAc.The main component in fraction 3-5, molecular mass 1690.9 Da ([M−2H]2−: m/z 844.4 and [M−3H]3−: m/z 562.6) is deduced to be a tetrasaccharide with one sulfate and one acetyl group. The sequence ΔUA-GlcNS-UA- can be assigned from the fragment ions produced by CID MS/MS of ion m/z 844.4 (Fig.4 C): C-type fragment ions at m/z 175 (ΔUA), m/z 416, a mass increment of 241 corresponding to GlcNS and the B-type ion m/z574 a mass increment of 158 corresponding to UA. The remaining mass of 1115 Da, again, indicates a GlcNAc residue linked to the lipid moiety. The location of sulfate in 3-5 can be assigned to the GlcN residue, as the fragment at m/z 416 (Fig.4 C) corresponds to a mass increment of 80 fromm/z 336. Thus, sequence of this antigen-negative tetrasaccharide is deduced to be: ΔUA-GlcNS-UA-GlcNAc. There was immunoreactivity in regions of lanes 3,5, and 6 corresponding to NGLs of disaccharides. As these were minor components, we examined for 10E4 immunoreactivity the NGLs of a series of twelve structurally defined heparin/heparan sulfate disaccharides (Table II and Fig.6). Among these, the NGL derived from ΔUA-GlcN gave by far the strongest binding signal. Weak binding (8–9-fold less intense in this semi-quantitative assay) was recorded to ΔUA-GlcN(6S), ΔUA-GlcNS, and ΔUA-GlcNAc(6S). It should be recalled that, in the NGLs, the inner monosaccharide is in a reduced, ring-opened form. The results are, nevertheless, in accord with the importance of the UA-GlcN sequence in 10E4 antigenicity. Other tentative interpretations of these data are (a) that 6-O-sulfated or N-sulfated glucosamine, orN-acetylglucosamine, but not a disulfated glucosamine, in the penultimate position may weakly cross-react with the nonsubstituted glucosamine, and (b) the antibody cannot accommodate an outer 2-O-sulfated hexuronic acid.Table IIHeparin/heparan sulfate disaccharides investigated for 10E4 antibody bindingDesignationSequenceRelative binding intensityI-AΔUA(2S)-GlcNAc(6S)–II-AΔUA-GlcNAc(6S)10.4III-AΔUA(2S)-GlcNAc–IV-AΔUA-GlcNAc–I-SΔUA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)–II-SΔUA-GlcNS(6S)–III-SΔUA(2S)-GlcNS–IV-SΔUA-GlcNS12.3I-HΔUA(2S)-GlcN(6S)–II-HΔUA-GlcN(6S)16.5III-HΔUA(2S)-GlcN–IV-HΔUA-GlcN100Antibody binding intensity was scored by scanning the immunostained NGL bands at 460 nm; intensities are expressed as peak areas relative to that for IV-H taken as 100% –, little or no binding detected. Open table in a new tab Antibody binding intensity was scored by scanning the immunostained NGL bands at 460 nm; intensities are expressed as peak areas relative to that for IV-H taken as 100% –, little or no binding detected. The major NGL product obtained after oxymercuration treatment to remove the terminal unsaturated hexuronic acid in the 10E4 antigen-positive tetrasaccharide fraction 3-1 (Fig. 6 A,lane 4) gave, by TLC-liquid secondary ion-MS, a [M−H]− ion at m/z 1451 and two fragment ions at m/z 1290 andm/z 1114 (not shown) corresponding to the expected sequence, GlcN-UA-GlcNAc-ADHP. The liquid secondary ion mass spectrum of the major NGL product of the similarly treated antigen-negative tetrasaccharide fraction 3-3 (Fig.7 A, lane 3) corresponded to that for GlcNAc-UA-GlcNAc-ADHP, ([M−H]−ion at m/z 1493 and fragment ions atm/z 1290 and m/z 1114). The lipid-linked trisaccharides derived from the antigen-positive and antigen-negative tetrasaccharides, together with the “parent” tetrasaccharides were examined for 10E4 antigenicity by TLC overlay (Fig. 7 B). Immunoreactivity was detected, as before, in the 3-1 tetrasaccharide but not in the trisaccharides. Thus the nonreducing end hexuronic acid in the 3-1 tetrasaccharide is required for 10E4 antigenicity. The 10E4 antigen-active tetrasaccharide is, to our knowledge, the first carbohydrate antigen sequence to have been assigned on heparan sulfate. Unexpectedly, the sequence lacks sulfate and constitutes a unique motif with an internal N-unsubstituted glucosamine. This residue is important for antigenicity of the tetrasaccharide as shown by the lack of antibody binding to the two tetrasaccharide analogs investigated, one of which has a N-acetylated, and the other a N-sulfated glucosamine at this position. The importance of N-unsubstituted glucosamine for eliciting strong 10E4 antibody binding is corroborated by the binding experiments with the series of NGLs derived from heparin/heparan sulfate disaccharides; only the disaccharide IV-H, containing theN-unsubstituted glucosamine shows strong binding. The weak 10E4 binding to the NGLs of the three disaccharides, III-H, IV-S, and II-A, raises the possibility that, in the heparan sulfate polysaccharide, certain of the monosulfated glucosamine andN-acetylglucosamine residues may contribute to antigenicity. From the binding data with the tri- and disaccharides, a further conclusion is drawn, namely that a hexuronic acid on the nonreducing side of the glucosamine is essential for 10E4 antigenicity and that it must be nonsulfated. Collectively our results are in accord with the preferential binding of 10E4 to heparan sulfate polysaccharide that is undersulfated. It is interesting that N-unsubstituted glucosamine was identified by van den Born et al. (24Van den Born J. Gunnarson K. Bakker M.A.H. Kjellén L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M. Berden J.H.M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31303-31309Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) to be a part of the heparan sulfate antigen recognized by another monoclonal antibody, JM-403. This antibody had been included by McBride et al.(10McBride P.A. Wilson M.I. Eikenlenboom P. Tunstall A. Bruce M.E. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 149: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in the immunohistochemical studies of scrapie lesions but was found not to overlap at all with 10E4 immunoreactivity. The JM-403 antigen sequence is clearly different from that of the 10E4 antigen, and the complete characterization of the two antigens will be important for identifying the definitive scrapie-associated heparan sulfate sequence. The occurrence of N-unsubstituted glucosamine as a natural component on HSPGs was considered doubtful until relatively recently. This is because the well documented steps in the biosynthesis of the sugar chains involve the formation of a polymer of repeated -GlcA-GlcNAc- units; this is followed by the action of a bifunctional enzyme that sequentially achieves N-deacetylation andN-sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine residues (25Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellén L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This appears to be a critical cue for further modifications of the carbohydrate chains, which include the epimerization of glucuronic to iduronic acid, and O-sulfation of the monosaccharides at various positions (25Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellén L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). A sulfatase that would desulfate the glucosamine has not yet been identified. Nevertheless, nonsulfatedN-unsubstituted glucosamine has been detected by chemical methods in various preparations of heparan sulfates. A preparation of endothelial HSPGs that was bound by L-selectin was reported to contain such N-unsubstituted glucosamine (26Norgard-Sumnicht K. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12012-12024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In quantitative studies (22Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), N-unsubstituted glucosamine was detected as a variable minor component (1–2 in every 50 monosaccharide residues) in heparan sulfates isolated from different sources. Structural studies with oligosaccharide fragments isolated from heparan sulfates have suggested that such glucosamine residues may be flanked by a glucuronic acid on the reducing and nonreducing side, and located in the boundary between low and high sulfated regions (22Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that they may also be interspersed in highly sulfated domains that contain iduronic acid residues (27Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38155-38162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The possibility thatN-unsubstituted glucosamine occurs naturally on HSPGs, rather than being an artifact of isolation or storage of the glycosaminoglycans has been strengthened by the finding that oligosaccharides containing N-unsubstituted glucosamine can serve as substrates for a newly characterized heparan sulfateO-sulfotransferase (27Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38155-38162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Shukla D. Liu J.

Arguably the strongest evidence for the natural occurrence ofN-unsubstituted glucosamine is that it has been identified as being a dominant part of the antigens recognized by two monoclonal antibodies, 10E4 and JM-403, each of which immunostains fresh frozen tissues with a distinct pattern (10McBride P.A. Wilson M.I. Eikenlenboom P. Tunstall A. Bruce M.E. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 149: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13David G. Bai X.M. Van Der, Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J.

Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Analyses of embryonic and adult tissues revealed that the expression of 10E4 antigen varies markedly during organogenesis and development (13David G. Bai X.M. Van Der, Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van Der, Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Thus 10E4 antigen, like a number of monoclonal antibody-defined carbohydrate antigens, is a differentiation antigen, which by analogy with those of the blood group Lewisx and Lewisa series (30Feizi T. Nature (Lond.). 1985; 314: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 31Brandley B.K. Swiedler S.J. Robbins P.W.

Biol. 1993; 3: 701-710Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar) can be predicted to have biological functions. There is strong precedence for assignments of roles to heparan sulfates, for example, as ligands and modulators of the activities of growth factors (34Gallagher J.T. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1998; 10: 137-144Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Just as exogenously added polyamines can deplete PrPSc from certain scrapie-infected cells (35Supattapone S. Nguyen H.-O.B. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14529-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), we propose that the 10E4 determinant, with its content of a free amine (and in multivalent display on heparan sulfate), is a candidate endogenous ligand for a protein or proteins in the pathway of PrPC to PrPSc conversion. Thus it will be important to determine the size and complete sequence of the 10E4 antigen, and investigate its role in the normal and pathological behavior of prion protein. In particular, the immunoreactive oligosaccharide(s) visualized as minor components in our chromatogram binding experiments with hexasaccharide fragments of HS-1 should be characterized, as the initial studies of David et al. (13David G. Bai X.M. Van Der, Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van Der, Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) indicated the 10E4 antigen contains glucosamine that isN-sulfated. It can be predicted, therefore, that the complete 10E4 antigen encompasses the tetrasaccharide sequence we have identified, flanked on one or other side by additional monosaccharide residues including N-sulfated glucosamine. The sulfation issue in regard to 10E4 antigen sequence will be important to clarify, as it has been suggested (5Caughey B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1994; 343: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that certain endogenous glycosaminoglycans or proteoglycans influence the in vivo behavior of PrP. Moreover, cell biological experiments have indicated that endocytosis of PrP is a prerequisite for the formation of PrPSc (2Harris D.A. Prions. Molecular and Cellular Biology. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK1999Google Scholar) and that negatively charged polysaccharides increase the rate of endocytosis of PrPC (36Shyng S.-L. Lehmann S. Moulder K.L. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30221-30229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Further work is under way to characterize hexasaccharides and longer oligosaccharides for 10E4 antigen activity.

Previously we found that activation of JNK in T-cells required costimulation of both T-cell receptor and auxiliary receptors such as CD28. In this study, we cloned a full-length human MEK kinase (MEKK) 2 cDNA from Jurkat T-cells and demonstrated that it was a major upstream MAPK kinase kinase for the JNK cascade in T-cells. The human MEKK2 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 619 amino acids and was the human counterpart of the reported murine MEKK2. It was 94% homologous with human and murine MEKK3 at the catalytic domains and 60% homologous at the N-terminal noncatalytic region. Northern blot analysis showed that MEKK2 was ubiquitously expressed, with the highest level in peripheral blood leukocytes. In T cells, MEKK2 was found to be a strong activator of JNK but not of extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPKs and to activate JNK-dependent AP-1 reporter gene expression. MEKK2 also synergized with anti-CD3 antibody to activate JNK in T cells, and stimulation of T cells led to induction of MEKK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Significantly, the JNK activation induced by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, but not by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and Ca2+ionophore A23187, was inhibited by dominant negative MEKK2 mutants.

It has been shown that during T-cell activation, activation of the JNK, but not of the Erk MAPK, cascade is dependent on costimulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) and the costimulatory receptor CD28 (29Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Jun/AP-1, the nuclear target of the JNK MAPK cascade, is also dependent on costimulation of TCR and CD28 in naı̈ve CD4+ T-cells (30Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). More recently, the role of the JNK MAPK cascade in T-cells was studied in gene-knockout mice, which showed that JNK1 and JNK2 play a crucial role in T-cell activation and differentiation (31Dong C.

Studies in fibroblasts indicated that members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) kinase (MEKK) gene family are the major MAPKKKs for the JNKs (1Su B.

MEKK1, the first MEKK identified in mammalian cells, was suggested to be involved in TCR-mediated JNK activation and cytokine gene expression (35Kaga S. Ragg S. Rogers K.A. Ochi A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4182-4189PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study suggested that MEKK2 rather than MEKK1 was involved in transducing TCR signals in T-cells (36Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks C.R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This study showed that murine MEKK2 but not MEKK1 is translocated to the T-cell/antigen-presenting cell interface during antigen stimulation (36Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks C.R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whether other members of the MEKK gene subfamily are involved in T-cell signal transduction is not clear. So far, no lymphocyte-specific MAPKKKs for the JNK cascade have been identified. In this study, we described the cloning and characterization of human MEKK2, a potent JNK MAPK activator, in T-cells. We found that MEKK2 was a specific JNK upstream-activating kinase in T-cells and was involved in transducing TCR/CD3-mediated T-cell signals for JNK MAPK activation and T-cell-specific gene expression. The degenerate oligonucleotides TTAATGGCNGTNAA(a/g)CA and TTNGCNCC(t/c)TTNAC(a/g)TCNC(g/t)(a/g)TG, which corresponded to sequences in kinase subdomains II and VII, respectively, of the yeast MAPKKK STE11 (37Rhodes N. Connell L. Errede B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1862-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were used to amplify related gene fragments by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with mRNA from Jurkat T-cells. A mixture of cDNA fragments of about 300 base pairs was amplified and subcloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for sequencing. We identified a cDNA fragment encoding a polypeptide 47% similar to STE11, 49% similar to murine MEKK1, and 99% similar to murine MEKK2 at the predicted kinase subdomains II-VII. This cDNA fragment was used as a probe to further screen a Jurkat cDNA library. We obtained four cDNA clones that contained a complete putative kinase domain, but all lacked the complete 5′ coding sequence. Full-length cDNA clones were isolated by further screening a human lymphocyte cDNA library (Invitrogen) with PCR with primers that matched the most 5′ sequence of the partial cDNA clones isolated from the Jurkat cDNA library. Ten individual clones were isolated, and the longest one, clone 2 g, was completely sequenced and used in this study. SRαRasL61, SRαRafBxB, SRαMEKK2, SRαHA-JNK1, SRαHA-Erk2, SRαHA-MEKK2, -73Col-Luc, -79Jun-Luc, IL-2-Luc, and pActin-β-Gal were described previously (2Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys.

The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MEKK2(NT) expression vector SrαHA-MEKK2(NT) was constructed by introducing anNcoI site into the first Met codon of MEKK2 by a PCR-based method and subcloning the NcoI-XhoI fragment that encodes amino acids 1–359 into the expression vector pSRα3HA. MEKK2(KM) is a MEKK2 mutant with a Lys-385 → Met mutation that was generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis. The MEKK2(KM) mutant cDNA was subcloned into SRαHA as described for SRαHA-MEKK2 (28Cheng J.

Expression and purification of the bacterial fusion protein glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun-(1–79) was previously described (6Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C.

Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). MEKK2 antibody 1128 was described previously (28Cheng J. Yang J. Xia Y. Karin M. Su B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and MEKK2 antibody 1129 was prepared by immunizing rabbits with GST human MEKK2 N-terminal region (amino acids 1–359) fusion protein. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 was purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). A multitissue poly(A)+blot was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and probed with a 1-kilobase HindIII-XhoI cDNA probe from the N-terminal region of human MEKK2 using the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Jurkat T-cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Jurkat T-cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (29Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell lysates were prepared 40 h after transfection as previously described (29Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) and incubated with appropriate antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C in a rotator. Then, protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for another 45 min. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 250 mmNaCl; 3 mm EDTA; 3 mm EGTA; and 100 mm Na3VO4) and twice with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6; 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate; 20 mmMgCl2; 2 mm EDTA; 2 mm EGTA; and 100 μm Na3VO4). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to kinase assays in 30 μl of kinase buffer with appropriate substrates in the presence of 0.5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 μm cold ATP. After 20 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and32P incorporation was determined with a Bio-Rad FX phosphorimaging apparatus (Bio-Rad). Luciferase assay was described previously (13Yang J. New L. Jiang Y. Han J. Su B. Gene. 1998; 212: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer TD-20/20 from Promega (Madison, WI). Western blot with anti-HA antibody 12CA5 and anti-MEKK2 antibodies 1128 and 1129 was performed as previously described using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (28Cheng J. Yang J. Xia Y. Karin M. Su B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To isolate a potential MAPKKK gene upstream of the JNK cascade from T-cells, we made degenerated oligonucleotides that corresponded to the sequences of the kinase subdomains II and VII of yeast MAPKKK STE11 (37Rhodes N. Connell L. Errede B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1862-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), because MAPKKK genes were highly conserved from yeast to mammals, and used them to amplify related gene fragments by reverse transcription-PCR of mRNA from Jurkat T-cells. A cDNA fragment with substantial homology to the catalytic domain of STE11, MEKK1, and murine MEKK2 was identified and used as a probe to clone a full-length cDNA from a human lymphocyte cDNA library as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This clone, clone 2 g, was completely sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of 619 amino acids. A homology search of the data base (NCBI-nr) revealed a high homology to murine MEKK2, suggesting that this clone was the human counterpart of murine MEKK2 (18Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This clone was also highly homologous to human MEKK3 (71%), murine MEKK3 (71%), and, to a lesser extent, human MEKK1 in the putative catalytic domain (58%). Thus we named the clone human MEKK2 (GenBankTM accession number AF111105). A comparison of the sequence of human and murine MEKK2 and human and murine MEKK3 is shown in Fig. 1 A. Northern blot analysis showed that human MEKK2 mRNA was strongly expressed in brain, heart, muscle, spleen, kidney, liver, placenta, and blood leukocytes but expressed at low levels in thymus, lung, small intestine, and colon (Fig. 1 B). We used MEKK2-specific antibody 1128 to immunoprecipitate the endogenous MEKK2 from Jurkat T-cells and found that the endogenous MEKK2 had an apparent molecular mass of about 70 kDa (Fig. 1 C). We recently demonstrated that in fibroblasts human MEKK2 is an important activating kinase of JNK and acts through formation of a specific MAPK module with JNKK2 and JNK1 (28Cheng J. Yang J. Xia Y. Karin M. Su B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To investigate whether MEKK2 is also involved in transducing T-cell-activating signals and JNK activation, we expressed full-length human MEKK2 with HA-tagged JNK1 in Jurkat T-cells and then determined the effect on JNK1 enzymatic activity. As shown in Fig.2 A, expression of the full-length MEKK2 cDNA in T-cells led to strong JNK1 activation. In contrast, it had no effect on Erk2, a JNK-related MAPK in T-cells. Expression of RasL61 and RafBxB, which are active forms of the Erk upstream activators Ras and Raf, respectively, led to Erk2, but not JNK1, activation in T-cells (Fig. 2 A). This result suggested that MEKK2 was a specific JNK, but not Erk, activator in T cells. Using the same protocol, we found that MEKK2 activated JNK2 similarly in T-cells (data not shown), suggesting that MEKK2 regulates both JNK1 and JNK2. To investigate whether MEKK2 participates in JNK-dependent gene expression, we used an AP-1 reporter plasmid, -73Col-Luc, to test the effects of MEKK2 on AP-1 transcription activity in Jurkat T-cells and COS-1 cells. Consistent with MEKK2 being an upstream activator for JNK, we found that MEKK2 activated AP-1 reporter gene expression both in T-cells and in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2 B). This result suggested that MEKK2 is an upstream activator of the JNK MAPK pathway in T-cells. Previously, we demonstrated that costimulation of Jurkat T-cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies led to strong synergistic JNK activation (29Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Because MEKK2 was able to activate JNK in T-cells (Fig. 2 A), we next examined whether MEKK2 could potentiate JNK1 activation by these T-cell stimuli. To do so, we transfected HA-JNK1 expression vector with increasing amounts of MEKK2 expression vector into Jurkat T-cells and measured the JNK activity without stimulation or with anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 antibody stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3, whereas anti-CD28 stimulation had no effect on MEKK2-mediated JNK activation, anti-CD3 stimulation greatly enhanced the MEKK2-mediated JNK activation, especially at low levels of MEKK2 expression. These results suggested that MEKK2 might be involved in transducing TCR/CD3 signals during T-cell antigen stimulation. The same conclusion was reached in a recent study on murine MEKK2 (36Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks C.R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The above results suggested that MEKK2 may act downstream of the TCR/CD3 receptor. To further examine this issue, we tested whether MEKK2 could be directly modified following anti-CD3 antibody stimulation in T cells. Recently, Schaefer et al. (36Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks C.R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) found that murine MEKK2 was translocated to the T-cell-antigen-presenting cell interface after antigen stimulation, suggesting that MEKK2 may be an early target of TCR signaling. Because stimulation of TCR rapidly activates several protein tyrosine kinases, it is possible that human MEKK2 may be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation in T-cells. To test this possibility, we transfected GST-tagged MEKK2 into Jurkat T-cells and analyzed it with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody after stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody. As shown in Fig.4, we found that there was a rapid induction of MEKK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to CD3 stimulation. We also observed a similar pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation of the endogenous MEKK2, and such phosphorylation was not affected by addition of anti-CD28 antibody (data not shown). This result indicated that MEKK2 was a substrate molecule for TCR/CD3 activated protein tyrosine kinases. To further determine the role of MEKK2 in T-cell stimulation, we constructed the expression vector SRαHA-MEKK2(NT), which expresses a MEKK2 mutant, MEKK2(NT), which lacks the entire catalytic domain. Expression of MEKK2(NT) in T-cells inhibited MEKK2-induced JNK activation in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown), suggesting that MEKK2(NT) is a dominant negative mutant. To determine the effect of MEKK2(NT) on JNK activation in T-cells, we transfected HA-JNK1 with increasing amounts of MEKK2(NT) and determined the JNK activity 36 h later with or without T-cell stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. As shown in Fig.5 A, JNK activation by T-cell costimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies was strongly inhibited by MEKK2(NT), suggesting that MEKK2 is required for JNK activation by costimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Interestingly, in a similar experiment, we found that costimulation of JNK in T-cells by TPA and A23187 was not blocked by the mutant MEKK2(NT) (Fig. 5 B). Transfection of MEKK2(NT) into Jurkat cells also did not inhibit the JNK activation in response to a combined stimulation with TPA, A23187, and anti-CD28 antibody (data not shown). Similar results were also reported with murine MEKK2 (36Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks C.R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that MEKK2 may not be involved in JNK activation by TPA plus Ca2+ plus CD28 in T cells. Because MEKK2 was required for JNK activation in T-cells, we next examined whether this effect was dependent on MEKK2 catalytic activity. We constructed the expression vector SRαMEKK2(KM), which expresses a MEKK2 mutant, MEKK2 (KM), with a point mutation of the conserved Lys-385 to Met in the ATP binding motif. Such a mutation in the ATP binding site has been shown to abolish the catalytic activity of many serine/threonine kinases (14Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and by itself MEKK2(KM) did not activate JNK in T-cells (data not shown). We transfected this mutant kinase with HA-JNK1 into Jurkat T-cells and determined the JNK1 activity with or without anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody costimulation. As shown in Fig.5 C, the MEKK2 mutant inhibited JNK activation by CD3 and CD28 costimulation. This result showed that the MEKK2(KM) mutant also had a dominant negative effect on JNK activation in T-cells. It has been shown that the JNK MAPK cascade is crucial for AP-1 and IL-2 gene expression in T-cells (29Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 30Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Because MEKK2 was involved in regulating JNK activation in T-cells, it was likely that MEKK2 was also required for the expression of these genes in T-cells. To investigate this, we transfected MEKK2(KM) with the AP-1 reporter plasmid -79Jun-Luc and the IL-2 reporter plasmid IL2-Luc into T-cells and determined the effect on the reporter gene expression after T-cell costimulation. As shown in Fig. 5 D, expression of MEKK2(KM) inhibited AP-1 and IL-2 reporter gene induction by T-cell costimulation, suggesting that MEKK2 is crucial for T-cell gene expression. A growing number of MAPKKKs, including MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, MEKK4, MEKK5, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, transforming growth factor-β-activated protein kinase 1, and tumor progression locus 2, have been shown to be capable of activating JNK (18Blank J.L.

However, how these MAPKKKs are involved in directing different cell surface signals to the downstream cytoplasmic and nuclear effectors in different tissues is still unknown. In this study, we described the cloning and characterization of human MEKK2, a full-length cDNA from Jurkat T-cells. The MEKK2 cDNA described in this study encoded a serine/threonine kinase and is probably the human counterpart of the reported murine MEKK2 (18Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), because these two molecules are very similar (96% identical). Both human and murine MEKK2 are much more similar to human and murine MEKK3 at the catalytic domain (94% identical) than are other members of the MEKK gene subfamily, indicating that MEKK2 and MEKK3 are closely related. Interestingly, Northern blot analysis showed that MEKK2 was expressed at high levels in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes but at low levels in thymus, suggesting that MEKK2 may have an important function in lymphocyte activation but not in normal T-cell development. Expression of dominant negative MEKK2 mutants was found to block JNK activation and AP-1 and IL-2 reporter gene induction by costimulation of CD3 and CD28 during T-cell activation. Interestingly, we found that JNK activation in T-cells by TPA and Ca2+ionophore was not inhibited by MEKK2 mutants. A similar result was obtained by Schaefer et al. (36Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks C.R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), who showed that expression of a similar murine MEKK2 dominant negative mutant could not inhibit JNK activation by TPA and ionomycine in murine T-cells. Therefore, these results indicated that MEKK2 is not involved in transducing TPA- and Ca2+ ionophore-mediated T-cell-activating signals but was required for transducing TCR/CD3-mediated activating signals. Recently we demonstrated that MEKK2 is a major upstream activator of the JNK MAPK through forming a triple molecular complex with JNKK2/MKK7 and JNK1 (28Cheng J. Yang J. Xia Y. Karin M. Su B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of both human MEKK2 (28Cheng J. Yang J. Xia Y. Karin M. Su B. Mol. Cell.

Murine MEKK2 is also able to activate the Erk and p38 MAPKs in addition to JNK MAPKs (18Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Because stimulation of T-cells can activate both the JNK and Erk pathways, our results suggested that MEKK2 might be involved in transducing TCR/CD3 signals to the JNK cascade but not to the Erk cascade. How MEKK2 is involved in TCR/CD3 signal transduction in T-cells is still unknown. Schaefer et al. (36Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks C.R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that murine MEKK2 is rapidly translocated to the T-cell-antigen-presenting cell interface in response to antigen stimulation, suggesting that participation of MEKK2 in TCR/CD3 was required for signaling to downstream targets. In our study, we found that stimulation of CD3 in T-cells also resulted in human MEKK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that MEKK2 is a target of the TCR/CD3-associated protein tyrosine kinases. It is possible that MEKK2 tyrosine phosphorylation after TCR stimulation is involved in regulating MEKK2 activity. Alternatively, tyrosine phosphorylation of MEKK2 may provide additional docking sites for MEKK2 to interact with TCR/CD3. Further studies on this issue should increase our understanding of the general mechanism of MEKK2 activation. Finally, transient expression of full-length MEKK2 in T-cells was able to activate JNK constitutively in the absence of stimulation, but no endogenous JNK activation was observed in unstimulated Jurkat T-cells (Fig. 2 A). This was not due to the absence of MEKK2 in Jurkat T-cells, because by using antiserum raised against the N terminus and C terminus, respectively, we easily detected MEKK2 protein in Jurkat T-cells (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, the endogenous MEKK2 in T-cells must be inactive before stimulation. It is possible that MEKK2 is tightly regulated by inhibitors or by compartmentalization, and such regulation could be disrupted in transient transfection assay. In this regard, we recently isolated an MEKK2-associated protein, and analysis of it will shed light on this issue. We thank Drs. M. Karin and T.-L.

https://openalex.org/W2059173497,"VP22, a structural protein of herpes simplex virus, exhibits unusual trafficking properties which we proposed might be exploited in gene and protein delivery applications. To pursue the use of the protein itself for cargo delivery into cells, we developed an expression system for the C-terminal half of VP22, residues 159–301 (VP22.C1), and purified the protein in high yields. Addition of short oligonucleotides (ODNs) induced the assembly of novel particles, which were regular spheres with a size range of 0.3 to 1.0 μm in diameter, incorporating both protein and ODN. Following the particles in living cells using fluorescently tagged ODNs, we show that they enter efficiently within 2–4 h, and reside stably in the cell cytoplasm for up to several days. Remarkably, however, light activation induced particle disruption and release of the protein and ODN to the nucleus and cytoplasm within seconds, a process that we have captured by time lapse microscopy. In addition to delivering antisense ODNs, ribozymes, and RNA/DNA hybrids, the VP22.C1 protein could also be modified to include peptides or proteins. These particles have the potential for delivery of a wide range of therapeutic agents in gene therapy and vaccine development.

Meredith D.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), is a major structural component of the virus (2Heine J.W. Honess R.W. Cassai E. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 640-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recruited into the tegument compartment in ∼2000 molecules per virion (3Leslie J. Rixon F.J. McLauchlan J. Virology. 1996; 220: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We previously reported the observations of unusual trafficking properties of VP22 whereby after being synthesized in a subpopulation of cells, in which it appeared largely cytoplasmic, the protein could also be observed in adjacent cells where it accumulated mainly in the nucleus (4Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made for a number of the homologues of VP22 in other α-herpesviruses (5Harms J.S. Ren X. Oliveira S.C. Splitter G.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3301-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Dorange F. El Mehdaoui S. Pichon C. Coursaget P. Vautherot J.F. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We suggested that this property of VP22 might be useful in the field of gene therapy, to amplify delivery of candidate gene products by expressing them as VP22 fusion products. The augmented delivery and activity of functional proteins potentially useful in gene therapy applications have now been demonstrated for p53 and thymidine kinase (7Phelan A. Elliott G. O'Hare P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 8Dilber M.S. Phelan A. Aints A. Mohamed A.J. Elliott G. Edvard Smith C.I. O'Hare P. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We also observed that when extracts containing VP22 were applied to the medium of tissue culture cells, the protein could subsequently be detected within cells, accumulating in the nuclei (4Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Therefore we further proposed that VP22 protein itself could be additionally exploited for the delivery of different types of cargoes. One particular class of molecules upon which much research has focused is that of the small oligonucleotides (ODNs),1 including antisense ODNs, ribozymes, triple helix forming ODNs, RNA/DNA hybrids, and recently small interfering RNAs. While significant successes have been reported in the development and application of such compounds, delivery both in vitro where they may be applicable for,e.g. target validation, and in vivo in a therapeutic setting, remains a major issue (for a review, see Ref. 9Gewirtz A.M. Stein C.A. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3161-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As a result considerable effort has been directed into developing strategies to overcome the different factors, such as the activity of serum nucleases, cellular uptake, endosomal release, intracellular distribution, and stability, that limit the activity of such ODNs. A nonexhaustive list of the many approaches being pursued includes the use of cationic lipids or liposomes, polycations, conjugation with sterols or the use of fusigenic peptides, and while each approach offers certain advantages, each also has distinct limitations (9Gewirtz A.M. Stein C.A. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3161-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Luft F.C. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 75-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Proteins with unusual trafficking properties such as VP22, TAT (11Mann D.A. Frankel A.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), and the Antennapaedia homeodomain (12Prochiantz A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) offer the prospect of protein and peptide delivery, but proteins generally have not been developed as agents for ODN delivery. In this work we present results on additional unusual properties of VP22 in recruiting ODNs into spherical particles which efficiently enter cells. A novel feature of the VP22/ODN particles is that after cell entry they remain stable in the cytoplasm, but can be activated by light, whereupon the ODN and protein diffuse throughout the cell, with the ODN accumulating in the nuclei. While we do not yet understand the mechanism promoting this activity, we have utilized the VP22/ODN particles to deliver candidate ODNs, and demonstrated light dependent activity. The assembly of such particles, which we have termed Vectosomes, may offer dual delivery applications, with the protein recruiting and delivering candidate therapeutic ODNs, or the ODN nucleating the assembly of a particle for the delivery of variants of VP22 carrying additional functional proteins. We propose that Vectosomes may represent a versatile new type of delivery agent for protein and ODN delivery. HPLC purified fluorescent phosphorothioate or phosphodiester oligonucleotides (F-ODN) were purchased from Genosys, Cambridge, United Kingdom. A biotinylated fluorescent oligonucleotide was obtained from the same supplier. The sequences of the F-ODNs used in this study were as follow: 5′-CCCCCACCACTTCCCCTCTC-3′, corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of ICAM-1; 5′-TCCCGCCTGTGACATGCATT-3′, corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of human c-raf kinase gene; 5′-TCCCGCGCACTTGATGCATT-3′, a control ODN for the anti-c-raf ODN containing 7 base mismatches (underlined). A 36-mer fluorescent hammerhead ribozyme (HPLC purified) directed against c-myb (13Jarvis T.C. Alby L.J. Beaudry A.A. Winchott F.E. Beigelman L. McSwigen J.A. Usman N. Stinchcomb D.T. RNA. 1996; 2: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar) was as follows: 5′-guuuucccUGAuGaggccgaaaggccGaaAuucucc-3′ (normal lowercase indicates 2′-O-methyl nucleotides, uppercase indicates 2′-hydroxyl (ribo) nucleotides, U indicates 2′-O-allyl uridine, backbone linkages were phosphodiester with five phosphorothioate linkages at each end). A HPLC purified 68-mer fluorescein-labeled RNA/DNA hybrid molecule (RDO) directed against the tyrosinase gene (14Alexeev V. Yoon K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) had the following sequence; 5′-ACTGCGGAAACTGTAAGTTTGGATTTTTTaauccaaacuTACAGuuuccgcaguGCGCGTTTTCGCGC-3′, where DNA residues are capitalized and the 2′-O-methyl RNA residues are in lowercase. The ribozyme and RDO were purchased from Cruachem, Glasgow, UK. A fragment corresponding to the C-terminal amino acids 159–301 of HSV VP22 was amplified with 5′ and 3′ primers designed for insertion of the fragment into the prokaryotic expression vector pET24b (Novagen) to yield the expression vector pVP24. This strategy results in the addition of an extra 14 residues from the vector to the N terminus of the VP22 coding region and a 6xHis tag to the C terminus. The coding region of the VP22 open reading frame in pVP24 was confirmed by sequencing. Expression was performed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21pLysS. Overnight cultures grown in the presence of kanamycin (10 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) were diluted (1:100) and incubated until the A600 reached ∼0.4. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) and incubation continued for a further 3–5 h. The cultures were then cooled on ice, the bacteria pelleted, and suspended in lysis buffer (70 ml/1.6 liters culture) containing 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8.0; 300 mm NaCl, 5 mmimidazole, pH 8.0; 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol; 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin. Lysosyme (1 mg/ml) was added and the samples incubated on ice for 30 min followed by sonication (3 × 10 s on ice). Nonidet P-40 (0.1%), DNase (5 μg/ml), and RNase (5 μg/ml) were then added and incubation continued for a further 20 min. Viscosity was reduced by drawing the sample through a 21-gauge needle 3 times before removal of insoluble material by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was further clarified by incubation (1 h, 4 °C) with DEAE-Sepharose (3.5 ml of a 50% slurry in lysis buffer), and the unbound fraction then loaded onto a 5-ml Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column (equilibrated in lysis buffer). The column was then washed in buffer (lysis buffer omitting DNase and RNase and containing 40 mmimidazole, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and bound material eluted in either a step elution at 500 mmimidazole or a gradient of imidazole from 0 to 500 mm. VP22.C1 eluted at ∼200 mm imidazole. Samples were stored frozen directly or after dialysis in PBS. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (Pierce Protein Plus Assay kit). Mass Spectrometry was performed by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility, University of Cambridge. A fraction of the dialyzed protein was labeled with fluorescein using a succinimidyl ester of fluorescein supplied in the Fluorescein-EX Protein Labeling kit (Molecular Probes). VP22.C1 was incubated with the reactive dye for 3 h at room temperature and unconjugated fluorescein was separated from labeled protein by gel filtration. To examine VP22.C1 binding to ODN, a standard amount of a fluorescently labeled 20-mer phosphorothioate (0.6 nmol) was incubated with increasing amounts of purified VP22.C1 (0.06, 0.12, and 1.2 nmol) in PBS (20 μl) for 10 min at room temperature. Complexes were then separated in nondenaturing gels (6% NuSieve GTG-agarose) in 1 × TBE. Free ODN and VP22.C1 complexes were visualized by shortwave illumination of the gel. After preliminary evaluation of conditions, VP22.C1·F-ODN complexes were routinely assembled and analyzed as follows. The oligonucleotide (10 μm) in 25 μl of PBS was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with VP22.C1 (20 μm) in 25 μl of PBS (final volume 50 μl at a VP22/oligonucleotide molar ratio of 2) theoretically resulting in overall neutral charge with respect to VP22 and the ODN. The sample was then diluted into 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium containing 10% calf serum and added to monolayers of cells (usually seeded at 105 cells/ml) in 4-well coverglass incubation chambers (Nunc, Life Technologies). After incubation at 37 °C live cells were either observed directly or after washing with PBS. For any prolonged observation cultures were maintained on a heated stage in the presence of 5% CO2 or transferred to CO2 independent medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Catalogue number 18045-054). Cultures were usually examined by epifluorescence (HBO 50 mercury lamp) and particles would redistribute within 10 s after initial illumination. To capture initial particle localization without ODN redistribution, cells were observed and focused by phase-contrast microscopy and then localization captured immediately by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 410 inverted confocal microscope set at low laser power (1:100 or 1:300 attenuation, 15 mW 488 nm argon laser). Broad range illumination was achieved using a fiber optic halogen lamp (Schott KL2500LCD, Fiber Optics Ltd., UK) incorporating a 250-W halogen reflector bulb. Light intensity reaching the cells was recorded using a Spectra-Physics Lightmeter (Thermopile Detector, Model 407A). Routinely, after particle uptake, cultures were removed from the incubator, washed in PBS, and illuminated for ∼3 min at a distance of 12 cm. Light intensity reaching the cells was ∼170 mW/cm2. Alternatively cultures were detached from monolayers with trypsin, washed in PBS, and then illuminated in suspension prior to replating. Numerous control experiments demonstrated that neither mode of illumination had any detectable cytotoxic effect nor any effect on cell proliferation rates. Complexes containing streptavidin-Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes), were formed as follow. The F-ODN containing biotin at the 3′ end was suspended in 12.5 μl of PBS at a concentration of 20 μm, and incubated with streptavidin-Alexa 594 (400 nm) in 12.5 μl of PBS for 2 h at 25 °C with occasional mixing. VP22.C1 (20 μm) in 25 μl of PBS was added to the mixture to make a final volume of 50 μl and the mixture incubated for 10 min. The complexes were then diluted in medium containing 10% serum as above and added to the cells. Images were annotated and presented using Adobe Photoshop software. For studies using antisense ODNs to inhibit cell proliferation we used a 20-mer ODN directed against the 3′-untranslated region of human c-raf kinase previously reported by a number of workers to inhibit proliferation in A549 cells (15Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Geiger T. Muller M. Fabbro D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 16Lau Q.C. Brusselbach S. Muller R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1899-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide with mismatches at 7 bases served as a control. The A549 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/ml the day before the experiment. The cells were then incubated overnight with VP22.C1·F-ODN complexes. The following day the cells were trypsinized, washed, and illuminated for 3 min with the fiber optic cold light in suspension in cell culture medium containing 10% serum. The cells (2 × 105) were then replated in 6-well dishes. Two days later, the cells were trypsinized and counted. We previously demonstrated that when crude soluble extracts containing VP22 were applied to the medium of monolayer cells in tissue culture, the protein could subsequently be detected in the cell nuclei (4Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Based on these observations we proposed that VP22 protein could be exploited for the delivery of different types of cargoes into cells. Numerous attempts to produce the intact protein in different bacterial systems were made but resulted in low yields or cleaved products. However, we noted from alignment analysis (ClustalX) of the VP22 homologues in other α-herpesviruses that the C-terminal half of the protein was the only region exhibiting a high degree of conservation (Fig.1a). Moreover studies of deletion mutants in transient transfection assays have shown that this C-terminal region retained most of the activity of the intact protein. 2J. Webb, personal communication. We therefore developed a system for the bacterial expression of the C-terminal half of the protein (residues 159–301) including a 6xHis tag at the C terminus to facilitate purification. Expression from this construct (pVP24, Fig. 1 b) resulted in high yields (5–10 mg/liter) of soluble protein (termed VP22.C1) which could be readily purified by a one-step purification procedure using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig. 1 c). Generally throughout the course of this work, as judged by total protein staining of polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel, preparations of ≥98% purity were achieved. The identity of the protein was also confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry of the purified protein indicated a mass of 18,415 ± 11, acceptably within experimental error from the predicted mass of 18,424. Thus we established a relatively straightforward scheme for the production and purification of high yields of intact soluble protein. To pursue the ability of VP22 to deliver heterologous cargoes into cells we chose first to examine its potential with small oligonucleotides. This class of molecules encompasses an increasingly wide range of potentially useful agents including, e.g. antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, interfering RNAs, and chimeroplasts but stability and delivery issues remain a major concern in their use. To begin with, the interaction between VP22.C1 and a series of standard 20-mer oligonucleotides (ODNs) containing a phosphorothioate backbone was assessed by gel retardation assays. The ODNs additionally contained a fluorescein molecule at their 5′ end to enable visualization in this assay and also subsequently in cell import assays (see below). Similar results were observed with a number of unrelated ODNs and typical results are shown in Fig. 2 a. VP22.C1 was incubated in increasing amounts (0.06, 0.12, and 1.2 nmol) with a fluorescein-conjugated 20-mer ODN (F-ODN, 0.6 nmol) in PBS and the complexes resolved in nondenaturing agarose gels (Fig.2 a). With limiting amounts of protein, 2 complexes (marked C1 and C2) with lower mobilities than the free F-ODN were observed while at the highest dose tested all of the F-ODN was observed in a complex which represented retention in the sample well (C3). We observed no sequence specificity for this interaction and binding could be competed by excess nonspecific DNA (data not shown), consistent with formation of the VP22.C1·F-ODN complex being due to nonspecific charge interactions. While complexes were formed with limiting doses of VP22.C1, it was possible that retention of the F-ODN in the well (C3) represented a general aggregation at this ratio of protein to F-ODN (predicted to result in overall neutrality of the two agents). Aliquots of the sample were therefore analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. At this ratio of VP22.C1 to F-ODN, we observed that the F-ODN was now present in discrete spherical and intensely fluorescent particles (Fig.2 b), quite unlike the free F-ODN which was seen as a uniform haze with no obvious particulate material (data not shown). The particles were also examined by electron microscopy with representative images of the EM grid and different magnifications shown in Fig.2 c. Consistent with the results from fluorescent microscopy, the particles were observed to be uniform regular spheres, rather than nonspecific aggregates. While there was some variation in size, the majority of particles (≥80%) were within a size range from 0.3 to 1 μm as judged by light scattering analysis (data not shown). Although several artificial cationic polymers, such as polylysine have been shown to form aggregates with negatively charged nucleic acids, this is the first example of which we are aware of an encoded polypeptide such as VP22.C1 promoting the formation of regular discrete particles of the type observed here. The formation of regular spherical VP22.C1.F-ODN particles prompted us to examine their uptake and delivery into cells. The presence of the fluorescein molecule on the ODN facilitated analysis by microscopy. We first determined that the complexes were stable in serum and tissue culture medium (data not shown). Thereafter all the analysis of cellular uptake and distribution were performed in living cells, and all images of the particles and F-ODN reported throughout this work were from live cells. Complexes were formed in PBS by mixing VP22.C1 and F-ODN at a 2:1 molar ratio and the samples then added to tissue culture medium containing 10% calf serum. The medium containing the complexes was then added to monolayers of different cell types (e.g. COS, Vero, or HeLa) grown on chambered coverslips and the cells examined at various times using a Zeiss Axiovert inverted confocal microscope. The final nominal concentrations in the medium of the protein and ODN were 1 μm and 0.5 μm, respectively, and for the sake of comparison, a concentration of 0.5 μm was used for the free uncomplexed F-ODN. The VP22.C1·F-ODN complexes could be readily observed in the medium and after overnight incubation these complexes could also be observed within cells. Typical representative images in COS and Hela cells are shown in Fig. 3, b ande, respectively. The intense fluorescent particles were located exclusively within the cytoplasm, numbered ∼2–10 per cell on average and were of the same size distribution as the particles observed before application to the cells. The particles were observed in all cells in a population and confocal microscopy demonstrated that they were inside cells, confirmed by results in the following sections (see below). By comparison free F-ODN was observed in a faint speckled cytoplasmic pattern (Fig. 3 a), probably representing low levels of endocytic uptake of free ODNs as described previously (17Loke S.L. Stein C.A. Zhang X.H. Mori K. Nakanishi M. Subasinghe C. Cohen J.S. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3474-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Thus the VP22.C1 particles appeared to be taken up by cells and located within the cytoplasm, but the F-ODN was retained within the complexes with little being detected in a free diffuse pattern within the cytoplasm or nucleus. However, upon closer inspection we made some unusual observations on the F-ODN distribution from the complexes. In certain fields a small number of cells exhibited a diffuse distribution of the F-ODN (e.g. Fig. 3 b, arrowheads). Moreover during systematic analysis scanning through numerous fields in the cultures, we frequently encountered complete fields in which the fluorescence pattern was distributed throughout every cell, with pronounced accumulation in the nuclei. It became clear that such fields were ones which had been previously visualized and in which, on initial examination, discrete cytoplasmic particles were observed. Upon re-examination, diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence was observed. A typical example of this is shown in Fig. 3, band d, which show the same field, initially upon examination (panel b) and 2 min later (panel d). For reference, intact arrows indicate the same cells in the two panels. Thus initially the F-ODN was present in cytoplasmic particles as described above, while in the same cells 2 min later pronounced diffuse distribution together with nuclear accumulation could now be observed. This activity of uptake, cytoplasmic stability, and release was also observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 3, e and f) and in a number of other cell types (data not shown). Parallel examination of fields containing the control F-ODN alone, showed no such alteration or diffuse distribution and this was never observed at any time (Fig. 3, a and c, and data not shown). To account for these results we proposed that the process of epifluorescence illumination during visualization was itself promoting release of the F-ODN, from the discrete localization in VP22.C1·F-ODN particles into the cytoplasm and nucleus. To follow the progress of this process, particles were applied as before. To capture initial particle localization without ODN redistribution (Fig. 3 g, 0 s), cells were observed and focused by phase-contrast microscopy and then distribution recorded immediately by confocal microscopy using a very low laser power (1:100 or 1:300 attenuation). The field was then subjected to epifluorescence illumination once for ∼10 s, and the image of the same field recorded again by confocal microscopy (Fig.3 g, 10 s) and thereafter at various intervals up to 130 s (Fig. 3 g). The results illustrate the dynamic nature of fluorescence distribution, and redistribution in living cells. Thus as indicated above, immediately upon examination (Fig.3 g, 0 s), discrete cytoplasmic particles were observed, with little or no diffuse fluorescence within the cells. Within seconds after the first observation the fluorescence could now be observed in a broad diffuse cytoplasmic location, frequently showing a gradient of intensity from the particles (Fig. 3 g, 10 s). Thereafter the pattern became more evenly distributed throughout the cell until ∼2 min after initial observation, when the F-ODN could be observed accumulating in the nucleus, although with nucleolar sparing (Fig. 3 g, 130 s). We were also able to record the process of release dynamically by time lapse microscopy and a movie (Fig. 4) recording release can be located for viewing at http://www.jbc.org. We conclude that a short burst of light (in this case supplied through the microscope objective, see also below) was sufficient to somehow induce release of the F-ODN from the otherwise stable particles into the body of the cell, whereupon it accumulated in the nucleus. We confirmed that neither the cellular uptake of the VP22.C1·F-ODN particles, nor the release of the F-ODN upon illumination was toxic to the cells (Fig.5 and data not shown). In fact, after uptake and light induced redistribution of F-ODN, nuclear accumulation of the F-ODN could be observed for several days thereafter. An example of nuclear accumulation of the F-ODN 3 days after application and ∼2 days after redistribution can be seen in Fig.6 c.Figure 5Cell growth is not affected by illumination. A549 cells were plated at 104 cells per well in 24-well plates on day 0. The following day (day 1) the cells were illuminated for 10 min with a fiber optic halogen lamp (Schott KL2500LCD). Following illumination the cells were incubated for the times indicated, then trypsinized and counted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Characterization of VP22.C1·F-ODN particle uptake. a, time course of uptake of VP22.C1·F-ODN particles into cells. Particles were added to cells (T24 bladder carcinoma cells) as usual and the cells incubated at 37 °C in medium containing 10% serum. At various times (1, 2, 4, or 6 h) after particle addition, the cells were washed extensively and uptake recorded immediately (−), or 2 min after a 10-s illumination with the Hg lamp (+), to record ODN redistribution.

The medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing 10% serum and the cells were further incubated overnight. One day later, cells incubated with VP22 complexes were subject to a 10-s illumination and the distribution of the ODN examined 2 min later, while cells incubated with Lipofectin complexes were examined directly (24 h). Two days after illumination (3 days after original incubation with the complexes) distribution of the ODN was compared again, without any further illumination (72 h). ODN distribution from the VP22 complexes was still readily observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this section we report results of a series of experiments examini"
https://openalex.org/W1995169002,"Fractalkine (FKN/CX3CL1) is a unique member of the chemokine gene family and contains a chemokine domain (CD), a mucin-like stalk, a single transmembrane region, and a short intracellular C terminus. This structural distinction affords FKN the property of mediating capture and firm adhesion of FKN receptor (CX3CR1)-expressing cells under physiological flow conditions. Shed forms of FKN also exist, and these promote chemotaxis of CX3CR1-expressing leukocytes. The goal of the present study was to identify specific residues within the FKN-CD critical for FKN-CX3CR1 interactions. Two residues were identified in the FKN-CD, namely Lys-7 and Arg-47, that are important determinants in mediating an FKN-CX3CR1 interaction. FKN-K7A and FKN-R47A mutants exhibited 30–60-fold decreases in affinity for CX3CR1 and failed to arrest efficiently CX3CR1-expressing cells under physiological flow conditions. However, these mutants had differential effects on chemotaxis of CX3CR1-expressing cells. The FKN-K7A mutant acted as an equipotent partial agonist, whereas the FKN-R47A mutant had marked decreased potency and efficacy in measures of chemotactic activity. These data identify specific structural features of the FKN-CD that are important in interactions with CX3CR1 including steady state binding, signaling, and firm adhesion of CX3CR1-expressing cells.

Neuronally expressed FKN is presumably involved in the central nervous system-based communication with CX3CR1-expressing microglia, whereas FKN expressed on endothelial cells likely mediates extravasation of CX3CR1-expressing cells, which include monocytes, T cells, and NK cells, out of the lumen of the blood vessel into the tissue parenchyma. FKN is also expressed by dendritic cells and intestinal epithelial cells, and CX3CR1 has recently been demonstrated on mast cells (13Kanazawa N. Nakamura T. Tashiro K. Muramatsu M. Morita K.

The dissection of molecular processes involving chemokines and chemokine receptors is an active area of investigation as development of therapeutic agents targeting these systems are likely to yield novel beneficial approaches in the treatment of inflammation, cancer, as well as inhibition of viral (human immunodeficiency virus) pathogenesis. Given the localization of FKN to endothelial, dendritic, and neuronal cells, this molecule also constitutes a potential therapeutic target for modulating several physiological processes including leukocyte trafficking and/or mechanisms involved neuroinflammation. The goal of the present study was aimed at identifying amino acid residues in the FKN molecule that are important determinants for binding to, and activating its receptor, CX3CR1. We employed deletional and site-directed mutagenesis in order to evaluate the effect of different lengths of the mucin stalk and determine the role of specific amino acid residues present in the FKN chemokine domain, in mediating FKN binding, signaling, and CX3CR1-dependent cell adhesion. DNA sequences encoding human fractalkine were cloned to the EcoRI/XhoI site of pcDNA3 (huFKN/pcDNA3). Five truncation mutants of FKN were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using huFKN/pcDNA3 as the template and five paired sets of complementary oligonucleotides encoding a different region of the mucin stalk (see Fig. 1). The oligonucleotides used are as follows A, 5′-CGA GTC TGT GGT CCT CGA GCC CGA AGC CAC AGG-3′ and 5′-CCT GTG GCT TCG GGC TCG AGG ACC ACA GAC TCG-3′; B, 5′-CGC CAA AGG CTC AGG CTC GAG GGC CTG TGG GCA CGG-3′ and 5′-CCG TGC CCA CAG GCC CTC GAG CCT GAG CCT TTG GCG-3′; C, 5′-GGA GAA TGC TCC GTC TCG AGG CCA GCG TGT GTG G-3′ and 5′-CCA CAC ACG CTG GCC TCG AGA CGG AGC ATT CTC C-3′; D, 5′-CCA TGC CAC CAT GGA CCT CGA GAG GCT GGG CGT CC-3′ and 5′-GGA CGC CCA GCC TCT CGA GGT CCA TGG TGG CAT GG-3′; and E, 5′-CGC CCA GGC TGC CAC CTC GAG GCA GGC GGT GGG GC-3′ and 5′-GCC CCA CCG CCT GCC TCG AGG TGG CAG CCT GGG CG-3′. Each mutation introduced an additionalXhoI restriction endonuclease recognition sequence into the plasmid. Mutant DNA was generated using the PCR; the original template was excised by subsequent DpnI treatment. Plasmid DNA was isolated from random ampicillin-resistant bacterial colonies and subjected to restriction endonuclease digestion analysis usingXhoI. The entire protein coding sequence of each mutant plasmid was subject to DNA sequence analysis in order to confirm the mutation and the fidelity of the DNA polymerase (Pfu) used in the PCR. An EcoRI/XhoI fragment of each truncation mutant was then subcloned to the same site(s) of pcDNA3.1/myc/His6 (Invitrogen); the specific version used depended on the frame in which the XhoI site was engineered. DNA sequence analysis of the final plasmid constructs was also performed in order to verify that the nucleotides encoding the myc/His6 were in frame with the nucleotides encoding the FKN. Site-directed mutagenesis of the chemokine domain of FKN (FKN-CD) was also carried out using oligonucleotide-directed PCR and subsequentDpnI treatment. Mutants were generated in the huFKN/pcDNA3 (full length) and the truncation mutant, form E (described above).

Approximately 10 million HEK293T cells (seeded in two 100-mm dishes) were transfected using 10 μg of plasmid DNA/plate and LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS for the first 20 h post-transfection and subsequently incubated with DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for an additional 24 h. Media were harvested and subjected to Ni-NTA chromatography according to the manufacturer's (Qiagen QIAexpressionist 03/99, Valencia, CA) recommended procedures. Briefly, conditioned media were mixed with an equal volume of 2× buffer (100 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 600 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and 1 ml of the Ni-NTA slurry. The mixture was rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. After rocking, the mixture was loaded into a filtration column, and the packed resin bed was subsequently washed with 8 ml of wash buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The protein was eluted with elution buffer (4 × 0.5 ml aliquots, 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), flash-frozen in liquid N2 in 100-μl aliquots, and stored at −80 °C until further use. Aliquots of conditioned media, Ni-NTA column flow-through, column washes, and the elutions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis analysis as described previously (9Harrison J.K. Jiang Y. Chen S. Xia Y. Maciejewski D. McNamara R.K. Streit W.J. Salafranca M.N. Adhikari S. Thompson D.A. Botti P. Bacon K.B. Feng L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10896-10901Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Aliquots were electrophoresed through 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride 0.45-μm membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked on a rotating table for 0.5 h in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline/Tween), 5% milk (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). After drying, the membranes were incubated for 2 h with a rabbit anti-fractalkine antibody (1:10,000 dilution) in TBS-T, 5% nonfat instant milk. The membranes were washed 3 times (10 min per wash) in TBS-T and subsequently incubated in a goat anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) in TBS-T, 5% milk for 1 h. The membranes were washed 3 times (10 min per wash) in TBS-T and then developed for 5 min with Pierce Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Membranes were finally exposed onto Amersham ECL film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 50,000 CHO cells stably expressing human or rat CX3CR1, or 300,000 rat microglia were seeded into the wells of a 12-well plate. Two days later, whole cell radioligand binding analysis was performed according to procedures published previously (9Harrison J.K. Jiang Y. Chen S. Xia Y. Maciejewski D. McNamara R.K. Streit W.J. Salafranca M.N. Adhikari S. Thompson D.A. Botti P. Bacon K.B. Feng L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10896-10901Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed (1 time) with PBS and subsequently incubated for 1 h in 0.5 ml of HBSS containing 10 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.4, and 0.1% BSA (binding buffer) with 0.5–1 nm125I-huFKN-CD (specific activity, 200–300 Ci/mmol) in the absence and presence of various concentrations of unlabeled inhibitors (FKN-CD, truncation mutants, or FKN-CD mutants). At the end of the incubation cells were rinsed 3 times (1 ml per wash) with ice-cold binding buffer. Radioactivity retained in the wells was extracted with 0.2n NaOH and subject to gamma spectroscopy. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 nm huFKN-CD. Data are expressed as percent of total specific binding. Graphical and statistical analysis was carried out using Prism 2.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Intracellular calcium levels in fura-2 AM-loaded CHO-huCX3CR1 cells were assayed as described previously (9Harrison J.K. Jiang Y. Chen S. Xia Y. Maciejewski D. McNamara R.K. Streit W.J. Salafranca M.N. Adhikari S. Thompson D.A. Botti P. Bacon K.B. Feng L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10896-10901Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) using a spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ). Cells were illuminated alternately with ultraviolet light (1/s) of 340 and 380 nm wavelength and monitored for fluorescence at 510 nm. Due to the uncertainties involved in the calculation of [Ca2+] i , the signals are reported as changes in F340/F380, which gives a relative measure of [Ca2+] i. The concentrations of purified soluble FKN proteins were determined by ELISA using anti-FKN antibodies. One hundred μl/well of 2 μg/ml capture anti-FKN (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was incubated overnight at room temperature in a 96-well plate. After washing three times in wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), the wells were blocked with 1% BSA, 5% sucrose, 0.05% NaN3 for 1 h. Following three more washes, 100 μl of each diluted protein sample was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After 3 washes, 100 μl of 100 ng/ml biotinylated anti-FKN (R & D Systems) diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% NaN3, 0.2% BSA was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were then washed 3 times, and 100 μl of 1:4000 dilution streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After 3 washes, horseradish peroxidase activity was detected colorimetrically using the TMB microwell peroxidase substrate system (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) and the results read on a Dynex microplate reader. Protein concentrations were determined by averaging the results of three independent ELISA assays. Chemotaxis toward soluble FKN and FKN-CD mutants was addressed by migration through transwells. Various dilutions of Ni-NTA-eluted fractions containing wild type and mutant proteins were made in 600 μl of medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS) and placed in the bottom of a transwell (6.5 mm diameter, 3-μm pore size, Costar, Corning, NY). One million L1.2 cells expressing CX3CR1-GFP were resuspended in 100 μl of RPMI medium and placed into the top chamber of a transwell. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the bottom well was harvested. The number of migrating cells was determined by counting a 20-μl aliquot using flow cytometry (Coulter Epics XL-MCL). Ni-NTA column elution buffer had no inhibitory or enhancing effects on L1.2 cell chemotaxis. For each experiment, values were normalized to wild type FKN with maximal chemotaxis to wild type FKN set at 100%. Concentration-response curves were generated by curve fit interpolation analysis using Cricket Graph III (Computer Associates International, Islandia, NY). Statistical analysis was carried out using Statistica 3.0b (Statsoft Inc.) EA.hy 926 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells (grown to 80% confluence) were transfected with 10 μg of DNA using a calcium phosphate precipitation-based method. Forty eight hours post-transfection, cells were seeded into media containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. G418-resistant cells were analyzed for cell surface levels of fractalkine by staining with a monoclonal antibody specific for the mucin domain of fractalkine (mAb 1D6). Results were visualized on a Coulter Epics-XL flow cytometer. Firm adhesion of CX3CR1-expressing cells was assessed by a parallel plate flow chamber assay as described previously (7Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Briefly, EA.hy 926 cells were plated onto glass coverslips and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C. The coverslips were then placed in a parallel plate flow chamber. K562 or K562-CX3CR1 cells were resuspended in flow buffer (PBS containing 0.75 mm CaCl2, 0.75 mmMgCl2, 0.5% BSA) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were perfused at a shear stress of 0.25 dynes/cm2 for 5 min. Following subsequent 1 min washes of 0.5, 1, and 1.85 dynes/cm2 for 1 min each, the cells were subjected to a high shear stress of 5 dynes/cm2 in flow buffer. The results of each run were recorded onto videotape. The number of K562 cells remaining bound to the monolayer was then counted. The number of captured cells on EA.hy 926 cell transfectants was determined by counting the number of cells that were in contact with the monolayer for at least 5 s during the initial loading phase in the flow chamber (shear stress of 0.25 dynes/cm2). For all monolayers, greater than 90% of the captured cells remained firmly adherent (n = 3). Although FKN is expressed as a membrane-attached protein, extracellular forms of this protein are readily detected. The specific cleavage site(s) that generate these shed forms of FKN are not known. FKN released from the cell surface has an observed molecular mass greater than predicted and thus is likely to contain all or a portion of the glycosylated mucin-like stalk. Our first goal was directed toward determining the effect of various lengths of this mucin-like domain on the affinity and efficacy of the FKN-CD for binding and activating CX3CR1. Fig. 1 depicts the entire protein sequence of human FKN, in alignment with the chemokine domains of the two known rodent orthologs (rat and murine FKN-CD). In order to evaluate the effect of various lengths of the mucin stalk on FKN-CD function, five truncation mutants of human FKN (designated A–E) were prepared in which DNA sequences encoding the signal peptide, the chemokine domain, and differential lengths of the mucin stalk were cloned in frame with C-terminal six histidine residues (His6). The C-terminal addition of the His6 residues facilitated purification of the various secreted FKN truncation mutants from the conditioned media of the HEK293T cell transfectants (using Ni-NTA chromatography). In addition, the figure highlights conserved lysine and arginine residues, present in the chemokine domain of the various fractalkine orthologs, that were targeted for site-directed mutagenesis (to alanine). Since chemokine receptors typically contain a number of aspartate and glutamate residues within their extracellular regions, these negatively charged side chains present in the receptor are likely candidate amino acids for interaction with positively charged amino acids that are prevalent not only in FKN but also in other chemokine sequences. Thus, we hypothesized that specific basic residues present within the FKN molecule are critical for interactions with its receptor CX3CR1. In addition, a single methionine residue (at position 15) and a uniqueN-linked glycosylation sequence (NIT) present in human and rat FKN are highlighted. Met-15 was previously suggested to interact with a peptide containing the sequences of the N terminus of human CX3CR1 (17Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); this residue was mutated to a lysine. From structural studies, the single N-linked glycosylation in the human FKN sequence, which is also present in the cognate region of rat FKN, appears to be a readily available substrate for this post-translational modification. Thus, in order to assess the role of this putative glycosylation site in the interaction of FKN with CX3CR1, we mutated the N-linked glycosylation sequence to “EIM”; this tri-amino acid motif is EIM in the murine ortholog. The effect of the length of the mucin stalk on the binding of the FKN-CD to CX3CR1 and the stimulation of intracellular calcium mobilization in CX3CR1-expressing cells were assessed. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A) of the five 293T cell-expressed truncation mutants of FKN, purified by Ni-NTA chromatography, indicated that all five forms were expressed and secreted into the HEK293T cell-conditioned media. All of the secreted proteins migrated as broad, diffuse bands thru SDS-PAGE at molecular masses greater than their calculated molecular masses based upon the predicted protein backbones (Table I). This is likely due to the glycosylated characteristics of the mucin stalk. Nevertheless, the relative sizes of the various truncation mutants were consistent with the protein containing the CD and progressively increasing lengths of the mucin stalk. Competition binding analysis (125I-FKN-CD binding to huCX3CR1-CHO cells) of each of these truncation mutants indicated that each form displayed a comparable affinity for human CX3CR1 (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, each form of the protein stimulated similar increases in intracellular calcium levels in the fura-2-loaded huCX3CR1-CHO cells (Fig. 2 C). Collectively the data indicate that the mucin stalk does not contribute to FKN binding affinity and efficacy for stimulating calcium mobilization in CX3CR1-expressing cells.Table IPredicted and observed molecular masses of FKN truncation mutantsFormPredicted (protein backbone)Observed (approximate range)kDaA14.721–30B19.635–50C26.243–80D34.760–100E36.666–100Shown are the calculated molecular masses (in kilodaltons) of the predicted protein backbones of the various FKN truncation mutants as well as the molecular mass ranges of the expressed proteins as observed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (depicted in Fig. 2).

Open table in a new tab Shown are the calculated molecular masses (in kilodaltons) of the predicted protein backbones of the various FKN truncation mutants as well as the molecular mass ranges of the expressed proteins as observed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (depicted in Fig. 2). The predicted molecular masses exclude the mass contributed by the putative signal peptide sequence. The effect of mutating the species conserved basic residues, the singleN-linked glycosylation consensus sequence, and Met-15, in the FKN-CD, on the binding of FKN to CX3CR1 was evaluated. Site-directed mutants of these residues were prepared in the context of the longest secreted truncation mutant (CD with all of the mucin stalk,i.e. form E) and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 A) indicated that all of the Ni-NTA-purified mutants were present at concentrations equivalent to the levels of the purified “wild type” form. Ni-NTA-purified proteins were then evaluated for their relative potency for inhibiting the binding of 125I-FKN-CD to the huCX3CR1-CHO cells. The K7A and R47A mutants displayed significantly lower binding potencies than the wild type and all other mutant forms (Fig. 3 B). Estimates of the relative shift in potencies of these two forms were ∼30–60-fold. FKN-CD mutants showing comparable binding affinities for CX3CR1 were evaluated for their ability to stimulate increases in intracellular calcium in fura-2-loaded huCX3CR1-CHO cells. At concentrations that achieve near full receptor occupancy (∼90%), each of these FKN mutants stimulated increases in intracellular calcium that were comparable to the “wild type” FKN (Fig. 3 C). At concentrations equivalent to ∼75% receptor occupancy by the wild type FKN, FKN-K7A, and -R47A mutants stimulated lower increases in intracellular calcium that correlated with the decreased binding affinity of these mutants. The concentration-dependent effect of FKN to promote chemotaxis of CX3CR1-expressing cells was evaluated for each of the mutants (Fig. 4). FKN-K7A and -R47A mutants displayed reduced chemotactic activity relative to that observed with wild type FKN. The FKN-R47A mutant was nearly ineffective at stimulating a chemotactic response, with maximal activity less than 10% of the wild type activity, whereas the FKN-K7A mutant retained ∼60% of the wild type maximal activity. The FKN-K36A mutant had slightly enhanced maximal chemotactic activity. Mutation of Met-15 (to Lys) yielded an FKN that was ∼10-fold less potent at promoting chemotaxis; these data are consistent with the slight reduction in binding affinity of FKN-M15K (see Fig. 3 B). TableII summarizes the effect of the mutations on the relative concentration dependence and maximal chemotactic activities of the mutant FKNs relative to the respective wild type FKN parameters.Table IIRelative EC 50 values and maximal chemotaxis of FKN-CD mutantsFormRelative EC50Maximal activityWT1100K7A0.81 ± 0.2258 ± 18 2-ap < 0.04, relative to WT.K14A1.8 ± 0.1678 ± 13M15K9.8 ± 4.95 2-ap < 0.04, relative to WT.113 ± 34K36A2.54 ± 0.7116 ± 6 2-ap < 0.04, relative to WT.R37A2.28 ± 0.63105 ± 33R47AND8 ± 4 2-ap < 0.04, relative to WT.K54A1.36 ± 0.06115 ± 21R74A1.71 ± 0.51122 ± 24NIT/EIM1.68 ± 0.34118 ± 20Shown are EC50 values and maximal chemotactic activity for FKN-CD mutants, relative to EC50 and maximal response of wild type (WT) FKN at stimulating chemotaxis of CX3CR1-L1.2 cells.

As stated, the specific basic residues targeted for mutagenesis are conserved in human, rat, and mouse FKNs. Analysis of the relative potencies of the mutants in binding to rat CX3CR1 revealed similar decreased affinities of the K7A and R47A mutants. This was evident regardless if the source of rat CX3CR1 was recombinant (Fig.5 A, rat CX3CR1-CHO cells) or native cell expressed (Fig. 5 B, rat microglia). These data indicate similar interactions of the FKN with CX3CR1 in humans and rodents and point to conserved amino acids in these receptor orthologs as the counter amino acid residues interacting with amino acids Lys-7 and Arg-47 in FKN. Parallel mutations were generated in the full-length FKN, in order to assess the role of these residues on FKN-dependent cell adhesion. The endothelial cell line, EA.hy 926, was transfected with each of these mutant constructs, and G418-resistant clonal cells were sorted.

Here we use high resolution time lapse microscopy to show a tight link between caspase activation and the morphological events delineating apoptosis in cultured SF21 cells from the moth Spodoptera frugiperda, a model insect system. The principal effector caspase,Sf-caspase-1, is proteolytically activated during SF21 apoptosis. To define the potential role of initiator caspases in vivo, we tested the effect of cell-permeable peptide inhibitors on pro-Sf-caspase-1 processing. Anti-caspase peptide analogues prevented apoptosis induced by diverse signals, including UV radiation and baculovirus infection. IETD-fmk potently inhibited the initial processing of pro-Sf-caspase-1 at the junction (TETD-G) of the large and small subunit, a cleavage that is blocked by inhibitor of apoptosis Op-IAP but not pancaspase inhibitor P35. BecauseSf-caspase-1 was inhibited poorly by IETD-CHO, our data indicated that the protease responsible for the first step in pro-Sf-caspase-1 activation is a distinct apical caspase. Thus, Sf-caspase-1 activation is mediated by a novel, P35-resistant caspase. These findings support the hypothesis that apoptosis in insects, like that in mammals, involves a cascade of caspase activations.

Apoptotic cells undergo a series of dramatic and characteristic alterations in morphology that include chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell shrinkage, and membrane blebbing (1Kerr J.F.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These irreversible changes in cellular architecture are initiated directly or indirectly by the proteolytic activity of the caspases, a highly conserved family of cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases that play a major role in programmed cell death (3Green D.R.

The caspases are activated from a latent proform (procaspase) by proteolytic excision of the large and small subunits that interact to generate the active enzyme. Procaspase processing occurs through proximity-induced autoactivation or by the activity of other proteases, including caspases (3Green D.R.

In mammals, apoptotic signaling initiates a caspase cascade wherein activated initiator caspases proteolytically activate downstream effector caspases (6Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

Initiator caspases possess long prodomains that interact with diverse proteins that regulate protease activation. In contrast, effector caspases have short prodomains. Initiator and effector caspases often exhibit different substrate specificities in vitro (5Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem.

In invertebrates, programmed cell death plays a critical role in development, control of DNA damage, and defense of pathogens, including viruses (10Bergmann A. Agapite J. Steller H.

However, the mechanisms by which caspases are activated and the hierarchy of apical and effector caspases are still unclear (10Bergmann A. Agapite J. Steller H.

On the basis of sequence similarity and biochemical activity, seven caspases have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster (Order Diptera) (15Vernooy S.Y. Copeland J. Ghaboosi N. Griffin E.E. Yoo S.J. Hay B.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 69-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Drosophila DRONC and DCP-2/DREDD possess long prodomains and by analogy to mammalian caspases are candidates as initiator caspases (16Dorstyn L.

Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). DCP-1, drICE, and DECAY contain short prodomains and therefore are likely effector caspases (18Song Z.W. McCall K. Steller H. Science. 1997; 275: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 19Fraser A.G. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2805-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Dorstyn L.

Caspases have also been identified and characterized from lepidopteran insects (moths and butterflies). In particular, Sf-caspase-1 is the principal effector caspase of SF21 cells (21Ahmad M.

These invertebrate cells have been used extensively for studies on apoptosis because of their sensitivity to diverse death stimuli, including baculovirus infection, UV radiation, and overexpression of proapoptotic genes (i.e. Drosophila reaper, hid, and grim) and their response to known apoptotic regulators such as P35 and IAP (23Clem R.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Pro-Sf-caspase-1, which contains a short prodomain, is activated by sequential proteolytic cleavages that are initiated only upon apoptotic signaling. The first cleavage occurs between the large and small subunit at the caspase-recognition site TETD↓G, which is also conserved in Drosophila DCP-1 and drICE. This initial cleavage event is blocked by baculovirus Op-IAP but is insensitive to the pancaspase inhibitor P35 (22LaCount D.J. Hanson S.F. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15657-15664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Op-IAP functions upstream from P35 to block apoptosis in Spodoptera (25Manji G.A. Hozak R.R.

A. 1997; 94: 13606-13611Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been hypothesized that the first step in pro-Sf-caspase-1 activation is mediated by an apical caspase that is distinguished by its novel resistance to P35 (22LaCount D.J. Hanson S.F. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15657-15664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To define the mechanism by which Sf-caspase-1 is activated upon apoptotic signaling and thereby gain insight into regulation of invertebrate effector caspases, we characterized the protease activity responsible for pro-Sf-caspase-1 activation. By using time lapse video microscopy of SF21 cells, we observed an exact correlation between the morphological hallmarks of apoptosis and caspase activation. We report here that peptide-based fluoromethyl ketone inhibitors potently blocked SF21 apoptosis induced by multiple signals. In particular, zVAD-fmk and IETD-fmk prevented the initial proteolytic processing of pro-Sf-caspase-1 at TETD↓G. BecauseSf-caspase-1 itself was inhibited poorly by IETD-CHO, our data indicated that the protease responsible for the first step in pro-Sf-caspase-1 activation is a distinct caspase, designated Sf-caspase-X. On the basis of these data, we concluded that the P35-insensitive activity of Sf-caspase-X is responsible for caspase activation in Spodoptera SF21 cells and that insects, like mammals, use a cascade of caspase-mediated events to execute apoptosis.

Nature. 1970; 225: 466-467Crossref Scopus (453) Google Scholar) were propagated in TC100 growth medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories) and 2.6 mg of tryptose broth/ml. SF21 cells were transfected as described previously (22LaCount D.J. Hanson S.F. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. J. Biol.

In brief, plasmid DNA in TC100 was mixed with N-[1-(2, 3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N- trimethylammonium methyl sulfate liposomes for 30 min at ambient temperature. The transfection mixture was added to cell monolayers previously washed with TC100. After 4 h of gentle rocking, the transfection mixture was replaced with supplemented TC100. Transfection efficiencies ranged from 60 to 80% as judged by lacZexpression in control plates. SF21 cell monolayers were UV-B irradiated for 10 min at room temperature by using a Blak Lamp (UVP, Upland, Calif) as described previously (33Hozak R.R. Manji G.A. Friesen P.D. Mol. Cell.

After cell attachment, growth medium was replaced, and the cells were UV irradiated or inoculated with virus as described. After a 2-h recovery period at 27 °C, mineral oil was added to prevent evaporation. Cells were viewed on a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) Diaphot microscope using a 100× oil emersion objective lens. Video images were obtained at the indicated intervals with a Photometrics Series 300 or Micromax digital camera. Images were background-subtracted and contrast-enhanced. QuickTime movies were produced using Adobe Premiere 5.1 using Cinepak compressor. Scale and time of compression are indicated. Levels of apoptosis induced in SF21 cell monolayers were determined by counting both apoptotic and viable, nonapoptotic cells using a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV phase contrast microscope (magnification, 200×) equipped with a digital camera and IP Lab Spectrum P software. Cells undergoing plasma membrane blebbing and/or cell body fragmentation were scored as apoptosis; both hallmarks were readily distinguished from viable cells (see Fig. 1). The mean ± standard deviation was calculated at the indicated times from the percentage of apoptotic cells of at least six evenly distributed fields of view and included from 1500 to 6000 cells. Irreversible fluoromethyl ketone peptide inhibitors z-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-DEVD-fmk,z-IETD-fmk, z-VAD-fmk, and z-FA-fmk (Calbiochem, San Diego) dissolved in Me2SO were mixed in supplemented TC100 and added to SF21 monolayers at the indicated concentrations. Cells were irradiated in the presence of peptide analogues and maintained at 27 °C. During infection, peptide analogues were added 1 h after inoculation. Me2SO vehicle was used as control. Whole cell lysates or purified proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to membranes. To detect Sf-caspase-1, immunoblots were incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of α-Sfcasp1 (22LaCount D.J. Hanson S.F. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. J. Biol.

C-terminal His6-tagged proteins were purified by nickel (Ni+2) affinity chromatography as described previously (22LaCount D.J. Hanson S.F. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. J. Biol.

Isolated proteins were >90% homogenous as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Colloidal Burst Coomassie G Stain (Z axis). Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Sf-caspase-1 activity was measured in reactions (20 μl) containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS,1 10% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm tetrapeptide substrates Ac-IETD-amc or Ac-DEVD-amc (Biomol Research). Accumulation of fluorescent product (amc) was monitored by using a Molecular Dynamics Biolumin 960 Kinetic Fluorescence/Absorbance microplate reader (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 465 nm) at 30-s intervals for 30 min. Rate of product formation was obtained from the linear portion of the reaction curves within the first 10% of substrate depletion and averaged for triplicate assays. For inhibition assays, increasing concentrations of tetrapeptide aldehydes Ac-IETD-CHO or Ac-DEVD-CHO (Biomol Research) were incubated with 200 fmol of purifiedSf-caspase-1. After 1 h at ambient temperature, substrate Ac-DEVD-amc (10 μm) was added, and residual caspase activity was measured as described above. Stained gels and immunoblots were scanned at a resolution of 300 dots per inch by using a Hewlett Packard ScanJetIIcx. The resulting files were printed from Adobe Photoshop 3.0 and Illustrator 7.0 by using a Tektronics Phaser 450 dye sublimation printer. Although many cellular components involved in apoptosis have been identified, little is known about the kinetics and morphological events of cell dismemberment. Cultured cells provide a unique view into the morphology of programmed cell death. In particular, SF21 cells from the moth S. frugiperda provide a useful model system for studies on both biochemical and morphological aspects of apoptosis (21Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L.J.

SF21 cells are especially attractive because of their sensitivity to diverse apoptotic stimuli and their classical apoptotic response, which includes degradation of chromosomal DNA into nucleosomal-sized fragments and vigorous membrane blebbing. Here, we used time lapse microscopy to document SF21 morphological events during apoptosis as a means to link them with intracellular biochemical processes. SF21 cells rapidly succumb to UV radiation-induced apoptosis, which consumes >90% of a culture within 9 h (25Manji G.A. Hozak R.R. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J.

Because of the large size (15–20 μm) and well defined nucleus of these cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic events during apoptosis were readily discerned by time lapse video microscopy (Fig. 1; see also Video 1 in supplementary material). The first sign of UV radiation-induced alterations was chromatin condensation, which included formation of multiple opaque or dense bodies (2–3 μm in diameter) within the nucleus (Fig. 1). The appearance of these spheroidal inclusions coincided with the early activation of cellular caspases 2–3 h after UV irradiation (33Hozak R.R. Manji G.A. Friesen P.D. Mol. Cell.

During this early period, other transformations were observed within the nucleus, including rapid migration of small particulate bodies and formation of vesicular-like structures. Immediately thereafter, apoptotic blebbing was uniformly initiated over the cell surface, upon which abundant microvilli-like structures were still observed. Membrane blebs first appeared as small rounded protrusions but grew rapidly to produce long extensions that ultimately detached from the main cell body to form apoptotic bodies. These vesicles were translucent or opaque, suggesting that their contents varied. Blebbing lasted for 30–45 min and consumed the cell, leaving behind a dense corpse. By 9–12 h after irradiation, only free floating apoptotic bodies and cell corpses remained (see Fig.4 A, panel ii). SF21 cells are also highly sensitive to baculovirus-induced apoptosis. AcMNPV mutants that lack functional apoptotic suppressors (p35 or iap) cause widespread apoptosis that severely restricts virus yields in part because of premature host cell death (23Clem R.J. Fechheimer M. Miller L.K. Science. 1991; 254: 1388-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 26LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J.

Virol. 1993; 67: 3730-3738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Time lapse microscopy of SF21 cells inoculated with the p35 deletion mutant vΔp35 (Fig. 2; see also Video 2 in supplementary material) revealed that the morphological hallmarks of virus-induced apoptosis were similar to those induced by UV radiation. However, vΔp35-induced apoptosis occurred later and was less synchronous. The first signs of apoptosis included formation of dense, refractile material within and around the inside edge of hypertrophied nuclei (Fig. 2, B and C). The appearance of this intranuclear density coincided with caspase activation, which begins 9 and 12 h after infection (22LaCount D.J. Hanson S.F. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15657-15664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because nuclear aggregates were absent in cells infected with wild-type virus that encodes caspase inhibitor P35 (see below), it is likely that this material is condensed chromatin resulting from caspase activity. Soon after these nuclear events, apoptotic blebbing was initiated. Blebbing initiated 9–19 h after infection (Fig. 2; see also Video 2 in supplementary material). This asynchrony may be due to variations in the timing of virus-induced apoptotic signaling. Blebbing was invariably followed by an unusual and striking series of fusions in which apoptotic bodies of an individual cell form a single spherical mass of vesicles. Although the mechanism for this resurrection-like process is unknown, it may involve virus-encoded surface proteins that mediate membrane fusion (45Monsma S.A. Blissard G.W. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2583-2595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During infection, baculovirus P35 prevents premature host cell death by blocking apoptosis. The role that P35 plays in prolonging cell survival and contributing to virus productivity is dramatically illustrated by time lapse microscopy of wild-type AcMNPV-infected SF21 cells (Fig.3; see also Video 3 in supplementary material). The first visible signs of infection occurred 9–12 h after inoculation, at which time the nucleus enlarged and the cell surface became ruffled. Extracellular budded virus, the first of two morphologically and temporally distinct forms of infectious virus (46Friesen P.D. Miller L.K. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Field's Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2001Google Scholar), is shed in abundance at 9–20 h and probably accounts for the vesicular, nonapoptotic protrusions at the cell surface. During this period, host caspases are activated and subsequently inhibited by newly synthesized P35 (22LaCount D.J. Hanson S.F. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15657-15664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J.

The second and largest virus particle, occluded virus (OV), appeared on the inside edge of the hypertrophied nuclei beginning 22 h after infection (Fig. 3 C). Composed of nucleocapsids embedded within a matrix of the protein polyhedrin (46Friesen P.D. Miller L.K. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Field's Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2001Google Scholar), these polyhedral particles expanded to occupy the entire nucleus (Fig. 3 D). The number, size (1–3 μm dia), and shape of OV particles varied between cells. OV are not produced unless apoptosis is blocked (23Clem R.J. Fechheimer M. Miller L.K. Science. 1991; 254: 1388-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 35Hershberger P.A. Dickson J.A. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5525-5533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, in a dynamic process that resembled necrosis, OV-containing cells expanded and ruptured (Fig. 3; see also Video 3 in supplementary material). Thus, as illustrated, the virus' apparent strategy is to prolong cell survival long enough for progeny maturation, whereupon lysis facilitates virus dissemination. The morphological events delineating apoptosis in SF21 cells coincided with the early activation of caspases (21Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L.J. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J.

To define the in vivo role of initiator and effector caspases in this invertebrate system, we first tested the anti-apoptotic activity of peptide inhibitors that target the caspases, including the membrane permeable peptides DEVD-fmk and IETD-fmk. Both tetrapeptides were potent inhibitors of apoptosis induced by either UV radiation or baculovirus infection (Fig. 4). Incubation of UV irradiated cells with either tetrapeptide prevented all morphological signs of apoptosis, which was widespread in untreated cultures (Fig. 4 A). Both peptides also blocked apoptosis induced by AcMNPV p35 deletion mutant vΔp35 (Fig. 4 B). At the highest extracellular dose tested (200 μm), DEVD- and IETD-fmk reduced apoptosis to less than 5%. At lower concentrations (30–50 μm), IETD-fmk was two to three times more effective than DEVD-fmk. In contrast, the control fluoromethyl ketone FA-fmk failed to affect apoptosis induced by either death stimulus (data not shown). The intracellular concentration of each peptide inhibitor was not determined. In addition to promoting cell survival, the caspase inhibitory peptides restored baculovirus multiplication. Upon treatment with DEVD- and IETD-fmk, vΔp35-infected SF21 cells accumulated OV particles at levels comparable with"

(1998) J. Biol. Chem.273, 11212–11217). Cloning of cDNA encoding the EAP30 protein revealed that it shares significant sequence similarity with the product of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNF8 gene (Schmidt, A. E., Miller, T., Schmidt, S. L., Shiekhattar, R., and Shilatifard, A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 21981–21985), which is required for efficient derepression of glucose-repressed genes. Here we report the cloning of cDNAs encoding the EAP45 and EAP20 proteins. In addition, we identify theS. cerevisiae VPS36 and YJR102c genes as potential orthologs of EAP45 and EAP20 and show that they are previously uncharacterized SNF genes with properties very similar to SNF8.

ELL-associated protein sucrose nonfermenting open reading frame vacuolar protein sorting polyvinylidene difluoride expressed sequence tag dithiothreitol hemagglutinin open reading frame polymerase chain reaction RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL (for 11–19 lysine-rich in leukemia) was originally identified in rat liver nuclear extracts and purified by its ability to increase the overall rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II in vitro by suppressing transient pausing by polymerase at many sites along the DNA (1Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The human ELLgene was also identified as a gene involved in t(11:19)(q23:p13.1) translocations with the MLL gene in acute myeloid leukemia (2Thirman M.J. Levitan D.A. Kobayashi H. Simon M.C.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22355-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to its ability to stimulate the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II, ELL is capable of inhibiting promoter-specific transcription initiation by RNA polymerase IIin vitro by binding polymerase and preventing it from entering the preinitiation complex (4Shilatifard A. Haque D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22355-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, ∼40% of the detectable ELL protein in rat liver whole cell extracts was found to be in a high molecular mass, multiprotein complex. Purification of this complex to near homogeneity revealed that, in addition to ELL, it includes threeELL-associated proteins (EAPs)1 of ∼45, ∼30, and ∼20 kDa (5Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11212-11217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ELL-EAP complex was found to possess elongation stimulatory activity indistinguishable from that of the individual ELL protein, but to lack transcription initiation inhibitory activity, suggesting that the EAPs blocked this ELL activity (5Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11212-11217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was confirmed when EAP30 was cloned and shown to interact directly with ELL in vitro and to prevent it from inhibiting transcription initiation (6Schmidt A.E. Miller T. Schmidt S.L. Shiekhattar R. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21981-21985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cloning of the cDNA encoding EAP30 revealed that it is a potential ortholog of the product of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNF8gene (6Schmidt A.E. Miller T. Schmidt S.L. Shiekhattar R. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21981-21985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The SNF8 gene was originally identified by Carlson and co-workers (7Yeghiayan P. Tu J. Vallier L.G. Carlson M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in a genetic screen for yeast genes essential for growth on sucrose. Yeast snf8 mutants are defective in derepression of glucose-repressed genes such as SUC2, which encodes the enzyme invertase that hydrolyzes the non-fermentable carbon sources sucrose and raffinose. Yeast bearing snf8 mutations are able to repress SUC2 expression in the presence of glucose, but do not support maximal SUC2 derepression when switched to low glucose-containing media (7Yeghiayan P. Tu J. Vallier L.G. Carlson M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this report, we present identification, cloning, and characterization of the remaining two EAPs, EAP45 and EAP20. In addition, we identify the S. cerevisiae VPS36 andYJR102c genes as potential orthologs of EAP45 andEAP20 and show that yeast containing mutations inVPS36 and YJR102c exhibit phenotypes very similar to those of snf8 mutants. Anti-T7 antibody was purchased from Novagen. Anti-HA (12CA5) and anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Protein A/G-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) was purchased from Sigma. Glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Hybond-P PVDF membranes were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Chemiluminescence reagent (Super Signal West Dura Extend) was purchased from Pierce. The ELL-EAP complex was purified as described (5Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11212-11217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The EAP45 and EAP20 proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 25 pmol of the EAP45 and EAP20 proteins were reduced, S-carboxyamidomethylated, and digested with trypsin in gel slices. An aliquot of the tryptic digests was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Another aliquot of the tryptic digests was fractionated by microbore high performance liquid chromatography, and isolated peptides were sequenced by automated Edman degradation. ESTs encoding EAP45 and EAP20 peptide sequences were identified through searches of the GenBank EST data base. ESTs encoding mouse EAP45 (AA274602 and AA086895) and mouse EAP20 (AA032693) were obtained from Research Genetics (IMAGE consortium) and sequenced on both strands. Mouse EAP45 containing an N-terminal Myc tag, mouse EAP30 containing an N-terminal HA tag, and mouse EAP20 containing an N-terminal T7 tag were subcloned into pBacPAK8, and recombinant baculoviruses were generated by the BacPAK baculovirus expression system (CLONTECH). Sf21 cells were cultured in Sf-900 II SFM with 5% fetal calf serum at 27 °C and infected with appropriate recombinant viruses. Sixty hours after infection, cells were collected and lysed by gentle vortexing in ice-cold buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for Western blotting and immunoprecipitations. Mouse EAP45 containing an N-terminal Myc tag was subcloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and mouse EAP30 containing an N-terminal HA tag, and mouse EAP20 containing an N-terminal T7 tag were subcloned into the pCI-neo expression vector (Promega). 48 h after transfection of 293T cells using Fugene 6, cells were collected and lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for Western blotting and immunoprecipitations. To measure interactions among the EAP proteins, baculovirus-infected insect cell lysates or transfected mammalian cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C and then with protein A/G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-Sepharose was washed three times in buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis through SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to Hybond-P PVDF membranes, probed with appropriate antibodies, and visualized using the Super Signal West Dura Extend chemiluminescence reagent. To generate theyjr102cΔ, snf8Δ, or vps36Δ yeast strains, the YJR102c, SNF8, or VPS36genes were deleted in S. cerevisiae strain BY4733 (Mata, his3–200, leu2–0, met15–0, trp1–63, ura3–0) (8Brachmann C.B.

Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Deletions were confirmed by PCR analysis of single colonies that grew on histidine(−) plates. Cell growth was analyzed under non-fermenting conditions by growing wild type BY4733 cells and isogenic strains containing the respective knockouts on plates containing 1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone and either 2% glucose (YPD) or 2% raffinose plus 1 μg/ml antimycin A (7Yeghiayan P. Tu J. Vallier L.G. Carlson M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Temperature sensitivity was assessed by growth of yeast on YPD at 39 °C. Yeast were grown in log phase for at least three generations to an A600 of 1 in YPD with 4% glucose. Cells to be derepressed were washed twice in 1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, and 0.05% glucose and then grown in the same medium plus 5% glycerol for 2.5 h. OneA600 unit of cells was washed in cold 10% sodium azide. Glucose repressed cells were resuspended in 50 μl of 10% sodium azide, and derepressed cells were resuspended in 200 μl of 10% sodium azide. Prior to assay, the derepressed cell suspension was diluted 10-fold in water. To assay invertase activity, 50 μl of cell suspension were added to 100 μl of 0.2 m sodium acetate (pH 5.1). 50 μl of 0.5m sucrose was then added, and the cell suspension was allowed to incubate for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 300 μl of 0.2 mK2HPO4. 100 μl of the resulting cell suspension was added to an additional 400 μl of 0.2 mK2HPO4 and boiled for 3 min. Two ml of glucostat reagent containing 0.2 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 40 μg of glucose oxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 5 μg of horseradish peroxidase, and 0.53 mg of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) were added, the reaction was incubated at room temperature for at least 30 min, and theA420 of the samples was determined. Invertase units (μmol glucose released/min/100 mg dry weight of yeast) were calculated by correcting for initial dilution of cell volumes and by comparison to standard curves performed in parallel with known concentrations of glucose. Yeast cells were grown under glucose repressed or derepressed conditions as described above. Total RNA was isolated from 2 A600 units of cells using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini-kit. Reverse-transcription was performed in 100-μl reactions using the Taq-Man reverse transcription kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 2 μg of total RNA. Reverse transcriptase reactions were primed with either aSUC2 antisense primer (5′-TTG GTT CGG CTT TCA AAT TGA-3′) or an ACT1 antisense primer (5′-GAG CAG CGG TTT GCA CT-3′). Real time quantitative PCR reactions were performed in a LightCycler (Roche) using SUC2 antisense and sense (5′-CCC ATG GAG ATC ATC CAT GTC T-3′) or ACT1 antisense and sense (5′-CCC ATG GAG ATC ATC CAT GTC-3′) primers; the SUC2 andACT1 PCR products were both ∼100 base pairs long. PCR reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with the Light- Cycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche) and contained 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μmof each primer, and 2 μl (2%) of the cDNA products of reverse transcription reactions. Reactions were initiated by heating at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles programmed as follows: 95 °C for 0 s, 60 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 6 s. To prepare the standard curve, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 pg of purified SUC2 or ACT1 PCR product was used in identical PCR reactions. The ELL-EAP complex, which is composed of the ELL, EAP45, EAP30, and EAP20 proteins, was purified to near homogeneity from rat liver whole cell extracts as described previously (5Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11212-11217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The sequences of peptides derived from EAP45 and EAP20 were determined by Edman degradation or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (Fig.1). No matches to peptides from EAP45 or EAP20 were identified in searches of the GenBank™ non-redundant data base, indicating that EAP45 and EAP20 are previously uncharacterized mammalian proteins. A search of the GenBank™ EST data base, however, identified mouse and human ESTs encoding the sequenced peptides and containing potential full-length EAP45 and EAP20 ORFs. The mouse EAP45 ORF encodes a 387-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 43,844 Da and a pI of 6.0 (Fig. 2). Mouse EAP45 is 97% identical in amino acid sequence to human EAP45. The mouse and human EAP20 ORFs encode identical 176-amino acid proteins with calculated molecular masses of 20,971 Da and pIs of 6.8 (Fig. 3).Figure 2Alignment of mammalian EAP45 with potentialD. melanogaster, C. elegans, and yeast orthologs.

Miller T. Schmidt S.L. Shiekhattar R. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21981-21985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To investigate interactions among the EAP proteins, 293T cells were transfected with various combinations of pCI-neo expression vectors encoding epitope tagged EAP45, EAP30, and EAP20. As shown in Fig. 4 A, when all three EAP proteins were coexpressed in 293T cells, all three proteins could be coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the epitope tags on either EAP45 or EAP20. In addition, EAP30 could be coimmunoprecipitated with EAP20 in the absence of exogenously expressed EAP45, and EAP20 could be coimmunoprecipitated with EAP45 in the absence of exogenously expressed EAP30. Because EAP45 was only expressed to detectable levels when coexpressed in 293T cells with EAP20, it was not possible to assess the ability of EAP30 to interact with EAP45 in the absence of exogenously expressed EAP20. We therefore investigated interactions among the EAP proteins in Sf21 insect cells. In these experiments, Sf21 cells were infected with various combinations of baculoviruses encoding epitope-tagged EAP45, EAP30, and EAP20. Consistent with the results of experiments carried out with 293T cells, when coexpressed in Sf21 cells, all three EAP proteins could be coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the epitope tags on either EAP45 or EAP20 (Fig. 4 B). In addition, EAP30 could be coimmunoprecipitated with EAP20 in the absence of exogenously expressed EAP45, and EAP20 could be coimmunoprecipitated with EAP45 in the absence of exogenously expressed EAP30. Only a very small fraction of EAP30, however, was coimmunoprecipitated with EAP45 in the absence of exogenously expressed EAP20. Taken together, the results of experiments carried out with both mammalian and insect cells suggest that EAP20 bridges EAP30 and EAP45 and thereby nucleates assembly of the EAP complex. The S. cerevisiae snf8 protein was previously identified as a potential ortholog of mammalian EAP30 (6Schmidt A.E. Miller T. Schmidt S.L. Shiekhattar R. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21981-21985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The SNF8 gene was originally isolated by Carlson and co-workers (7Yeghiayan P. Tu J. Vallier L.G. Carlson M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in a screen for yeast mutants defective in derepressing expression of glucose-repressed genes such asSUC2, which encodes the sucrose and raffinose hydrolyzing enzyme invertase. How Snf8 participates in regulation of gene expression by glucose is not yet known. GenBank™ data base searches identified the S. cerevisiaeVps36 protein and the product of S. cerevisiae ORF YJR102c are potential orthologs of mammalian EAP45 and EAP20, respectively. TheS. cerevisiae VPS36 gene was previously identified in a genetic screen for yeast defective in a variety of protein trafficking pathways (10Nothwehr S.F. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Luo W.J. Chang A. J. Cell. Biol. 1997; 138: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, data base searches identified the products of Drosophila melanogaster ORF CG10711,Caenorhabditis elegans ORF F17C11.8, andSchizosaccharomyces pombe ORF SPBC3B9.09 as potential orthologs of EAP45 (Fig. 2) and D. melanogaster ORF CG14750,C. elegans ORF W02A11.2, and S. pombe ORF SPBC4B4.06 as potential orthologs of EAP20 (Fig. 3). In light of the amino acid sequence similarities between EAP30 and Snf8, EAP45 and Vps36, and EAP20 and Yjr102c, we speculated that, like Snf8, Vps36 and Yjr102c could have roles in regulation of glucose repressed genes. To address this possibility, S. cerevisiaestrains lacking the SNF8, VPS36, orYJR102c genes were constructed and their phenotypes compared. Carlson and co-workers (7Yeghiayan P. Tu J. Vallier L.G. Carlson M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Vallier L.G. Carlson M. Genetics. 1991; 129: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that yeast lacking the SNF8 gene are viable, but exhibit growth defects on raffinose, temperature sensitivity, and partial loss of the ability to derepress SUC2 expression. Like SNF8, neither VPS36 nor YJR102c is an essential gene. As described previously for the snf8 deletion,vps36 and yjr102c deletions result in a severe growth defect on raffinose and temperature-sensitive growth on glucose (Fig. 5). To compare the effects of snf8, vps36, andyjr102c deletions on SUC2 derepression, wild type and deletion strains were grown for several generations in medium containing 4% glucose to repress SUC2 and then transferred to medium containing 0.05% glucose and 5% glycerol as carbon sources. As shown previously (7Yeghiayan P. Tu J. Vallier L.G. Carlson M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Vallier L.G. Carlson M. Genetics. 1991; 129: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in Fig.6 A, the snf8deletion strain was partially defective in derepression of invertase activity after cells were transferred out of high glucose medium; maximum invertase activity obtained under derepressing conditions was ∼4-fold lower with the snf8 deletion than with the isogenic wild type yeast strain. Maximum invertase activity under derepressing conditions was similarly reduced in the vps36and yjr102c deletion strains. To determine whether the partial defect in invertase derepression in the three deletion strains is accompanied by decreases in SUC2 RNA levels, total RNA was prepared from wild type and mutant yeast strains grown under repressing and derepressing conditions, and SUC2 RNA levels were determined by real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 6 B, similar to invertase activity,SUC2 RNA was only partially derepressed insnf8, vps36, and yjr102c deletion strains, indicating that mutations in these genes affect regulation ofSUC2 RNA synthesis and/or stability. RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL was recently purified from rat liver as a component of a multiprotein complex containing ELL and three additional proteins designated EAPs ∼45 (EAP45), ∼30 (EAP30), and ∼20 (EAP20) kDa; ∼40% of the detectable ELL in rat liver whole cell extracts is present in the ELL-EAP complex (5Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11212-11217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In a previous study, the ELL-EAP complex was found to possess elongation stimulatory activity indistinguishable from that of the individual ELL protein. In contrast to free ELL, however, the ELL-EAP complex lacked transcription initiation inhibitory activity, arguing that association of the EAPs with ELL blocked this activity (5Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11212-11217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cloning of the cDNA encoding the EAP30 protein and characterization of its interaction with ELL revealed that EAP30 alone is capable of interacting directly with ELL and blocking ELL transcription initiation inhibitory activity (6Schmidt A.E. Miller T. Schmidt S.L. Shiekhattar R. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21981-21985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, comparison of the EAP30 amino acid sequence with known protein sequences identified the product of the S. cerevisiae SNF8 gene as a potential ortholog. The yeast SNF8 gene was originally identified by Carlson and co-workers (7Yeghiayan P. Tu J. Vallier L.G. Carlson M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in a genetic screen for yeast defective in derepression of expression of glucose-repressed genes like SUC2, which encodes the sucrose-metabolizing enzyme invertase. Carlson and co-workers found that yeast lacking the SNF8 gene repressSUC2 expression properly when grown in glucose-containing media, but fail to support maximal derepression of SUC2 gene expression when switched to low glucose-containing media. In this report, we describe cloning of cDNAs encoding the EAP45 and EAP20 proteins, which, together with EAP30, reconstitute the three subunit EAP complex. In addition, we identify the S. cerevisiae VPS36 and YJR102c genes as potential orthologs ofEAP45 and EAP20 and show that they are previously uncharacterized SNF genes. Taken together with our evidence that mutation of the VPS36and YJR102c genes results in similar SNF phenotypes in yeast, our finding that the mammalian EAP proteins function together in a multiprotein complex raises the possibility that the yeast Snf8, YJR102c, and Vps36 proteins may also function together in a complex in yeast. Indeed, in an independent line of research, Emr and co-workers 2M. Babst and S. Emr, personal communication. have identified the S. cerevisiae SNF8 and YJR102c genes in a genetic screen for yeast defective in intracellular protein trafficking and have shown that the Snf8, YJR102c, and Vps36 proteins are present in yeast in a multiprotein complex. Finally, the relationship between the functions of S. cerevisiae Snf8, Yjr102c, and Vps36 proteins in derepression of glucose repressed genes and protein trafficking is unknown. In light of previous evidence that derepression of the SUC2 gene is accompanied by increases in both transcription and stability ofSUC2 mRNA, our observation that deletions of theSNF8, VPS36, and YJR102c genes results in reduced levels of derepressed SUC2 mRNA expression indicates that the Snf8, Yjr102c, and Vps36 proteins participate in some way in promoting transcription and/or mRNA stability during derepression. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the protein encoded by the human tumor susceptibility 101 (TSG101) gene, which has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, has recently been shown to be an ortholog of the S. cerevisiaeVps23 protein (13Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 14Li Y. Kane T. Tipper C. Spatrick P. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3588-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutations in the VPS23 andTSG101 genes result in intracellular protein trafficking defects in yeast and mammalian cells, respectively. In addition to its role in protein trafficking, however, the TSG101 protein has been reported both to function as a general transcriptional corepressor (15Watanabe M. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and to interact specifically with the AF-1 activation domain of the glucocortoid receptor and inhibit glucocorticoid receptor-, androgen receptor-, and estrogen receptor-dependent gene expression in cells (15Watanabe M.

Cancer. 1999; 86: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, future studies investigating the functions of the EAP proteins in mammalian cells and in yeast should provide valuable insights into the intriguing relationship between the transcriptional regulatory and protein trafficking pathways in eukaryotic cells.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the estrogen receptor binds to calmodulin-Sepharose in vitro. However, the association of endogenous calmodulin with endogenous estrogen receptors in intact cells has not been reported, and the function of the interaction is obscure. Here we demonstrate by co-immunoprecipitation from MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells that endogenous estrogen receptors bind to endogenous calmodulin. Estradiol treatment of the cells had no significant effect on the interaction. However, incubation of the cells with tamoxifen enhanced by 5–10-fold the association of calmodulin with the estrogen receptor and increased the total cellular content of estrogen receptors by 1.5–2-fold. In contrast, the structurally distinct calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine and CGS9343B attenuated the interaction between calmodulin and the estrogen receptor and dramatically reduced the number of estrogen receptors in the cell. Neither of these agents altered the amount of estrogen receptor mRNA, suggesting that calmodulin stabilizes the protein. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that, in the presence of Ca2+, calmodulin protected estrogen receptors from in vitro proteolysis by trypsin. Furthermore, overexpression of wild type calmodulin, but not a mutant calmodulin incapable of binding Ca2+, increased the concentration of estrogen receptors in MCF-7 cells, whereas transient expression of a calmodulin inhibitor peptide reduced the estrogen receptor concentration. These data demonstrate that calmodulin binds to the estrogen receptor in intact cells in a Ca2+-dependent, but estradiol-independent, manner, thereby modulating the stability and the steady state level of estrogen receptors.

Calmodulin, an acidic effector protein that regulates multiple intracellular processes (1Cohen P. Klee C. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1988Google Scholar), has an essential role in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (2Reddy G.P.V. Reed W.C. Sheehan E.L. Sacks D.B.

Inactivation of calmodulin blocks the cell cycle (4Rasmussen C.D. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3961-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 5Natsukari N. Zhang S.P. Nichols R.A. Weiss B.

Means A.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3961-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, calmodulin is directly involved in DNA synthesis (2Reddy G.P.V. Reed W.C. Sheehan E.L. Sacks D.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10426-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, calmodulin concentrations are increased in several malignancies, including those of the liver (6Wei J.-W. Morris H.P. Hickie R.A. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2571-2574PubMed Google Scholar), lung (7Liu G.X. Sheng H.F. Wu S. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 899-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), keratinocytes (8Grief F.

Whether the increased calmodulin contributes to neoplastic transformation or is a consequence of the altered cellular homeostasis that occurs during malignancy has not been ascertained. It has been reported that calmodulin associates in vitro in a Ca2+-dependent manner with the estrogen receptor isolated from rat uterus cytosol (12Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and that this interaction stimulates binding of the estrogen receptor to the estrogen response element (13Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The estrogen receptor, which regulates the expression of specific genes and participates in breast cell proliferation (14Walker R.A. Varley J.M. Cancer Surveys. 1993; 16: 31-57PubMed Google Scholar), is the principal target for chemotherapy of breast carcinoma (15Lykkesfeldt A.E. Acta Oncol. ( Stockh. ). 1996; 35 Suppl. 5: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence implicate a role for Ca2+ and calmodulin in mediating the actions of estrogen as follows. (i) Estrogen induces Ca2+ fluxes in breast carcinoma cells (16Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Endocrine Rev. 1987; 8: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar); (ii) Ca2+ channel antagonists inhibit the proliferation of breast carcinoma cells (17Taylor J.M. Simpson R.U. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2413-2418PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) tamoxifen, the primary chemotherapeutic agent used to treat breast cancer, deregulates intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (18Jain P.T. Trump B.F. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 1167-1174PubMed Google Scholar); (iv) sustained increased intranuclear Ca2+ concentrations induce DNA fragmentation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells in a calmodulin-dependent manner (19Bellomo G. Perotti M. Taddei F. Mirabelli F. Finardi G. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1342-1346PubMed Google Scholar); (v) calmodulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the estrogen receptor (20Migliaccio A. Rotondi A. Auricchio F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5921-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); and (vi) calmodulin is required for the formation of the estrogen receptor-estrogen response element complex and for activation of an estrogen responsive promotor (21Biswas D.K. Reddy P.V. Pickard M. Makkad B. Pettit N. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33817-33824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Together these findings suggest that Ca2+/calmodulin could be a participant in the mitogenic effects of estrogen. Therefore, we set out to examine the physiological significance of the interaction of calmodulin with the estrogen receptor. The antibody to calmodulin was described previously (22Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The anti-estrogen receptor antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz. Calmodulin-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Affi-Gel was from Bio-Rad. Tissue culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was from BioWhittaker. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Purified human estrogen receptor was from PanVera, Ca2+-free pig brain calmodulin was obtained from Ocean Biologics, and sequencing gradel-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone -treated trypsin was obtained from Promega. All other reagents were of standard analytical grade. MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells were grown to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. To examine the effect of estradiol, the medium was replaced with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the fetal bovine serum was treated with dextran-coated charcoal (23Tcholakian R.K. Jones G.M. Sanborn B.M. Rodriguez-Rigau L.J. Reimondo G.G. Clin. Chem. 1980; 26: 101-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were treated with estradiol, tamoxifen, or the calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine (TFP)1 or CGS9343B. The concentrations and incubation times are indicated in the figure legends. To lyse the cells, the medium was removed, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (145 mm NaC1, 12 mm Na2HPO4, and 4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.2) and 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-base, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, aprotonin, and pepstatin containing 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA) was added. The lysates were collected and quick-frozen in methanol/solid CO2. The mammalian expression vector, POPI3, was purchased from Stratagene. An oligonucleotide linker flanked by NotI andAflII-containing XbaI, SmaI, andBlpI cleavage sites was fashioned and inserted into theNotI and AflII sites of POPI3. This introducedXbaI, SmaI and BlpI sites in the polylinker region to form POPI3-Xb. A puromycin resistance gene was removed from pBabe-puro (24Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) with BamHI and ClaI. The fragment was treated with S1 nuclease to form blunt ends. POPI3 was digested with AatII and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to prevent self ligation. The puromycin gene was ligated into the AatII site to form POPI3-Xb-puro. The vector containing the cDNA for mammalian calmodulin was obtained from Dr. A. Persechini (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY) and was designated pMZ-xCaM1 (25Persechini A. Blumenthal D.K. Jarrett H.W. Klee C.B. Hardy D.O. Kretsinger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8052-8058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To excise the calmodulin cDNA for insertion into POPI3-Xb-puro, the PstI site of pMZ-xCaM1 was changed to an AflII site by insertion of an oligonucleotide linker containing AflII and SalI sites flanked by PstI. The vector was digested withNcoI, then treated with Klenow enzyme and deoxynucleotides to form a blunt end, and finally, digested with AflII. To accommodate the fragment, POPI3-Xb-puro was digested withAflII and XbaI. The fragment was ligated with the vector to form POPI3-Xb-puro-mCaM. The vector containing the cDNA for mutant calmodulin that does not bind Ca2+ (CaMΔCa) was a gift from Dr. K. Beckingham (Rice University, Houston, TX) and was designated pRK5 (26Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To excise the calmodulin cDNA for insertion into POPI3-Xb-puro, pRK7 was first digested with BlpI, then treated with S1 nuclease to form a blunt end, and finally, digested with XbaI. To accommodate the fragment, POPI3-Xb-puro was digested withBlpI, treated with S1 nuclease to form a blunt end, and then digested with XbaI. The fragment was ligated with the vector to form POPI3-Xb-puro-CaMΔCa. A synthetic gene encoding the calmodulin binding sequence of myosin light chain kinase inserted in the eukaryotic expression vector pSVL (27Wang J. Campos B. Jamieson G.A. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30245-30248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. John Dedman (University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH). Transient transfection of this construct into mammalian cells neutralizes calmodulin function (27Wang J. Campos B. Jamieson G.A. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30245-30248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Vectors were transiently transfected into MCF-7 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After 6 h, the medium was replaced with 10% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and returned to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Unless indicated otherwise, cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection. Cell lysates, normalized for total protein, were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 ml of calmodulin-Sepharose in the presence of 1 mmCaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. Samples were washed five times in lysis buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed as described below. Equal amounts of protein lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody linked to Affi-Gel as described previously (28Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Samples were washed five times in lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Immunoblots were probed with anti-estrogen receptor or anti-calmodulin antibody. Complexes were visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. For immunoprecipitation of pure proteins, 1 μg of estrogen receptor was incubated with 1 μm tamoxifen or an equal volume of vehicle at 4 °C. After 30 min, 5 μg of calmodulin was added in lysis buffer (final volume of 300 μl) containing 1 mmCaC12 or 1 mm EGTA, and incubation was continued for 30 min. Samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-calmodulin antibody and processed by Western blotting as described above. Pure estrogen receptor (8 μg) was incubated at 4 °C with 10.5 μg calmodulin (5-fold molar excess) or 10.5 μg of myoglobin in 125 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 1 mmCa2+ or 1 mm EGTA. After 20 min,l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (1:100 trypsin:estrogen receptor, w/w) was added, and samples were incubated at 25 °C. At the time points indicated in the figure legend, 30-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture and immediately added to boiling SDS. Samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected with Coomassie Blue R-250. The extent of digestion, expressed relative to undigested protein, was quantified by laser-scanning densitometry from Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Total RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells with RNAzol B (Teltest, Inc.). Two micrograms of RNA was mixed with denaturing buffer (60% deionized formamide, 7% formaldehyde, 1× borate buffer, 6% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol), resolved on a 1% agarose, 3% formaldehyde gel in borate buffer (5 mm boric acid, 5 mmsodium borate, 10 mm sodium sulfate, and 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0), transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and cross-linked with UV light. The estrogen receptor cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. P. Yen, National Institutes of Health) was removed from pcDNA3 with EcoRI and purified by low melt agarose. Approximately 20 ng of estrogen receptor cDNA was labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Northern blots were probed with radiolabeled cDNA, and estrogen receptor mRNA was identified by autoradiography. Protein determinations were performed using the DC protein assay from Bio-Rad. RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry. Densitometry of the bands on the gels, the autoradiographs, and the enhanced chemiluminescence signals was performed with NIH-Image. Statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t test using InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The interaction of calmodulin with the estrogen receptor was initially characterized in MCF-7 breast epithelial cells by calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography. This approach demonstrated that calmodulin binds to the estrogen receptor (Fig. 1 B), corroborating previous observations with cytosol from rat uterus (12Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,13Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Binding of the estrogen receptor to calmodulin-Sepharose was abrogated when Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA (data not shown). To evaluate the effect of estradiol and tamoxifen on the association of calmodulin with the estrogen receptor, we first examined the level of estrogen receptors in cells incubated with each agent (Fig. 1 A). Estradiol alone decreased the concentration of estrogen receptors by 50%, whereas tamoxifen increased the amount of estrogen receptor in the cell lysate by 1.5–2-fold; inclusion of estradiol during cell culture prevented the augmentation by tamoxifen (Fig. 1 A). Analysis by calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography revealed that estradiol treatment did not substantially alter the binding of estrogen receptors to calmodulin (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, 1 μm tamoxifen enhanced binding of the estrogen receptor to calmodulin by 5–10-fold (Fig. 1 B). The enhanced binding induced by tamoxifen is substantially greater than the 1.5–2-fold increase in estrogen receptor content produced by tamoxifen. When cells were treated with both tamoxifen and estradiol, the increased binding of estrogen receptors to calmodulin produced by tamoxifen was attenuated (Fig. 1 B). Under the conditions tested, neither estradiol (data not shown) nor tamoxifen (Fig.2) influenced the amount of calmodulin in the cells nor the amount of calmodulin immunoprecipitated.Figure 2Immunoprecipitation of the estrogen receptor with calmodulin. MCF-7 cells, treated for 16 h with either vehicle or the indicated concentrations of tamoxifen (Tam), were lysed, and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody (panel A) or applied directly to SDS gels (panel B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with anti-estrogen receptor or anti-calmodulin antibody. The positions of migration of the estrogen receptor (ER) and calmodulin (CaM) are indicated.

Leclercq G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the binding of estrogen receptors to endogenous calmodulin in intact cells has not been previously reported. Binding of endogenous calmodulin to the estrogen receptor was revealed by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1 C). Analogous to the data obtained with calmodulin-Sepharose, co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that estradiol did not significantly alter the interaction between the estrogen receptor and calmodulin. Although fewer estrogen receptors co-immunoprecipitated with calmodulin in cells stimulated with estradiol than in control cells (Fig. 1 C, comparelanes 1 and 2), the magnitude of the decrease was similar to that produced by estradiol in cell lysates (Fig.1 A). These data indicate that estradiol does not significantly modulate the binding of the estrogen receptor to calmodulin. By contrast, tamoxifen substantially enhanced in a dose-dependent manner the interaction between calmodulin and the estrogen receptor (Fig. 2 A). The maximum increase was observed at 0.25–0.5 μm tamoxifen. Although tamoxifen also increased the total amount of estrogen receptor in the cells, the magnitude of the increase was substantially less than the magnitude of the increase in the amount of estrogen receptor that co-immunoprecipitated with calmodulin (compare Figs. 2, Aand B). Moreover, the maximum increase in total estrogen receptors was detected at 0.5–1 μm tamoxifen, a concentration slightly higher than that at which maximum binding was observed. Neither the total amount of calmodulin in the cell nor the amount of calmodulin immunoprecipitated was significantly altered by treatment (Fig. 2). To verify that the tamoxifen-induced augmentation of the interaction between calmodulin and the estrogen receptor is direct, in vitro analysis with pure proteins was performed. Pure estrogen receptors were preincubated with tamoxifen or vehicle, followed by incubation with calmodulin. The amount of estrogen receptor that co-immunoprecipitated with calmodulin was increased approximately 2-fold by tamoxifen (Fig. 1 D). Chelation of Ca2+with EGTA revealed that the binding of estrogen receptors to calmodulin is Ca2+-dependent (Fig. 1 D). To examine the function of the interaction of calmodulin with the estrogen receptor, cells were incubated with two structurally distinct, cell-permeable calmodulin antagonists, TFP (29Motohashi N. Anticancer Res. 1991; 11: 1125-1164PubMed Google Scholar) or CGS9343B (30Norman J.A. Ansell J. Stone G.A. Wennogle L.P. Wasley J.W.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 535-540PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure to 10 μmTFP or 40 μm CGS9343B for 16 h reduced the total number of estrogen receptors in the cells to 50% of control and virtually undetectable levels, respectively (Fig.3 A). These concentrations of the antagonists had no effect on cell viability (data not shown). CGS9343B induced a dose-dependent decrease in the number of estrogen receptors; this reduction was not modulated by estradiol (Fig.3 B). The effect of the calmodulin antagonists was specific for estrogen receptors as they did not alter the amount of cellular IQGAP1 (data not shown), a major calmodulin-binding protein in breast epithelial cells (28Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of the antagonists on the interaction between calmodulin and the estrogen receptor, cells were incubated with each calmodulin antagonist for a short time period. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with TFP or CGS9343B for 30 min altered neither the total amount of estrogen receptor nor of calmodulin in the cell lysate (Fig.4 B). By contrast, the amount of estrogen receptor bound to calmodulin was decreased by both TFP and CGS9343B (Fig. 4 A). Compared with vehicle, the relative amount of estrogen receptor that co-immunoprecipitated with calmodulin was 0.42 ± 0.04 and 0.38 ± 0.04 (mean ± S.E.,n = 3; p < 0.001) for TFP and CGS9343B, respectively (Fig. 4 C). Taken together, our data demonstrate that stimulation and inhibition of the interaction of calmodulin with the estrogen receptor increases and reduces the total cellular content of estrogen receptors, respectively. These results indicate that calmodulin influences either the expression or stability of the estrogen receptor. To discriminate between these two possibilities, Northern blot analysis was compared among MCF-7 cells treated for 16 h with vehicle, tamoxifen, or CGS9343B (Fig. 5). Neither compound significantly altered the amount of estrogen receptor mRNA, indicating that calmodulin does not modulate estrogen receptor gene expression. Thus, calmodulin binding most likely stabilizes the estrogen receptor against proteolysis. This hypothesis was evaluated both in vitro with purified proteins and in intact cells. In vitro proteolysis revealed that the estrogen receptor was very sensitive to digestion byl-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. Incubation at 37 °C (1:7 trypsin:estrogen receptor, w/w) resulted in complete disappearance of the full-length receptor within 1 min (data not shown). Analysis at 25 °C with a very low ratio of trypsin to estrogen receptor (1:100, w/w) was required to detect limited proteolysis (Fig. 6). Because Ca2+ regulates the binding of calmodulin to the estrogen receptor (see Fig. 1 D), the effect of calmodulin on proteolysis of the estrogen receptor was performed both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. In the presence of Ca2+, calmodulin reduced the susceptibility of the estrogen receptor to proteolysis by trypsin. The rates of disappearance of intact estrogen receptor and the appearance of degradation products were substantially reduced by Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 6 A). Myoglobin, which has a molecular mass close to that of calmodulin, was used as a control protein. Chelation of Ca2+, which substantially decreases the activity of trypsin (31Burrell M.M. Enzymes of Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar), markedly slowed the rate of digestion of the estrogen receptor (compare the samples with myoglobin in Figs. 6, A and B). In the absence of Ca2+, the protective effect of calmodulin on proteolysis of the estrogen receptor by trypsin was substantially attenuated (Fig.6 B). To further evaluate the ability of calmodulin to protect the estrogen receptor in intact cells, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with a mammalian expression vector directing the expression of wild type calmodulin or a mutant calmodulin that is incapable of binding Ca2+, CaMΔCa (26Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with anti-calmodulin antibodies revealed that the concentration of calmodulin (wild type and mutant) in transfected cells was 1.5–2-fold higher than that in cells transfected with vector alone (Fig.7 A, lower panel). As noted earlier, the binding of calmodulin to the estrogen receptor is dependent upon Ca2+; CaMΔCa should therefore not alter the stability of the estrogen receptor. Probing immunoblots of cell lysates with anti-estrogen receptor antibody demonstrated a 1.69 ± 0.27-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 3) increase in the amount of estrogen receptor in cells overexpressing wild type calmodulin (Fig. 7 A). By contrast, overexpression of CaMΔCa had no effect on the amount of estrogen receptor (Fig.7 A). Targeted expression of an inhibitor peptide derived from myosin light chain kinase can neutralize the function of calmodulin in the nucleus of transiently transfected mammalian cells (27Wang J. Campos B. Jamieson G.A. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30245-30248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of this peptide into MCF-7 cells decreased by ∼50% the total amount of estrogen receptor in the cells after 48 h (Fig. 7 B). Thus, selectively increasing or decreasing the relative amount of functional calmodulin resulted in a concomitant increase and decrease, respectively, of estrogen receptor levels in the cells. Our data clearly document an interaction between endogenous calmodulin and endogenous estrogen receptors in human breast epithelial cells. The binding is regulated by Ca2+, which is required for the interaction. Incubation of MCF-7 cells for 16 h with estradiol or the antiestrogen tamoxifen decreased and increased, respectively, the total amount of estrogen receptor in the cells (see Figs. 1 and 2 and Refs. 32Kiang D.T. Kollander R.E. Thomas T. Kennedy B.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5312-5316PubMed Google Scholar and 33Pink J.J. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2321-2330PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, concentrations of tamoxifen as low as 0.25 μm substantially increased the binding of calmodulin to the estrogen receptor. Tamoxifen acts as a calmodulin antagonist in vitro (34Lam H.-Y.P.

Physical and functional interactions between these families play important roles in modulating gene expression. Previous studies have demonstrated a direct interaction between the DNA-binding domains of the two partners. However, the molecular details of the interactions have not been investigated so far. Here we used the known three-dimensional structures of the ETS DNA-binding domain and Jun/Fos heterodimer to model an ETS-Jun/Fos-DNA ternary complex. Docking procedures suggested that certain ETS domain residues in the DNA recognition helix α3 interact with the N-terminal basic domain of Jun. To support the model, different Erg ETS domain mutants were obtained by deletion or by single amino acid substitutions and were tested for their ability to mediate DNA binding, Erg-Jun/Fos complex formation, and transcriptional activation. We identified point mutations that affect both the DNA binding properties of Erg and its physical interaction with Jun (R367K), as well as mutations that essentially prevent transcriptional synergy with the Jun/Fos heterodimer (Y371V).

The ability of transcription factors to interact specifically with one another, resulting in the formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes, enables the generation of diverse inducible and developmentally regulated programs of gene expression. Biochemical and functional characterization of transcription factor complexes has shown that the structural information necessary for their assembly is provided by both protein-protein and protein-DNA contacts (1Wolberger C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 29-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Particularly, Ets and Jun/Fos family members commonly function as part of the integrated regulatory complexes. For example, complex formation of the Ets protein Elk-1/SAP-1 with the serum responsive factor is critical for the regulation of the c-fos promoter (2Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar); the Ets-related protein GAPBα forms heterotetramers with GABPβ to activate the immediate early promoters of HSV-1 (3LaMarco K.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); and the binding of a Jun/Fos heterodimer along with the nuclear factor of activated T cells to composite elements is critical for the regulation of genes involved in T cell activation (8Chen L. Glover J.N. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The Ets family proteins share a highly conserved 85-amino acid winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (ETS domain) that is able to bind the consensus DNA core sequence 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′ and to engage in protein-protein interactions (9Crépieux P. Coll J. Stéhelin D. Crit. Rev. Oncol. 1995; 5: 615-638Google Scholar, 10Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6514-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The Jun and Fos families consist of related bZIP1proteins that are able to heterodimerize and bind the consensus DNA sequence 5′-TGACTCA-3′ (12Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar). Ets proteins act synergistically with a variety of other transcription factors to regulate many cellular and viral promoters and enhancers (9Crépieux P. Coll J. Stéhelin D. Crit. Rev. Oncol. 1995; 5: 615-638Google Scholar, 10Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.W. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The Jun/Fos heterodimer is one of the well characterized partners of Ets proteins (10Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3261-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These direct protein interactions have been shown to involve the DNA-binding domain of the two partners. However, the amino acid residues critical for these highly intricate interactions have not been precisely mapped so far. Here we studied the molecular contacts between the human Erg protein and the Jun/Fos heterodimer to gain insights into the general mechanisms by which these two families of transcription factors interact to regulate gene expression. In this respect, we used molecular modeling techniques and the available crystal structures of the ETS domain and the Jun/Fos heterodimer complexed to DNA to predict individual residues involved in the Erg-Jun/Fos-DNA ternary complex formation. The selected ETS domain residues were thus mutated and then tested for their ability to support Jun/Fos recruitment in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly two conserved amino acids in the ETS domain (residues Arg367 and Tyr371 in Erg) are required for efficient recruitment of the Jun/Fos heterodimer. Whereas the R367K substitution abolished DNA binding, interaction with Jun, and consequently transcriptional cooperation, the Y371V mutation abrogated interaction with Jun and synergy without abolishing DNA binding. Therefore the structural determinants of Erg that are important for ternary complex assembly are also required for transcriptional synergy. We thus propose that interdependent protein-protein and protein-DNA contacts regulate Erg-Jun/Fos-DNA complex assembly. The functional changes induced by these mutations define the location of a putative conserved Jun binding interface in the ETS domain. The proposed ETS-Jun/Fos-DNA complex model assumes that the recognition consensus DNA sequence 5′-GGAA-3′ of the ETS domain is located upstream from the DNA binding site 5′-TGACTCA-3′ of the Jun/Fos heterodimer, as observed in the polyomavirus enhancer. The aim of this model is to predict protein-protein interactions when the Jun/Fos heterodimer and the ETS domain of Erg are simultaneously bound to their respective DNA targets, as observed on individual crystal structures. This model is based on the x-ray crystallographic coordinates of the Jun/Fos-DNA (Ref. 18Glover J.N. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 1fos) and Elk-1-DNA (Ref. 19Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 1dux) complexes and was built using the molecular modeling software Insight II (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The ETS domains of the Elk-1 and Erg proteins are indeed highly similar, with an overall sequence identity of 55%. The DNA fragment in the Elk-1-DNA complex x-ray structure (19Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) displays an important bending centered on7G; only the part of DNA extending from G at position 7 to T at position 13 (5′-GAAGTGT-3′) and its complementary strand were then considered. Because important conformational rearrangements can occur upon ternary complex formation that remain unpredictable by molecular modeling means, we deliberately used a simple rigid docking approach. First the Jun/Fos heterodimer was replaced at the center of a 30-nucleotide DNA structure adopting a standard double-stranded B-conformation. Then to investigate individual residues that could be involved at the protein-protein interface when Elk-1 and Jun/Fos are simultaneously bound to their DNA targets, we computed all possible overlapping superimpositions of the selected Elk-1-DNA fragment (5′-GAAGTGT-3′) along the 30-nucleotide standard DNA structure with the Jun/Fos heterodimer remaining fixed at its center. The set of atoms used for DNA structure superimpositions were deoxyribose atoms C1′, C2′, C3′, C4′, and O4′. The root mean square values provided were around 1.5 Å. The ETS domain of the Elk-1-DNA complex was thus progressively advanced toward the Jun/Fos heterodimer. From all of the built ETS-Jun/Fos-DNA complexes, only one displays intermolecular contacts without steric clashes between protein backbones (see Fig. 2). Finally, facing the simplicity of the followed strategy, the structures of DNA and proteins being kept rigid, energy minimization was not appropriate in this context. ROS 17.2/8 (rat osteosarcoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The Erg deletion mutant expression vectors (constructs Erg (1) and Erg (307)) have been described previously (17Carrère S. Verger A. Flourens A. Stéhelin D. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3261-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The amino acid substitutions and disrupted ETS domain derivatives were constructed by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate primers flanked by convenient restriction sites. Full details and primer sequences are available on request. Briefly, deletion mutants were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification and subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen). Constructs were then cloned via EcoRI/BglII sites into pSG5 vector for further transcription and translation in vitro. To construct recombinant pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the DNA fragments encoding Jun, DBD, DBD-R367K, DBD-Y371V, and DBD-D374V were first generated by using polymerase chain reaction amplification of pSG5 hu-Jun and pSG5 hu-Ergp55, respectively, and subcloned into pCRII vector. The BamHI/EcoRI (Jun) or EcoRI (DBD) fragments were cloned in-frame into the cloning sites present within the pGEX-2TK polylinker. The amino acid junctions of the GST vector with the Jun or Erg sequences (in bold type) are: GST-Jun, SVGSMTAK; GST-DBD, GRPVYLGSGQ; GST-DBD-R367K, IRPVYLGSGQ; GST-DBD-Y371V, GRPVYLGSGQ; and GST-DBD-D374V, GRPVYLGSGQ. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The day before transfection, ROS 17 2/8 cells were plated at 50–60% confluence in 6-well plates. For transfection, cells were incubated with 1.0 μg of plasmid DNA and 4 μl of polyethyleneimine (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) for 6 h in 1 ml of OptiMEM and then in fresh complete medium. When necessary, pSG5 plasmid was used as a carrier. For reporter assays, detailed transfection conditions are indicated in the relevant figure legend. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity with a Berthold (Nashua, NH) chemioluminometer. Results presented are the means of at least five transfections. In vitro translated proteins were generated with a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro transcription/translation system (TNT/Promega) and labeling with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine/50 μl of reticulocyte lysate. The translation products were visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The bacterial expression of GST constructs and the purification of GST fusion proteins were performed as described (17Carrère S. Verger A. Flourens A. Stéhelin D. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3261-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Expression levels of the various GST fusion proteins were confirmed by Coomassie staining (data not shown) and by Western blot (see Fig. 5 B). For pull-down assays, 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with 1 μg of GST, GST-Jun, GST-DBD, GST-DBD-R367K, GST-DBD-Y371V, or GST-DBD-D374V fusion proteins in NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0, 5% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with incubation buffer (12 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mmNaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA) and resuspended in 30 μl of a mixture containing 35S-labeled protein expressed in reticulocyte lysate and incubation buffer. After 1 h at 4 °C, beads were washed six times with NETN and mixed with SDS sample buffer. The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The DNA binding reaction was performed at room temperature for 30 min in a total volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and 5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). As a probe, we used a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the polyomavirus enhancer (Py) 5′-GATCTTTAAGCAGGAAGTGACTAACTGACCGCAGGTGGATC-3′ or to an ETS consensus (EBS) 5′-GATCTTCGAAACGGAAGTTCGAG-3′ and labeled with [γ-32P]dATP at a concentration of 10,000 cpm/reaction. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 5–10% polyacrylamide gel containing 2% glycerol in TBE buffer. Autoradiography was performed on dry gels using an extra film to quench radioactivity arising from the 35S-labeled proteins. Before electrophoretic mobility shift assay, GST fusion proteins were visualized and quantified by Western blotting. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a Bio-Rad dry blotter using 25 mm Tris-base, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol as the transfer buffer. Membrane was blocked in PBS with 5% (w/v) dry milk for 1.5 h and stained with a rabbit antibody against the ETS domain of the human Erg protein (20Dhordain P. Dewitte F. Desbiens X. Stéhelin D. Duterque- Coquillaud M. Mech. Dev. 1995; 50: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and a secondary goat anti rabbit/peroxidase antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibody incubations were performed for 1.5 h in PBS with 5% (w/v) dry milk followed by four 15-min washes in PBS with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. For detection we used the ECL chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. For transient transfection experiments, cell extracts were prepared from confluent 6-well plates. Cells were washed in cold PBS and harvested with Laemmli SDS sample buffer. Extracts were boiled for 5 min, and samples were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as for GST fusion detection. In our previous study (17Carrère S. Verger A. Flourens A. Stéhelin D. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3261-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we defined functional domains of the Erg transcription factor (Fig.1 A) and showed that Erg sequences 253–472, including the ETS domain, are necessary for Jun/Fos recruitment. To better characterize the Erg sequences important for Jun recruitment and Erg-Jun/Fos-DNA ternary complex assembly, we prepared a recombinant protein, named GST-DBD, comprising the ETS domain of Erg (amino acids 307–392 fused to GST) and Jun/Fos proteins (full-length proteins translated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysates) to perform GST pull-down assay. As shown in Fig.1 B, 35S-labeled Jun (lane 5) and the Jun/Fos heterodimer (lane 6), but not Fos alone (lane 4), bind specifically to immobilized intact GST-DBD but not to GST alone (lanes 7–9). Thus these results suggest that the ETS domain of Erg alone includes minimal sequences for recruiting the Jun/Fos heterodimer in vitro. We then performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the Py, known to contain adjacent EBS and AP-1 binding sites and to bind Ets and Jun/Fos proteins (21Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus we incubated a 32P-labeled Py probe with purified GST recombinant proteins, corresponding to the Erg DNA-binding domain (GST-DBD), and with Jun/Fos proteins cotranslated in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the Py probe formed, in the presence of both Erg-DBD and Jun/Fos proteins, a specific ternary complex that migrated more slowly than the secondary Jun/Fos-Py complex alone (compare lanes 2 and 4). A similar ternary complex was observed with full-length Erg (data not shown). Assembly of the ternary complex required both intact EBS and AP-1 binding sites because mutation of these sequences prevented ternary complex formation (data not shown). To verify that the ternary complex contained both Erg-DBD and the Jun/Fos heterodimer, we incubated the binding reactions with specific antibodies against GST fusion protein or Jun (αGST-IgG and αJun-IgG, respectively). The addition of αJun-IgG abolished formation of the Jun/Fos-Py and Erg-DBD-Jun/Fos-Py complexes but not the Erg-DBD-Py complex (Fig.1 C, lane 5). Conversely αGST-IgG hindered formation of the Erg-DBD-Py and Erg-DBD-Jun/Fos-Py complexes but not the Jun/Fos-Py complex (lane 6). The functional consequences of these physical interactions were then analyzed by transient transfections with a reporter plasmid containing four copies of the polyomavirus enhancer (Fig. 1 D). As expected, cotransfection of Erg and Jun/Fos proteins resulted in a 10-fold transactivation, which revealed a cooperative effect between the two partners. Together these results indicate that Erg and the Jun/Fos heterodimer can form a ternary complex on the adjacent binding sites of the polyomavirus enhancer and that physical interactions between the two proteins contribute to ternary complex assembly. Although we identified the ETS DNA-binding domain as an instrumental scaffold for interaction with the Jun/Fos heterodimer and for transcriptional cooperation, we did not identify amino acids that participate in this mechanism. To make predictions about residues that could be involved in interactions between Erg and the Jun/Fos heterodimer, we modeled an ETS-Jun/Fos-DNA ternary complex (Fig.2) using the available crystal coordinates of the Jun/Fos-DNA (18Glover J.N. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) and Elk-1-DNA complexes (19Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The use of Elk-1-DNA instead of Erg-DNA complexes for which no crystallographic data are as yet available seemed appropriate; there is close similarity in the overall scaffold of the ETS domains because the winged helix-turn-helix motif and DNA-contacting residues are strongly conserved (19Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Pio F. Kodandapani R. Ni C.Z. Shepard W. Klemsz M. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A.

The rigid docking strategy followed to build the ETS-Jun/Fos-DNA ternary complex model is described under “Experimental Procedures.” In our ETS-Jun/Fos-DNA model (Fig. 2), the two protein partners bind to the major groove on opposite sides of the DNA helix, positioning the helix α3 of the ETS domain and the N-terminal part of the Jun basic domain in close proximity. Principally we located Jun residue Lys267 and Elk-1 residues Arg62, Tyr66, and Asp69 conserved in Erg (Arg367, Tyr371, and Asp374) at the protein-protein interface. As observed in the different available crystal structures of ETS-DNA complexes (5Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. de la Brousse F.C. McKnight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 19Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct.

Cell. 1998; 2: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the arginine residue Arg62 (Arg367 in Erg) is involved in hydrogen bonds with the DNA core sequence 5′-GGAA-3′ and seems to be unavailable for supplementary interactions. Moreover the positive charge of its guanidinium group should not allow favorable interactions with the N-terminal basic domain of Jun, which is also positively charged. On the other hand, the phenol ring of Tyr66(Tyr371 in Erg) involved in DNA contacts in the SAP-1-DNA complex structure (24Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) but not in Elk-1-DNA (19Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the carboxylate group of Asp69 (Asp374 in Erg), well accessible at the protein surface, could interact with the basic residue Lys267 of Jun (Fig. 2). However, if Tyr66 is highly conserved within the sequences of the ETS family and may thus be instrumental, Asp69 is frequently mutated (22Pio F. Kodandapani R. Ni C.Z. Shepard W. Klemsz M. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23329-23337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and thus may not play a major role in ETS-Jun/Fos complex formation (see below). Structural studies have revealed that the ETS domain forms a winged helix-turn-helix motif described to fold into a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet with three α-helices (Fig. 3 A), where helix α3 is the major DNA recognition component (19Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Pio F. Kodandapani R. Ni C.Z. Shepard W. Klemsz M. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A.

Cell. 1998; 2: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Our model (Fig. 2) suggests that this helix α3 should also include sequences allowing the recruitment of the Jun/Fos heterodimer. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a set of differentially truncated polypeptides in the ETS domain and expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. We then generated different Erg protein mutants in which either the first helix α1, both helices α1 and α2, or both β3 and β4 β-sheets of the ETS domain were deleted (Fig. 4 A). As previously described (25Siddique H.R. Rao V.N. Lee L. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1751-1755PubMed Google Scholar), the integrity of the 85-amino acid ETS domain is necessary to bind an EBS, whereas Erg proteins lacking N-terminal helix α1, helices α1 and α2, or β3 and β4 β-sheet failed to bind DNA (Fig. 4 B). Strikingly our pull-down assays using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins indicated that the ETS domain retained the ability to interact with GST-Jun (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3, 6,9, 12, 15, and 18), even when the α1 and α2 helices or the β3 and β4 β-sheets had been deleted and the DNA binding had been abolished (Fig. 4, B andC). Interestingly, these results revealed that deletion of the helix α1 did not affect Erg-Jun/Fos interaction, excluding the possibility that the conserved LXXLL motif, a potential protein-protein interface (26Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 27Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), participates in the binding of Jun/Fos. Moreover Erg and Jun proteins could form a complex independently of DNA binding because specific interactions between the Jun/Fos heterodimer and the ETS domain of Erg were also observed in the presence of ethidium bromide (data not shown), which is known to disrupt DNA-protein interactions (28Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Thus although the ETS domain of Erg is the minimal Jun/Fos interaction domain, altering structural features such as the secondary structures can be without effect on the interaction with Jun. We have previously shown that deletion of the whole ETS domain abolishes Jun binding (17Carrère S. Verger A. Flourens A. Stéhelin D. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3261-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consequently all these results point out the DNA recognition helix α3 as the major ETS domain component for interaction with Jun protein.Figure 4Identification of Erg ETS domain regions essential for interaction with Jun/Fos.

Based on our molecular model of the ETS-Jun/Fos-DNA ternary complex, we identified essentially two Erg residues Tyr371 and Asp374 (Tyr66and Asp69 in Elk-1) (Fig. 2). In the x-ray structure of the SAP-1-DNA complex (24Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the tyrosine residue (Tyr371 in Erg) clearly participates in DNA recognition by contacting the thymine located on the complementary strand to the 5′-GGAA-3′ core sequence. However this residue seems not strictly required for DNA binding because its substitution does not always abolish DNA recognition (22Pio F. Kodandapani R. Ni C.Z. Shepard W. Klemsz M. McKercher S.R.

We now show that heat treatment similar to that used for preparation of latent antithrombin also transforms antithrombin to another form, which we denote prelatent, with potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity but with retained proteinase- and heparin-binding properties. The ability of prelatent antithrombin to inhibit angiogenesis is presumably due to a limited conformational change, which may partially resemble that in latent antithrombin. Such a change is evidenced by a different cleavage pattern of prelatent than of native antithrombin by nontarget proteinases. Prelatent antithrombin exerts its anti-angiogenic effect by a similar mechanism as latent antithrombin, i.e. by inhibiting focal adhesion formation and focal adhesion kinase activity, thereby leading to decreased proliferation of endothelial cells. The proteinase inhibitory fractions in commercial antithrombin preparations, which have been heat treated during production, also have anti-angiogenic activity, comparable with that of the prelatent antithrombin form.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries from pre-existing vessels, is important for regulation of many physiological processes, including wound healing, embryogenesis, and female reproductive functions. Deregulation of angiogenesis in diseases such as cancer leads to excessive formation of new blood vessels and tumor progression (1Folkman J. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7209) Google Scholar). A number of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, specifically inhibiting endothelial cell function and thus also tumor expansion, have recently been identified. Many of these inhibitors are derived by modification of abundant proteins which thereby gain new properties,e.g. endostatin, a fragment produced by proteolytic cleavage of collagen XVIII (2O'Reilly M.S.

Antithrombin, a plasma proteinase inhibitor of the serpin superfamily, is the major physiological inhibitor of coagulation serine proteinases, primarily thrombin and factor Xa. The anticoagulant polysaccharide, heparin, accelerates antithrombin inhibition of these enzymes up to 4000-fold by binding and activating the inhibitor by means of a specific pentasaccharide sequence (4Björk I.

Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 188-204PubMed Google Scholar). Like all serpins, antithrombin traps its target proteinases by exposing a reactive bond, located in a surface loop (Fig. 1) (6Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), to the enzyme, which initially cleaves this bond as a normal substrate (4Björk I. Olson S.T.

Serpins: Structure, Function, and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin1996Google Scholar). The opening of the reactive-bond loop at the acyl-intermediate stage of this cleavage, however, causes the N-terminal segment of the loop to rapidly insert as a middle strand into the main β-sheet, the A sheet, of the serpin. The proteinase, which is still attached to this segment by an acyl bond, is thereby translocated to the other end of the inhibitor and concurrently inactivated by distortion of the active site structure (8Lawrence D.A.

Full proteolytic cleavage of the reactive-bond loop of antithrombin by target or nontarget proteinases converts the inhibitor to an inactive form with low heparin affinity, in which the cleaved loop is inserted into the A sheet in a similar manner as in the proteinase complexes (Fig. 1) (13Björk I. Fish W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9487-9493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mourey L. Samama J.-P. Delarue M. Petitou M. Choay J. Moras D. J. Mol.

Heat treatment transforms antithrombin to another inactive, low heparin affinity form, denoted latent, in which the intact reactive-bond loop is analogously inserted into the A sheet (Fig. 1) (6Carrell R.W.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Both cleaved and, more potently, latent antithrombin have recently been found to possess anti-angiogenic properties that are not shown by the native inhibitor (16O'Reilly M.S. Pirie-Shepherd S. Lane W.S. Folkman J. Science. 1999; 285: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 17Larsson H. Sjöblom T. Dixelius J. Östman A. Björk I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6723-6729PubMed Google Scholar). These properties presumably are due to the conformational changes caused by loop insertion exposing certain epitopes that interact with appropriate endothelial cell membrane components. Antithrombin-proteinase complexes may have similar anti-angiogenic activity, although this possibility has not been investigated. Latent antithrombin has been shown to exert its anti-angiogenic effect by inducing apoptosis of endothelial cells, caused by disruption of cell-matrix interactions through uncoupling of focal adhesion kinase (17Larsson H. Sjöblom T. Dixelius J. Östman A. Björk I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6723-6729PubMed Google Scholar). Due to its anti-angiogenic activity, latent antithrombin efficiently inhibited tumor growth in mouse models (16O'Reilly M.S. Pirie-Shepherd S. Lane W.S. Folkman J. Science. 1999; 285: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar,17Larsson H. Sjöblom T. Dixelius J. Östman A. Björk I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6723-6729PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we show that heat treatment similar to that used for preparation of latent antithrombin converts native antithrombin to a form with potent anti-angiogenic and tumor inhibitory activity but, unlike latent antithrombin, with retained ability to bind proteinases and heparin. A different proteinase cleavage pattern of this form than of native antithrombin indicates that a limited conformational change has been induced by the heat treatment. The anti-angiogenic activity is presumably due to this conformational change, which may be related to that in latent antithrombin. We therefore tentatively denote the new antithrombin form as prelatent. We also show that the fractions with proteinase inhibiting activity in commercial antithrombin preparations, which have undergone heat treatment as a viral inactivation step during production, have anti-angiogenic activity similar to the novel prelatent form. Human α-antithrombin was purified from plasma by affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose, followed by anion-exchange chromatography (18Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D.

Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Animal work was carried out at the animal facility of the Biomedical Center, Uppsala University, and was approved by the local board of animal experimentation and thus performed according to the United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research guidelines for the welfare of animals in experimental neoplasia (28Workman P. Balmain A. Hickman J.A. McNally N.J. Rohas A.M. Mitchison N.A. Pierrepoint C.G. Raymond R. Rowlatt C. Stephens T.C. Wallace J. Straughan D.W. Lab. Anim. 1988; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Female, 6-week-old C57BL6/J mice (M & B A/S, Ry, Denmark) were acclimatized and caged in groups of five and were fed a diet of animal chow and drinking water ad libitum. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Forene; Abbott, Solna, Sweden) during all manipulations. T241 fibrosarcoma cells (0.5 × 106 cells in a volume of 50 μl) were injected subcutaneously into the left flank of each mouse. Animals carrying palpable tumors within 4 days after injection were randomized and received treatment with 1 mg/kg/day of native antithrombin, prelatent antithrombin, or buffer (0.02 m phosphate, 0.1m NaCl, pH 7.4), given as daily subcutaneous injections in the right flank for 10 days. The tumors were measured once a day in a double-blind procedure, and tumor volumes were calculated by the formula: Π/6 × width2 × length. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA. The mice were sacrificed at the end of the treatment. The porcine aortic endothelial cell line overexpressing fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (PAE/FGFR-1 cells) (29Wennström S. Landgren E. Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13749-13756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Täby, Sweden), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies). PAE/FGFR-1 cells were seeded into 24-well dishes (2 × 104 cells/well). After 4 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum, and the cells were incubated for an additional 12 h. At this time, FGF-2 (20 ng/ml), native antithrombin (1 μg/ml), or prelatent antithrombin (1 μg/ml) alone or FGF-2 together with native or prelatent antithrombin at these concentrations were added, and the incubation was continued. The same additions were then made after an additional 2 days. Cell numbers were scored in a Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics, Luton, UK) after a total of 5 days of incubation. All experiments were performed in triplicate. PAE/FGFR-1 cells were serum-starved overnight and preincubated for 4 h at 37 °C with native or prelatent antithrombin (3 μg/ml). The cells were then washed and stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C with FGF-2 (100 ng/ml), native antithrombin (3 μg/ml), or prelatent antithrombin (3 μg/ml) alone or with FGF-2 in combination with native or prelatent antithrombin at these concentrations. The cells were lysed in 0.02m Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% (w/w) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 1% (w/w) aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. The precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a Hybond-C Extra (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was treated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and immunoreactive proteins were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system based on a protocol described earlier (30Matthews J.A. Batki A. Hynds C. Kricka L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Stoichiometries of full-length heparin binding and affinities of full-length heparin or pentasaccharide binding to native and prelatent antithrombin were measured at 25.0 ± 0.2 °C by titrations of the antithrombin forms with the saccharides, as described previously (18Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 31Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10196-10204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The titrations were monitored by the increase in tryptophan fluorescence that accompanies the interaction (33Nordenman B. Danielsson Å. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Stoichiometries of inhibition of α-thrombin by native and prelatent antithrombin were determined by titrating the enzyme with the inhibitor forms and measuring the residual enzyme activity with a chromogenic substrate, as detailed previously (18Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 32Arocas V. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10196-10204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Second-order rate constants for inhibition of α-thrombin or factor Xa by the two antithrombin forms alone and in complex with full-length heparin or pentasaccharide were measured at 25.0 ± 0.2 °C under pseudo-first order conditions with catalytic amounts of the saccharides, as in earlier work (18Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 31Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I.

Circular dichroism spectra in the far-ultraviolet wavelength region (200–250 nm) of native and prelatent antithrombin were measured at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C) in 0.02 m sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, with a Jasco J-41A spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo, Japan). The measurements were done with a band width of 2 nm in cells with 0.1-cm path lengths and with protein concentrations of 0.2 mg/ml. Mean residue ellipticities were calculated from a mean residue weight of 113 (34Bock S.C. Wion K.L. Vehar G.A. Lawn R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 8113-8125Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Native and prelatent antithrombin (1 mg/ml) were digested at 37 °C with chymotrypsin (Type VII; Sigma-Aldrich), thermolysin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or subtilisin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 90–120 min at weight ratios of enzyme to antithrombin of 1:25–1:50 in 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4. The buffer also contained 5, 2, and 50 mmCaCl2 in the case of chymotrypsin, thermolysin, and subtilisin, respectively. The digestions with chymotrypsin and subtilisin were stopped by addition of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to 200 μm, whereas the thermolysin digestion was stopped with 4 mm EDTA. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the gels were stained or electroblotted to a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane (Qiabrane PVDF; Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, appropriate bands were excised and the N-terminal sequences of the polypeptides were analyzed directly in an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 470A gas phase sequencer, connected on-line to a 120A PTH analyzer. Plasma antithrombin was incubated for 24 h at 60 °C in the presence of citrate at pH 7.4, as in the procedure for isolation of latent antithrombin (15Wardell M.R. Chang W.S.W. Bruce D. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose with NaCl gradient elution gave two major peaks (Fig. 2),viz. latent antithrombin, eluting at about 0.3 mNaCl (15Wardell M.R. Chang W.S.W. Bruce D. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and an antithrombin form eluting at about 1.0 mNaCl, i.e. at a similar position as native antithrombin. As detailed below, further characterization of this form showed that it differed from native antithrombin in anti-angiogenic and certain biochemical properties in a manner that prompted us to denote it as prelatent. Prelatent antithrombin had the same mobility as native antithrombin in PAGE under nondenaturing conditions (not shown), as well as in SDS-PAGE under both nonreducing (not shown) and reducing (Fig. 3) conditions. No aggregates were seen in PAGE under nondenaturing conditions. Re-chromatography on heparin-agarose showed no detectable contamination by latent antithrombin.Figure 3SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions of native and prelatent antithrombin digested with proteinases.

Filter discs were saturated with a constant amount of FGF-2 alone or together with different amounts of native or prelatent antithrombin. The discs were applied to the CAM, and the development of new blood vessels was analyzed after 3 days. Prelatent antithrombin efficiently inhibited FGF-2-induced angiogenesis at an equimolar dose, although not in a 10-fold lower amount (Fig. 4, TableI). In contrast, native antithrombin did not appreciably affect neovascularization even at a 10-fold higher level than the lowest effective amount of prelatent antithrombin.Table IEffect of native and prelatent antithrombin on chick CAM angiogenesis induced by FGF-2StimulatorAntithrombinAmount of antithrombinAngiogenesis scoreNo. of embryosμgBufferNone01.29FGF-2None03.09FGF-2Native32.79FGF-2Prelatent0.032.55FGF-2Prelatent0.31.35FGF-2Prelatent11.35FGF-2Prelatent31.29FGF-2 (0.2 μg/filter) was added without or with native or prelatent antithrombin at the doses indicated in 0.02 m phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4.

The possibility that prelatent antithrombin might affect tumor growth due to its anti-angiogenic properties was studied in a mouse fibrosarcoma model. C57BL6/J mice were inoculated with T241 fibrosarcoma tumor cells subcutaneously in the left flank. Treatment by daily injections of native antithrombin, prelatent antithrombin, or buffer in the right flank was initiated when the mice had palpable tumors and continued for 10 days. The tumor volume in animals treated with prelatent antithrombin was significantly reduced to 25% of that in animals treated with buffer (Fig. 5). Native antithrombin had an appreciably smaller effect on tumor growth, and the decrease in tumor volume was not significant. The effect of prelatent antithrombin on endothelial cell proliferation was examined by culturing PAE/FGFR-1 cells together with FGF-2 and in the presence and absence of native or prelatent antithrombin. FGF-2 treatment induced an increase in the number of cells after 5 days of culture to ∼150% compared with the control cultures (Fig.6). The increase in cell number in cultures treated with FGF-2 together with prelatent antithrombin was significantly lower, whereas prelatent antithrombin had no effect in the absence of the growth factor. In contrast, native antithrombin did not affect the FGF-2-induced increase in endothelial cell number. Latent antithrombin has previously been shown to inhibit angiogenesis by impeding focal adhesion formation and FAK activity (17Larsson H. Sjöblom T. Dixelius J. Östman A. Björk I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6723-6729PubMed Google Scholar). A possible similar effect of prelatent antithrombin was investigated by stimulating PAE/FGFR-1 cells with FGF-2 in the presence and absence of native or prelatent antithrombin. The activity state of FAK was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of FAK, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Incubation of the cells with prelatent antithrombin, but not with native antithrombin, was found to markedly reduce the FGF-2-induced FAK activity (Fig.7). Titrations, monitored by the increase in tryptophan fluorescence induced by heparin binding, at high antithrombin concentrations showed that prelatent antithrombin bound full-length heparin (containing ∼26 saccharide units) with a stoichiometry of 1.0 ± 0.05, identical to the binding stoichiometry of native antithrombin (18Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 33Nordenman B. Danielsson Å. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Heparin induced the same about 40% enhancement of tryptophan fluorescence in prelatent as in native antithrombin (18Olson S.T.

For example, corepressors N-CoR/SMRT recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 to remove specific acetyl groups from histone proteins of specific gene-regulatory regions. As a result, chromatin is packed, and gene activity is repressed (13Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.-M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.-M. Brard G. Ngo D. Davie J.R. Seto E.

Upon ligand binding to receptors, the AF-2 domain (helix 12) is repositioned, corepressors are released, and coactivators are recruited to activate target gene expression. One mechanism of gene activation is believed to be mediated by relaxation of chromatin due to the action of acetyltransferase encoded by the coactivator complexes. It was first suggested that the molecular basis underlying nuclear receptor interaction with coactivators involved a signature motif LXXLL (L is a leucine, and X is any amino acid) present in many coactivators (7Torchia J.

By studying the x-ray crystal structure of a ternary complex formed by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, the ligand, and an 88-amino acid peptide of coactivator SRC-1, it was found that a charge clamp was formed on the ligand-binding domain of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor that made a direct contact with the backbone atoms of the LXXLL helices of SRC-1 (19Darimont B.D.

Later, it was shown that aporeceptor interaction with corepressor involved a CoRNR box (L/IXXI/VI) (L is a leucine, I is an isoleucine, V is a valine, and X is any amino acid) found in corepressors such as N-CoR and SMRT. However, in competition experiments, CoRNR peptides were able to block both corepressor and coactivator interaction with nuclear receptors (22Hu X. Laza M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), suggesting that a similar and probably overlapping receptor-interaction motif is present in coactivators and corepressors. Furthermore, by studying mutant receptors and corepressors, it was found that mutations in nuclear receptor residues that directly participated in coactivator binding disrupted their interaction with corepressors (23Nagy L. Kao H.-H. Love J.D. Li C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 24Perissi V.

It was then suggested that a consensus LXXI/HIXXXI/L sequence of corepressors is an extended helix compared with the LXXLL helix found in coactivators, and both helices were able to interact with nuclear receptors in the same receptor pocket (24Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lamber M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfel M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar).

However, the mouse RIP140 was characterized in this laboratory as a potent corepressor for orphan nuclear receptor TR2 in the absence of putative ligands (26Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol.

Later, we demonstrated a strong ligand-dependent interaction of RIP140 with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), mediated by a C-terminal segment of RIP140 (27Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31320-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two unique features of RIP140 are: (a) in contrast to classical coactivators that interact with ligand-bound hormone receptors to activate target gene expression, RIP140 suppressed gene activation by interacting with ligand-bound nuclear receptors in most reported studies (28Chuang F.M. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Schaufele F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1332-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Miyata K.S. McCaw S.E. Meertens L.M. Patel H.V. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28371-28377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and (b) the ligand-dependent receptor-interacting motif of RIP140 does not involve any of its nine copies of the LXXLL motif, rather it utilizes its C-terminal domain for holo-RAR/RXR interaction and N-terminal amino acids (AA) 154–350 for Ah receptor interaction (26Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32Kumar M.B. Tarpey R.W. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22155-22164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This first aim of this study was to dissect the LXXLL-less motif of RIP140 that interacts with ligand-bound RAR/RXR. This motif was determined by using different molecular approaches, including two-hybrid interaction, coimmunoprecipitation, and GST pull-down assays. The functional role of this motif in the suppressive effects of RIP140 on RA induction of target gene expression was demonstrated in mutation studies. Finally, association of HDAC3, RIP140, and RAR/RXR was demonstrated to be ligand-dependent in coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and histone acetylation decreased on the promoter region carrying a RA response element in the presence of RIP140. These data provided a molecular explanation for the action of RIP140 as a novel ligand-dependent negative modulator of RA-regulated gene expression. RIP140 and its deletions were each fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain of pM vector (CLONTECH) to dissect the interacting domain by either restriction digestion or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of RIP140 cDNA. Full-length RIP (RIP-F), N-terminal domain AA 1–496 (RIP-N), central portion AA 496–1006 (RIP-cent), and C-terminal domain AA 977–1118 (RIP-C) were described previously (26Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). R-18 was made by HindIII digestion of RIP-C, R-19 was made by SmaI digestion of R-18, and R-20 to R-32 were made by PCR cloning. The ligand-binding domain of RAR and RXR was fused to the pVP16 vector (CLONTECH) for the two-hybrid test, and the reporter (Gal4-luc) and techniques for culturing COS-1 cells, transfection, and luciferase and lacZ assays were as described previously (26Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing dextran charcoal-treated serum. all-trans-RA (at-RA) and 9-cis-RA were each added at a final concentration of 5 × 10−7m. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. At least three independent experiments were conducted to obtain the mean and the S.E. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with RIP140 (wild type mutant L-384 as described later or an empty vector), RARα, RXRβ, and FLAG-tagged HDAC3 (33Wei L.-N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Rarooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with vehicle or at-RA (1 μm) 24 h after transfection and harvested 24 h later for resuspension in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were sonicated twice in 20-s pulses on ice, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipiation, 150–200 μl of total lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 3 h, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein G-agarose resin (Sigma), continued incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, and washing with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline. Beads were resuspended in loading buffer for separation on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with anti-RIP140 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-RARα or anti-RXRβ (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). After washing, blots were incubated with a secondary antibody against the species from which the primary antibody was derived, followed by extensive washing and detection with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST pull-down assay was conducted as described previously (24Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lamber M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfel M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Various RIP140 segments as shown in Fig. 2 A were cloned by transferring each corresponding fragment of RIP140 dissected from the pM fusions to a GST vector (26Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). R-33, R-34, R-35, R-36, and R-37 were derived from R-18, R-20, R-21, R-28, and R-31, respectively. Full-length RAR and RXR were expressed from T7 promoter and labeled with [35S]methionine where indicated using a TNT kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Escherichia coli BL21 transformed with the GST-fusion vectors was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, and fusion proteins were purified from glutathione-Sepharose columns. The partially purified GST-RIP fusion protein was incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled RAR or RXR in the presence of unlabeled receptor partner. RA was added at a concentration of 10−6m. Peptide LTKTNPILYYMLQK (RIP140 amino acid 1063–1076) of either l- ord-amino acids was synthesized and purified by the microchemical facility of the University of Minnesota. The expression vectors for RAR, RXR, and full-length RIP140 were as described previously (26Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mutant RIP140 (L-384) with only the receptor-interacting motif (AA 1063–1076) deleted was made by ligating the AA 1077–1118 fragment to AA 1–1063 of RIP140. Reporter carrying a direct repeat 5 (DR5)-tk-luc and tests of RA induction in the COS-1 system were as described previously (26Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with the DR5-tk reporter, RAR, and RXR expression vectors, and either a CMV-driven wild type RIP140 expression vector, the L-384 mutant, or an empty vector. The ChIP assay (33Wei L.-N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Rarooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). After transfection for 24 h, cellular histone was cross-linked to DNA by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1%. Precipitated chromatin was incubated with an anti-acetylated histone 3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C, treated with proteinase K, and purified by phenol extraction. For PCR detection of precipitated chromatin DNA, primers for the tk promoter region (130 base pairs) following the DR5 site were 5′-AGCGTCTTGTCATTGGCG-3′ and 5′-TTAAGCGGGTCGCTGCAG-3′. Control PCRs to amplify the CMV promoter were conducted by using primers 5′-CTGACCGCCCAACGAC-3′ and 5′-GACTAATACGTAGATG-3′, which allowed the CMV promoter region to be amplified in the size of 255 base pairs. Previously, we have confirmed that RIP140 interaction with RAR and RXR depends upon the presence of ligands and utilizes a small C-terminal segment of RIP140 that lacks a typical LXXLL motif (27Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31320-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular basis of this ligand-dependent RIP140 interaction with RAR and RXR, we first utilized mammalian two-hybrid interaction tests. As shown in Fig. 1, pM-RIP140 interaction with pVP-RAR or pVP-RXR + RAR is mediated by the C-terminal segment between AA 977 and AA 1161, and this interaction is dependent upon the presence of ligand (at-RA for pM-RAR and at-RA + 9-cis-RA for pM-RXR + RAR (Fig. 1 B, columns 1–3)). The C-terminal segment was further deleted from AA 1118 to AA 1161, resulting in R-18, which maintained a very similar pattern of interaction (Fig. 1 B, column 4). R-18 was further deleted to retain only AA 977–1006 (R-19), 977–1033 (R-21), and 977–1076 (R-20). Among these deletions, only R-20 was able to interact with RAR/RXR (Fig. 1 B, column 6), indicating that the interacting motif was located between AA 1033 and AA 1076. To confirm this result, 5′ deletions were made from R-18 to generate R-22 and R-23, which retained AA 1023–1118 and AA 1084–1118, respectively. As predicted, R-22 (Fig. 1 B, column 8) but not R-23 was able to interact with RAR/RXR, suggesting that the interacting motif resides in the central portion of R-18. This was supported by the positive result for construct R-24, which contained only AA 1023–1076 (Fig. 1 B, column 10). Further deletions from the 3′-end to generate R-25 (AA 1023–1063) and R-27 (AA 977–1063) abolished interaction. However, 5′ deletions of R-24 to generate R-26 (AA 1047–1076) and R-28 (AA 1063–1076) did not affect the interaction (Fig. 1 B, columns 12 and 14). R-28 was the smallest clone that remained fully functional to interact with RAR/RXR. This was confirmed by the positive results of two constructs containing this region (R-29 and R-30) and the negative results of further deletions (R-31 (AA 1069–1076; Fig. 1 B, column 17) and R-32 (AA 1069–1076)). The pattern of interaction with pM-RXR + RAR in the presence of 9-cis-RA alone was very similar to that of at-RA + 9-cis-RA (data not shown). Based on these results, it is concluded that RIP140 interacts with RAR and RXR in a ligand-dependent manner, and the interaction with liganded RAR and RXR is mediated by a small C-terminal peptide sequence (LTKTNPILYYMLQK) from AA 1063 to AA 1076. To confirm the ligand-dependent RAR/RXR-interacting motif of RIP140,in vitro interaction tests based on GST pull-down assays were performed. In these tests, RIP140 portions were expressed as GST fusions, and RAR/RXR was expressed in TNT, with either one labeled with [35S]methionine. Fig.2 A shows the maps of the representative clones, Fig. 2 B shows the GST pull-down experiments that utilized labeled RAR, and Fig. 2 C shows the Coomassie Blue-stained gel separating partially purified RIP fragments (labeled with asterisks on the right). As shown in Fig. 2 B, all the clones that contain AA 1063–1076,i.e. R-33, R-34, and R-36, interacted with RAR/RXR in the presence of at-RA, whereas clones in which this motif was deleted, i.e. R-35 and R-37, failed the test. This result further supports the notion that RIP140 interacts with holo-RAR/RXR through C-terminal AA sequence 1063–1076 and that the interaction requires ligand binding to one molecule of the receptor dimer. To confirm the specificity of this peptide sequence in mediating RIP140 interaction with RAR, peptide competition was conducted in GST pull-down assays using the smallest RIP140 clone (R-36), as shown in Fig. 3 A. Peptide was added at a concentration range of 2–20 μm, and either RAR (top) or RXR (bottom) was labeled in the receptor input. The specific bands pulled-down by R-36 for either RAR-labeled or RXR-labeled receptor dimer were effectively competed out by the addition of 2 μm peptide. At a concentration of 20 μm, this peptide was able to compete with R-36 for more than 90%. To further substantiate the specificity in the competition experiment, a peptide with the same sequence ofd-amino acids was tested in parallel, as shown in Fig.3 B. The l-peptide successfully competed in this experiment (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), whereas thed-peptide failed to compete even at a concentration as high as 100 μm (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). Therefore, it is concluded that the C-terminal AA 1063–1076 sequence of RIP140 is a ligand-dependent, specific RAR/RXR-interacting motif. The biological activity of RIP140 in hormone receptor actions has been controversial. In the RAR/RXR system, we have consistently observed a ligand-dependent interaction of RIP140 with RAR and RXR heterodimers, which resulted in strongly suppressed RA induction of reporter activities (27Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31320-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction of RAR/RXR is required for the biological activity of RIP140, represented as suppression of RA-induced reporter activity, a mutant RIP140 (L-384) was constructed in which region AA 1063–1076 was specifically deleted. Transfection experiments were conducted to determine RA induction of reporter activities in the presence of RIP140 or this mutant, as shown in Fig.4. Consistent with our previous observations, RA induced reporter activities >50-fold (Fig. 4,columns 1 and 2). In the presence of wild type RIP140, the basal level reporter activity remained the same in the absence of RA (column 3), but RA-induced reporter activity decreased >20-fold (column 4). In contrast, the mutant, L-384, failed to effectively suppress RA induction (columns 5 and 6). This result confirmed that the suppressive effect of RIP140 on RA reporters was mediated by its direct interaction with RAR/RXR through the C-terminal AA 1063–1076 sequence in a ligand-dependent manner. Previously, we have demonstrated a direct interaction of RIP140 with HDAC3 and that the immunoprecipitates of anti-RIP140 encode HDAC activity (33Wei L.-N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Rarooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We have therefore hypothesized that RIP140 could function as a novel ligand-dependent corepressor for nuclear receptor actions by recruiting HDAC to nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent manner. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether HDAC3 can form immunocomplexes with RIP140 and RAR/RXRin vivo, and whether the formation of these complexes is ligand-dependent. COS-1 cells were transfected with expression vectors for RIP140 (wild type mutant L-384 or an empty vector), FLAG-HDAC3, RARα, and RXRβ. Anti-FLAG antibody was used to precipitate proteins complexed with HDAC3. As shown in Fig.5, RARα (Fig. 5 A, lane 4), RXRβ (Fig. 5 B, lane 4), and RIP140 (Fig. 5 C, lane 4) were all detected in immunocomplexes in the presence of at-RA. In the absence of RA, these proteins were either absent or detected at a negligible level (lane 6 of Fig. 5, A–C). To confirm the specificity of RIP140 action in facilitating the formation of these immunocomplexes, two control experiments were conducted by using either the L-384 mutant RIP140 that had a deletion in its C-terminal motif (lane 5) or an empty vector (no RIP140,lane 8). Under either condition, immunocomplex formation was much less efficient, as shown in the much reduced level of RAR (Fig.5 A), RXR (Fig. 5 B), and RIP140 (Fig.5 C) in the precipitates. To monitor the efficiency of protein expression in these cultures, total lysates were examined on the same blots for the expression of each component as shown onlanes 1–3 and 7. This result strongly supports our hypothesis that RIP140 facilitates immunocomplex formation of HDAC3 with RAR/RXR in the presence of RA and that the C-terminal receptor-interacting motif of RIP140 is required for this activity. Our demonstrations of HDAC activity in the immunoprecipitates of anti-RIP140 (33Wei L.-N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Rarooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and RA-induced complex formation of RIP140, HDAC3, and holo-RAR/RXR (Fig. 5) predict decreased acetylation of chromatin histones around the promoter region of RAR/RXR target genes in the presence of RIP140 and RA. To test this possibility, we employed ChIP assays by using a classical DR5-tk reporter as a model, which was also used to examine the biological activity of RIP140 on RA-regulated target gene expression (Fig. 4). In this assay, acetylated chromatin can be precipitated with anti-acetylated histone 3, and the precipitated DNA fragments can be detected by PCR. On the contrary, hypoacetylated chromatin is precipitated less efficiently; therefore, less DNA is amplified. As shown in the top panel of Fig.6 A, an expected 130-base pair fragment can be amplified efficiently from cells transfected with the control vector (lane 1) but not from cells cotransfected with RIP140 (lane 2), indicating a decrease in acetylation on the tk promoter region regulated by the DR5 element. The negative controls in which a nonspecific rabbit antiserum was used are shown inlanes 3 and 4. Two positive controls of input DNA are shown in lanes 5 and 6. Lane 7shows a negative control of water, and lane 8 shows a positive control of plasmid DNA. For an internal control of this assay, the acetylation status of the CMV promoter used in the expression vector was monitored in parallel experiments as shown in thebottom panel of Fig. 6 B. Because no DR5 is present in the CMV promoter-driven expression vector, this promoter is highly acetylated and is therefore amplified efficiently, regardless of the presence or absence of RIP140 (lanes 1 and2). To confirm the specificity of RIP140 effects, ChIP assay was conducted by using various concentrations of RIP140 expression vector and the L-384 mutant as shown in Fig. 6 B. Deacetylation of the promoter (top panel) occurs in the presence of wild type RIP140 in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 1–4), whereas the promoter remains acetylated at the same level in the presence of mutant RIP140 (lane 5) and the control (lane 1). The second panel shows input DNA, thethird panel shows nonspecific IgG control, and thebottom panel shows a Western blot of transfected RIP140 expression in these cultures. These results clearly show the specificity of hypoacetylation on the promoter containing the DR5 element as a result of expression of wild type RIP140/RAR/RXR in the presence of RA, but not in the presence of mutant RIP140 with the C-terminal receptor-interacting motif deleted. It is concluded that the coimmunoprecipitated complex of RIP140, holo-RAR/RXR, and HDAC3 is correlated with decreased histone acetylation on the promoter driven by the RAR/RXR target element DR5 and that the C-terminal receptor-interacting motif of RIP140 is required for this activity. This study demonstrates a novel holo-RAR/RXR-interacting motif (LTKTNPILYYMLQK) of RIP140, which diverts from the reported LXXLL box found in coactivators or the CoRNR box (L/IXXI/VI) found in corepressors. This motif mediates strong ligand-dependent interaction of RIP140 with RAR/RXR as demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivoprotein interaction tests. Interaction of RIP140 with RAR/RXR results in suppressed RA induction of target gene expression, and the presence of this motif in RIP140 is essential for this biological activity. RIP140 and RAR/RXR can be efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with HDAC3 in the presence of RA but are less efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with HDAC3 in its absence. RAR/RXR cannot be coprecipitated efficiently with HDAC3 with expression of the C-terminal motif-deleted RIP140 or without expression of RIP140, suggesting a role of this C-terminal motif of RIP140 in enhancing RA-induced molecular interactions among these proteins. Finally, expression of wild type RIP140 but not mutant RIP140 dose-dependently renders hypoacetylation of the promoter region of RA target gene in the presence of RA, suggesting recruitment of HDAC3 by the RIP140/RAR/RXR complex to the RA-responsive promoter in a ligand-dependent manner. However, it remains to be determined whether the recruitment of HDAC3 to the RA-responsive promoter and the repression of gene expression as a result of RIP140 expression also occur for endogenous gene promoters and whether other HDACs can also be recruited by RIP140/RAR/RXR complexes. RIP140 is able to interact with numerous nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent manner in the case of hormone receptors and in a ligand-independent manner in the case of orphan receptors. However, the receptor-interacting domain of RIP140 varies among different receptor systems. For instance, its interaction with orphan receptor TR2 utilizes various portions of the molecule that contain the LXXLL motif (26Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas its interaction with holo-RAR/RXR utilizes the novel motif present in its C terminus. Whereas it has been demonstrated that its interaction with other hormone receptors can be mediated by its nine LXXLL motifs, the evidence for this type of interaction is less compelling. In our two-hybrid interaction tests, we occasionally detected a very low level of interaction in the absence of ligand; however, this detection system can be complicated by the nuclear environment of the cell types used and the activity of reporter. The ligand-dependent enhancement of RIP140 interaction with RAR/RXR through the LXXLL-less motif is significant and represents a novel example of holo-receptor interaction with its coregulator. Structural studies are required to resolve the molecular basis of this interaction. The biological role of RIP140 has been debated because variable results have been presented in different studies. Whereas the initial study suggested a coactivator function of RIP140 in a chimeric estrogen receptor system (25Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), many later studies from different laboratories have demonstrated RIP140 as a corepressor or negative coregulator (28Chuang F.M. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Schaufele F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1332-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Miyata K.S. McCaw S.E. Meertens L.M. Patel H.V. Mol. Cell.

Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Later, we found that RIP140 expression also suppressed RA induction of target gene, despite its ligand-dependent interaction with RAR/RXR (27Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31320-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated a direct association of RIP140 with HDAC3 through its N-terminal domain and that the immunoprecipitated complexes pulled out with anti-RIP140 encode HDAC activity (33Wei L.-N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Rarooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The current study extends the findings of these previous studies and provides strong evidence for a suppressive role of RIP140 in RA-mediated gene expression. A molecular explanation for the negative role of RIP140 in RA signaling pathways is presented,i.e. the recruitment of HDAC3 by RIP140/RAR/RXR complex to RA-responsive promoters in a RA-dependent manner. This view contradicts the central dogma that ligand induces association of holo nuclear receptors with coactivators that encode histone acetyltransferase activity. The fact that the novel receptor-interacting motif of RIP140 diverts from the classical LXXLL box found in coactivators and the CoRNR box found in corepressors may explain the unique feature of RIP140. It will be interesting to examine how RIP140, as compared with other coactivators, interacts with holo-RAR/RXR. RIP140 represents the first negative cofactor for nuclear receptors that acts in a ligand-dependent manner. Exactly how this observation can be translated into a specific biological event remains to be explored. It is noted that a number of studies have reported negative regulation of gene expression by a direct effect of RA on certain RA response elements found in the parathyroid hormone-related protein gene, the thyrotropin-β gene, and the mouse Oct-3/4 gene (18Pikarsky E. Sharir H. Ben-Shushan E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1026-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Abe M. Akeno N. Ohida S. Horiuchi N. J.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), etc. It is tempting to speculate a role of RIP140 on specific gene suppression mediated by the direct action of RA-bound RAR/RXR in certain cell types or under specific conditions. It would be interesting to examine the difference in receptor conformation when complexed with a typical corepressor, coactivator, or a novel coregulator like RIP140."
https://openalex.org/W1998102354,"The C1 domains of conventional and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms bind diacylglycerol and phorbol esters with high affinity. Highly conserved hydrophobic residues at or near the rim of the binding cleft in the second cysteine-rich domain of PKC-δ (PKC-δC1b) were mutated to probe their roles in ligand recognition and lipid interaction. [3H]Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) binding was carried out both in the presence and absence of phospholipids to determine the contribution of lipid association to the ligand affinity. Lipid dependence was determined as a function of lipid concentration and composition. The binding properties of a high affinity branched diacylglycerol with lipophilicity similar to PDBu were compared with those of PDBu to identify residues important for ligand selectivity. As expected, Leu-20 and Leu-24 strongly influenced binding. Substitution of either by aspartic acid abolished binding in either the presence or absence of phosphatidylserine. Mutation of Leu-20 to Arg or of Leu-24 to Lys caused a dramatic (340- and 250-fold, respectively) reduction in PDBu binding in the presence of lipid but only a modest reduction in the weaker binding of PDBu observed in the absence of lipid, suggesting that the main effect was on C1 domain -phospholipid interactions. Mutation of Leu-20 to Lys or of Trp-22 to Lys had modest (3-fold) effects and mutation of Phe-13 to Tyr or Lys was without effect. Binding of the branched diacylglycerol was less dependent on phospholipid and was more sensitive to mutation of Trp-22 to Tyr or Lys, especially in the presence of phospholipid, than was PDBu. In terms of specific PKC isoforms, our results suggest that the presence of Arg-20 in PKC-ζ may contribute to its lack of phorbol ester binding activity. More generally, the results emphasize the interplay between the C1 domain, ligand, and phospholipid in the ternary binding complex. The C1 domains of conventional and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms bind diacylglycerol and phorbol esters with high affinity. Highly conserved hydrophobic residues at or near the rim of the binding cleft in the second cysteine-rich domain of PKC-δ (PKC-δC1b) were mutated to probe their roles in ligand recognition and lipid interaction. [3H]Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) binding was carried out both in the presence and absence of phospholipids to determine the contribution of lipid association to the ligand affinity. Lipid dependence was determined as a function of lipid concentration and composition. The binding properties of a high affinity branched diacylglycerol with lipophilicity similar to PDBu were compared with those of PDBu to identify residues important for ligand selectivity.

Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The structure of the PKCs is composed of an N-terminal regulatory region and a C-terminal catalytic region. The regulatory region modulates enzymatic activities by interacting with endogenous and exogenous activators and cofactors of PKCs through subdomains such as the pseudosubstrate region and the C1 and C2 domains (3Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 4Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The twin C1 domains, a tandem repeat of a cysteine-rich, zinc finger structure, are the binding sites for the endogenous PKC ligand sn-diacylglycerol (DAG) and for the phorbol ester tumor promoters (5Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The C1 domain consists of a conserved 50 amino acid sequence possessing the motif HX 12CX 2CX 13/14CX 2CX 4HX 2CX 7C (C, cysteine; H, histidine; X, any other amino acid) and coordinating two Zn2+ ions (7Quest A.F.G. Bloomenthal J. Bardes E.S.G. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10193-10197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solution structure of the C1b domain of PKC-α was determined by NMR. The domain adopts a globular fold allowing two non-consecutive sets of residues to form the two separate zinc-binding sites (8Hommel U. Zurini M. Luyten M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallographic structure of the C1b domain of PKC-δ in complex with phorbol 13-acetate in the absence of phospholipid revealed that phorbol 13-acetate binds in a hydrophilic groove between two pulled-apart β strands at the tip of the domain. Phorbol ester binding caps the hydrophilic groove and generates a contiguous hydrophobic surface covering one-third of the domain, thereby facilitating the membrane insertion of the domain (9Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg M.G. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). These conclusions are supported by subsequent NMR analysis of the C1b domain of rat PKC-γ in solution titrated with lipid micelles in the presence and absence of phorbol ester (10Xu R.X. Pawelczyk T. Xia T.-H. Brown S.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10709-10717Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The residues critical for maintaining the overall structure and ligand binding by the C1 domain have been explored in several studies (9Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg M.G. Hurley J.H.

The 2 histidines and all but 1 of the 6 conserved cysteines that coordinate the two Zn2+ ions, namely the residues at positions 3, 8, 11, 21, 24, 27, and 38, are vital for structural integrity and the interaction with ligands. Two loops at positions 7–12 and 20–27, which comprise most of the β2 and β3 segments, constitute the phorbol ester binding site. Mutations within this region drastically affect the activity of the C1 domain (12Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition to ligand binding, the C1 domain also contributes to membrane interaction as does the C2 domain of the classical PKCs and the pseudosubstrate region (15Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Less is known about the residues responsible for membrane interaction. Since its discovery as a conserved structural module, the C1 domain has been found to be present in a range of novel proteins, distinct from the PKCs, which constitute the superfamily of phorbol ester/DAG receptor proteins. The chimaerins, Munc-13, PKD/PKC-μ, and RasGRP exemplify subgroups within this emerging superfamily. The chimaerins, RasGRP, and PKC isoforms differ in their ligand recognition, reflecting both differences in lipid requirements as well as in intrinsic specificity. Understanding the structural basis for ligand selectivity remains largely unresolved. Phe-20 had been suggested to be involved in differential affinity of β2-chimaerin to constrained DAG analogs and thymeleatoxin (17Caloca M.J. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Blumberg P.M. Lewin N.E. Kremmer E. Mischak H. Wang S. Nacro K. Bienfait B. Marquez V.E. Kazanietz M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11854-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); the same residue was also suggested to be responsible for weaker phorbol ester binding of the C1a domains of PKCs (13Irie K. Oie K. Nakahara A. Yanai Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Fukuda H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9159-9167Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Arg-20 in PKC-ζ and -ι may contribute, along with Gly at position 11, to its lack of phorbol ester recognition. Trp-22 was implicated in mediating differential lipid and ligand binding in PKC-α and PKD/PKC-μ (15Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). 2Q. J. Wang, T.-W. Fang, V. E. Marquez, and P. M. Blumberg, manuscript in preparation. However, few studies had thoroughly examined the roles of these residues in C1 domain function. Guided by computer modeling, NMR, and x-ray crystallography, we sought in the present study to use site-directed mutagenesis to explore three aspects of C1 domain functions in parallel: ligand recognition, lipid interaction, and ligand selectivity. We mainly focused on four residues at positions 13, 20, 22, and 24 along the rim of the ligand-binding pocket that are exposed to the surface and positioned toward the membrane (9Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg M.G. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Residues of varying hydrophilicity such as Tyr, Asp, Lys, and Arg were introduced at these positions in order to change the overall surface hydrophobicity around the binding cleft, therefore affecting their interaction with lipids and ligands. In order to explore residues potentially important for determining the specific binding activity of different C1 domains, we also mutated select residues in PKC-δC1b to the unique residues appearing in the C1 domains of PKC-ζ, PKC-λ/ι, and n/β-chimaerin, as well as in PKD/PKC-μ, which were candidates for their differential binding activity and ligand selectivity, as suggested by sequence comparisons and our structural modeling studies. The binding activities of wild type and mutant PKC-δC1b domains for phorbol ester and DAG were characterized in the presence and absence of phospholipid or in the presence of lipid vesicles of different compositions. Our results further our insight into the structural basis of C1 domain function. [20-3H]Phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Reagents for expression and purification of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The C1b domain of PKC-δ was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the full-length mouse PKC-δ cDNA as template and was subcloned into a pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant plasmid was expressed in XL1-blue E. coli cells and purified to homogeneity as described previously (18Kazanietz M.G. Barchi Jr., J.J. Omichinski J.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14679-14684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the GST-δC1b fusion proteins was performed with the Unique Site Elimination (U.S.E.) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (12Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pGEX-δC1b plasmid was used as the template and aPstI selection primer was used to convert a PstI site to a SacII site within the pGEX plasmid. The mutated residues are shown in Fig. 1. After two consecutive cycles of restriction digestion and bacteria expansion, the full-length sequences of the mutant plasmids were verified by sequencing, which was performed by the DNA Minicore, Division of Basic Sciences, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). The wild type and mutant pGEX-δC1b plasmids were transformed into E. coli (XL-1 blue from Stratagene), and the positive clones were subsequently picked and grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The expression of GST fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-O-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The bacteria was harvested after 5 h of induction at 37 °C and the GST-δC1b protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads following the manufacturer's recommendation (Amersham Pharmacia). The purity of the protein after eluting from the beads was verified by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. [3H]PDBu binding to the wild type and mutant GST-δC1b domains was measured using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay developed in our laboratory (19Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The assay mixture (250 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 4 mg/ml bovine immunoglobulin G, [3H]PDBu, and variable concentrations of competing ligand. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 5 or 30 min. Samples were chilled to 0 °C for 10 min, 200 ml of 35% polyethylene glycol in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) was added, and the samples were incubated at 0 °C for an additional 15 min. The tubes were centrifuged in a Beckman 12 microcentrifuge at 4 °C (12,000 rpm, 15 min). A 100-μl aliquot of the supernatant was removed for the determination of the free concentration of [3H]PDBu, and the pellet was carefully dried. The tip of the centrifuge tube containing the pellet was cut off and transferred to a scintillation vial for the determination of the total bound [3H]PDBu. Aquasol was added both to an aliquot of the supernatant and to the pellet, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was measured using an excess of nonradioactive PDBu (30 μm). Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding (20Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of dissociation constants (K d) and number of binding sites (B max), typical saturation curves with increasing concentrations of [3H]PDBu (between 0.125 and 4 nm) were performed in triplicate. Dissociation constants (K i) of the branched DAG 97F31 were determined by competition of [3H]PDBu binding to GST-δC1b using 6–8 increasing concentrations of the 97F31. ID50 values were determined from the competition curve, and the K i for the competing ligand was calculated from its ID50 using the relationship K i = ID50/(1 +L/K d), where L is the concentration of free [3H]PDBu and K dis the dissociation constant for PDBu. Approximately 30 ng/tube PKC-δC1b domain was used for each assay. In cases in which theK d of PDBu for the mutant PKC-δC1b domain was >20 nm, dissociation constants for PDBu were determined by competition using non-radioactive PDBu competing with [3H]PDBu (specific activity 870.2 dpm/pmol). Values represent the mean of n experiments, as indicated, with triplicate determinations for each point in each competition curve in each experiment. Mutant protein (4 μg/tube) was used for each competition assay. The amount of protein was adjusted for each assay so that the specific binding was over 60–80% of total binding and the total bound [3H]PDBu was below 30% of the total amount of [3H]PDBu in the assay. For measuring [3H]PDBu binding in the absence of phospholipids, the K d was determined by competition using nonradioactive PDBu as described previously with minor modifications (18Kazanietz M.G. Barchi Jr., J.J. Omichinski J.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14679-14684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 7–8 increasing concentrations of unlabeled PDBu (10 nm to 10 μm) were used to compete 100 nm [3H]PDBu (specific activity 870.2 dpm/pmol) in a typical 250-μl reaction mix. 4–10 μg/tube PKC-δC1b domain was used in each assay, and the amount was adjusted so that the specific binding was over 60–80% of total binding and the total bound [3H]PDBu was below 30% of the total amount of [3H]PDBu in the assay. Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 100 μm PDBu, was 20–40% of total bound in the absence of unlabeled PDBu. The data were fitted to the theoretical inhibition curve, and the K d was calculated from the equation K d = ID50− L, where ID50 is the concentration of the nonradioactive PDBu that displaced the binding of the [3H]PDBu by 50% and L is the concentration of free radioligand at the ID50. Since some of the C1 domain bound to the walls of the assay/centrifuge tube, both the pellet and tube were counted. The preparation of the sucrose-loaded vesicles was adopted, with minor modification, from the procedure of Mosior and Epand (21Mosior M. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Aliquots of lipids, e.g.POPS and POPC, in chloroform were mixed and dried under a stream of N2. The lipids were subsequently resuspended in 170 mm sucrose in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles by placing in a 42 °C water bath and in dry ice alternately. LUV were obtained by 40 rounds of extrusion through a 100-nm polycarbonate membrane in a LipoFast liposome “factory” (Sigma). Lipid concentrations were monitored by including a trace amount of [3H]DPPC before extrusion to ensure an accurate final concentration after extrusion. An experimental approach similar to that described above was used for the determination of [3H]PDBu binding in the presence of LUV. Briefly, wild type and mutant GST-δC1b domains were incubated with [3H]PDBu (2 nm), sucrose-loaded vesicles comprising POPS and POPC in the presence of 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, and 5 mg/ml γ-globulin. The concentration of the total phospholipid in the assay was 200 mm unless otherwise indicated. Incubations were carried out at 22 °C for 5 min, followed by polyethylene glycol precipitation as described above for the [3H]PDBu binding assay. 15 ng to 4 μg/tube of protein was used in each assay, and the amount was optimized so that the specific binding was over 60–80% of total binding and the total bound [3H]PDBu was below 30% of the total amount of [3H]PDBu in each binding assay. Mutations were introduced in PKC-δC1b using site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mutated residues and their positions are indicated in Fig. 1 A. The three-dimensional structure of the four hydrophobic residues in relation to the orientation of PDBu in complex with PKC-δC1b is illustrated in Fig. 1 B. The wild type and mutant PKC-δC1b domains were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins. Protein expression was induced by the addition of IPTG. In initial experiments, the expression level after induction with IPTG was monitored every hour. An incubation time of 4–5 h after the addition of IPTG was found to be optimal and was then used subsequently for all GST PKC-δC1b fusion proteins. The fusion proteins were predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm and were isolated from the soluble fraction by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The purified proteins were detected on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa. All mutant proteins appeared the same size on SDS-PAGE as the wild-type protein. No shift in molecular weight was observed (data not shown). We first determined the apparent [3H]PDBu binding affinities of wild type and mutant PKC-δC1b domains in the presence of phosphatidylserine (Table I). [3H]PDBu bound to the wild type PKC-δC1b domain with aK d of 0.49 nm, in good agreement with our previous value (12Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14679-14684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mutants varied markedly in their affinities for PDBu. Replacement of Leu-20 or Leu-24 with Asp led to complete loss of measurable binding. Several hundred-fold loss of activity was observed for L20R and for L24K. In contrast, only a 3-fold effect was observed for L20K, comparable to that for W22K. The other mutations caused less than a 2-fold change. TheB max values of all the mutants were reduced compared with the wild type, with the L20K, L20F, and L24K mutants being 3–6-fold lower. This reduction presumably reflects stability or ease of folding and did not correlate with the changes in binding affinity. Due to the variable B max, the amount of protein used was optimized to give above 60–80% specific binding for [3H]PDBu and below 30% of total [3H]PDBu bound in each binding assay.Table I[3H]PDBu binding to mutants of C1b domain in PKC-δδC1b mutants[3H]PDBuKdB maxKdRatioB max%nmmut./δC1bpmol/mgmut./δC1bControl0.49 ± 0.03 (3)(1.00)13400 ± 2800 (3)(1.00)F13Y0.78 ± 0.02 (3)1.607050 ± 350 (3)52.73%F13K0.75 ± 0.14 (3)1.539020 ± 880 (3)67.39%L20DNDNDL20K1.54 ± 0.50 (4)3.151740 ± 410 (4)13.01%L20R165.9 ± 7.6 (3)339.2610140 ± 830 (3)75.76%L20F0.56 ± 0.09 (3)1.154360 ± 570 (3)32.61%W22Y0.66 ± 0.22 (3)1.358700 ± 1600 (3)65.26%W22K1.42 ± 0.13 (3)2.9011790 ± 500 (3)88.16%L24DNDNDL24K122 ± 23 (4)250.365050 ± 470 (4)37.73%Receptor-ligand interaction was studied by Scatchard analysis of [3H]PDBu binding to mutants of the PKC-δC1b domain in the presence of 100 μg/ml PS.

Seven increasing concentrations (in triplicate) of [3H]PDBu were used. Values represent the mean ± S.E. of the number of experiments in parentheses. ND, not detected; mut., mutant. Analysis of [3H]PDBu binding in the absence of PS permits the effects of the mutations on the interaction of the C1 domain with ligand to be separated from those on the interaction of the C1 domain with lipid or of the C1-ligand complex with lipid (TableII). In the absence of PS, the wild-type PKC-δC1b domain showed a 70-fold decrease in [3H]PDBu binding affinity. This value agrees well with that reported previously (18Kazanietz M.G. Barchi Jr., J.J. Omichinski J.G. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14679-14684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As in the presence of lipid, neither the L20D nor L24D mutants displayed detectable [3H]PDBu binding. Dramatically, the L20R and L24K mutants, which showed 340- and 250-fold weaker binding than the wild type in the presence of lipid, showed decreases of only 6.7- and 2.9-fold, respectively, compared with wild type in the absence of phospholipid; indeed, their absolute binding affinities were similar in the presence or absence of phospholipid. It thus appears that these mutations have limited effect on the ligand binding per sebut interfere with formation of the complex with phospholipid. The L20K mutant showed a modest (3.2-fold) decrease in binding affinity in the absence of lipid, similar to its decrease in the presence of phospholipid (3.2-fold), suggesting that the effect was on the ligand binding. Conversely, the W22K mutant showed virtually no decrease in the absence of phospholipid (1.1-fold) compared with a 2.9-fold decrease in the presence, suggesting that its influence was on lipid interaction.Table II[3H]PDBu binding to mutants of the C1b domain in PKC-δ in the absence of PSδC1b mutantsPDBuKdB maxKdRatioB max%nmmut./δC1bpmol/mgmut./δC1bControl33.4 ± 5.6 (4)5020 ± 470 (4)F13Y34.3 ± 6.7 (3)1.034050 ± 140 (3)80.75F13K22.1 ± 1.8 (3)0.663320 ± 220 (3)66.16L20DNDNDL20K107 ± 13 (3)3.192860 ± 410 (3)57.04L20R223 ± 62 (3)6.66740 ± 180 (3)14.78W22Y38.1 ± 6.6 (3)1.144300 ± 1100 (3)85.64W22K38.1 ± 2.8 (3)1.143040 ± 550 (3)60.53L24DNDNDL24K98 ± 18 (3)2.941800 ± 30035.87Receptor-ligand interaction was studied by competition of [3H]PDBu binding with nonradioactive PDBu in the absence of PS.

ND, not detected; mut., mutant. Since only properly folded protein is capable of binding to PDBu, reflected by the changes of B max value, we were only determining the binding properties of mutant protein that had retained an intact structure. Meanwhile, the [3H]PDBu binding curves for the wild-type and mutant PKC-δC1b domain are consistent with homogeneous binding kinetics. Computer modeling studies showed that mutations introduced at the hydrophobic residues at the rim of the binding cleft are unlikely to introduce structural changes to the overall folding of the zinc finger protein. 4Pak, Y., Enyedy, I. J., Varady, J., Kung, J. W., Lorenzo, P. S., Blumberg, P. M., and Wang, S. (2001) J. Med. Chem., in press. To evaluate interaction of the C1 domain-ligand complex with phospholipids directly, we determined the dose dependence of [3H]PDBu binding to the wild type and mutant PKC-δC1b domains as a function of phospholipid concentration, using LUV (Fig.2). The mutants examined were those whose binding affinities were measurable and dependent on the presence of lipid. The F13K and F13Y and L20K mutants showed either no or little shift, whereas the W22K and W22Y mutants showed intermediate shifts in the dose-response curves. The results of the lipid reconstitution thus show good qualitative agreement with the conclusions from the binding analysis in the presence and absence of phospholipid. The binding analysis ± lipid was carried out in the presence of 100% phosphatidylserine (100 μg/ml). Using POPS:POPC mixed vesicles, we compared the lipid dependence of the wild type and the W22K mutant of PKC-δC1b as a function of the mol% POPS at a constant total concentration of lipid of 0.2 mm (Fig.3 A). The mol% POPS for 50% reconstitution under these conditions shifted from 13.5% for the wild type to 46.5% for the W22K mutant. Lipid conditions that are marginal for reconstitution of ligand binding should be reflected in a decreased apparent affinity for ligand binding. Thus, at POPS:POPC (50:50), which is saturating for binding of PDBu to the wild type but not for the W22K mutant of PKC-δC1b, the K d for the mutant was 6.38 ± 1.11 nm compared with 0.35 ± 0.15 nm for the wild type, a difference of 20-fold, whereas no or less difference in relative K d value was seen in the absence of lipid or under lipid"
https://openalex.org/W1998088595,"We investigated the mechanism of interaction of individual L-type channel amino acid residues with dihydropyridines within a dihydropyridine-sensitive α1A subunit (α1ADHP). Mutation of individual residues in repeat III and expression in Xenopus oocytes revealed that Thr1393 is not required for dihydropyridine interaction but that bulky side chains (tyrosine, phenylalanine) in this position sterically inhibit dihydropyridine coordination. In position 1397 a side chain carbonyl group was required for high antagonist sensitivity. Agonist function required the complete amide group of a glutamine residue. Val1516 and Met1512 side chains were required for agonist (Val1516) and antagonist (Val1516, Met1512) sensitivity. Replacement of Ile1504 and Ile1507 by α1A phenylalanines was tolerated. Substitution of Thr1393 by phenylalanine or Val1516 by alanine introduced voltage dependence of antagonist action into α1ADHP, suggesting that these residues form part of a mechanism mediating voltage dependence of dihydropyridine sensitivity. Our data provide important insight into dihydropyridine binding to α1ADHP which could facilitate the development of α1A-selective modulators.

Our data provide important insight into dihydropyridine binding to α1ADHP which could facilitate the development of α1A-selective modulators. By modulating P/Q-type Ca2+ channels such drugs could serve as new anti-migraine therapeutics. The membrane depolarization-dependent opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels effectively modulates Ca2+ influx into electrically excitable cells. These channels represent key elements in Ca2+ signaling, controlling neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, muscle contraction, and pacemaker functions. So far selective nonpeptide Ca2+ channel modulators have only been developed for L-type Ca2+ channels which are expressed primarily in the cardiovascular system but also in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol... 2000; 16: 521-555Google Scholar,2Striessnig J. Cell Physiol. Biochem... 1999; 9: 242-269Google Scholar). Other Ca2+ channel types, such as N, P, Q, and R-type Ca2+ channels, play a prominent role for fast neurotransmitter release in neurons (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol... 2000; 16: 521-555Google Scholar), but they are insensitive to L-type Ca2+ channel modulators. 1,4-Dihydropyridines (DHPs),1 such as isradipine or amlodipine, are very well characterized L-type Ca2+channel blockers (“antagonists”) that are also used to treat cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, DHP Ca2+ channel activators (“agonists,” e.g. BayK8644) stimulate Ca2+ currents through L-type channels. DHPs do not modulate ion currents through, e.g. P- or Q-type channels. This difference in DHP sensitivity is the result of different α1 subunit isoforms which, together with accessory subunits such as α2-δ and β, form the Ca2+ channel complexes. L-type Ca2+ channels are formed, e.g. by DHP-sensitive α1C or α1S subunits, whereas P- and Q-type Ca2+channels contain DHP-insensitive α1A subunits. Individual amino acid residues that form the DHP binding pocket in L-type α1 subunits have recently been identified (for review, see Refs. 3Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol... 1997; 37: 361-396Google Scholar, 4Striessnig J. Grabner M. Mitterdorfer J. Hering S. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Trends Pharmacol.

Most interestingly, some but not all of these residues are conserved in non-DHP-sensitive subunits, such as α1A and α1E. These subunits are rendered fully DHP agonist- and antagonist-sensitive after introduction of the remaining nonconserved L-type residues forming the binding pocket (yielding, e.g. DHP-sensitive α1A subunits, α1ADHP (6Sinnegger M.J.

Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 14906-14911Google Scholar)). Although site-directed mutagenesis has been used to identify residues important for DHP interaction, the exact role of some of these residues in antagonist and agonist interaction has not been completely studied. In addition, for some of these L-type residues it is still unclear if their introduction into α1A creates additional interaction sites for the DHP molecule or removes an inhibitory effect of the corresponding α1A residue. A more detailed insight into the molecular mechanisms of DHP binding to its recombinant drug binding domain in α1ADHP could provide important structural information for developing small molecules with affinity for α1A subunits. Such drugs could be useful therapeutics for the treatment of α1A-associated disorders such as migraine (8Kraus R.L. Sinnegger M.J. Koschak A. Glossmann H. Stenirri S. Carrera P. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 9239-9243Google Scholar). To address this question we used site-directed mutagenesis to study further the mechanism of DHP interaction with L-type residues in repeat III of a DHP-sensitive α1A subunit (α1ADHP). By carrying out these studies within the α1A background our results can be applied to future studies aimed at the development of α1A-selective Ca2+ channel modulators. The construction of α1ADHP and M1512V (α1ADHPi) was described previously (6Sinnegger M.J. Wang Z. Grabner M. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Mitterdorfer J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 27686-27693Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into α1ADHP cDNA containing silent restriction sites (indicated by asterisks) generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in previous cloning steps (9Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron.. 1996; 16: 207-218Google Scholar). Mutant α1 cDNAs were created by PCR using the “gene SOEing” technique (10Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ).. 1989; 77: 61-68Google Scholar) employing proofreading Pfupolymerase (Stratagene). Mutations of Thr1393 and Gln1397 (α1A numbering (11Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature.. 1991; 350: 398-402Google Scholar); corresponding to positions 1039 and 1043 in α1C-II, respectively (12Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron.. 1991; 7: 45-57Google Scholar)) were introduced by PCR using appropriately mutated SOE-PCR primers into a SfiI-SalI* cassette (nucleotides 4297–4744, α1A numbering) of anXhoI-ClaI* fragment (nucleotides 1689–4925, domains II and III) of α1ADHP subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). The mutations were reintroduced through an NheI-ClaI* fragment (nucleotides 3543–4925, domain III) into α1ADHP in PNKS2 (provided by O. Pongs, ZFMNB, Hamburg, Germany), thus yielding the following α1ADHP mutants: T1393A, T1393Y, T1393F, T1393S, Q1397A, Q1397M, Q1397E, and Q1397N. Mutations in transmembrane segment IIIS6 were introduced by PCR into an SalI*-ClaI*cassette (nucleotides 4744–4925) of α1ADHP in PNKS2, thus yielding the following α1ADHPmutants: Y1503A, I1504A, I1504F, I1507A, I1507F, P1508A, M1512A, and V1516A, corresponding to positions 1152, 1153, 1156, 1157, 1161, and 1165 in α1C-II, respectively. Mutagenic primers contained silent point mutations to introduce or eliminate restriction endonuclease sites for verification of the desired mutations. Fragments amplified by PCR were sequenced entirely to confirm sequence integrity. Capped run-off poly(A+) cRNA transcripts fromXbaI-linearized cDNA templates were synthesized according to Krieg and Melton (13Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res... 1984; 12: 7057-7070Google Scholar). α1 cRNA was coinjected with β1a (14Ruth P. Roehrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E. Regulla S. Meyer H.E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Science.. 1989; 245: 1115-1118Google Scholar) and α2δ (15Ellis S.B. Williams M.E. Ways N.R. Brenner R. Sharp A.H. Leung A.T. Campbell K.P. McKenna E. Koch W.J. Hui A. Schwartz A. Harpold M.M. Science.. 1988; 241: 1661-1664Google Scholar) subunit cRNAs into stage V–VI oocytes fromX. laevis. 1–6 days after cRNA injection inward barium currents (IBa) through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were measured at room temperature using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique as described previously (9Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron.. 1996; 16: 207-218Google Scholar). To quantifiy endogenousIBa X. laevis oocytes injected only with β1a and α2δ were analyzed in parallel. Only oocytes expressing peak IBa through recombinant Ca2+ channels at least three times as high (usually >100 nA) as the highest endogenous currents were included into analysis. Data analysis and acquisition were performed by using the pClamp software package (version 6.0, Axon Instruments). Leakage correction was performed by adjusting the current traces by a factor calculated from the difference between the leak at −80 mV and −90 mV, respectively. The extracellular solution contained 40 mmBa(OH)2, 50 mm NaOH, 2 mm CsOH, and 5 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid). The voltage recording and current-injecting microelectrodes were filled with 2.8 m CsCl, 0.2 m CsOH, 10 mmHEPES, and 10 mm EGTA (adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl) and had resistances of 0.7–6 megohms. Modulation of peak IBa was measured from the indicated standard holding potentials to a test pulse corresponding to the peak potential (IBa block by DHP antagonists) or 10 mV positive to the peak potential of the current-voltage relations (IBa stimulation by DHP agonist and FPL64176, respectively). Standard pulse frequency was 0.017 or 0.034 Hz to assess channel modulation. Isradipine was employed at a concentration (10 μm) causing near complete channel block in oocytes at negative holding potentials (6Sinnegger M.J. Wang Z. Grabner M. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Mitterdorfer J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 27686-27693Google Scholar). The time course of peak current inhibition by isradipine was estimated by fitting the peak currents of successive episodes to a monoexponential function (IBa =A*exp(−t/τ) + C). Because of slow recovery from inactivation, steady-state inactivation was quantified from the decline of peak IBaafter switching from a holding potential of −120 mV to more positive holding potentials allowing equilibrium IBa to be reached. For mutant V1516A, which showed relatively little inactivation at −80 mV, −100 mV was used as reference potential for the resting state. (±)-Isradipine (PN200-110) was from Sandoz AG (Basel, Switzerland), (±)-BayK8644 was from Bayer AG (Wuppertal, Germany), and FPL64176 was from Fisons Pharmaceuticals (Leicestershire, U. K.). Drug-containing solutions were freshly prepared from 10 mm stock solutions (in dimethyl sulfoxide) and applied at the same flow rate as control solution. Data are given as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was calculated using the unpaired Student'st test, employing OriginR (Microcal, version 6.0). We and others have shown recently that α1A (α1ADHP, Fig.1 A) and α1E subunits become highly DHP-sensitive by mutation of 8–9 amino acids to residues present in L-type α1 subunits (6Sinnegger M.J. Wang Z. Grabner M. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Mitterdorfer J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 27686-27693Google Scholar, 7Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Sharp E. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T.

In this study we used α1ADHP as a suitable model to study further the mechanism by which amino acid residues in transmembrane segments IIIS5 and IIIS6 participate in DHP interaction. The α1A structural background should allow application of the results for α1A drug development. Previous studies have shown that replacement of the IIIS5 residues Thr1393 or Gln1397 (numbering according to α1ADHP, see also Fig. 4) in DHP-sensitive α1A chimeras (17Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. Striessnig J. Grabner M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30330-30335Google Scholar) or α1C (18He M. Bodi I. Mikala G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 2629-2633Google Scholar) by the corresponding α1A residues (T1393Y, Q1397M) substantially decreased DHP sensitivity. It is unclear if this is because of a steric interference introduced by the corresponding tyrosine or methionine side chain, respectively, or the result of the removal of the appropriate pharmacophores. To address this question we replaced Thr1393 or Gln1397 in α1ADHP by a series of other residues and tested the consequences of these mutations for modulation ofIBa by the DHP Ca2+ channel blocker isradipine and activator BayK8644 after expression inXenopus oocytes. In agreement with previous results, 10 μm isradipine inhibited 72.1 ± 6.9% (n = 4, Fig. 1 C) ofIBa through α1ADHP elicited from a holding potential of −80 mV. 10 μm BayK8644 stimulatedIBa by 4.3 ± 1.2-fold (n = 4). Sensitivity was abolished after mutation of Thr1393 to tyrosine (mutant T1393Y: 4 ± 8.3% inhibition, n= 5; 1.4 ± 0.7-fold stimulation, n = 7). T1393Y was also insensitive to stimulation by the non-DHP agonist FPL64176 (1.04 ± 0.1 fold stimulation, n = 3). Fig.1 C shows that reduction of the side chain size by mutation from threonine to serine (mutant T1393S: 59.2 ± 16.3% inhibition, n = 3; 3.6 ± 0.4-fold stimulation,n = 5; p > 0.05) or alanine (mutant T1393A: 59.5 ± 10.3% inhibition, n = 5; 5.6 ± 2.8-fold stimulation, n = 4, p > 0.05) not only preserved full DHP antagonist sensitivity but also supported stimulation by BayK8644. These results show that the side chain of Thr1393 is not essential for DHP modulation. Instead, the bulky hydroxyphenyl moiety of tyrosine must prevent DHP interaction (19Huber I. Wappl E. Herzog A. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Langer T. Striessnig J. Biochem. J... 2000; 347: 829-836Google Scholar). To determine whether DHP antagonist sensitivity was affected by membrane voltage, inhibition by isradipine was measured also at −100 mV holding potential at which a much smaller fraction of channels underwent steady-state inactivation than at −80 mV (TableI). As for α1ADHP (Fig. 2; 20), DHP sensitivity was not affected by membrane voltage in T1393A (−100 mV: 62.1 ± 10, 5% inhibition, n = 4) and T1393Y (Fig. 2;). No significant antagonist sensitivity of T1393Y was recovered at holding potentials causing 70% steady-state inactivation (12.0 ± 13.2%,n = 3; Fig. 2). Steady-state inactivation properties of mutant T1393Y were similar to α1ADHP (Table I). This rules out decreased antagonist sensitivity of T1393Y being caused by changes in channel inactivation properties.Table ISteady-state inactivation of α1ADHP and α1ADHPmutantsMutantSteady-state inactivationAt −100 mVAt −80 mV%%α1ADHP6.9 ± 5.742.4 ± 16T1393A20.5 ± 8.5*64.3 ± 8.5**T1393Y8.1 ± 1.532.9 ± 15.7T1393F7.9 ± 10.243.4 ± 22.7T1393S19.6 ± 9.3**57.8 ± 16.3Q1397A16.9 ± 5.6*55.2 ± 11.7Q1397M8 ± 2.946.7 ± 8.6Q1397E13.5 ± 6.140.7 ± 21.2Q1397N18.5 ± 4.6**60.9 ± 16.7V1516AND4.1 ± 3.5**Steady-state inactivation was determined at −80 and −100 mV as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are given as the means ± S.D.

Statistical significant differences from α1ADHP are indicated. *,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ND, not determined. Next we investigated whether the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine side chain contributes to the reduction of DHP sensitivity in T1393Y by creating mutant T1393F. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the isradipine sensitivity of peak IBa through T1393F was reduced dramatically at −100 mV holding potential (8.8 ± 5.0% inhibition, n = 3), and stimulation by BayK8644 was negligible (1.34 ± 0.28-fold stimulation, n = 3, Fig. 1). However, isradipine increased IBa decay during depolarization causing 42 ± 20% (n = 3) inhibition at the end of the 350-ms test pulse (Fig. 2 A). This indicated that the drug still interacts with depolarized channels. The increase in IBa decay may be caused by preferential interaction with or promotion of inactivated channel states (20Berjukow S. Marksteiner R. Gapp F. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 22114-22120Google Scholar) and prompted us to study DHP block at more depolarized holding potentials. Unlike T1393Y, DHP antagonist sensitivity of T1393F increased substantially at more positive holding potentials, and inhibition of peak IBa was recovered completely at potentials causing 70% steady-state inactivation (Fig. 2). Interestingly, development of block was slowed compared with α1ADHP (T1393F: τ = 4.51 ± 1.38 min,n = 6; α1ADHP: τ = 2.28 ± 0.26 min, n = 4, p < 0.05). No evidence for a similar voltage-dependent action was found for BayK8644 (Fig. 1 C). Taken together our experiments show that the tyrosine's phenyl ring alone is sufficient to decrease α1ADHP antagonist sensitivity at negative potentials but that the additional hydroxyl group is required to maintain this effect at more positive voltages. Previous experiments have shown that mutation of IIIS5 Gln1397 to the corresponding methionine (17Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. Striessnig J. Grabner M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30330-30335Google Scholar, 18He M. Bodi I. Mikala G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 2629-2633Google Scholar) reduces DHP sensitivity. This was also observed after introduction of this mutation (Q1393M) into α1ADHP (Fig. 1 C). Antagonist sensitivity was decreased, and simulation by the agonists FPL64176 (0.95 ± 0.13-fold stimulation, n = 3) and BayK8644 (Fig.1 C) was abolished. In contrast to Thr1393, introduction of an alanine, resulting in mutant Q1397A, did not support full DHP antagonist (29.6 ± 13.5% inhibition, n= 7) and agonist (1.4 ± 0.15-fold stimulation, n= 5) sensitivity (Fig. 1 C). This indicates that the side chain of Gln1397 participates directly in DHP binding. Replacement of glutamine by asparagine, which shortens the side chain by one methylene group, conferred full antagonist sensitivity (68.8 ± 9.8%, n = 5, p > 0.05) but significantly reduced stimulation by the agonist (1.8 ± 0.66-fold, n = 5). A similar finding was obtained for mutant Q1397E (63.5 ± 15% inhibition, n = 5; 1.8 ± 0.36-fold stimulation, n = 4) and Q1397D (17Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. Striessnig J. Grabner M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30330-30335Google Scholar) in which the side chain NH2 groups are replaced by OH groups. Taken together these results confirm our previous hypothesis that the carbonyl group (present in the amide and carboxyl side chains) in position 1397 is sufficient for DHP antagonist sensitivity, whereas full agonist action requires the complete amide moiety. Our data show that the latter must even be located in an appropriate distance from the IIIS5 backbone because only glutamine but not asparagine supports full activity. Previous radioligand binding (21Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Acheson M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 18752-18758Google Scholar) or functional (22Bodi I. Yamaguchi H. Harat M. He M. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 24952-24960Google Scholar) studies have shown that Tyr1503, Ile1504, Ile1507, and Met1512 are important determinants of isradipine affinity in transmembrane helix IIIS6. However, the contribution of Tyr1503, Ile1504, and Ile1507 have not yet been determined within the α1ADHP background. As shown in Fig.3 B, mutation of these residues to alanine did not decrease antagonist sensitivity (−80 mV). This is consistent with previous results obtained with mutated α1C subunits, in which only 2.5–5-fold lower affinities at −80 mV were reported for these single mutations in functional experiments (22Bodi I. Yamaguchi H. Harat M. He M. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 24952-24960Google Scholar). As in α1C (22Bodi I. Yamaguchi H. Harat M. He M. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 24952-24960Google Scholar), mutation Y1503A, but not I1504A and I1507A, abolished agonist stimulation of peak current (Fig. 3 B). The activating effect of BayK8644 was converted into an inhibitory one, evident as inhibition of 42 ± 8.4% (n = 3) ofIBa at the end of the 350-ms test pulse (Fig.3 C). This demonstrates that the mutation does not block DHP interaction with the channel but prevents the agonist from stabilizing open channel conformations. Because BayK8644 is employed as the racemic mixture of an agonist ((−)-enantiomer) and a weak antagonist ((+)-enantiomer), IBa inhibition most likely reflects channel block by the antagonistic enantiomer in the absence of stimulation by the agonist. This is supported further by the finding of the complete lack of IBa modulation by the optically pure agonist FPL64176 (0.97 ± 0.12-fold stimulation,n = 3). To address the question of whether DHP sensitivity is still maintained after back-mutation of L-type residues in positions 1504 and 1507 to the corresponding α1A phenylalanines, we constructed mutants I1504F and I1507F. Both mutants showed only minor and nonsignificant decreases in isradipine inhibition compared with α1ADHP. This demonstrates that the DHP sensitivity of α1A can be achieved by introduction of an even lower number of L-type residues into α1ADHP than described previously. Both mutants were efficiently stimulated by 10 μm BayK8644. In the case of I1507F, stimulation was even more pronounced than for α1ADHP (15.6 ± 7.6-fold, n = 7). Such an enhancement was also found for stimulation by FPL64176, although not on the level of statistical significance (I1507F: 4.1 ± 1.16-fold, n = 4, Fig. 3 C; α1A-DHP: 2.8 ± 0.84-fold, n = 3 (6Sinnegger M.J. Wang Z. Grabner M. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Mitterdorfer J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 27686-27693Google Scholar)). We also analyzed the requirement of the Met1512 side chain for agonist action. In agreement with earlier studies (21Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Acheson M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 18752-18758Google Scholar) mutation M1512A reduced isradipine sensitivity (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the Met1512 side chain interacts directly with the DHP antagonist. This side chain preferentially mediated antagonist effects because stimulation by BayK8644 was not affected by the mutation (5.5 ± 2.6-fold stimulation, n = 6). This is in contrast to our previous observation in which substitution of this residue by a valine reduced both agonist and antagonist sensitivity (Fig. 3 B (6Sinnegger M.J. Wang Z. Grabner M. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Mitterdorfer J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 27686-27693Google Scholar)). Other residues in IIIS6 which may affect drug modulation by DHPs are Pro1508 and Val1516. In position 1508 both alanine and proline support high affinity DHP antagonist interaction in α1C (23Peterson B.Z. Tanada T.N. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 5293-5296Google Scholar) and α1ADHP (Fig. 3 B). However, mutation of Pro1508 to alanine may cause mutation-induced conformational changes of the IIIS6 helix (24Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science.. 1998; 280: 69-77Google Scholar) which could affect modulation by agonists. This possibility has not yet been investigated. We found no evidence for such an effect in P1508A (Fig. 3 B). Val1516, which is conserved in L- and non-L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunits, was recently found to contribute to Ca2+ channel block by phenylalkylamines (25Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Abbott M.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 18759-18765Google Scholar) and (+)-cis-diltiazem (26Kraus R.L. Hering S. Grabner M. Ostler D. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 27205-27212Google Scholar), but its contribution to DHP sensitivity is unknown. Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate that mutation V1516A decreased stimulation by BayK8644 and inhibition by isradipine at a −80 mV holding potential. As for T1393F, V1516A increasedIBa decay during the test pulse. At −80 mV peakIBa was reduced by 21 ± 12% (n = 5), but IBa at the end of the 350-ms test pulse was reduced by 55 ± 15% (n= 5). This mutation also introduced voltage dependence for isradipine block, as decreased DHP sensitivity was not observed at holding potentials where 70% of the channels were inactivated (Fig. 2). In contrast to T1393F, no slowing of isradipine block development was evident (τ = 1.53 ± 0.96 min, n = 3). We have studied the contribution of residues previously found to mediate sensitivity of L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunits to DHP Ca2+ channel blockers and activators. Our data (summarized in Fig. 4) provide further structural insight into the differential affinity of α1A and L-type α1 subunits for DHP Ca2+ channel modulators. Decreased DHP sensitivity after the introduction of bulky tyrosine or phenylalanine residues into position 1393 of α1A (T1393Y, T1393F) is not caused by the removal of a critical binding contact. Instead, the bulky side chains sterically prevent high affinity DHP interaction. In T1393F, i.e. in the absence of the tyrosine hydroxyl group, obstruction of DHP antagonist interaction is only found for resting channels but is nearly absent when channels are inactivated. It is tempting to speculate that the hydroxyl function stabilizes a certain orientation of the tyrosine side chain which interferes with DHP antagonist coordination independent of channel conformation. This may be accomplished, e.g. by forming a hydrogen bond with other residues. From a working model of the DHP binding domain (19Huber I. Wappl E. Herzog A. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Langer T. Striessnig J. Biochem. J... 2000; 347: 829-836Google Scholar) based on the three-dimensional coordinates of the kcsA potassium channel (24Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science.. 1998; 280: 69-77Google Scholar) the carbonyl oxygen of the IIIS6 Met1511 would be the most likely candidate for such hydrogen bonding (not shown). Removal of the hydroxyl group (in mutant T1393F) still prevents high DHP antagonist sensitivity of resting channels but restores sensitivity when the channels inactivate. We propose that hydrogen bonding does not occur without the hydroxyl group, providing the phenyl group with more rotational flexibility such that DHP antagonist binding to inactivated states is possible. This flexibility may delay, but not prevent, DHP association to the channel. Such a model can explain the observed slower onset of DHP block of IBa through T1393F compared with α1ADHP. We present evidence that, in contrast to Thr1393, the Glu1397 side chain is involved directly in DHP binding. Maximal DHP antagonist sensitivity critically depends on the presence of a side chain carbonyl group, a potential hydrogen bond acceptor, whereas DHP agonist action requires an intact amide function spaced at a defined distance (glutamine amide) from the IIIS5 protein backbone. Introduction of nine L-type channel amino acids into α1A renders the resulting DHP-sensitive construct (α1ADHP) highly sensitive to DHPs. Although α1ADHP retains most of the hallmarks of DHP interaction with L-type Ca2+ channel α1A subunits (such as high affinity, stereoselectivity, and allosteric modulation by non-DHP Ca2+ antagonists (19Huber I. Wappl E. Herzog A. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Langer T. Striessnig J. Biochem. J... 2000; 347: 829-836Google Scholar)), the typical voltage dependence of DHP block is absent (20Berjukow S. Marksteiner R. Gapp F. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 22114-22120Google Scholar). This has also been described previously for a DHP-sensitive α1E subunit construct (27Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Hu M. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett... 1999; 451: 152-156Google Scholar). We show that the change of only a single amino acid residue can introduce considerable voltage dependence of the DHP block into α1ADHP. This is an important observation because the molecular mechanism for voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel block by DHPs is not well understood. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that first, alterations of single amino acid side chains affect voltage-dependent DHP block. In previous studies the voltage dependence of α1C subunits has been associated with sequence divergence of multiple residues within larger sequence stretches (comprising transmembrane segment IS6 (27Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Hu M. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett... 1999; 451: 152-156Google Scholar, 28Welling A. Ludwig A. Zimmer S. Klugbauer N. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Circ. Res... 1997; 81: 526-532Google Scholar)). Second, we found that single mutations within two distinct but adjacent transmembrane segments of the DHP binding domain can modify the voltage dependence of DHP inhibition of α1ADHP by apparently different mechanisms. The addition of a bulky phenylalanine in position 1393 mainly decreases DHP antagonist sensitivity for resting channels. This steric hindrance decreases when the channel assumes the inactivated conformation (see above). A different mechanism seems to apply for mutation V1516A. In this case, DHP sensitivity also decreases mainly for resting channels after removal of the valine side chain by mutation to alanine. This suggests that the valine side chain is essential for DHP action in the resting channel conformation but is not important once the channel inactivates. The relative contribution of individual residues for DHP binding must therefore change upon depolarization. We cannot distinguish whether the Val1516 side chain interacts directly with the DHP molecule in the resting state or contributes indirectly to a hydrophobic stabilization of the binding domain which is disrupted by its mutation to alanine. Taken together, our experiments identify two basic mechanisms that explain voltage-dependent changes in DHP sensitivity, at least in α1ADHP Ca2+channels: gating-induced molecular rearrangements within the DHP binding domain can alter DHP antagonist affinity either by changing the extent of steric hindrance by a particular residue (such as in T1393F) or by providing (or stabilizing) suitable attachment sites for the drug (such as in V1516A). Our results contribute important information for the development of P/Q-type Ca2+ channel-selective modulators. DHP derivatives would represent ideal lead compounds for the development of α1A Ca2+ channel modulators. Investigation of the DHP binding domain within the α1A sequence background of α1ADHP not only reveals information about the molecular mechanism of DHP interaction with L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunits in general, but also provides structural hints for novel DHP analogs that could possess considerable affinity for α1A subunits and therefore represent lead compounds for further drug development. We found that in the α1A sequence environment the two L-type isoleucine residues in IIIS6 (Ile1504, Ile1507) are not important for DHP interaction and can be replaced by the respective α1A phenylalanines. Therefore transfer of high DHP sensitivity to α1A requires the introduction of even less than 9 L-type residues as reported for α1ADHP (6Sinnegger M.J. Wang Z. Grabner M. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Mitterdorfer J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 27686-27693Google Scholar, 7Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Sharp E. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 14906-14911Google Scholar). From one of our previous studies with α1A chimeras (9Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron.. 1996; 16: 207-218Google Scholar) it is evident that DHP antagonist sensitivity only very weakly depends on the four L-type residues in repeat IV (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, DHP interaction with the remaining three L-type channel amino acid residues in IIIS5 and IIIS6 (Thr1393, Gln1397, and Met1512) is crucial for DHP sensitivity of α1ADHP. The strongest structural determinant abolishing DHP sensitivity in α1A is the tyrosine in position Thr1393 which, according to our data, sterically prevents DHP binding. In contrast, there is no evidence for such an effect for α1A residues introduced into positions 1397 and 1512. Instead, these fail to provide suitable attachment sites for the DHP molecule thus leading to a measurable but limited sensitivity decrease. It is therefore likely that drug molecules (e.g. DHP derivatives) that escape the steric hindrance of Tyr1393 and do not depend on binding interaction with Met1512 and Gln1397 must have considerable Ca2+ channelblocking effects for α1A subunits. Smaller and more hydrophobic compounds may fulfill these requirements. Together with the results from earlier studies (9Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron.. 1996; 16: 207-218Google Scholar, 17Mitterdorfer J. Wang Z. Sinnegger M.J. Hering S. Striessnig J. Grabner M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30330-30335Google Scholar, 18He M.

EMBO J... 1996; 15: 2365-2370Google Scholar) our data show that the structural requirements for effective stimulation by DHP agonists of IBa through α1ADHPare more complex than for antagonists. This is based on the observation that introduction of the α1A sequence into several L-type positions of α1ADHP in repeats III (1393, 1397, 1512) and IVS6 (9Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron.. 1996; 16: 207-218Google Scholar) results in a complete loss of agonist sensitivity to 10 μm concentrations of BayK8644 and FPL64176. Most of these mutations and mutation Y1503A illustrate that DHP agonist effects can be removed completely in mutants still displaying antagonist sensitivity (e.g. Q1397M, Y1503A, M1512V; Fig. 3). In radioligand binding studies DHP agonists and antagonists bind to their binding domain in an apparently competitive manner. It is therefore likely that such mutations still allow DHP agonist binding to the channel but are unable to stabilize or prevent stabilization of open channel conformations by the bound agonist. A similar conclusion was reached after mutation of a pore-loop serine (position 1466 in α1ADHP), which prevents agonist effects but appears still to mediate antagonist sensitivity (5Yamaguchi S. Okamura Y. Nagao T. Adachi-Akahane S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 41504-41511Google Scholar). In summary, our data provide important insight into DHP interaction with their binding domain within the structural background of α1A.

Furthermore, after treatment with IL-1β for 1 h, cytoplasmic IκBα degradation occurred simultaneously with translocation of p65 into the nucleus.

After viral transduction, the cells were stimulated with IL-1β for 4 h, and CFTR mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot analysis. The stimulation of CFTR, induced by IL-1β, was also blocked in the presence of the dominant negative mutant.

Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. et al.Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5969) Google Scholar). Before lung infection, an excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines and an increased number of neutrophils has been reported in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of CF patients (2Konstan M.W. Berger M. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 1997; 24 (, 159–161): 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), which also contain high levels of mucus. We have recently reported that the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), regulates the steady-state levels of CFTR mRNA and protein in the T84 human carcinoma cell line in a biphasic way: stimulatory at 0.5 ng/ml and inhibitory at higher doses (3Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Giordano L. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1500: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism involved in this response of CFTR to IL-1β is essentially unknown. In most cells, IL-1β causes translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB into the nucleus (4Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). This transcription factor is a heterodimer (composed most commonly of p65/p50), the constituents of which are members of the Rel family of transcription factors (5Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5588) Google Scholar). NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex, bound to the endogenous cytoplasmic inhibitors known as IκBs. The best characterized and most extensively studied NF-κB inhibitor is IκBα. In response to extracellular stimuli, such as IL-1β, the IκBα protein is rapidly phosphorylated by the IκB kinase complex and targeted for proteolysis (6Jobin C. Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C451-C462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This exposes the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB and facilitates its translocation into the nucleus with subsequent initiation of gene transcription (4Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 5Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5588) Google Scholar). It has been established that IκB kinase phosphorylates IκBα on serine residues 32 and 36 and that this phosphorylation is the prerequisite for ubiquitination and proteosome-dependent degradation of IκBα. This, in turn, causes the liberation of NF-κB and allows it to translocate into the nucleus. There are some reagents that can stimulate or inhibit the activity of NF-κB such as daunorubicin (7Das K.C. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14914-14920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) (8Watanabe K. Kazakova I. Furniss M. Miller S.C. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), respectively. Furthermore, Jobin and colleagues (9Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar) have constructed an adenoviral vector bearing a mutant form of IκBα in which serines 32 and 36 are replaced by alanine residues (S32A/S36A) thereby preventing IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. The IκBα mutant has been shown to act as a very specific NF-κB superrepressor (9Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). Using these reagents, we have demonstrated here that NF-κB is involved in the up-regulation of CFTR by IL-1β in T84 cells. T84 human colon carcinoma cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) cell line CCL248; Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12 1:1 mixture supplemented with 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technology, Inc.). Subconfluent cells (70–75%) were incubated in serum-free medium (10 ml/100-mm Petri dish) for 48 h. Then IL-1β was added to the medium at different concentrations as indicated in the legends to the figures. For NF-κB inhibition experiments, the cells were preincubated with PDTC (100 μm) for 30 min before the addition of IL-1β. For NF-κB stimulation experiments, the cells were incubated with daunorubicin (0.1 μm) for 1 h for gel shift assays and for 4 h for Northern blots. The T84 cell line was cultured to subconfluency and transduced with Ad5IκBα or Ad5LacZ in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12; Life Technologies, Inc.) at a multiplicity of infection of 100 (1:100 T84 cells/viral particles) for 12 h with gentle agitation every hour. The adenovirus was washed off, fresh serum-containing medium was added, and the cells were incubated for a further 12 h. The cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h and then stimulated with IL-1β (0.5 ng/ml) for 4 h. AD5IκBα- or Ad5LacZ-transduced or non-transduced cells or treated with PDTC or daunorubicin were stimulated with IL-1β (0.5 ng/ml) for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RNA was precipitated with 50% isopropanol, and theA260/A230 andA260/A280 ratios were determined to verify RNA purity. Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (10Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Cell. Mol. Biol.

Briefly, equal amounts of total RNA (30 μg) were separated electrophoretically on 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to Zeta Probe GT blotting membranes (Bio-Rad). RNA was stained with a solution of 0.04% methylene blue in 0.5 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), scanned, and quantified (NIH Image program) 2Contact corresponding author for Web address. to control for sample loading. The membranes were hybridized at 65 °C with a 3.3-kbp CFTR cDNA probe (ATCC 61136) and with a 1.25-kbp glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe, both labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by random priming (Prime a Gene Labeling System;Promega Co., Madison, WI), washed at 65 °C as described (10Cafferata E.G.

After stimulation, the cells were washed twice with 1 ml cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 1 ml cold phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 s at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm fresh dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 30 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell pellet suspension was lysed with a Dounce homogenizer, and the extent of lysis was determined by trypan blue exclusion. The cell lysate/nuclear suspension was prepared by centrifugation (14,000 × gfor 2 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge). The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and left on ice for 1 h with occasional vortexing. Extracted nuclei were isolated by further centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C (11DiMango E. Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Tabibi S. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2598-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotide probes containing the consensus sequence for NF-κB (5′−AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C−3′) were purchased from Promega (Promega Co.). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with 5000 cpm of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe, 0.05 mg/ml of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, in a final volume of 10 μl for 20 min at room temperature. The complexes were fractionated on 4% native polyacrylamide gels, run in 2.2m formaldehyde-TBE buffer at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak film at −70 °C. Subconfluent monolayers of T84 cells (grown for 2 days in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12) were incubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of IL-β at two concentrations (0.5 or 2.5 ng/ml). The monolayers were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid sodium salt, 1% Nonidet-P40, 2 mmEDTA (pH 8)). Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min, at 4 °C). Soluble proteins in the supernatant were denatured with Laemmli sample buffer, fractionated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Transferred proteins were probed with the monoclonal anti-NF-κB antibody (Ab p65) or anti-IκBα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). As a control for loading, histone H1 and β-actin were probed with appropriate antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The primary antibody was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern and Western blots were scanned on an HP4C scanner and quantified using the PC-compatible program, NIH Image.2 Sample loading in Northern blots was quantified with methylene blue staining. A lineal response to methylene blue staining was obtained for up to 40 μg of total RNA (3Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Giordano L. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1500: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, a maximum of 30 μg was used in each assay. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey test. To determine whether the CFTR response to IL-1β in T84 cells involves NF-κB activation, we first studied the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB by EMSA using as probe a double-stranded oligonucleotide possessing an NF-κB-binding site. Cells were treated with IL-1β for 15, 30, and 60 min at 2 concentrations, 0.5 ng/ml (to stimulate CFTR expression) and 2.5 ng/ml (to inhibit CFTR expression). The nuclear extracts were then assayed by gel shift. As shown in Fig.1, IL-1β induced an increase in NF-κB DNA-binding activity at 0.5 ng/ml with a maximum after 60 min. This activation was observed as early as 15 min after IL-1β treatment. At 2.5 ng/ml IL-1β, the levels of NF-κB diminished with respect to those induced at 0.5 ng/ml. This is in agreement with the biphasic curve previously obtained for CFTR mRNA and protein levels in which IL-1β is stimulatory at 0.5 ng/ml and inhibitory at higher concentrations (3Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Giordano L. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1500: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The NF-κB complex activated by IL-1β treatment (0.5 ng/ml) of T84 cells contained a p65-p50 heterodimer as determined by supershifts using specific antibodies (Fig. 1 B). This result is in agreement with the observation that, in most cells, the heterodimer is composed of the RelA (p65) and NF-κB1 (p50) subunits, this variant being the most potent gene transactivator among the NF-κB family (6Jobin C. Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C451-C462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased levels of p65 in the nucleus were observed by Western blotting analysis of nuclear extracts (Fig. 1 C) when cells were treated with 0.5 ng/ml of IL-1β, and decreased levels were observed at 2.5 ng/ml. These data suggest a correlation between nuclear NF-κB levels and the CFTR response to different concentrations of IL-1β, which might explain the biphasic curve obtained in response to IL-1β (3Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Giordano L. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1500: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation by most inducers requires degradation of the isoform IκBα. Therefore, we also looked for IL-1β-induced degradation of IκBα in the cytoplasmic extracts of cells treated with IL-1β. Western blot analysis, using an antibody against IκBα, indicated that IL-1β effectively reduced the cytoplasmic levels of IκBα at 0.5 ng/ml, and basal levels where restored at 2.5 ng/ml (Fig.1 C). This again is in agreement with the concept that NF-κB is no longer translocated into the nucleus when a high concentration of IL-1β is used. This result is not surprising because, in most mammalian cells, IκBα is rapidly degraded following inducible phosphorylation but is quickly resynthesized in an NF-κB-dependent manner (6Jobin C. Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C451-C462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results demonstrate that the NF-κB pathway is active in T84 cells and that IL-1β induces the activation of NF-κB and its translocation into the nucleus. We next studied whether the activation and translocation of NF-κB induced by IL-1β (at 0.5 ng/ml) is involved in the regulation of CFTR mRNA levels. The T84 cells were pretreated for 30 min with the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC (100 μm) (12Brennan P. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Boland P. Foster S. O'Neill L. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 272: 12952-12960Google Scholar). The cells were then stimulated with IL-1β (0.5 ng/ml), and CFTR mRNA levels were determined after 4 h, by Northern blot analysis. The inhibitor PDTC abrogated up-regulation by IL-1β but also reduced the basal CFTR mRNA levels in a short time. However, this reduction in basal levels is compatible with the half-life (4 h) of the CFTR mRNA (3Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Giordano L. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1500: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and a general toxic effect of PDTC does not seems to occur at 100 μm because the expression levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase did not change in the presence or absence of PDTC (Fig. 2). The results obtained with the inhibitor PDTC, therefore, provided initial evidence that NF-κB might be involved in CFTR regulation by IL-1β. To further test the proposition that NF-κB activation was involved in the increased expression of CFTR mRNA observed after IL-1β treatment at 0.5 ng/ml, daunorubicin, an NF-κB activator (7Das K.C. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14914-14920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 13Boland P. Foster S. O'Neill L. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 272: 12952-12960Google Scholar), was then used. To demonstrate that daunorubicin was effectively working in T84 cells, an EMSA was performed using NF-κB as a probe. As expected, an NF-κB shift was induced by daunorubicin (0.1 μm) in T84 cells (Fig. 3 B) indicating that the dose and time-frame for the treatment was correct. Once we had demonstrated that an effective nuclear translocation of NF-κB is induced by daunorubicin, we examined whether CFTR mRNA levels were also affected. Daunorubicin at 0.1 μm induces the expression of CFTR mRNA as shown by Northern blot analysis (Fig.3 A). These results further support the notion that IL-1β, at low doses, regulates CFTR via NF-κB activation. However, chemical inhibitors and stimulators are not always completely specific. Therefore, to address this possible difficulty and to confirm the role of NF-κB T84 cells were transduced with an adenoviral vector expressing a dominant negative form of IκBα, which prevents IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent NF-κB nuclear translocation (9Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar).

Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar) to generate the adenovirus vector, is shown in Fig. 4 C. To determine the efficiency of transduction, T84 cells were transduced with Ad5LacZ and stained for β-galactosidase activity. An efficiency of 60–70% was achieved (Fig. 4 B). After transduction with Ad5IκBα, the cells were stimulated with IL-1β for 4 h, and CFTR mRNA levels were determined by Northern analysis. The stimulation of CFTR induced by IL-1β was blocked by the dominant negative mutant, as shown in Fig. 4 A, confirming that NF-κB has a role in the pathway by which IL-1β regulates CFTR and can stimulate the expression of CFTR.Figure 4Dominant negative IκBα blocks the CFTR mRNA stimulation induced with IL-1β.T84 cells were cultured to subconfluency and then transduced with Ad5IkBα or Ad5LacZ in serum-free medium (multiplicity of infection 1:100 T84cells/viral particles) for 12 h. The adenovirus was then washed off, fresh medium was added, and the cells incubated for 24 h. The cells were then treated with IL-1β (0.5 ng/ml) for 4 h.A, Northern blots were probed using a 3.3-kbp CFTR cDNA fragment.

In most cases, only a diminished amount of the protein is normally present on the surface of CF cells (14Riordan J.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1499-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, any drug that can up-regulate the gene might also facilitate an increase in the amount of protein reaching the cell membrane, perhaps to levels sufficient to restore a quasi-normal phenotype. It is for this reason that it is important to identify the pathway(s) involved in CFTR regulation. Here, we have demonstrated that IL-1β acts in the modulation of CFTR, at least in part, through a pathway involving NF-κB. Because IL-1β is the first recognized extracellular factor that can increase the expression of CFTR mRNA and protein, clarification of the key role of NF-κB in the pathway of CFTR up-regulation might allow the identification of new potential targets for therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2072633195,"The addition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors to proteins occurs by a transamidase-catalyzed reaction mechanism soon after completion of polypeptide synthesis and translocation. We show that placental alkaline phosphatase becomes efficiently GPI-anchored when translated in the presence of semipermeabilized K562 cells but is not GPI-anchored in cell lines defective in the transamidase subunit hGpi8p. By studying the synthesis of placental alkaline phosphatase, we demonstrate that folding of the protein is not influenced by the addition of a GPI anchor and conversely that GPI anchor addition does not require protein folding. These results demonstrate that folding of the ectodomain and GPI addition are two distinct processes and can be mutually exclusive. When GPI addition is prevented, either by synthesis of the protein in the presence of cell lines defective in GPI addition or by mutation of the GPI carboxyl-terminal signal sequence cleavage site, the substrate forms a prolonged association with the transamidase subunit hGpi8p. The ability of the transamidase to recognize and associate with GPI anchor signal sequences provides an explanation for the retention of GPI-anchored protein within the ER in the absence of GPI anchor addition."

We used a collagen bead model of collagen phagocytosis to determine whether CsA inhibits internalization by blocking efflux of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial calcium stores. CsA caused dose-dependent inhibition of phagocytosis of collagen-coated (but not bovine serum albumin-coated) beads. Chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA/AM or inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase of ER stores with thapsigargin reduced collagen bead phagocytosis.

Direct measurements of Ca2+ in mitochondrial and ER stores showed that CsA only slightly inhibited collagen bead-induced discharge of calcium from mitochondria, but almost completely blocked discharge from ER stores. We reduced the numbers of mitochondria with chronic ethidium bromide treatment to test for the importance of ER/mitochondrial interactions.

Cyclosporin A (CsA)1 is a cyclic endecapeptide immunosuppressant that is widely used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation. Despite the effectiveness of CsA in preventing rejection, its clinical application is limited by various side effects (1Thiru S. Thomson A.W. Cyclosporin, Mode of Action and Clinical Application.Kluwer Academic Publishers. 1989; : 324-359Google Scholar), including cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and gingival overgrowth (2Carranza Jr., F.A. Carranza Jr., F.A. Newman M.G. Cinical Periodontology.W. B. Saunders Co. 1996; Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling (3Fomina A.F. Fanger C.M. Kozak J.A. Cahalan M.D. J. Cell Biol... 2000; 150: 1435-1444Google Scholar) is a common mechanism for CsA-induced cardiotoxicity (4Olbrich H.G. Dols S. Ver Donck L. Kober G. Kaltenbach M. Mutschler E. Int. J. Cardiol... 2000; 27: 319-325Google Scholar) and many other side effects. In cardiac muscle cells, CsA inhibits contractility by altering the function of Ca2+ release channels and deregulating mitochondrial ion homeostasis (5Park K.S. Kim T.K. Kim D.H. Am. J. Physiol... 1999; 276: H865-H872Google Scholar). CsA induces mitochondrial dysfunction by binding to cyclophilin D (6Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J... 1988; 255: 357-360Google Scholar), a mitochondrial protein that regulates conductance of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (PTP), a nonspecific, high conductance ion-permeable channel in mitochondrial membranes. CsA induces cyclophilin to detach from the PTP (7Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenter R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 2185-2192Google Scholar) and thus facilitates closure. However, the mechanism(s) by which CsA causes gingival overgrowth is unknown (2Carranza Jr., F.A. Carranza Jr., F.A. Newman M.G. Cinical Periodontology.W. B. Saunders Co. 1996; Google Scholar).Under physiological conditions, gingival connective tissues exhibit a remarkably rapid rate of collagen turnover (8Sodek J. Arch. Oral Biol... 1978; 23: 977-982Google Scholar). The abundant synthesis of collagen in these tissues is balanced by an equally rapid rate of intracellular degradation (9Sodek J. Ferrier J. Collagen Relat. Res... 1988; 1: 11-21Google Scholar), a process that is mediated by the phagocytic pathway in fibroblasts (10Everts V. van der Zee E. Creemers L. Beertsen W. Histochem. J... 1996; 28: 229-245Google Scholar). In CsA-induced gingival overgrowth, there is a net increase in collagen (11McGaw W.T. Porter H. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol... 1988; 65: 186-190Google Scholar), but CsA does not increase collagen expression (12Redlich M. Greenfeld Z. Cooperman H. Pisanty S. Shoshan S. Arch. Oral Biol... 1997; 42: 277-282Google Scholar) and does not substantially alter collagenase levels (13Tipton D.A. Stricklin G.P. Dabbous M.K. J. Cell. Biochem... 1991; 46: 152-165Google Scholar). Instead, the net increase in collagen is apparently due to reduced phagocytosis by fibroblasts (11McGaw W.T. Porter H. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol... 1988; 65: 186-190Google Scholar). Indeed, although CsA-induced inhibition of collagen phagocytosis has been demonstrated in several in vivo studies (14Ayanoglou C.M. Lesty C. J. Periodontal Res... 1999; 34: 7-15Google Scholar, 15Kataoka M. Shimizu Y. Kunikiyo K. Asahara Y. Yamashita K. Ninomiya M. Morisaki I. Ohsaki Y. Kido J.I. Nagata T. J. Cell. Physiol... 2000; 182: 351-358Google Scholar), the mechanisms and the intracellular locus of this inhibition are not defined.In “professional” phagocytes such as neutrophils, efficient phagocytosis is dependent on calcium release from intracellular stores (16Stendahl O. Krause K.-H. Krischer J. Jerström P. Theler J.-M. Clark R.A. Carpentier J.L. Lew D.P. Science.. 1994; 265: 1439-1441Google Scholar), which, in turn, is reliant on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor function to regulate calcium levels within endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores (17Bultynck G. De Smet P. Weidema A.F. Ve Heyen M. Maes K. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ).. 2000; 3: 681-693Google Scholar). These receptors are translocated to periphagosomal sites during particle internalization (18Favre C.J. Jerstrom P. Foti M. Stendahl O. Huggler E. Lew D.P. Krause K.-H. Biochem. J... 1996; 316: 137-142Google Scholar), suggesting that phagocytosis may be affected by calcium levels in the intracellular stores. Notably, α2β1integrin-mediated collagen phagocytosis in gingival fibroblasts is regulated by intracellular calcium (19Arora P.D. Manolson M. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 35432-35441Google Scholar), in which a calcium-dependent feedback loop may alter integrin affinity of matrix molecules and thereby enhance integrin-mediated cell adhesion (20Sjaastad M.D. Angres B. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 8214-8218Google Scholar). Since CsA binding to cyclophilin perturbs the function of the PTP (6Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A.

Immunol... 1998; 161: 6122-6127Google Scholar), we considered that CsA may inhibit collagen phagocytosis by deregulating calcium homeostasis in mitochondrial and/or ER stores.To obtain an improved understanding of the role of calcium signaling in phagocytosis and CsA-induced gingival overgrowth, we have used a well characterized in vitro model of α2β1 integrin-mediated collagen phagocytosis in gingival and Rat2 fibroblasts (19Arora P.D. Manolson M. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 35432-35441Google Scholar, 22Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol... 1996; 168: 695-704Google Scholar, 23Knowles G.

Cells were stimulated with collagen beads, and the effect of CsA on intracellular calcium signaling in cytosolic, mitochondrial, and ER stores was examined. The data show that CsA inhibits the binding step of collagen phagocytosis through a calcium-regulated pathway involving ER and mitochondrial stores.DISCUSSIONAlthough some of the modes of action of CsA as an immunosuppressant are understood (37Kay J.E. Thomson A.W. Cyclosporin, Mode of Action and Clinical Application.Kluwer Academic Publishers. 1989; : 4Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) by which CsA induces gingival overgrowth is unknown (2Carranza Jr., F.A. Carranza Jr., F.A. Newman M.G. Cinical Periodontology.W. B. Saunders Co. 1996; Google Scholar). The main findings in this study are that the CsA-induced inhibition of collagen phagocytosis observed in vivo (11McGaw W.T. Porter H. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol... 1988; 65: 186-190Google Scholar, 14Ayanoglou C.M. Lesty C. J. Periodontal Res... 1999; 34: 7-15Google Scholar, 15Kataoka M. Shimizu Y. Kunikiyo K. Asahara Y. Yamashita K. Ninomiya M. Morisaki I. Ohsaki Y. Kido J.I. Nagata T. J. Cell. Physiol... 2000; 182: 351-358Google Scholar) can be replicated in the collagen bead model and that CsA mediates phagocytic inhibition by deregulating intracellular calcium signaling. In this study, we have considered previous observations that CsA binding to cyclophilin inhibits the conductance of the mitochondrial PTP (6Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J... 1988; 255: 357-360Google Scholar) and can independently act upon ER stores to inhibit calcium release (5Park K.S. Kim T.K. Kim D.H. Am. J. Physiol... 1999; 276: H865-H872Google Scholar, 21Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol... 1998; 161: 6122-6127Google Scholar). Furthermore, several functional interactions between the regulation of calcium in mitochondrial and ER calcium stores have been characterized (46Landolfi B. Curci S. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Hofer A.M. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 142: 1235-1243Google Scholar) that underline the importance of communication between these organelles in calcium homeostasis (48Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev... 1999; 79: 1127-1155Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have shown here that calcium signaling is an important regulatory mechanism of collagen bead phagocytosis and that CsA markedly perturbs calcium responses to collagen bead incubations. Collagen phagocytosis was strongly inhibited by clamping [Ca2+]i to low levels with BAPTA, by depleting intracellular stores with thapsigargin, or by treatment with pharmacologically relevant doses of CsA. These data implicate intracellular calcium homeostasis and CsA perturbation of collagen bead-induced calcium signaling as important target processes in CsA inhibition of collagen phagocytosis.Phagocytosis and [Ca2+]iSignalsWhen [Ca2+]i was monitored during collagen bead-induced phagocytosis, Rat2 fibroblasts exhibited a calcium peak within 150 s, a similar but more rapid response than that seen in the spreading of endothelial cells on fibronectin substrata (38Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 120: 1003-1010Google Scholar) or after incubation of kidney epithelial cells with RGD-coated beads (20Sjaastad M.D. Angres B. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 8214-8218Google Scholar). This calcium response was evidently important for the collagen bead binding step of phagocytosis because chelation of intracellular calcium with BAPTA/AM or inhibition of ER stores with thapsigargin strongly inhibited phagocytosis. These results are consistent with the previous demonstration of a requirement for calcium fluxes in cells forming productive adherent interactions with beads (20Sjaastad M.D. Angres B. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 8214-8218Google Scholar). However, the important requirement of calcium release from ER stores that we have shown here is in marked contrast to previous data showing that matrix protein-coated beads induce calcium rises that are largely dependent on extracellular sources (20Sjaastad M.D. Angres B. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 8214-8218Google Scholar). In this context, the importance of ER calcium stores in collagen bead-induced phagocytosis was shown by direct measurement of ER calcium stores with mag-fura-2 and by thapsigargin pretreatment, in which collagen beads induced only a small calcium rise; this effect was seen in both Rat2 fibroblasts and Rat2 fibroblasts pretreated with CsA. The chelation of Ca2+i with BAPTA also caused a significant decrease in the [Ca2+]i response compared with untreated cells, and the magnitude of this response was similar to that following thapsigargin treatment. Notably and consistent with previous findings (20Sjaastad M.D. Angres B. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 8214-8218Google Scholar, 38Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 120: 1003-1010Google Scholar), we found that [Ca2+]i responses to collagen phagocytic stimuli also involve entry of extracellular calcium and thus are not due solely to release from intracellular stores (47Bengtsson T. Jaconi M.E.E. Gustafson M. Magnusson K.-E. Theler J.-M. Lew D.P. Stendahl O. Eur. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 62: 49-58Google Scholar). However, in this study, we have concentrated on the role of CsA in regulating intracellular calcium responses to collagen beads since previous data showed that CsA can down-regulate calcium release from both ER (5Park K.S. Kim T.K. Kim D.H. Am. J. Physiol... 1999; 276: H865-H872Google Scholar, 21Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol... 1998; 161: 6122-6127Google Scholar) and mitochondrial (48Bernardi P. Physiol.

Neurochem... 2000; 74: 1999-2009Google Scholar) stores and thus is likely to suggest a mechanism for how CsA inhibits collagen phagocytosis (11McGaw W.T. Porter H. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol... 1988; 65: 186-190Google Scholar, 14Ayanoglou C.M. Lesty C. J. Periodontal Res... 1999; 34: 7-15Google Scholar,15Kataoka M. Shimizu Y. Kunikiyo K. Asahara Y. Yamashita K. Ninomiya M.

Physiol... 2000; 182: 351-358Google Scholar).ER and Mitochondrial [Ca2+] Responses to Collagen Phagocytic StimuliPreincubation of Rat2 fibroblasts with CsA caused a rapid and significant inhibition of the calcium efflux from the ER in response to collagen beads. Previous data (38Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 120: 1003-1010Google Scholar) suggest that a large part of the increase in [Ca2+]i following cell spreading on matrix proteins may be due to calcium release from intracellular calcium stores, and our direct measurements of ER [Ca2+] with mag-fura-2 show that ER stores are indeed a locus for this inhibition. Notably, CsA inhibits inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding to its cognate receptors and inhibits calcium release from ER stores in macrophages (21Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol... 1998; 161: 6122-6127Google Scholar); CsA can also alter the characteristics of the calcium release channel in the ER of cardiac cells (5Park K.S. Kim T.K. Kim D.H. Am. J. Physiol... 1999; 276: H865-H872Google Scholar). In view of these data, we suggest that an important mechanism for CsA inhibition of collagen phagocytosis is blocking calcium efflux from ER stores; this would also account for the greatly reduced [Ca2+]i following CsA pretreatment and collagen bead stimulation. The CsA-induced attenuation of this calcium signal may be sufficient to inhibit collagen binding to collagen receptors, perhaps by regulating the affinity of the α2β1 integrin (20Sjaastad M.D. Angres B. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 8214-8218Google Scholar, 41Onley D.J. Knight C.G. Tuckwell D.S. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 24560-24564Google Scholar).Collagen bead-induced phagocytosis provoked a time-dependent and equivalent decrease in mitochondrial [Ca2+] in untreated and CsA-pretreated Rat2 cells. Since CsA greatly attenuated [Ca2+]i responses to collagen beads, it seems unlikely that the efflux of calcium from mitochondrial stores contributed significantly to the increased [Ca2+]i after bead incubation. This result was not because CsA had no effect on mitochondrial function: indeed, CsA pretreatment preserved Ψm following suspension challenge (34Kulkarni G.V. Lee W. Seth A. McCulloch C.A.G. Exp. Cell Res... 1998; 244: 170-178Google Scholar), indicating that the PTP was inhibited, as reported earlier (32Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Mach A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit X.A. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med... 1995; 182: 367-377Google Scholar). A more likely explanation for the lack of effect of CsA on mitochondrial calcium is that calcium ions can exit via other channels or pumps that are not affected by CsA (48Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev... 1999; 79: 1127-1155Google Scholar). In view of these data, does mitochondrial regulation of calcium impact on collagen bead binding? Conceivably, and as suggested by recent data on ER/mitochondrial store interactions (29Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goodwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol... 1997; 136: 833-844Google Scholar, 46Landolfi B. Curci S. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Hofer A.M. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 142: 1235-1243Google Scholar), mitochondria may sense high local concentrations of calcium within the cell and act to buffer [Ca2+] (44Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science.. 1993; 262: 744-747Google Scholar). We investigated this possibility using mitochondrial depletion methods previously described for studies of ER/mitochondrial calcium store interactions (26Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avdhani G. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 522-533Google Scholar). In mitochondrion-depleted cells, collagen bead-induced calcium efflux from mitochondria was inhibited by CsA, indicating that ER/mitochondrial regulation of calcium signaling is dependent on functional interactions between the two sets of organelles. Conceivably, the effect of CsA on mitochondrial regulation of calcium may serve to inhibit the explosive release of calcium from ER stores (46Landolfi B. Curci S. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Hofer A.M. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 142: 1235-1243Google Scholar); when these processes are dampened, the phagocytosis-induced calcium signal in the cytosol is inhibited.We are aware of the potent inhibition of the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin by CsA (50Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev... 2000; 80: 1483-1521Google Scholar) and the possibility that CsA may modulate integrin affinity for collagen through a calcineurin pathway. However, in the context of this study, we note that FK506, which also potently inhibits calcineurin, has no effect on collagen phagocytosis and does not cause gingival overgrowth (51Thorp M. DeMattos A. Bennett W. Barry J. Norman D. Transplantation.. 2000; 69: 1218-1220Google Scholar). Consequently, we conclude that the effect of CsA perturbation on the whole cell is independent of a calcineurin-mediated decrease in collagen binding and phagocytic efficiency. In the CsA-treated gingival fibroblast, this inhibition leads to decreased collagen phagocytosis, a net increase in matrix proteins, and gingival overgrowth. Although the exact role of the mitochondrial calcium stores is not shown by these data, the importance of signaling interactions between discrete calcium stores is evident. Cyclosporin A (CsA)1 is a cyclic endecapeptide immunosuppressant that is widely used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation. Despite the effectiveness of CsA in preventing rejection, its clinical application is limited by various side effects (1Thiru S. Thomson A.W. Cyclosporin, Mode of Action and Clinical Application.Kluwer Academic Publishers. 1989; : 324-359Google Scholar), including cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and gingival overgrowth (2Carranza Jr., F.A. Carranza Jr., F.A. Newman M.G. Cinical Periodontology.W. B. Saunders Co. 1996; Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling (3Fomina A.F. Fanger C.M. Kozak J.A. Cahalan M.D. J. Cell Biol... 2000; 150: 1435-1444Google Scholar) is a common mechanism for CsA-induced cardiotoxicity (4Olbrich H.G. Dols S. Ver Donck L. Kober G. Kaltenbach M. Mutschler E. Int. J. Cardiol... 2000; 27: 319-325Google Scholar) and many other side effects. In cardiac muscle cells, CsA inhibits contractility by altering the function of Ca2+ release channels and deregulating mitochondrial ion homeostasis (5Park K.S. Kim T.K. Kim D.H. Am. J. Physiol... 1999; 276: H865-H872Google Scholar). CsA induces mitochondrial dysfunction by binding to cyclophilin D (6Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J... 1988; 255: 357-360Google Scholar), a mitochondrial protein that regulates conductance of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (PTP), a nonspecific, high conductance ion-permeable channel in mitochondrial membranes. CsA induces cyclophilin to detach from the PTP (7Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenter R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 2185-2192Google Scholar) and thus facilitates closure. However, the mechanism(s) by which CsA causes gingival overgrowth is unknown (2Carranza Jr., F.A. Carranza Jr., F.A. Newman M.G. Cinical Periodontology.W. B. Saunders Co. 1996; Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, gingival connective tissues exhibit a remarkably rapid rate of collagen turnover (8Sodek J. Arch. Oral Biol... 1978; 23: 977-982Google Scholar). The abundant synthesis of collagen in these tissues is balanced by an equally rapid rate of intracellular degradation (9Sodek J. Ferrier J. Collagen Relat. Res... 1988; 1: 11-21Google Scholar), a process that is mediated by the phagocytic pathway in fibroblasts (10Everts V. van der Zee E. Creemers L. Beertsen W. Histochem. J... 1996; 28: 229-245Google Scholar). In CsA-induced gingival overgrowth, there is a net increase in collagen (11McGaw W.T. Porter H. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol... 1988; 65: 186-190Google Scholar), but CsA does not increase collagen expression (12Redlich M. Greenfeld Z. Cooperman H. Pisanty S. Shoshan S. Arch. Oral Biol... 1997; 42: 277-282Google Scholar) and does not substantially alter collagenase levels (13Tipton D.A. Stricklin G.P. Dabbous M.K. J. Cell. Biochem... 1991; 46: 152-165Google Scholar). Instead, the net increase in collagen is apparently due to reduced phagocytosis by fibroblasts (11McGaw W.T. Porter H. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol... 1988; 65: 186-190Google Scholar). Indeed, although CsA-induced inhibition of collagen phagocytosis has been demonstrated in several in vivo studies (14Ayanoglou C.M. Lesty C. J. Periodontal Res... 1999; 34: 7-15Google Scholar, 15Kataoka M. Shimizu Y. Kunikiyo K. Asahara Y. Yamashita K. Ninomiya M. Morisaki I. Ohsaki Y. Kido J.I. Nagata T. J. Cell. Physiol... 2000; 182: 351-358Google Scholar), the mechanisms and the intracellular locus of this inhibition are not defined. In “professional” phagocytes such as neutrophils, efficient phagocytosis is dependent on calcium release from intracellular stores (16Stendahl O. Krause K.-H. Krischer J. Jerström P. Theler J.-M. Clark R.A. Carpentier J.L. Lew D.P. Science.. 1994; 265: 1439-1441Google Scholar), which, in turn, is reliant on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor function to regulate calcium levels within endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores (17Bultynck G. De Smet P. Weidema A.F. Ve Heyen M. Maes K. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ).. 2000; 3: 681-693Google Scholar). These receptors are translocated to periphagosomal sites during particle internalization (18Favre C.J. Jerstrom P. Foti M. Stendahl O. Huggler E. Lew D.P. Krause K.-H. Biochem. J... 1996; 316: 137-142Google Scholar), suggesting that phagocytosis may be affected by calcium levels in the intracellular stores. Notably, α2β1integrin-mediated collagen phagocytosis in gingival fibroblasts is regulated by intracellular calcium (19Arora P.D. Manolson M. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 35432-35441Google Scholar), in which a calcium-dependent feedback loop may alter integrin affinity of matrix molecules and thereby enhance integrin-mediated cell adhesion (20Sjaastad M.D. Angres B. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 8214-8218Google Scholar). Since CsA binding to cyclophilin perturbs the function of the PTP (6Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J... 1988; 255: 357-360Google Scholar) and can independently inhibit calcium release from ER stores (5Park K.S. Kim T.K. Kim D.H. Am. J. Physiol... 1999; 276: H865-H872Google Scholar,21Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol... 1998; 161: 6122-6127Google Scholar), we considered that CsA may inhibit collagen phagocytosis by deregulating calcium homeostasis in mitochondrial and/or ER stores. To obtain an improved understanding of the role of calcium signaling in phagocytosis and CsA-induced gingival overgrowth, we have used a well characterized in vitro model of α2β1 integrin-mediated collagen phagocytosis in gingival and Rat2 fibroblasts (19Arora P.D. Manolson M. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 35432-35441Google Scholar, 22Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol... 1996; 168: 695-704Google Scholar, 23Knowles G.

Cells were stimulated with collagen beads, and the effect of CsA on intracellular calcium signaling in cytosolic, mitochondrial, and ER stores was examined. The data show that CsA inhibits the binding step of collagen phagocytosis through a calcium-regulated pathway involving ER and mitochondrial stores. DISCUSSIONAlthough some of the modes of action of CsA as an immunosuppressant are understood (37Kay J.E. Thomson A.W. Cyclosporin, Mode of Action and Clinical Application.Kluwer Academic Publishers. 1989; : 4Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) by which CsA induces gingival overgrowth is unknown (2Carranza Jr., F.A. Carranza Jr., F.A. Newman M.G. Cinical Periodontology.W. B. Saunders Co. 1996; Google Scholar). The main findings in this study are that the CsA-induced inhibition of collagen phagocytosis observed in vivo (11McGaw W.T. Porter H. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol... 1988; 65: 186-190Google Scholar, 14Ayanoglou C.M. Lesty C. J. Periodontal Res... 1999; 34: 7-15Google Scholar, 15Kataoka M. Shimizu Y. Kunikiyo K. Asahara Y. Yamashita K. Ninomiya M. Morisaki I. Ohsaki Y. Kido J.I. Nagata T. J. Cell. Physiol... 2000; 182: 351-358Google Scholar) can be replicated in the collagen bead model and that CsA mediates phagocytic inhibition by deregulating intracellular calcium signaling. In this study, we have considered previous observations that CsA binding to cyclophilin inhibits the conductance of the mitochondrial PTP (6Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J... 1988; 255: 357-360Google Scholar) and can independently act upon ER stores to inhibit calcium release (5Park K.S. Kim T.K. Kim D.H. Am. J. Physiol... 1999; 276: H865-H872Google Scholar, 21Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol... 1998; 161: 6122-6127Google Scholar). Furthermore, several functional interactions between the regulation of calcium in mitochondrial and ER calcium stores have been characterized (46Landolfi B. Curci S. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Hofer A.M. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 142: 1235-1243Google Scholar) that underline the importance of communication between these organelles in calcium homeostasis (48Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev... 1999; 79: 1127-1155Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have shown here that calcium signaling is an important regulatory mechanism of collagen bead phagocytosis and that CsA markedly perturbs calcium responses to collagen bead incubations. Collagen phagocytosis was strongly inhibited by clamping [Ca2+]i to low levels with BAPTA, by depleting intracellular stores with thapsigargin, or by treatment with pharmacologically relevant doses of CsA. These data implicate intracellular calcium homeostasis and CsA perturbation of collagen bead-induced calcium signaling as important target processes in CsA inhibition of collagen phagocytosis.Phagocytosis and [Ca2+]iSignalsWhen [Ca2+]i was monitored during collagen bead-induced phagocytosis, Rat2 fibroblasts exhibited a calcium peak within 150 s, a similar but more rapid response than that seen in the spreading of endothelial cells on fibronectin substrat"

We show here that, unlike tenascin-C, the recombinant fibrinogen-like domain of tenascin-X is not involved in heparin binding. On the other hand, the two contiguous fibronectin type III repeats b10 and b11 have a predicted positive charge at physiological pH, hence a set of recombinant proteins comprising these domains was tested for interaction with heparin. Using solid phase assays and affinity chromatography, we found that interaction with heparin was conformational and involved both domains 10 and 11. Construction of a three-dimensional model of domains 10 and 11 led us to predict exposed residues that were then submitted to site-directed mutagenesis. In this way, we identified the basic residues within each domain that are crucial for this interaction. Blocking experiments using antibodies against domain 10 were performed to test the efficiency of this site within intact tenascin-X. Binding was significantly reduced, arguing for the activity of a heparin-binding site involving domains 10 and 11 in the whole molecule. Finally, the biological significance of this site was tested by cell adhesion studies.

All are multi-domain proteins consisting of an N-terminal region involved in oligomerization, a series of epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a variable number of fibronectin type III (FNIII)1 modules, and a C-terminal domain homologous to fibrinogen (Fbg). This complex structure gives rise to multiple interactions with proteins and carbohydrates. Alternative splicing events involving FNIII domains generate a variety of isoforms whose different interaction properties and functions have been demonstrated for TN-C (1Jones F.S. Jones P.L. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 235-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Many studies have emphasized the possible role of proteoglycan binding in the functions of members of the tenascin family. TN-C binding to glycosaminoglycans, namely heparin, heparan and chondroitin sulfates is well documented. Two heparin-binding sites have been identified in the fifth FNIII and the Fbg domain of TN-C by the use of recombinant domains produced in bacteria (2Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol.

Several types of proteoglycans have been shown to interact with TN-C, e.g.brain proteoglycans (6Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2523-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans derived from smooth muscle cells in culture (7Chiquet M. Fambrough D.M. J.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Perlecan, an extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycan, interacts preferentially with the small splice variant of TN-C; FNIII domains 3–5 are involved in this interaction (9Chung C.Y. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, incorporation of the small variant of TN-C in the fibronectin matrix deposited by cellsin vitro is dependent on the presence of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (9Chung C.Y. Erickson H.P. J.

Heparin binding seems to be a common feature of molecules of the tenascin family; TN-X and TN-Y are also heparin-binding proteins (16Matsumoto K. Saga Y. Ikemura T. Sakakura T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R.

Our study is focussed on the localization of heparin-binding domains within the TN-X molecule. TN-X has the typical arrangement of modules characteristic of TNs (16Matsumoto K. Saga Y. Ikemura T.

Few data are available concerning the function of TN-X, but in one clinical case, a patient deficient in TN-X protein, has been reported to present a connective tissue disorder typical of Ehlers Danlos-like syndrome (24Burch G.H. Gong Y. Liu W. Dettman R.W. Curry C.J. Smith L. Miller W.L. Bristow J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Symptoms consist of skin and joint hyperextensibility, vascular fragility, and poor wound healing. In view of these connective tissue defects, TN-X might be involved in cell-matrix interactions and in matrix network formation. Because GAGs are likely to be involved in these molecular interactions, we have analyzed the heparin binding properties of TN-X by mapping the heparin-binding site(s) within the molecule using recombinant proteins. In comparison with the localization of the heparin binding site in TN-C, we have produced the recombinant Fbg domain in bacterial or eukaryotic cells and found no interaction with heparin. Sequence analysis of TN-X showed that two successive FN III domains are positively charged at physiological pH (domains 10 and 11). We produced a set of recombinant proteins containing this region and localized one heparin binding site to these domains, the residues crucial for this interaction being identified by site-directed mutagenesis. The efficiency of this site in the context of the whole TN-X molecule was analyzed by blocking experiments using antibodies specific for this region (domain 10). Finally, the physiological significance of this heparin binding site was tested by cell adhesion studies. Bovine TN-X was purified using a procedure previously described (21Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Boutillon M.M. Garrone R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, TN-X was extracted with 0.5 m NaCl and immunopurified on a column prepared with the 4E7 monoclonal antibody. Proteins nonspecifically bound to the column were desorbed with 1 mMgCl2, and TN-X was then eluted with 0.15 mNa2CO3, pH 12.0. After dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), purified TN-X was stored at −70 °C. Recombinant proteins encompassing FNIII modules of bovine TN-X are termed FNXn, where ncorresponds to the repetition(s) used. For this study, we used the previously described recombinant fragments FNX9, FNX10, and FNX9-10 (25Elefteriou F. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Lethias C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and generated new recombinant proteins containing the FNIII b11 repeat, i e., FNX11, FNX10-11, and FNX9-10-11. The DNA coding for the new proteins was amplified by PCR and cloned in the overproducing plasmid pT7/7-His6 as previously described. The oligonucleotides used in the PCR reaction were FNIII b9-forward (25Elefteriou F. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Lethias C. Eur. J.

Garrone R. Lethias C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with the exception that here the IPTG induction was carried out at 37 °C for 3 h instead of overnight at room temperature. The His-tagged proteins were purified in two chromatographic steps. first using a metal affinity column and second using an ion exchange MonoQ (FNX9 and FNX9-10) or Mono-S (FNX10, FNX11, FNX10-11, FNX9-10-11) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Production and purification of the fibrinogen domain (FbgX) in bacteria has been previously described (25Elefteriou F. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Lethias C. Eur. J.

In the first step, one primer contains the mutation, whereas the second is one of two oligonucleotides used to generate the wild type construct. The first PCR fragment, gel purified, is then used as a primer during the second PCR together with the wild type oligonucleotide opposite to that used in PCR1.Table INucleotide sequences of primers used for mutagenesisFNIII domainMutated residueSequence of internal oligonucleotideFNX 10Arg485′-GGGCCCATCCTGGTCCTTGAA-3′Lys845′-GGCCATGGCGCCTCGAGCCCAGGAGGCC-3′Arg855′-GGGGCCATGGCGCTGCTTGCCCAGGAGG-3′Arg865′-GAGGGGGCCATGCTGCCTCTTGCCCAGG-3′Lys84 and Arg855′-GCCATGGCGCTGCGAGCCCAGG-3′Arg85 and Arg865′-GGGCCATGCTGCTGCTTGCCCA-3′Lys84 and Arg865′-GGGGGCCATGCTGCCTCGAGCC-3′FNX 11Arg35′-CACAGAGACCCAGAGAGCTGTG-3′Arg45′-GAGACCCGCCAAGCTGTGGATG-3′Lys125′-GAGGCTGGAACAAGCCGTCCCTC-3′Arg135′-GGAACAAAGCAGCCCTCAAAA-3′Lys165′-CGTCCCTCAAGCCCACGTCTGG-3′Arg185′-CTCAAAACCACAGCTGGGGGAG-3′Arg905′-CGGGCTGTCCCAGGACAAGCGA-3′Lys12 and Arg135′-GGAACAAGCCAGCCCTCAAAAC-3′Mutated bases are underlined. Open table in a new tab Mutated bases are underlined. A DNA fragment encoding the Fbg domain was amplified by PCR using Goldstar polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) and FbgX as matrix. The sequence of the sense primer (5′-TATGGCCCAGCCGGCCGGTGGGCTGCGGATCCCCTTCC-3′) introduced aSfiI restriction site (underlined) at the 5′ end of the PCR fragment and allowed in-frame cloning with the Igκ-chain leader sequence. The antisense primer (5′-TATGGGCCCGCCTCCCCTGCCCAGGGGCCGGTAG-3′) introduced anApaI site (underlined) at the 3′ end of the DNA and permitted in-frame cloning with the c-myc and His6 tags. The PCR fragment was introduced between theSfiI and ApaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pSecTag2/hygro (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells were transfected with pSec-Fbg construct permitting the secretion of recombinant protein harboring c-myc and His6 tags at the C terminus (Invitrogen). Petri culture dishes (60 mm) with cells at half-confluency were rinsed twice in serum-free medium and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 5 ml of serum-free medium containing 33 μl of Perfect lipid ≠8 (Invitrogen) and 11 μg of DNA. After removing the transfection solution, the cells were incubated for 36 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Selection was then performed by adding 400 μg/ml hygromycin B in the culture medium. Clones were passaged in 24-well tissue culture plates, and the medium was checked for the presence of the Fbg domain. One milliliter of medium was incubated with 50 μl of Talon resin. The resin was rinsed in Tris-buffered saline and heated in Laemmli sample buffer. The supernatant was analyzed by Western blotting using routine procedures (21Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Boutillon M.M. Garrone R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the His6 tag. This antibody was obtained serendipitously by immunization with recombinant proteins corresponding to SURF modules of sea urchin fibrillar collagen, produced in a bacterial system using the same vector as for the FNX proteins (27Lethias C. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To produce the recombinant protein, HEK293 cells were cultured in serum-free conditions, and the medium was collected every 48 h. The medium was loaded on to a Talon metal affinity resin equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline, and elution was performed in the same buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. After dialysis against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, the eluate was further purified on a HiTrap Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Separation was achieved by elution with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 1m. Fractions containing the Fbg domain were pooled and dialyzed against PBS. Protein purity was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis where it was estimated to be greater than 90%. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm. 96-well microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) were coated overnight at +4 °C with purified bovine TN-X or recombinant proteins diluted in PBS. Wells were saturated with T-PBS-BSA (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with heparin-albumin-biotin (Sigma) in T-PBS-BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Extravidin, Sigma) diluted 1:2000. After the last set of rinses, bound peroxidase was detected with H2O2 and 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. Experiments were repeated three to five times. Each data point represents the mean of duplicate or triplicate determination. For inhibition experiments, incubation with antibodies was performed for 1 h before adding the heparin-albumin-biotin complex. Detection of bound heparin was performed as described above. 30 μg of recombinant FNX10-11 fragments dissolved in buffer A (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl) were loaded onto a Hi-Trap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 0.8 ml/min using a high performance liquid chromatography system (Waters). The column was extensively washed with buffer A. Retained proteins were then eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.1–1 m NaCl in buffer A) with constant monitoring of absorbance at 280 nm. Parental CHO-K1 and mutant CHO-677 and CHO-745 cell lines, developed by Esko et al. (28Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), were purchased from the American Type Cell Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in F12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Cell adhesion to protein adsorbed to microtiter plates was tested according to a previously described procedure (19Elefteriou F. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Lethias C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22866-22874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), except that cells were suspended using a nonenzymatic dissociation solution (Sigma). Inhibition experiments with GAGs were performed by incubating the FNX10-11 substrate for 15 min with heparin or chondroitin sulfate that was diluted in serum-free medium before adding cells to the plates. The data points are expressed as means of triplicates, and each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. A working model of each of the FNIII-like domains b10 and b11 was constructed based on sequence comparison with known three-dimensional structures of FNIII repeats available from the protein data base at RCSB. The program CLUSTAL W (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55749) Google Scholar) was used to align the FNIII repeats as independent domains with the following Protein Data Bank codes: 1fnf, 1ttg, 1fna, 1mfn, 1ten,1cfb, and laz7. The alignment was reformatted, and 10 slightly varying three-dimensional models from each domain were calculated with the modeling program MODELLER4 (30Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10561) Google Scholar) on an ORIGIN2000 work station (Silicon Graphics Inc.) applying molecular dynamics with standard parameters. The 10 models of each domain were visually inspected with the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and then averaged and energy minimized with the program X-PLOR (32Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) to obtain a single model of each FNIII domain. Molecular properties of the three working models, such as potential surface or side chain interactions, were visualized with the freely available program “WebLab viewer Light” (Molecular Simulations Inc.) on a standard PC. After two successive purifications by metal affinity resin and ion exchange chromatography, purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, confirming the excellent level of purity for each protein (Fig. 1). The apparent molecular masses of the recombinant FbgX domain produced in E. coliand in 293 cells were slightly different. The higher mass of the protein expressed in mammalian cells was due to (i) the additionalc-myc tag introduced by the pSecTag2/Hygro expression vector and (ii) the glycosylation that occurred in eukaryotic cells. Indeed, the analysis of the primary sequence of bovine TN-X allowed us to predict a N-glycosylation site in the Fbg domain, namely the NIS sequence located at residues 76–78 from this domain (19Elefteriou F. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Lethias C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22866-22874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The presence of these additional sugars was confirmed by staining gels with Schiff's reagent (data not shown). Prior to the mapping of the heparin binding site, we tested the ability of TN-X, purified from embryonic bovine skin, to interact with heparin. As shown in the solid phase assay (Fig.2), the heparin biotin-complex was retained in the wells coated with TN-X in a dose-dependent manner, with a saturation limit. We produced the individual C-terminal fibrinogen domain in a bacterial system (FbgX) and tested its interaction with heparin under the same conditions as intact TN-X. In this case, no interaction could be observed. Because this recombinant domain was recovered from the bacterial pellet after urea extraction and renaturation by dialysis, it is possible that this domain was not correctly folded and that we missed a conformational binding site present in this region. To circumvent this problem, we produced the same domain in mammalian cell cultures. As before, results in the solid phase heparin-binding test were negative, confirming that the fibrinogen domain was not responsible for the interaction of TN-X with heparin. To identify a heparin-binding site within TN-X, we tested the binding of recombinant domains spanning FNIII domains 9–11. This region was chosen because sequence analysis of both domains 10 and 11 predicted a positive charge at physiological pH. We tested the recombinant proteins in the solid phase assay, where it clearly appeared that the two domains 10 and 11 were necessary for interaction with heparin (Fig.3). Only the recombinant proteins FNX10-11 and FNX9-10-11 exhibited heparin binding activity, whereas the individual modules in FNX10, FNX11, or FNX9-10 did not. Interaction with heparin was also tested using soluble recombinant proteins loaded on to a heparin-Sepharose column (Fig.4). As expected, FNX10, FNX11, and FNX9-10 were found in the unbound fraction, and FNX10-11 and FNX9-10-11 were retained in the column. By elution with a linear NaCl gradient, both proteins were eluted as a single peak whose position corresponded to a concentration of 0.33 m NaCl. The same apparent affinity was observed when whole TN-X, purified from skin, was loaded on the heparin-affinity column (data not shown). When all recombinant proteins were loaded together in the column, the same result was obtained, suggesting that domains 10 and 11 must be contiguous in the same protein to generate a fully active heparin-binding site. A more careful examination of chromatograms in the unbound fractions suggested that domain 11 had an higher affinity for heparin than domain 10. Indeed, FNX11 protein was found in the late fractions during column washing (Fig. 4 A). To further map the heparin binding activity, we decided to produce recombinant FNX10-11 proteins bearing single or double mutations replacing basic residues Arg and Lys by Gln and Ser, respectively. First, we examined the primary structure of the two modules 10 and 11. One BBXB sequence, which had been determined to be a potential heparin binding site, was present in these two modules, but this sequence was found at a similar position in 13 of the 30 FNIII-like domains characterized in bovine TN-X (19Elefteriou F. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Lethias C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22866-22874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, this sequence was unlikely to be a major binding site in our system. In agreement with this hypothesis, our data clearly demonstrated that the site was conformational and involved both domains 10 and 11. Mutations were dictated by the predicted accessibility of positively charged residues according to our three-dimensional models of the isolated FNIII domains. The contributions of Arg3, Arg4, Lys12, Arg13, Lys16, and Arg18 located in the region connecting both domains 10 and 11 were tested. As shown in Fig.5, a cluster of basic residues was predicted in domain 11 that comprised Lys12, Arg13, and Arg90. An additional residue Arg18 was mutated as a control. In domain 10, the adjacent residues Arg84, Lys85, and Arg86that projected outwards in the three-dimensional model, located in a loop between the F and G β-sheets, were considered as good candidates for the interaction. These residues, together with Arg45, a control located on the other side of the module, were mutated. Mutation sites within domains 10 or 11 of FNX10-11 are summarized in TableI (see “Materials and Methods”). All mutants were tested by heparin-Sepharose chromatography, and their elution positions were compared with that of the wild type FNX10-11 protein. As shown in Table II, the most pronounced effect of a single mutation was observed for Lys16 of domain 11; this mutant was found in the unbound fraction of the heparin column. All other single mutations realized within this domain had negligible effects. Double mutants 12-13, 12-90, and 13-90 showed a very moderate decrease (from 63 to 77%) in heparin affinity, confirming that these residues were not crucial for interaction with heparin. In domain 10, mutation of Arg86resulted in strong inhibition of heparin binding because the protein was eluted at only 30% retention time compared with the wild type. Moreover, the cluster of basic residues 84–86 appeared important for heparin interaction because the double mutants 85-86 and 84-86 were not retained in the column.Table IIHeparin binding of mutated recombinant proteins FNX 10–11FNIII domainMutation(s)Retention%FNX 10Arg4887Lys8467Arg8559Arg8630Lys84 and Arg8552Arg85 and Arg860Lys84 and Arg860FNX 11Arg386Arg492Lys1281Arg1390Lys160Arg1892Arg9082Lys12 and Arg1363Lys12 and Arg9077Arg13 and Arg9075As a result of site-directed mutagenesis, Lys and Arg residues were replaced respectively by Ser and Gln.

J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hove-Jensen B. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1487-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Certain microorganisms also utilize PRPP for the synthesis of methanopterin or polyprenylphosphate pentoses (3White R.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3447-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Sherman M.S. Kalbe-Bournonville L. Bush D. Xin Y. Deng L. McNeil M. J. Biol.

Fernandes J.F. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 230: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PRPP synthase is encoded by the PRS gene(s). Eukaryotic organisms usually contain more than one PRS gene. Analysis of a cDNA library as well as genome sequencing have revealed the presence of at least five PRS genes in the flowering plantArabidopsis thaliana (Ref. 6Krath B.N. Eriksen T.A. Poulsen T.S. Hove-Jensen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, GenBankTM/EBI database accession no. AC004521). Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) appears to contain at least fourPRS genes, coding for PRPP synthase isozyme 1 to 4, all of which have enzymatic activity. This was established by analysis of a cDNA library for complementation of an Escherichia coli Δprs allele (7Krath B.N. Hove-Jensen B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 2 and 3 contain 76 and 87 additional amino acids at their N-terminal ends, respectively, compared with spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 4 and PRPP synthases from E. coli (8Hove-Jensen B. Harlow K.W. King C.J. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6765-6771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Bacillus subtilis(9Nilsson D. Hove-Jensen B. Arnvig K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), or man (10Roessler B.J. Bell G. Heidler S. Seino S. Becker M. Palella T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 193Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These transit peptides of the spinach PRPP synthases contain consensus motifs for maturation of the polypeptides during entry into organelles. Experimental evidence and amino acid sequence comparison revealed that spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 2 was found within the chloroplast, whereas isozyme 3 appeared to be located within the mitochondrion and isozyme 4 in the cytosol. The location of spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 1 is unknown. The deduced N-terminal sequence of the presumed mature isozyme 3 polypeptide is Asn-Ser-Val-Glu-Phe; the polypeptide contains 320 amino acids, and has a calculated molecular mass of 35,497 Da. This value is similar to that for PRPP synthases from most other organisms (7Krath B.N. Hove-Jensen B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present work we report the properties of spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3. The enzyme was synthesized in E. coli and was specified by a gene, which had been manipulated to make the gene product resemble the presumed mature polypeptide, i.e.without a transit peptide. Spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 and the “classical” PRPP synthases from E. coli, B. subtilis,and man differ greatly in their specificity for diphosphoryl donor, dependence of Pi for activity, and in their allosteric properties. We show that spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 belongs to a novel class of PRPP synthases, Class II. Oligonucleotides were provided by Hobolth DNA Syntese (Hillerød, Denmark). Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, PRPP and Rib-5-P from Sigma, and nucleotides from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]GTP, [α-32P]CTP, and [α-32P]UTP were obtained from PerkinElmer Biosystems. [γ-32P]ATP was prepared as previously described (11Jensen K.F. Houlberg U. Nygaard P. Anal.

Episome transfer was performed by mixing exponentially growing cultures of HO773 and XL1-Blue in a 50:1 ratio at 37 °C. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h leucine prototrophic-tetracycline resistant exconjugants were selected. Cells were grown at 37 °C in NZY broth (13Hove-Jensen B. Maigaard M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 174: 6852-6865Crossref Google Scholar). When necessary the culture medium was supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg liter−1), tetracycline (10 mg liter−1), isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (5 μm), or NAD (40 mg liter−1). Cell growth was monitored in an Eppendorf PCP6121 photometer as absorbance at 436 nm. An optical density at 436 nm of 1 (1-cm path length) corresponds to ∼3 × 1011cells liter−1. To construct pBK862, DNA of pBK843 (7Krath B.N. Hove-Jensen B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was digested by restriction endonucleases BstBI and EcoRV. The resulting DNA fragments were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and the 1048-base pair DNA fragment containingPRS3 was cut out and purified (Qiagen). Ten picomoles of each of the oligodeoxyribonucleotides 5′-AATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACTATGAATTCCGTCGAGTTTT (MNS) and 5′-CGAAAACTCGACGGAATTCATAGTTAATTTCTCCTCTTTAATG (MNS-komp) were annealed by heating to 95 °C and slowly cooled to 0 °C. This annealing resulted in the formation of a double-stranded DNA fragment withEcoRI and BstBI overhangs. The underlined nucleotides of the MNS oligodeoxyribonucleotide indicate the codons specifying the N-terminal end of the presumed mature spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 polypeptide. DNA of pUHE23-2 2H. Bujard, University of Heidelberg, personal communication. was digested by restriction endonucleases PvuII and EcoRI. The three DNA species were mixed and ligated by T4 DNA ligase (Promega), transformed (14Mandel M. Higa A. J. Mol.

Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1487-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the resulting plasmid (pBK862) was confirmed by sequencing using an Abi Prism 310 DNA Sequencer as recommended by the supplier (PerkinElmer). Two liters of NZY broth supplemented with ampicillin, tetracycline, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were inoculated with 100 ml of overnight culture of strain HO1088/pBK862 and incubated with shaking for 20 h. The following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells (6 g of wet weight) were harvested by centrifugation (Sorvall, GS3 rotor) at 6000 rpm for 12 min, washed in 0.9% NaCl, collected by centrifugation (Sorvall, SS34 rotor), resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6 and homogenized for 6 ×1 min in a Soniprep ultrasonic disintegrator (Measuring and Scientific Equipment, model 150). Debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. Streptomycin sulfate (10% w/v in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.6) was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant fluid was 45% saturated with solid (NH4)2SO4. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant fluid was 65% saturated with solid (NH4)2SO4. After centrifugation, the precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, and an equal volume of a solution of 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 was added. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6 and applied to a column (1.0 × 25 cm) of Dyematrex Gel Blue B (Millipore). After washing the column with three volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6 protein was eluted at 1 ml min−1 with a 50-ml linear 0.0–0.5 m KCl gradient in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6. Fractions containing PRPP synthase activity were combined and applied to a DE52 anion exchange column (Whatman; 1.0 × 30 cm). Protein was eluted at 1 ml min−1 with a 100-ml linear 0.0–0.5m NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6. Fractions containing PRPP synthase activity were combined, concentrated by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6 containing 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. The purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid procedure with chemicals provided by Pierce (16Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18792) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Amino acid sequencing by automated Edman degradation was performed by the Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition, Technical University of Denmark. PRPP synthase activity was assayed at 37 °C as follows: Extract or enzyme (10 μl), appropriately diluted, was mixed with 40 μl of a reaction mixture (both prewarmed at 37 °C) containing radiolabeled (deoxy)ribonucleoside triphosphate (1 kBq per assay), Rib-5-P, MgCl2 or MnCl2, 20 mm NaF (omitted after chromatography in DE52), 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6. Unless otherwise indicated the concentrations of ATP, Rib-5-P, and MgCl2 (or MnCl2) were 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mm, respectively. Samples (10 μl) were removed at intervals and mixed with 5 μl of 0.33 m HCOOH. This 15 μl was applied to polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Baker-flex, J. T. Baker) and dried. When [γ-32P]ATP was used as diphosphoryl donor, PRPP and ATP were separated by thin layer chromatography in 0.85 m KH2PO4, which had been previously adjusted to pH 3.4 with 0.85 mH3PO4, as solvent. When [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]GTP, [α-32P]CTP, or [α-32P]UTP were used as diphosphoryl donors, chromatography was performed as follows: CH3OH (2 cm), 1 m CH3COOH (2 cm), and 0.9 m CH3COOH-0.3 m LiCl (16 cm) (17Randerath K. Randerath E. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 13: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Hove-Jensen B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6852-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By this procedure [32P](deoxy)ribonucleoside triphosphate was separated from [32P](deoxy)ribonucleoside monophosphate. Radioactivity was quantitated in an Instant Imager (Packard, model 2024). Results of initial velocity determinations and of product inhibition studies, both of which were the average of at least three determinations, were fitted to the following equations using the program UltraFit, (Biosoft, version 3.01). Equation 1 is the Michaelis-Menten equation for hyperbolic substrate saturation kinetics, whereas Equation 2 is the rate equation for a sequential Bi Bi mechanism. For competitive inhibition, noncompetitive inhibition, and substrate inhibition the initial velocities were fitted to Equations 3,4, and 5, respectively (19Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 173-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cleland W.W.

Calculation of the free Mg2+ concentration was performed as previously described (21Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2447-2458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA encoding the 87 codons specifying the presumed transit peptide of spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 were removed and replaced by an ATG triplet as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Nucleotide sequencing of pBK862 as well as amino acid sequencing of the purified recombinant PRPP synthase demonstrated its N-terminal amino acid sequence to be Met-Asn-Ser-Val-Glu-Phe. This was identical to the sequence of the presumed mature polypeptide with an additional methionine, which served as the translation initiation residue. Induction of expression of the resulting PRS3 allele, harbored in pBK862, resulted in overproduction of the enzyme. PRPP synthase was purified by (NH4)2SO4and polyethylene glycol precipitations, followed by affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. The yield was 7.2 mg of 95% pure enzyme with a specific activity of 13.1 μmol (min × mg of protein)−1. The enzyme required the presence of Mg2+ for activity. When ATP and Mg2+ were added at equimolar concentrations, the saturation curve for ATP appeared sigmoid. When Mg2+ was added at 2 mm excess of ATP an increase in enzyme activity was observed compared with the activity with equimolar concentrations of ATP and Mg2+, and the saturation curve for ATP appeared hyperbolic with a decrease in the Km for ATP. These results indicate that Mg2+ was required as a free cation to activate the enzyme and that the true substrate for the reaction was MgATP. The enzyme accepted Mn2+ as an alternative cation with an activity of 15% of that obtained with Mg2+. The enzyme was inactive with the following divalent cations: Ca2+, Cd2+, and Co2+. The activity of the enzyme was independent of Pi, and in addition no activation by Pi was observed as the activity of the enzyme remained at 11 μmol (min × mg of protein)−1 at Pi concentrations between 0 and 80 mm. The effect of pH on the activity was determined in the range 6.5–9.0 with Tris/HCl as buffer. The enzyme showed maximal activity at pH 7.6. The activity increased steeply up to pH 7.2 and decreased with a shallower slope above pH 7.6. The shape of the curve for the dependence of temperature on the activity was symmetrical with maximal activity at 40 °C. As a result of these analyses we chose to assay the activity of the enzyme at 37 °C, at pH 7.6 and at a free Mg2+concentration of at least 1.2 mm. Initial velocity versus the concentration of either ATP or Rib-5-P was found to follow typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. To determine whether the reaction occurred by a sequential or a ping-pong mechanism, the effect of the ATP concentration on the initial velocity was measured at different concentrations of Rib-5-P and vice versa. In double reciprocal plots of the data, intersecting lines indicated that the reaction followed a sequential mechanism (Fig. 1). The data were fitted to Equation 2 and resulted in a KATPvalue of 170 μm, a KRib-5-P value of 110 μm, and a Vmax value of 13.1 μmol (min × mg of protein)−1. The binding order was analyzed by product inhibition studies. Rib-5-P or ATP was varied at different fixed concentrations of the products PRPP or AMP. Inhibition by PRPP was competitive with respect to ATP (Fig. 2 A) and noncompetitive with respect to Rib-5-P (Fig. 2 B). Inhibition by AMP was noncompetitive with respect to both ATP and Rib-5-P (Fig. 2,C and D). The calculated inhibition constants are given in Table I. The data agree with a steady-state ordered Bi Bi mechanism in which ATP binds to the enzyme first, followed by Rib-5-P and a leaving order of products where AMP release is followed by release of PRPP.Table IInhibition constants and mode of inhibition of PRPP synthaseSubstrateInhibitorMode of inhibitionKisKiiμmμmATPAMPaThe concentration of ATP was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 2.0 mm AMP, 3.0 mm Rib-5-P, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.non competitive1620 ± 5002170 ± 390ATPPRPPbThe concentration of ATP was varied from 0.1 to 2.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 2.0 mm PRPP, 3.0 mm Rib-5-P, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.competitive520 ± 50ATPADPcThe concentration of ATP was varied from 0.2 to 2.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 2.0 mm ADP, 3.0 mm Rib-5-P, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.competitive680 ± 50Rib-5-PAMPdThe concentration of Rib-5-P was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 1.0 mm AMP, 2.0 mm ATP, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.non competitive450 ± 1801130 ± 300Rib-5-PPRPPeThe concentration of Rib-5-P was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 2.0 mm PRPP, 1.0 mm ATP, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.non competitive820 ± 3601700 ± 450Rib-5-PADPfThe concentration of Rib-5-P was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 2.0 mm ADP, 1.0 mm ATP, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.non competitive1220 ± 2002290 ± 230Inhibition constants were determined as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Standard errors are those given by the computer program.1-a The concentration of ATP was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 2.0 mm AMP, 3.0 mm Rib-5-P, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.1-b The concentration of ATP was varied from 0.1 to 2.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 2.0 mm PRPP, 3.0 mm Rib-5-P, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.1-c The concentration of ATP was varied from 0.2 to 2.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 2.0 mm ADP, 3.0 mm Rib-5-P, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.1-d The concentration of Rib-5-P was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 1.0 mm AMP, 2.0 mm ATP, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.1-e The concentration of Rib-5-P was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 2.0 mm PRPP, 1.0 mm ATP, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.1-f The concentration of Rib-5-P was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mm in the presence of 0.0 to 2.0 mm ADP, 1.0 mm ATP, and 5.0 mmMgCl2.

Spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 readily accepted nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP as diphosphoryl donors. Saturation with dATP, CTP, or UTP followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and data were fitted to Equation 1. With GTP, substrate inhibition was observed (Fig.3). The calculated kinetic constants,Km, Vapp, andKi for GTP, are shown in TableII. The Km values for dATP, CTP, and UTP varied little from KATP, whereas the Km value for GTP was 3- to 4-fold higher. The Vapp values for CTP and UTP were 10% of Vmax (Table II). As a result dATP and ATP were essentially equally effective as diphosphoryl donors, whereas GTP, CTP, and UTP were less efficient compared with ATP.Table IIKinetic constants of PRPP synthase for diphosphoryl donors other than ATPDiphosphoryl donorKmaThe concentration of dATP, GTP, CTP, or UTP was varied from 0.125 to 8.0 mm at 3.0 mm Rib-5-P and MgCl2 in at least 2 mmexcess of diphosphoryl donor concentration.VappKiμmμmol (min × mg)−1μmdATP233 ± 1312.8 ± 0.1GTP650 ± 2806.9 ± 1.7350 ± 160CTP116 ± 201.5 ± 0.1UTP137 ± 201.2 ± 0.02Kinetic constants were determined as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Standard errors are those given by the computer program.a The concentration of dATP, GTP, CTP, or UTP was varied from 0.125 to 8.0 mm at 3.0 mm Rib-5-P and MgCl2 in at least 2 mmexcess of diphosphoryl donor concentration. Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants were determined as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Standard errors are those given by the computer program. In contrast to the diphosphoryl donor, the enzyme was strictly specific for the ribose moiety. Thus, activity of the enzyme with deoxyribose 5-phosphate as substrate was undetectable. ADP and in some cases GDP, are potent inhibitors of PRPP synthases from a variety of organisms. Both of these ribonucleotides also inhibited spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3. However, both ADP (Fig.4 A and Table I) and GDP (data not shown) were linear competitive inhibitors of ATP saturation. Furthermore inhibition by ADP was noncompetitive with respect to Rib-5-P (Fig. 4 B and Table I). The inhibitory effect of GTP on PRPP synthase activity was analyzed further (Fig.5). The results are interpreted as simple competitive inhibition of binding of ATP by GTP. TheKiGTP value at a given ATP concentration can be estimated as [ATP] ×KmGTP/KATP. At 1 mm ATP this value is 3.8 mm, whereas at 3 mm ATP the value is 11.5 mm. Both values are consistent with those extrapolated from the data of Fig. 5. Thus, ATP relieved the inhibition by GTP. This indicates that the cause of substrate inhibition by GTP most likely resulted from the formation of a catalytically noncompetent complex of two or more GTP molecules bound in the active site.Figure 5Inhibition of PRPP synthase activity by GTP. Activity was determined with [γ-32P]ATP as described in “Experimental Procedures.” The concentration of Rib-5-P was 3 mm, whereas the concentration of MgCl2 was 2 mm in excess of the total ribonucleoside triphosphate concentration. The concentration of unlabeled GTP was varied from 0.0 to 3.0 mm at an ATP concentration of 5.0 mm (●), 3.0 mm (▪), or 1.0 mm (▴).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Neither tryptophan nor histidine (up to 8 mm, each), which are also products of the PRPP consuming pathways, inhibited the activity of spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3. We here show that spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 had properties very different from other well characterized PRPP synthases. These properties were independence of Pi for activity and stability, lack of allosteric inhibition, and relaxed specificity for diphosphoryl donor. The classical PRPP synthases share common properties, among others, of being dependent on Pi for maximal activity and being allosterically inhibited by ADP. In fact evidence has accumulated, which indicate that Pi and ADP both bind to the same allosteric site. This evidence comes from results of characterization of six point mutations of human PRPP synthase 1. These mutant variants are associated with gouty arthritis because of overproduction of purine compounds. The mutant forms are less sensitive or insensitive to ADP inhibition and simultaneously are activated by lower concentrations of Pi than the normal enzyme (22Becker M.A. Smith P.R. Taylor W. Mustafi R. Switzer R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition the crystal structure of B. subtilis PRPP synthase has been obtained either in complex with α, β-methylene ADP, an analog of ADP, or with SO42−, an analog of Pi. In these two complexes the β-phosphorus of α, β-methylene ADP and SO42− occupy the same position (23Eriksen T.A. Kadziola A. Bentsen A.-K. Harlow K.W. Larsen S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Finally, analysis of ADP inhibition of Piactivation of E. coli PRPP synthase suggests that the two compounds bind to the same site (24Willemoës M. Hove-Jensen B. Larsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35408-35412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The present work demonstrates that the activity of spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 was independent of Pi and that the enzyme was inhibited by ADP only in a manner competitive with ATP. This is in contrast to the complex ADP inhibition found for the Salmonella typhimurium PRPP synthase (25Switzer R.L. Sogin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 242: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Together these observations suggest that spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 lacks a functional allosteric site for ribonucleoside diphosphates. GTP also inhibited spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3. This effect appeared to be caused by binding of two molecules of GTP to the active site. Similar observations have been done with various nucleotides inhibiting PRPP synthase from S. typhimurium (25Switzer R.L. Sogin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 242: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). From the data in Fig. 5, we conclude that there seems to be no alternative allosteric binding site to which binding of GTP will inhibit the enzyme activity. In addition, the classical PRPP synthases use ATP exclusively as diphosphoryl donor, except for the mammalian enzymes, which may also use dATP (26Fox I.H. Kelly W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5739-5748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Roth D.G. Shelton E. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 291-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to this, spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 had a much broader specificity toward diphosphoryl donor by using, in addition to ATP or dATP, GTP or the pyrimidine ribonucleoside triphosphates CTP or UTP. The amino acid sequence identity of spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 with the classical PRPP synthases from E. coli, S. typhimurium, B. subtilis, and mammalian sources is low. Thus, the identity of spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 with E. coli and B. subtilis PRPP synthases and human PRPP synthase 1 is 23–25%, whereas the identity of E. coli PRPP synthase with B. subtilis PRPP synthase and human PRPP synthase 1 is 52 and 49%, respectively. Based on amino acid sequence comparison we previously suggested a distinction between Class I (i.e. classical) PRPP synthases and Class II PRPP synthases (6Krath B.N. Eriksen T.A. Poulsen T.S. Hove-Jensen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This low sequence identity of spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 with the classical PRPP synthases is reflected in the dramatic differences in enzymatic properties between spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 and the classical PRPP synthases reported in the present work. Class II appears to be specific for plants and contains a few other members: spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 4, A. thaliana PRPP synthase isozymes 3 and 4. These PRPP synthases have been shown to be independent of Pi for activity (6Krath B.N. Eriksen T.A. Poulsen T.S. Hove-Jensen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Krath B.N. Hove-Jensen B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Six additional partial sequences with high homology to spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 have been identified by database search. All of these sequences originate from plant sources (GenBankTM/EBI accession no. AI973393(maize), AW620825 (soybean), AW696707 (barrel medic), BE041040 (rice),BE341210 (potato), and H75122 (loblolly pine)). Spinach and A. thaliana contain at least two and three additional PRPP synthases, respectively. Enzymatic analysis or amino acid sequence comparison showed that these enzymes belong to Class I (6Krath B.N. Eriksen T.A. Poulsen T.S. Hove-Jensen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Krath B.N. Hove-Jensen B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 also shares common properties with the classical PRPP synthases. The kinetic mechanism of spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 was steady-state ordered Bi Bi with MgATP binding first and PRPP leaving last similar to that shown previously forS. typhimurium and E. coli PRPP synthases (21Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2447-2458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Willemoës M. Hove-Jensen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5078-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 required free Mg2+ as an activator, similar to what has been shown for the bacterial and human PRPP synthases (8Hove-Jensen B. Harlow K.W. King C.J. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6765-6771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Switzer R.L. J. Biol.

Hove-Jensen B. Switzer R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Previous reports on plant PRPP synthases describe some properties of an enzyme purified 14-fold from spinach leaves (30Ashihara H. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1977; 83: 379-392Crossref Google Scholar) or an enzyme purified from rubber tree latex (31Gallois R. Prévôt J.-C. Clément A. Jacob J.-L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The latter enzyme apparently is different from all other PRPP synthases in size and specific activity. The molecular mass of the subunit is estimated as 57,000 Da, compared with 35,497 Da of spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3. The activity of the purified rubber tree latex enzyme is 0.7 μmol (min × mg of protein)−1, which is much lower than the 13 and 170 μmol (min × mg of protein)−1 determined for the spinach PRPP synthase isozyme 3 and E. coli PRPP synthase (28Willemoës M. Hove-Jensen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5078-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), respectively. It is very likely that these preparations of PRPP synthases from spinach leaves and from rubber tree latex are composed of more than one subunit species. In contrast, we used a highly purified enzyme specified by an allele of the spinach PRS3cDNA in the present work. We thank Robert L. Switzer for careful reading of the manuscript, Martin Willemoës for invaluable discussions and for careful reading of the manuscript, and Tonny D. Hansen for excellent technical assistance."

When the intracellular iron concentration decreases, an iron-sulfur cluster necessary for aconitase activity is disassembled, which then activates the RNA binding site. IRP-2 has 57% overall amino acid identity to IRP-1 but contains an additional 73-amino acid insertion and is not converted to an inactive form under iron-replete conditions (5Guo B., Yu, Y.

The natural IREs all contain the hairpin loop sequence CAGWGH (where W is A or U and H is C, A, or U; Fig. 1 A) that is necessary for high affinity binding to both IRPs. NMR and in vitro selection results indicate that the first and fifth positions of the hairpin loop form a Watson-Crick pair. A disordered C nucleotide is present in all identified natural IREs five base pairs from the hairpin loop (Fig.1 A, C-12) and has been assumed to directly contact the IRPs. In most IREs, the C is a single bulge in the helix of the IRE stem (32Addess K.J. Basilion J.P. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Pardi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but it is also found as part of a larger dynamic internal loop (31Gdaniec Z. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This internal loop increases binding affinity for the IRPs and has been proposed to be part of a Mg2+ binding site that could affect the conformation of the hairpin (33Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that a U or G can substitute for the C with little effect on binding to IRP-1 provided that additional nucleotides are also present within the bulged loops. Results are more consistent with a role for the IRE bulge/bulge loop in positioning the hairpin for optimal IRP-1 binding rather than in directly contacting the protein.DISCUSSIONThe absolute conservation of the CAGWGH hairpin loop within the RNAs selected from the starting 50N RNA population emphasizes the importance of this sequence, and it is remarkable that more highly divergent RNAs were not obtained given the available sequence space. However, the selection was set-up to isolate the highest affinity IRP-1 binders, and as a result RNAs with dramatically different conformations and lower binding affinities, analogous to those that interact with theE. coli aconitase (47Tang Y. Guest J.R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3069-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), would not have been selected. In addition, high affinity binding RNAs requiring significantly more sequence space than the IRE may have been underrepresented within the starting RNA pool. Other unintended biases such as the impact of the flanking PCR primer sequences also have to be considered, and as a result the possibility of additional high affinity IRP-binding RNA motifs cannot be excluded. Alternatively, the binding affinity of the natural IRE to an IRP is one of the strongest known RNA-protein interactions, and the CAGWGH hairpin loop may simply be an integral part of the best possible IRP binding RNAs.The in vitro selections and mutagenesis indicated that the addition of a CA to the 3′-end of the hairpin loop only results in a 2-fold decrease in binding of the ferritin IRE and selected U-bulge RNA (Fig. 1). Previous insertions to the hairpin loop had a significantly greater detrimental effect (23Jaffrey S.R. Haile D.J. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4627-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 48Kikinis Z. Eisenstein R.S. Bettany A.J. Munro H.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4190-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, these RNAs had nucleotides added to both the 5′- and 3′-sides of the hairpin loop, and it is likely that the location and size of the insertion as well as the sequence bias against G (Fig. 3 B) affects the relative impact of the insertions. This is supported by the absence of insertions at other locations within the hairpin loop of the RNAs obtained from the initial 50N selection.On the basis of limited in vitro selection and mutagenesis, it had previously been assumed that a bulged C was essential for high affinity binding of the IRE to the IRPs. The initial direction of this study used IRP-1 to test the hypothesis that there are additional high affinity variants of the IRE that could not have been detected by the previous studies. The internal bulges/loops that can compensate for a U or G at the bulge position make this point. Putative IREs with a G or U at the bulge position have also been identified within the crayfish ferritin mRNA (49Huang T.S. Melefors O. Lind M.I. Soderhall K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the trout ferritin mRNA (50Yamashita M. Ojima N. Sakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26908-26913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) respectively. Both putative IREs also have the potential to form internal loops although not with the same sequence as that described here (Fig. 3 B), and their physiological relevance has not yet been demonstrated. IRP-2 has previously been shown to be more sensitive to the presence of the internal loops than IRP-1 (41Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As a result, even though IRP-1 and IRP-2 are highly similar proteins with overlapping and similar binding affinities, it is possible that IRP-2 may not interact with the selected RNAs in the same manner as IRP-1.There are at least two mechanisms through which the internal loops could be facilitating the binding of the IRE variants containing a U or G substitution at the bulge position. First, the selected loops could provide binding energy by making direct contact with IRP-1, in effect compensating for the loss of contacts potentially provided by a bulged C. However, the tolerated sequence heterogeneity of the selected bulges/loops (Fig. 3 B) would argue against direct protein contacts. In addition, conservation of the CAGWGH hairpin loop, the similar IC50 (Krel) andKd, and chemical protections would argue against significant differences in the binding of the selected RNAs to IRP-1. Also, substitution of U-10 with a C in the selected U-bulge RNA does not significantly improve binding, which may have been expected if the selected loops were making additional contacts (Fig. 1 B). Alternatively, if the role of the ferritin IRE bulged C is to position the phylogenetically conserved hairpin loop for optimal binding, the selected loop nucleotides may provide another means of obtaining this conformation when there is a U or G at the bulge position. This is consistent with NMR results suggesting the internal loop influences the conformation of the hairpin loop (33Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, because the loss of one or more potential hydrogen bond contacts may only have a slight impact on Kd, the possibility that the bulged C of the ferritin IRE also makes some minor contacts with the protein cannot be completely excluded. Aconitase purified from Bacillus subtilis binds to a B. subtilis mRNA that has the potential to form an IRE-like structure containing the CAGWGH loop sequence but missing the canonical bulged C (51Alen C. Sonenshein A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10412-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This further suggests that the hairpin loop sequence is the central feature of the IRE-IRP interaction and implies that the internal bulge could have subsequently evolved to optimize the interaction. A decrease in cytosolic iron concentration can stimulate the RNA binding activity of two different iron regulatory proteins (IRP-1 and IRP-2).1 IRP-1 and cytoplasmic aconitase are the same protein, but the RNA binding and enzymatic activities are mutually exclusive (1Kaptain S. Downey W.E. Tang C. Philpott C. Haile D. Orloff D.G. Harford J.B. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. U. S.

When the intracellular iron concentration decreases, an iron-sulfur cluster necessary for aconitase activity is disassembled, which then activates the RNA binding site. IRP-2 has 57% overall amino acid identity to IRP-1 but contains an additional 73-amino acid insertion and is not converted to an inactive form under iron-replete conditions (5Guo B., Yu, Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Instead, interaction of aqueous iron within the 73-amino acid insertion results in oxidation of the protein and targeting for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (8Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This internal loop increases binding affinity for the IRPs and has been proposed to be part of a Mg2+ binding site that could affect the conformation of the hairpin (33Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that a U or G can substitute for the C with little effect on binding to IRP-1 provided that additional nucleotides are also present within the bulged loops. Results are more consistent with a role for the IRE bulge/bulge loop in positioning the hairpin for optimal IRP-1 binding rather than in directly contacting the protein. DISCUSSIONThe absolute conservation of the CAGWGH hairpin loop within the RNAs selected from the starting 50N RNA population emphasizes the importance of this sequence, and it is remarkable that more highly divergent RNAs were not obtained given the available sequence space. However, the selection was set-up to isolate the highest affinity IRP-1 binders, and as a result RNAs with dramatically different conformations and lower binding affinities, analogous to those that interact with theE. coli aconitase (47Tang Y. Guest J.R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3069-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), would not have been selected. In addition, high affinity binding RNAs requiring significantly more sequence space than the IRE may have been underrepresented within the starting RNA pool. Other unintended biases such as the impact of the flanking PCR primer sequences also have to be considered, and as a result the possibility of additional high affinity IRP-binding RNA motifs cannot be excluded. Alternatively, the binding affinity of the natural IRE to an IRP is one of the strongest known RNA-protein interactions, and the CAGWGH hairpin loop may simply be an integral part of the best possible IRP binding RNAs.The in vitro selections and mutagenesis indicated that the addition of a CA to the 3′-end of the hairpin loop only results in a 2-fold decrease in binding of the ferritin IRE and selected U-bulge RNA (Fig. 1). Previous insertions to the hairpin loop had a significantly greater detrimental effect (23Jaffrey S.R. Haile D.J. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4627-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 48Kikinis Z. Eisenstein R.S. Bettany A.J. Munro H.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4190-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, these RNAs had nucleotides added to both the 5′- and 3′-sides of the hairpin loop, and it is likely that the location and size of the insertion as well as the sequence bias against G (Fig. 3 B) affects the relative impact of the insertions. This is supported by the absence of insertions at other locations within the hairpin loop of the RNAs obtained from the initial 50N selection.On the basis of limited in vitro selection and mutagenesis, it had previously been assumed that a bulged C was essential for high affinity binding of the IRE to the IRPs. The initial direction of this study used IRP-1 to test the hypothesis that there are additional high affinity variants of the IRE that could not have been detected by the previous studies. The internal bulges/loops that can compensate for a U or G at the bulge position make this point. Putative IREs with a G or U at the bulge position have also been identified within the crayfish ferritin mRNA (49Huang T.S. Melefors O. Lind M.I. Soderhall K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the trout ferritin mRNA (50Yamashita M. Ojima N. Sakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26908-26913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) respectively. Both putative IREs also have the potential to form internal loops although not with the same sequence as that described here (Fig. 3 B), and their physiological relevance has not yet been demonstrated. IRP-2 has previously been shown to be more sensitive to the presence of the internal loops than IRP-1 (41Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As a result, even though IRP-1 and IRP-2 are highly similar proteins with overlapping and similar binding affinities, it is possible that IRP-2 may not interact with the selected RNAs in the same manner as IRP-1.There are at least two mechanisms through which the internal loops could be facilitating the binding of the IRE variants containing a U or G substitution at the bulge position. First, the selected loops could provide binding energy by making direct contact with IRP-1, in effect compensating for the loss of contacts potentially provided by a bulged C. However, the tolerated sequence heterogeneity of the selected bulges/loops (Fig. 3 B) would argue against direct protein contacts. In addition, conservation of the CAGWGH hairpin loop, the similar IC50 (Krel) andKd, and chemical protections would argue against significant differences in the binding of the selected RNAs to IRP-1. Also, substitution of U-10 with a C in the selected U-bulge RNA does not significantly improve binding, which may have been expected if the selected loops were making additional contacts (Fig. 1 B). Alternatively, if the role of the ferritin IRE bulged C is to position the phylogenetically conserved hairpin loop for optimal binding, the selected loop nucleotides may provide another means of obtaining this conformation when there is a U or G at the bulge position. This is consistent with NMR results suggesting the internal loop influences the conformation of the hairpin loop (33Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, because the loss of one or more potential hydrogen bond contacts may only have a slight impact on Kd, the possibility that the bulged C of the ferritin IRE also makes some minor contacts with the protein cannot be completely excluded. Aconitase purified from Bacillus subtilis binds to a B. subtilis mRNA that has the potential to form an IRE-like structure containing the CAGWGH loop sequence but missing the canonical bulged C (51Alen C. Sonenshein A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10412-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This further suggests that the hairpin loop sequence is the central feature of the IRE-IRP interaction and implies that the internal bulge could have subsequently evolved to optimize the interaction.

The Et-1 effect resulted from PLA2 production of an eicosanoid that inhibited Kir3. In this study, we show that Kir3 inhibition by eicosanoids is channel subunit-specific, and we identify the site within the channel required for arachidonic acid sensitivity. Activation of the G-protein-coupled MOR by the selective opioid agonist D-Ala2Glyol, enkephalin, released Gβγ that activated Kir3. The response to MOR activation was significantly inhibited by Et-1 activation of HETAR in homomeric channels composed of either Kir3.2 or Kir3.4. In contrast, homomeric channels of Kir3.1 were substantially less sensitive. Domain deletion and channel chimera studies suggested that the sites within the channel required for Et-1-induced inhibition were within the region responsible for channel gating. Mutation of a single amino acid in the homomeric Kir3.1 to produce Kir3.1(F137S)(N217D) dramatically increased the channel sensitivity to arachidonic acid and Et-1 treatment. Complementary mutation of the equivalent amino acid in Kir3.4 to produce Kir3.4(S143T)(D223N) significantly reduced the sensitivity of the channel to arachidonic acid- and Et-1-induced inhibition. The critical aspartate residue required for eicosanoid sensitivity is the same residue required for Na+ regulation of PIP2gating. The results suggest a model of Kir3 gating that incorporates a series of regulatory steps, including Gβγ, PIP2, Na+, and arachidonic acid binding to the channel gating domain.

G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate human endothelin A receptor mu opioid receptor D-Ala2Glyol, enkephalin endothelin-1 β-2 subunit of the G-protein phospholipase C The G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir3)1 provide essential regulation of neuronal and cardiac excitability (1Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By mediating the effects of acetylcholine, monoamine, and peptide receptor activation, Kir3 channels respond to a wide range of transmitters. The Kir3 family of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels consists of subunits (Kir3.1–Kir3.5) that can assemble to form functional heteromultimers. Kir3 channels share a common design characterized by cytoplasmic N and C termini and two transmembrane domains M1 and M2 that surround a potassium selective pore region (P or H5) (2Dascal N. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1 below). The activation of Kir3 is complex and not completely understood. Kir3 channels require the interaction of multiple components to produce channel activation, including Gβγ, Na+, the phospholipid PIP2, and ATP (3Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Medina I.

Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Huang and colleagues proposed that Gβγ activates Kir3 by stabilizing interactions between PIP2 and the potassium channel. They showed that PIP2 depletion blocks activation of Kir3 by both Gβγ and Na+ (8Huang C.L. Feng S.Y. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Both the stimulation and inhibition of Kir3 mediated by Gβγ were recently shown to depend on the type of β subunit in the dimer (9Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ATP is another regulatory element in Kir3 gating that presumably acts indirectly by maintaining phosphorylation of PIP2. The response to activation of Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 heteromultimers is rapidly inactivated (run down) when internal ATP is depleted. Sui et al. (10Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) show that Kir3 activity is ATP-dependent and is mediated by PIP2; moreover, ATP hydrolysis enables both Na+ and Gβγ activation (10Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These studies support the hypothesis that Kir3 gating components responsible for channel activation are interdependent. Kir3 normally exists as a heterotetramer, but the gating properties of individual subunits may be studied by using channel mutants able to form functional homomeric channels: Kir3.1(F137S) (11Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), Kir3.2(S146T) (12Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and Kir3.4(S143T) (13Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although members of Kir3 are similar in structure, one primary difference in the subunits is the presence of a Na+ activation site found in Kir3.2 and Kir3.4, which is not found in Kir3.1. Ho and Murrell-Lagnado (14Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 645-651Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol.

Substitution of asparagine for aspartate 226 in Kir3.2(D226N) abolished Na+-dependent activation for both the Kir3.2 homomer and Kir3.1/Kir3.2 heteromultimers without altering the amplitude of receptor activation (14Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 645-651Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8639-8648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ho and Murrell-Lagnado proposed that Na+ binding to an aspartic acid residue in Kir3.2 masks a nearby charged amino acid and permits PIP2binding. In contrast to the process of channel activation by PIP2, Na+, and Gβγ, the mechanism of arachidonic acid inhibition of Kir3 is less well defined. Arachidonic acid and its metabolites modulate several ion channels, including Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 heteromultimers in cardiac myocytes (16Kurachi Y. Ito H. Sugimoto T. Shimizu T. Miki I. Ui M. Nature. 1989; 337: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Unsaturated free fatty acids such as oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids inhibit Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 heteromultimers by blocking ATP-dependent gating in atrial cells (7Kim D. Pleumsamran A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We previously showed that arachidonic acid inhibits the potassium channel response to the mu opioid agonist DAMGO inXenopus oocytes expressing MOR and Kir3 heteromultimers (17Rogalski S.L. Cyr C. Chavkin C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Channel sensitivity to arachidonic acid depended on the channel subtype: heteromultimers consisting of Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 or Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 were more sensitive to arachidonic acid than heteromultimers consisting of Kir3.1 and Kir3.5. These results suggest that eicosanoids have direct effects on G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels by modification of the channel conformation, but the molecular basis for eicosanoid inhibition of Kir3 was not defined. In the present study, we explored the hypothesis that eicosanoids generated by HETA activation may directly modulate Kir3 gating. Using site-directed mutagenesis to identify the eicosanoid-sensitive regulatory site on the Kir3 channel, we provide evidence that eicosanoid-induced inhibition of Kir3 requires the Na+-dependent gating site. The rat mu opioid receptor clone was obtained from Dr. Lei Yu (GenBank™ accession number L13069). cDNA for the human endothelin A (HETA) receptor (GenBank™ accession number S67127) was obtained from Dr. Richard Kris. cDNAs for the Kir 3.1 (GIRK1) (GenBank™ accession number U01071) and Kir 3.2 (GIRK2) (GenBank™ accession number U11859) were obtained from Drs.

Mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase with complementary oligonucleotide primers incorporating the desired mutation. Positive clones were confirmed by automated sequencing. Plasmid templates for constructs were linearized prior to in vitro cRNA synthesis using mMESSAGE mMACHINE (Ambion Inc., TX). Healthy stage V and VI oocytes were harvested from mature anesthetized Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Ft. Atkinson, WI) and defolliculated enzymatically as described previously (18Leonard J.P. Snutch T.P. Chad J. Wheal H. Molecular Neurobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 161-182Google Scholar). The oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in standard oocyte buffer, ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma Chemical Co.). One day after harvest, each oocyte was injected with 50 nl of cRNA for the mu opioid receptor (MOR), human endothelin A receptor (HETA), and G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium channels. Recordings were made at least 48 h after cRNA injection. A Geneclamp 500 amplifier was used for standard two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments. The pCLAMP program (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Oocytes were removed from incubation medium, placed in the recording chamber containing ND96 medium, and clamped at −80 mV. Recordings were made in hK buffer (2 mm NaCl, 96 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Microelectrodes were filled with 3m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–1.0 MΩ. Currents were measured without leak subtraction. Individual comparisons of drug effects on Kir3 were conducted using oocytes from the same harvest and injection batch. Pharmacologic agents were perfused or placed directly into the bath from freshly made stock solutions. Stock solutions of arachidonic acid were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO); the final concentration of Me2SO applied to the oocytes was <0.02%. Arachidonic acid was stored at −70 °C until use. Nitrogen was bubbled through water prior to dissolving endothelin. Endothelin-1 and DAMGO were obtained from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA and were stored at −20 °C until use. Arachidonic acid and U73122 were from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA. Me2SO was from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO. Data are presented as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between results was calculated using ANOVA followed by a student's unpaired two-tailedt test. A probability of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Heterologous expression of MOR and Kir3 in Xenopusoocytes generated a malleable system for the study of channel activation (Fig. 2). Activation of the Gi/Go-coupled opioid receptors by the agonist DAMGO (1 μm) released Gβγ that activated Kir3 and produced a robust inward current (Fig.2 A). Activation of the heterologously expressed Gq-coupled endothelin receptor produced a cascade of signals that resulted in the reduction of the DAMGO-evoked response. To identify the Kir3 subunit conferring sensitivity to endothelin, we used the strategy developed by Logothetis and colleagues to generate functional homomeric Kir3 channels. Mutation in the pore of these channels, Kir3.1(F137S) and Kir3.4(S143T) greatly increased expression and the current evoked by the channel homomers. In agreement with Vivaudou and colleagues (13Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we noted that the wild type channel Kir3.4 does not produce functional currents when expressed alone inXenopus oocytes. In contrast, the homomer Kir3.4(S143T) (1 ng of cRNA/oocyte) produced a robust current with an average receptor-activated current of 1–2 μA in response to agonist. Although the wild type channel Kir3.1 (1 ng) forms functional channels with the intrinsic Xenopus subunit Kir3.5, the current response produced was small (50–100 nA) compared with the large currents (1–2 μA) produced by the functional homomer Kir3.1(F137S) (1 ng). These results are consistent with the conclusions of Vivaudouet al. (13Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) that the Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 currents are produced by the functional homomeric channel without combining with endogenous Kir3.5. Similarly, Kir3.2(S146T) (1 ng) produced larger currents (500 nA to 1 μA) compared with wild type Kir3.2 (100 nA) (1 ng), which normally forms a homomeric channel. Moreover, the point mutation of Kir3.2(S146T) served as a control as this mutation in the pore was similar to Kir3.1(F137S) and Kir3.4(S143T). Thus, oocytes expressing presumptive homomeric forms of Kir3.1, 3.2, and 3.4 were functional and were robustly activated by Gβγ released by mu opioid receptor activation. Oocytes expressing either Kir3.2(S146T) or Kir3.4(S143T) treated with Et-1 prior to the second DAMGO challenge showed a marked inhibition of the second opioid response (Fig. 2 B). The amplitude of the second opioid response in Kir3.2(S146T) homomers after Et-1 treatment was inhibited by 100 ± 0% (n = 9). The amplitude of the second opioid response in Kir3.4(S143T) homomers after Et-1 treatment was inhibited by 74 ± 5% (n = 18) (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the second opioid response in oocytes injected with Kir3.1(F137S) and treated with Et-1 prior to the second DAMGO challenge was not significantly inhibited. The amplitude of the second opioid response in Kir3.1(F137S) homomers after Et-1 treatment was 1 ± 11% (n = 16). The difference in endothelin sensitivity of the Kir3.1–3.5 heteromeric channel and the Kir3.1(F137S) channel supports the conclusion that the latter formed a functional homomer under these expression conditions. In addition, the channel type selectivity evident from this experiment further supports the conclusion that the endothelin-induced suppression of the DAMGO-activated response was caused by a direct modification of the channel. We previously showed that the PLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3 selectively blocked the endothelin receptor-mediated effect (17Rogalski S.L. Cyr C. Chavkin C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results suggested that an eicosanoid such as arachidonic acid produced by PLA2 activation following HETA receptor activation was responsible for channel inhibition. Another interpretation of our data was that the endothelin effect was caused by PLC-mediated PIP2depletion. To test the latter hypothesis, oocytes were pretreated with the PLC inhibitor U73122 (5 μm) (19Vickers J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 1156-1163PubMed Google Scholar) for 10 min and tested for endothelin sensitivity under conditions previously shown to inhibit PLC activity in oocytes (20Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The amplitude of the second opioid response in Kir3.4(S143T) homomers after Et-1 treatment was inhibited by 61 ± 5% (n = 8). Pretreatment with the PLC inhibitor U73122 (5 μm) did not block the inhibition of the second opioid response to Et-1. The amplitude of the second opioid response of Kir3.4(S143T) homomers after Et-1 treatment was inhibited by 66 ± 5% (n = 8) (not significantly different than in the absence of U73122). Thus, PLA2 activation and subsequent eicosanoid production likely caused the endothelin-induced inhibition. Furthermore, the results suggest that Kir3.2 and Kir3.4 were sensitive to the eicosanoid generated by PLA2 activation whereas Kir3.1 was not. To determine the basis for the insensitivity of Kir3.1(F137S) to endothelin receptor activation, the Et-1-insensitive Kir3.1 and Et-1-sensitive Kir3.4 sequences were aligned and compared. These Kir3 subunits share the most homology in the pore region and the greatest heterogeneity in the tail regions. Macica and colleagues (21Macica C.M. Yang Y. Hebert S.C. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F588-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Macica C.M. Yang Y. Lerea K. Hebert S.C. Wang W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F175-F181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified a serine residue in the distal N terminus in the inward rectifier ROMK1 that confers sensitivity to arachidonic acid. We wanted to test the hypothesis that an N-terminal residue was responsible for eicosanoid sensitivity of Kir3. Sequential truncations of the N terminus were made, and the effect of Et-1 on Kir3 activation was tested. Oocytes expressing a truncated Kir3.4(S143T) lacking amino acids 1–57 produced strong potassium currents and a robust response following DAMGO activation of MOR. The amplitude of the second opioid response in the channel with the N-terminal truncation Kir3.4(S143T)(Δ1–57) after Et-1 treatment was inhibited, a result not significantly different than the parent (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3 B). Truncation of the first 23 amino acids in Kir3.2 also did not block either the DAMGO activation or endothelin sensitivity (data not shown). In contrast, the C terminus of Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 differed significantly in both amino acid length and amino acid sequence. Chimeras composed of the Et-1-sensitive Kir3.4(S143T) N terminus and pore region with the Et-1-insensitive Kir3.1 C-terminal tail, Kir3.4(S143T)-(1–338)/Kir3.1-(333–501) and Kir3.4(S143T)-(1–249)/Kir3.1-(244–501), were used to define the region of endothelin sensitivity. The response to DAMGO of oocytes expressing the channel chimera Kir3.4(S143T)-(1–338)/Kir3.1-(333–501) was inhibited following Et-1 treatment. The sensitivity of the chimera was not significantly different from the parent channel Kir3.4(S143T) (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, the DAMGO response of oocytes expressing the chimera Kir3.4(S143T)-(1–249)/Kir3.1-(244–501) was inhibited following Et-1 treatment. The sensitivity of this chimera was also not significantly different from Kir3.4(S143T) (p > 0.05) (Fig.3 B). Thus, neither the N terminus nor the distal C terminus of Kir3 contained elements required for the Et-1-induced inhibition. The chimera and truncation data suggest that the channel domain responsible for endothelin sensitivity was within the proximal C-terminal region near the transmembrane domain M2. The proximal C-terminal domain of the channel contains sites responsible for Gβγ, PIP2, and Na+ gating (5Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 9Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8639-8648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After comparing the different Kir3 channels, we noted a correlation between endothelin sensitivity and Na+ gating sensitivity. Kir3.1 was substantially less sensitive to endothelin, whereas Kir3.2 and Kir3.4 were very sensitive (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, Kir3.1 is not gated by Na+, whereas Kir3.2 and Kir3.4 are gated by Na+ (5Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 14Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 645-651Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8639-8648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Based on this correlation, we explored the hypothesis that the Kir3 gating domain was important in the observed eicosanoid inhibition of Kir3. Na+ sensitivity was reported to depend on the presence of a critical aspartate residue in the gating domain (5Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 14Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 645-651Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8639-8648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Kir3.1(F137S) and Kir3.4(S143T)(D223N) lack the aspartate thought to be responsible for Na+ gating, and the corresponding channels Kir3.4(S143T) and Kir3.1(F137S)(N217D) contain this residue. These channel variants were produced and expressed in oocytes (Fig.4). We coexpressed either Na+-sensitive or Na+-insensitive channel mutants of Kir3.1 or Kir3.4 with cRNA for the MOR and cRNA for the human endothelin A receptor. The amplitude of the second opioid response in Kir3.1(F137S) (Na+-insensitive) homomers after Et-1 treatment was inhibited by 22 ± 5% (n = 18) (Fig. 4). The slightly greater sensitivity to Et-1 shown by Kir3.1(F137S) in this set of recordings compared with the data presented in Fig. 2 was not statistically different from the data shown in Fig. 1. The slight difference is attributed to normal seasonal variation in oocytes, and the increased sensitivity to Et-1 was also shown by Kir3.4(S143T). Introduction of the aspartate residue that confers Na+ sensitivity also dramatically increased endothelin sensitivity. Oocytes injected with Kir3.1(F137S)(N217D) (Na+-sensitive) and then treated with Et-1 prior to the second DAMGO challenge showed a marked inhibition of the second opioid response. The second opioid response after Et-1 treatment was inhibited by 82 ± 5% (n = 16) (p < 0.01). For Kir3.4, removal of the critical aspartate significantly reduced endothelin sensitivity (Fig. 4). The second mu opioid response after Et-1 activation in oocytes expressing the HETA receptor, the MOR and Kir3.4(S143T) (Na+-sensitive) was inhibited by 97 ± 1% (n = 7). Oocytes expressing Kir3.4(S143T)(D223N) (Na+-insensitive) treated with Et-1 prior to the second DAMGO challenge showed significantly less inhibition of the second opioid response; endothelin reduced the response to DAMGO by 63 ± 6% (n = 12). Kir3.4(S143T)(D223N) remains partially sensitive to endothelin treatment, but the sensitivity was significantly reduced compared with Kir3.4(S143T). These data indicate that a significant component of the endothelin sensitivity of Kir3 depended on the presence of the aspartate residue also responsible for Na+ gating. The residual sensitivity suggests that endothelin receptor activation may also inhibit Kir3 at other sites. The results suggested that endothelin activation of PLA2 produced an eicosanoid that inhibited Kir3 channels by interacting at the Na+ gating domain. Prior work showed that arachidonic acid was the most potent of the eicosanoids at inhibiting Kir3 in cardiac myocytes (7Kim D. Pleumsamran A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, we tested the effectiveness of arachidonic acid application on the Na+-sensitive and -insensitive Kir3 variants. In oocytes expressing the channel homomer Kir3.1(F137S), arachidonic acid (20 μm) did not inhibit the second DAMGO-elicited response of MOR (0 ± 3%). In oocytes expressing the channel with a site for Na+ activation, Kir3.1(F137S)(N217D), arachidonic acid produced an inhibition of the second opioid response; the second DAMGO response was inhibited by (26 ± 1%) (p < 0.05) (Fig.5). Moreover, arachidonic acid inhibited the Na+-sensitive Kir3.4(S143T) (18 ± 2%). compared with oocytes with the analogous Na+-site removed Kir3.4(143T)(D223N) (−2 ± 6%). These data support the hypothesis that eicosanoid inhibition of Kir3 was dependent on the presence of the Na+ gating site. The principal finding of this study is that arachidonic acid inhibited G-protein-gated potassium channels at the Na+/PIP2 gating domain. The identification of this mechanism helps clarify the effects of eicosanoids generated by phospholipase A2 activation, and the results provide new insights into the gating process controlling Kir3 function. Previous studies established that the elevation of Gβγ concentration following Gi/o-coupled receptor activation increases Kir3 conductance (23Henry D.J. Grandy D.K. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar). Gβγ was shown to work in concert with PIP2 to induce a conformational change in the channel and open the K+-selective pore. In addition to Gβγ, Kir3.2, and Kir3.4 channel subunits are activated by Na+ (14Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 645-651Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8639-8648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The results provide support for the hypothesis that arachidonic acid is an additional component, directly regulating Kir3 gating. The results obtained provide evidence that the production of an eicosanoid by endothelin receptor activation was responsible for the observed inhibition of Kir3 in this expression system. The HETAR is a Gq-coupled receptor that activates both PLC and PLA2 (24Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). As PLA2 metabolizes PIP2 to arachidonic acid (Fig.6), depletion of PIP2 could potentially result from endothelin receptor activation. Either mechanism could result in Kir3 channel inhibition, because the production of an eicosanoid (7Kim D. Pleumsamran A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or the depletion of PIP2(20Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) could reduce channel conductance. Meyer et al. (25Meyer T. Wellner-Kienitz M. Biewald A. Bender K. Eickel A. Pott L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5650-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) recently showed that endothelin receptor activation inhibits IK(ACh) in atrial myocytes, and this effect could be blocked by increasing the intracellular concentration of PIP2. They interpret their data to suggest that endothelin receptor activation of PLC results in PIP2 depletion and IK(ACh) inhibition; however the role of an eicosanoid in the endothelin effect was not considered and competition between activation by PIP2 and inhibition by arachidonic acid could explain their result (Fig. 6). Several lines of evidence exclude the explanation that depletion of PIP2 was responsible for the endothelin effect in oocytes. We found that PLC inhibition by U73122 did not block endothelin action. Our prior study showed that the PLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3 blocked endothelin effects (17Rogalski S.L. Cyr C. Chavkin C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The third observation is that the Kir3 subunit sensitivity to arachidonic acid matches endothelin sensitivity. Thus, our results support the conclusion that endothelin activation of PLA2 produces an eicosanoid that inhibits Kir3 rather than depletion of PIP2 required for channel activation. The specific eicosanoid generated by endothelin receptor activation inXenopus oocytes was not identified; however, arachidonic acid is a reasonable candidate based on its high potency shown by Kim and Pleumsamran (7Kim D. Pleumsamran A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, arachidonic acid exhibited an inhibition profile that was similar to that endothelin receptor activation (Fig. 5). We note that Kir3.4(S143T)(D223N) was not significantly affected by arachidonic acid application whereas Kir3.4(S143T)(D223N) had residual sensitivity to endothelin inhibition. The difference could either result from the possibility that endothelin acted by additional mechanisms or that the activation of the HETAR was a more efficient means to deliver the active eicosanoid than extracellular application of arachidonic acid. Consistent with the latter interpretation, the data showed that the inhibition produced by endothelin was more robust than that produced by arachidonic acid. These results suggest that the critical aspartate residue was not the sole determinant of endothelin effect. Additional site-directed mutagenesis would be required to define other residues in the binding pocket required for eicosanoid sensitivity. The basis for the inhibitory effects of eicosanoids on Kir3 conductance was not defined, but the study provides clues. The correlation between Na+ sensitivity and arachidonic acid sensitivity suggests that the binding site of eicosanoids is part of the domain controlled by the Na+ binding site. Moreover, the Na+ binding site also regulates PIP2binding. Because arachidonic acid shares structural features with PIP2, the PIP2 binding region of Kir3 may also bind arachidonic acid. The inhibition of gating caused by arachidonic acid may result from a competition with PIP2 for binding at this site. In the absence of structural data, we suggest the physical basis for the interaction between these gating components and the ion channel in a diagram (Fig. 6). Lei et al. (9Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) used mammalian cells transfected with Kir3 heterotetramers to show that Gβ5-containing dimers could inhibit Kir3. They suggested that Gβ5-containing dimers could competitively displace Gβγ binding in the proximal C terminus, a region near the putative eicosanoid binding site suggested in by the present study. Additional work will be required to further define the interaction between eicosanoids, Gβγ, and PIP2 at Kir3; however, our data show that the mechanism of Kir3 sensitivity to arachidonic acid differs from that reported for ROMK channels by Macica et al. (21Macica C.M. Yang Y. Hebert S.C. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F588-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Macica C.M. Yang Y. Lerea K. Hebert S.C. Wang W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F175-F181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The large Kir3.1(F137S) currents clearly showed that the channel was formed as a homomer consistent with prior reports (11Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The DAMGO-evoked currents produced in oocytes expressing the Kir3.1(F137S)(N217D) mutant were smaller (387 ± 142 nA) than those produced by Kir3.1(F137S) (1170 ± 98 nA). We interpret the increased sensitivity of Kir3.1(F137S)(N217D) to endothelin and arachidonic acid as resulting from the introduction of the critical aspartate residue required for eicosanoid binding. Although Kir 3.1 may form channels with endogenous Kir3.5, we did not exclude the less likely interpretation that the Kir3.1(F137S)(N217D) channel formed endothelin-sensitive heteromers with Kir3.5. We used a sequence alignment program to compare the Na+-insensitive Kir3.1 with the Xenopus homologue, Kir3.5. When Kir3.5 is aligned with Kir3.1, we note that Kir3.5 contains the critical aspartate that is required for Na+ activation of the channel (BCM Search Launcher, Baylor College of Medicine). Thus, we would expect that any heteromultimers composed of Kir3.1(F137S)(N217D) and Kir3.5 would be arachidonic acid-sensitive. This explains the sensitivity of Kir3.1 and Kir3.5 heteromultimers (Fig. 2). Future single channel recordings would resolve this question. We explored the mechanism of endothelin receptor-induced inhibition of mu opioid receptor activation of Kir3 in vitro. AlthoughXenopus oocytes are a complex expression system with interacting signaling molecules, insights to Kir3 gating mechanisms are evident from these results. The endothelin receptor is one member of the Gq-coupled seven-transmembrane superfamily of receptors (24Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). Other Gq receptors that regulate Kir3 by eicosanoid production may also require specific gating components to exert effects on the channel. For example, activation of the Gq-coupled substance P receptors expressed in locus coeruleus neurons inhibits Kir3 currents (26Koyano K. Grigg J.J. Velimirovic B.M. Nakajima S. Nakajima Y. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 20: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 27Velimirovic B.M. Koyano K. Nakajima S. Nakajima Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1590-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of inhibition was not established in that study, the results shown here may be relevant. Eicosanoid regulation of Kir3 as described in this study may be relevant to the pathological situations that occur during inflammation. Because Kir3 has in important role in cardiac excitability, cardiovascular disease may elicit an inflammatory response to produce eicosanoids that inhibit Kir3 (28Henrich C.J. Simpson P.C. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2061484837,"We previously identified transcription factor AP-2 as the nuclear factor that interacts with the tissue-specific repressor element in the rat serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) promoter. In this report, we provide evidence for a second AP-2-binding site and show that both AP-2 sites participate in mediating the transcription repression of SAA1 promoter. This proximal AP-2 site overlaps with the NFκB-binding site known to be essential for SAA1 promoter activity. Protein binding competition experiments demonstrated that AP-2 and NFκB binding to these overlapping sites were mutually exclusive. Furthermore, the addition of AP-2 easily displaced prebound NFκB, whereas NFκB could not displace AP-2. These results thus suggest that one mechanism by which AP-2 negatively regulates SAA1 promoter activity may be by antagonizing the function of NFκB. Consistent with a repression function, transient expression of AP-2 in HepG2 cells inhibited conditioned medium-induced SAA1 promoter activation. This inhibition was dependent on functional AP-2-binding sites, since mutation of AP-2-binding sites abolished inhibitory effects of AP-2 in HepG2 cells as well as resulted in derepression of the SAA1promoter in HeLa cells. In addition to SAA1, we found that several other liver gene promoters also contain putative AP-2-binding sites. Some of these sequences could specifically inhibit AP-2·DNA complex formation, and for the human complement C3 promoter, overexpression of AP-2 also could repress its cytokine-mediated activation. Finally, stable expression of AP-2 in hepatoma cells significantly reduced the expression of endogenous SAA, albumin, and α-fetoprotein genes. Taken together, our results suggest that AP-2 may function as a transcription repressor to inhibit the expression of not only SAA1 gene but also other liver genes in nonhepatic cells.

Karvelas M. Nossal G.J. Ye Z.S. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 5Li S. Crenshaw E.B. d. Rawson E.J. Simmons D.M. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1990; 347: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). To achieve accurate tissue-specific transcription, a complex array of signals must be integrated through the actions of transcription activators and repressors, culminating at the gene promoter to regulate initiation of RNA synthesis (6Johnson F.B. Krasnow M.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev.

For instance, expression of MyoD is restricted to the skeletal muscle cells and contributes to myogenesis by interacting with other positive transcription factors to activate the transcription of muscle-specific genes (9Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. Zhuang Y. Lassar A. Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). In contrast, neuron-restrictive silencer factor is expressed in most nonneuronal tissues and in undifferentiated neuronal progenitors (10Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y.

Because of its tissue distribution and its repressive effects on neuronal-specific genes, this silencer factor may function as a master negative regulator for neurogenesis (10Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G.

A growing list of transcription factors has been shown to function as either transcription activators or transcription repressors, depending on the promoter and cellular context of their target genes (13Jiang J.

Nature. 1995; 375: 105-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Examples of this group of transcription factors include theDrosophila transcription factor Kruppel, which converts from an activator to a repressor in a concentration-dependent manner (15Sauer F.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Transcription factor AP-2 is yet another transcription regulator with dual functions. First identified in HeLa cell nuclear extracts (21Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 22Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), AP-2 was named for its transcription activation function. It acts as an activator in regulating many genes, including those involved in the morphogenesis of peripheral nervous system, face, limbs, skin, and nephric tissues (23Schorle H. Meier P. Buchert M.

Exactly when a particular transcription factor with dual functions acts as an activator or as a repressor depends not only on its intrinsic features and concentration and on the presence of other transcription factors but perhaps also on the structure, relative position, and orientation of the promoter sequence itself (13Jiang J. Rushlow C.A. Zhou Q. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3147-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Roberts S.G. Green M.R.

Med. 1990; 7: 287-298PubMed Google Scholar), represents an excellent model system to study cytokine-induced regulation and liver-specific expression. Its serum concentration increases 1,000-fold after acute inflammation, being regulated primarily by the 200–300-fold increase inSAA gene transcription (32Benson M.D. Kleiner E. J.

Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8453-8461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mice, theSAA gene family consists of four genes, SAA1,SAA2, SAA3, and SAA5, and a pseudogene (36Lowell C.A.

Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whereas expression of SAA1, SAA2, andSAA3 is dramatically induced after inflammation and each contributes equally to the increased SAA mRNA levels in the liver,SAA5 expression is induced to a much lower level and with different induction kinetics (38de Beer M.C. Beach C.M. Shedlofsky S.I. de Beer F.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39de Beer M.C. Kindy M.S. Lane W.S. de Beer F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4661-4667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to being highly regulated by the inflammatory cytokines, expression of SAA1and SAA2 are also highly cell type-specific, restricted to the liver hepatocytes (32Benson M.D. Kleiner E. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 495-499PubMed Google Scholar, 34Gorevic P.D. Franklin E.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 1981; 32: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Lowell C.A. Stearman R.S. Morrow J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8453-8461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the rat SAA1 promoter demonstrate that 304 bp of its 5′-flanking sequence are sufficient not only for its liver cell-specific expression but also for its cytokine-induced expression in response to inflammatory mediators (40Li X.X. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15192-15201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further deletion analyses identified a 66-bp DNA fragment spanning bp −138 to −73 that could confer its cytokine responsiveness. Within this cytokine response unit (CRU) reside binding sites for transcription factors NFκB, C/EBP, and YY-1 (41Lu S.Y. Rodriguez M. Liao W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6253-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas NFκB and C/EBP function cooperatively to induceSAA1 promoter activity in response to cytokine stimulation, YY-1 functions as a repressor in opposing NFκB-mediated transcription activation and contributes to the low basal expression ofSAA1 and perhaps the transience of its expression after inflammation (41Lu S.Y. Rodriguez M. Liao W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6253-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent transient transfection analyses revealed a tissue-specific repressor element distal to the CRU that conferred repression on the SAA1 promoter in HeLa cells but had no such inhibitory activity in liver cells (42Li L. Liao W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This repressor element formed an intense DNA-protein complex with nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells but not from liver cells. We have recently purified this DNA-binding protein from HeLa nuclear extracts and shown by protein sequencing and biochemical and immunological analyses that it is identical to the transcription factor AP-2 (43Ren Y. Reddy S.A. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37154-37160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Here, we report on the repressive effects of AP-2 on the expression of transfected and endogenous liver genes and suggest that it may function as a negative regulator to repress the expression of some liver genes in nonhepatic cells. HeLa, HepG2, and Hep3B cells were grown in basal medium that contained minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mmpyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HepG2 and Hep3B cells were used for our transient transfection and stable cell line studies because they have been demonstrated to confer proper regulation of many endogenous and transfected genes, includingSAA (44Ganapathi M.K.

Conditioned medium (CM) known to contain a mixture of inflammatory mediators capable of inducing acute-phase gene expression was prepared from activated mixed lymphocyte cultures as described (48Huang J.H. Rienhoff Jr., H.Y. Liao W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3619-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and used as a mixture with an equal volume of basal medium. The wild-type AP-2 consensus sequence (AP-2) (5′-GGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCGTGGTCAG-3′) and its mutant (mAP-2) (5′-GGAACTGACCGaCCGCtGCCGTGGTCAG-3′) are from the human metallothionein IIA promoter (bp −188 to −161) (49Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The wild-type (5′-CCTTCACTCTATACCTCAGGCAGCTAAGGAA-3′) and mutant (5′-CCTTCACTCTATACCTtAaaCAGCTAAGGAA-3′) AP-2d and wild-type (5′-CATGGTGGGACTTTCCCCAGGGACCAA-3′) and mutant (5′-CATGGTGGGACTTTCCCCAaaGACCAA-3′) AP-2p oligonucleotides correspond to the distal (bp −285 to −255) and proximal (bp −97 to −70) AP-2-binding sites, respectively, in theSAA1 promoter. These oligonucleotides were used as primers in polymerase chain reactions (PCR) or as probes or competitors in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). pTK/SAA1(−285/−70) was constructed by inserting a DNA fragment from the rat SAA1 promoter (bp −285 to −70) into theSmaI site of pBLCAT vector, which contains the thymidine kinase (TK) minimal promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. This SAA1 promoter fragment was synthesized by PCR using AP-2d and the complement of AP-2p oligonucleotides. The constructs pTK/SAA1(−285/−70)mAP-2d/p is identical to pTK/SAA1(−285/−70) except the distal and the proximal AP-2 sites have been mutated. pSAA1/CAT(−120) contains the intact SAA1promoter (bp −120 to +18) in front of the CAT reporter (50Li X. Liao W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the pSAA1/CAT(−120)mAP-2p construct has the proximal AP-2 site mutated. The AP-2 expression construct, pIND/AP-2, was made by inserting a 1.9-kilobase fragment containing the AP-2 cDNA and β-globin intronic sequences into theHindIII/XbaI site of pIND expression vector (Invitrogen). Expression constructs for the wild-type AP-2 (pSAP2), the frameshift AP-2 mutant (pSAP2/FS21), and the dominant-negative AP-2 mutant (pSAP2Δ166–277) were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Tainsky (49Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The reporter construct pC3/Luc(−199) containing 199 bp of the human C3 promoter in a luciferase reporter was kindly provided by Dr. Gretchen Darlington (51Wilson D.R. Juan T.S. Wilde M.D. Fey G.H. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6181-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells (1.5–2 × 105) were seeded into 60-mm culture dishes 16 h before they were transfected with plasmid DNAs using the FuGENETM6 transfection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were incubated for 16–20 h before being stimulated with basal medium or with 50% CM to induce the reporter gene activities. Sixteen to 20 h after treatment, cells were harvested for cell extract preparation and CAT or luciferase assays. CAT assays were performed essentially as described (48Huang J.H. Rienhoff Jr., H.Y. Liao W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3619-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The conversion of acetylated forms of chloramphenicol was calculated by measuring the radioactivity with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Luciferase activity was measured with luciferase assay kit (Tropix, Inc.) using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG & G Berthold). The averages and S.E. from 3 or 4 independent experiments were calculated relative to the activities for the control samples, to which a value of 1.0 was assigned. For EMSA, 2 × 104 cpm (∼1 ng) of32P-labeled DNA fragments were mixed with indicated amounts of protein samples in reaction buffer (48Huang J.H. Rienhoff Jr., H.Y. Liao W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3619-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the samples were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 200 V for 100 min. The gel was then dried and autoradiographed. The intensities of shifted protein-DNA complexes were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In oligonucleotide competition experiments, the protein was incubated simultaneously with the labeled probe and an excess amount of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides. Recombinant AP-2 and the p50 subunit of NFκB were purchased from Promega. Hep3B cells were plated at 70–80% confluence in 100-mm culture dishes 16–24 h before transfection with pIND/AP-2 or empty vector (3 μg/dish). Cells were trypsinized 48 h after transfection, washed with basal medium, and split into four 100-mm culture dishes in selection medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Cells were fed with fresh selection medium every 3–4 days. After culturing for 2–3 weeks, individual resistant clones were picked and transferred to 24-well plates. Clones that express AP-2 were screened by EMSA using the AP-2d sequence as a probe and further verified by RT-PCR. Three AP-2-expressing clones, designated H3B.A1, H3B.A2, and H3B.A6, were selected for further analysis. For comparison, three control clones that contain the empty pIND vector were selected similarly and were designated H3B.V1, H3B.V2, and H3B.V3. Total cellular RNAs were isolated from the cloned Hep3B cell lines using the High Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). TitanTM One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to optimize conditions for PCR (55 °C for 30 min, 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 1 min) and to quantify mRNA levels. The amplification reactions contained 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP for the detection of reaction products and were carried out to ensure that they are within the linear range of the amplification. The reaction products were resolved on 5% native polyacrylamide gels and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). We had previously identified a repressor element in the ratSAA1 promoter that could inhibit its promoter activity in HeLa cells (42Li L. Liao W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed this repressor element contained a high affinity binding site for AP-2 (43Ren Y. Reddy S.A. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37154-37160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigated the mechanisms for the repressive effects of AP-2 by searching for additional AP-2-binding sites in the SAA1promoter. In addition to the AP-2-binding site (bp −272 to −265) identified initially, one additional sequence (5′-CCCCAGGG-3′) located at bp −85 to −78 was found to be a potential AP-2-binding site (Fig.1 A). These two sites were designated, relative to their positions in the SAA1promoter, the distal AP-2-binding site (AP-2d) and the proximal AP-2-binding site (AP-2p) (Fig. 1 A). It is interesting to note that the sequences at the AP-2p site are highly conserved between rat, human, and mouse SAA1 genes (40Li X.X. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15192-15201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Edbrooke M.R. Burt D.W. Cheshire J.K. Woo P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1908-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine whether the AP-2p site could indeed interact with AP-2, oligonucleotide competition experiments were carried out using radiolabeled AP-2d sequence and purified AP-2 in EMSA. In the absence of any competitors, a strong AP-2·DNA complex was detected (Fig. 1 B). As expected, both the consensus AP-2 binding sequence from the metallothionein IIA promoter and the AP-2d site very effectively competed for AP-2·DNA complex formation, whereas the mutated AP-2d-site oligonucleotides could not compete (Fig. 1 B). When the wild-type and mutated AP-2p oligonucleotides were used as competitors, the wild-type AP-2p oligonucleotides showed dose-dependent competition of the complex formation, whereas the mutant AP-2p site did not. This result indicates that the AP-2p site functioned as a binding site for AP-2, although it had lower binding affinity than the AP-2d site. Interestingly, the position of the AP-2p site overlaps that of NFκB, which is known to be essential for SAA1 promoter function (40Li X.X. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15192-15201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Li X. Liao W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The overlapping nature of these two transcription factor-binding sites raises an intriguing question, that is, whether binding of one factor to the DNA would affect the binding of the other factor. To address this question, gel shift assays were performed using the AP-2p probe, which contains both AP-2- and NFκB-binding sites, and recombinant AP-2 and NFκB. The reactions were carried out under probe-limiting conditions to allow AP-2 and NFκB to compete for limited amounts of target DNA. When added individually to the reactions, both AP-2 and NFκB formed specific DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 2). However, when AP-2 and NFκB were added together, no DNA-protein complexes with slower mobilities were observed, arguing against simultaneous binding of these two transcription factors to the same DNA molecule. To examine their relative binding affinities, radiolabeled AP-2p probe was first incubated with a constant amount of AP-2 or NFκB. After a brief incubation, increasing amounts of NFκB or AP-2 were added to the reaction mixture. As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of AP-2 readily displaced the prebound NFκB from this overlapping region (lanes 8–12). At a 2.3-fold molar excess of AP-2, no NFκB remained bound to the probe. In sharp contrast, NFκB had little effect on the prebound AP-2, even at a 28-fold molar excess of NFκB (lanes 2–6). Taken together, our results indicate that AP-2 and NFκB bind to this overlapping region in a mutually exclusive manner. Furthermore, AP-2 has much higher DNA binding affinity than NFκB. It is therefore tempting to speculate that one mechanism by which AP-2 may inhibit cytokine-induced SAA1 promoter function is by antagonizing the ability of activated NFκB to bind to its cognate binding site. Site-specific mutation of NFκB- or C/EBP-binding sites in the CRU completely abolished SAA1 promoter cytokine responsiveness (40Li X.X. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15192-15201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Li X. Liao W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), indicating the importance of these two transcription factors in SAA1 gene transcription. Since we showed that the NFκB-binding site overlaps with that of AP-2 and the presence of AP-2 effectively prevents NFκB from binding to its cognate site, we sought to determine whether AP-2 binding to the AP-2p site is required for its repressive effects on the SAA1promoter. Two reporter constructs, pSAA1/CAT(−120) (wild-type AP-2p site) and pSAA1/CAT(−120)mAP-2p (mutant AP-2p site), were generated. As determined by EMSA, the 2-bp mutation at the AP-2p site completely abolished AP-2 binding but still retained full NFκB binding activities (data not shown). These two reporter constructs were cotransfected into HepG2 cells with the AP-2-expression vector, pSAP2, to assess the effects of AP-2p site mutation on the ability of AP-2 to repress the reporter gene expression. As shown in Fig.3, the CAT activities for both the wild-type and the mutant constructs could be induced 5–6-fold by CM. However, cotransfection with AP-2 expression vector completely inhibited CM-induced expression of the wild-type pSAA1/CAT(−120) reporter. In contrast, expression of AP-2 had no significant effects on the cytokine responsiveness of the mutant pSAA1/CAT(−120)mAP-2p reporter. As controls, cotransfection with the frameshift AP-2 mutant construct had no inhibitory effects on either reporter construct. These results indicate that AP-2-mediated repression on a pSAA1/CAT(−120) reporter requires a functional AP-2p site. Because liver and liver-derived cell lines such as HepG2 do not normally express AP-2, a study of the effects of AP-2 in these cells requires cotransfection with AP-2 expression vectors. In contrast, HeLa cells express abundant amounts of AP-2, thus making cotransfection unnecessary as well as providing an alternative approach to examine the specificity of AP-2 repression effects. To investigate whether the lack of SAA1 promoter activities in HeLa cells is, at least in part, due to repression by the endogenous AP-2 through its binding at AP-2d and AP-2p sites, we generated a double AP-2-site mutant construct, pTK/SAA1(−285/−70)mAP-2d/p, in which both the distal and the proximal AP-2 sites were mutated. As expected, the construct containing the wild-type AP-2 sites, pTK/SAA1(−285/−70), was nonresponsive to CM stimulation when transfected into HeLa cells, presumably due to inhibition by the endogenous AP-2. Mutation of AP-2-binding sites, however, resulted in derepression ofSAA1 promoter activity (Fig.4).

We hypothesized that an IL-13 antagonist may have profound therapeutic utility in these conditions. We, therefore, mutagenized human IL-13 in which Glu at position 13 was substituted by a Lys residue. This highly purified recombinant IL-13 variant, IL-13E13K, bound with 4-fold higher affinity to the IL-13 receptor than wild-type IL-13 but retained no detectable proliferative activity on the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line. IL-13E13K competitively inhibited IL-13- and IL-4-dependent TF-1 proliferation. It also inhibited IL-13-induced STAT-6 (signal transduction and activator of transducer-6) activation in immune cells and cancer cells and reversed IL-13-induced inhibition of CD14 expression on human primary monocytes. These results demonstrate that high affinity binding and signal generation can be uncoupled efficiently in a ligand receptor interaction. These results also suggest that IL-13E13K may be a useful antagonist for the treatment of allergic, inflammatory, and parasitic diseases or even malignancies in which IL-13 plays a central role.

Therefore, it has been hypothesized that blocking the effect of IL-13 can provide therapeutic benefit in these pathological conditions. Cytokine receptors for hematopoietic growth factors with a four α-helix structure exist largely as homodimers or heterodimers (34Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1999; 52: 1-65Google Scholar). For example, receptors for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, growth hormone, prolactin, and leptin can exist as homodimers (34Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1999; 52: 1-65Google Scholar). In this class of receptors, a single cytokine binds to two identical subunits and causes receptor internalization and signal transduction. Heterodimeric cytokine receptors generally consist of a major cytokine binding subunit and a signaling subunit (or shared subunit) (34Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1999; 52: 1-65Google Scholar). In this class of receptors, signaling subunits are often shared with more than one cytokine. For example, gp130 receptor subunit is shared with receptors for IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, cardiotrophin-1, and oncostatin M. IL-2Rγ subunit is shared by IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, and IL-15 receptors. The common β-subunit is shared by receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF (34Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1999; 52: 1-65Google Scholar). Similarly, IL-4Rα subunit is shared by the IL-4R and IL-13R system (14Murata T. Obiri N.I. Puri R.K. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar, 35Izuhara K. Harada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13097-13102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Smerz-Bertling C. Duschl A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4899-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In heterodimeric receptor systems, usage of intracellular signaling mechanism(s) is generally also shared (34Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1999; 52: 1-65Google Scholar). One of the difficulties in understanding the interaction between ligand and the shared receptor subunits is that the subunit itself usually binds its ligand with low affinity. To overcome this problem, numerous cytokine antagonists have been generated by site-directed mutagenesis, which has been shown to utilize heterodimeric receptor systems. These mutants have clarified the crucial role of a particular residue in the ligand-receptor interaction. Among them, various antagonistic muteins including mGM-CSF (38Altmann S.W. Patel N. Kastelein R.A. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 39Altmann S.W. Kastelein R.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have been produced. However, no antagonist of murine or human IL-13 has been produced. To produce an IL-13 antagonist, we created a mutation in the IL-13 molecule. The selection of the residue to be mutated was based on the knowledge of mutants produced for the IL-4 family of lymphokines (e.g. GM-CSF, IL-5, IL-4, and IL-13) (48Boulay J. Paul W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20525-20528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Paul W. Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the amino acid sequence of α-helix A of these molecules was aligned, a conserved structure was identified. Mutation in one of the Glu residue in the conserved helical structure produced molecules with altered interaction with their receptors, suggesting that this region is critical for ligand-receptor interaction and signal transduction. For example, when Glu-21, located in α-helix A of the mGM-CSF molecule, was mutated to Ala, a mGM-CSF with decreased bioactivity was produced. Similarly, when Glu-9, also located in α-helix A of the IL-4 molecule, was mutated to Lys (IL-4E9K), a dramatic inhibition in binding to IL-4Rα chain was observed (47Kruse N. Shen B. Arnold S. Tony H. Meuller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When amino acid residues in α-helix A of IL-13, IL-4, mGM-CSF, and hIL-5 were aligned, Glu-13 in IL-13 was identified, which is located at the equivalent position in IL-4, mGM-CSF, and hIL-5 (Fig. 1 A). In addition, since IL-4 and IL-13 share two receptor chains with each other and Glu-9 in IL-4 molecule has been shown to interact with the IL-4Rα chain, we mutagenized Glu to Lys at this position. This molecule, IL-13E13K was then expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and further characterized. We demonstrate that IL-13E13K has a 4–8-fold higher binding affinity to IL-13R compared with wtIL-13. Interestingly, IL-13E13K inhibited IL-13-induced signal transduction, cell proliferation, and biological activities in many different cell types. We conclude on the basis of these results that IL-13E13K is a novel powerful antagonist that may have many clinical applications. Sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers were synthesized at Bioserve Biotechnologies (Laurel, MD). The pET based expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used for construction of mutein clone. Plasmids were amplified in E. coli, DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.), and DNA was extracted using plasmid purification kits (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

Briefly, 5 × 105cells in 100 μl of binding buffer were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 125I-IL-13 (200 or 500 pm) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of unlabeled wtIL-13 or IL-13 mutant. Receptor-bound 125I-IL-13 was separated from unbound 125I-IL-13. The cell pellets were counted in a γ counter (Wallac). EMSA was performed as described before (7Murata T. Obiri N.I. Puri R.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Murata T. Taguchi J. Puri R.K. Blood. 1998; 91: 3884-3891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Oshima Y. Joshi B.H. Puri R.K. J.

After incubation with various concentrations of wtIL-13 or IL-13 mutants for 15 min, THP-1 cells, Ebstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cells, or KSY-1 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with cold whole-cell extraction buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 300 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 20% glycerol). DNA-protein interactions were assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the Bandshift kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (4.2 × 109 cpm/μg) SBE-1. Primary monocytes were cultured at 1 × 107 cells/ml for 48 h with 1 ng/ml wtIL-13 with or without 1 μg/ml IL-13E13K. Staining of the cells was performed as described elsewhere (51Oshima Y. Joshi B.H. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14375-14380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fluorescence data were collected on a FACScan/C32 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The results were analyzed with the CELLQuest (Becton Dickinson) program. Protein synthesis inhibition assay was performed as previously described (3Puri R.K. Leland P. Obiri N.I. Husain S.R. Kreitman R.J. Haas G.P. Pastan I. Debinski W. Blood. 1996; 87: 4333-4339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Oshima Y. Joshi B.H. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14375-14380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 103 PM-RCC or U251 cells/well were cultured with various concentrations of IL-13PE38QQR incubated for 20–24 h at 37 °C, and then 1 μCi of [3H]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well and cultured for an additional 4 h. For blocking experiments, wtIL-13 or IL-13 mutants and IL-13PE38QQR were added simultaneously. Finally, cells were washed and harvested on a fiberglass filtermat, and cell associated radioactivity was measured in a β Plate counter (Wallac). The concentration of IL-13PE38QQR at which 50% inhibition of protein synthesis (IC50) occurred was calculated. The sequence of CRH domains of various cytokines were aligned by the Bestfit program of GCG software (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Helical wheel analyses were also performed using GCG software. Percent similarity and identity of extracellular domains between IL-13Rα1 and IL-2Rγ subunits were 40.5 and 31.9%, respectively. These numbers indicate reasonable sequence similarity justifying the use of IL-2Rγ subunit as a template for modeling IL-13Rα1 subunit. Conserved sequence patterns such as the WSXWS motif and four conserved Cys residues between β-strands of IL-13Rα1 and IL-2Rγ were perfectly aligned. The alignment of sequences between IL-4 and IL-13 was also performed as previously reported (20Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.M. Dumont X. Guillemot J.C. Kaghad M. Labit C. Leplatois P. Liauzun P.

Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1077-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The similarity and identity of α-helix A and D of IL-13 to the known structure of IL-4 was in a similar range, as observed for IL-2Rγ and IL-13Rα1 subunits. However, the similarity of α-helix B and C could not be reasonably determined (54Bamborough P. Duncan D. Richards W.G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1077-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The coordinate of the CRH domain of the IL-4Rα subunit was also used in our model that was obtained from protein data bank entry1ILL. The model building and refinement procedures were based on the procedure previously described in detail (55Greer J. Proteins. 1990; 7: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). An initial model was built using the homology module of InsightII (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). Small loops and splices were created and handled such that the energy was kept at minimum for best model. The structures were finally refined using the Discover program (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). When the α-helix A of hIL-13, hIL-4, mGM-CSF, and hIL-5 were aligned, glutamic acid residues were found to be aligned perfectly in all of these molecules. In IL-13, this Glu was located at position 13 (Fig. 1 A). Helical wheel analysis of IL-13, IL-4, and mGM-CSF suggested that hydrophobic residues clustered in one side of the α-helix (Fig. 1 B). These hydrophobic residues may be buried in the core of the molecules, as shown for IL-4 and hGM-CSF (56Hage T. Sebald W. Reinemer P. Cell. 1999; 97: 271-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 57Walter M. Cook W. Ealick S. Nagabhushan T. Trotta P. Bugg C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). α-Helix A of hIL-5 did not show a cluster of hydrophobic residues (data not shown). Further pattern analysis demonstrated that the aligned critical residues are located in the other side of the hydrophobic buried cluster. Based on these analyses and the fact that Glu in IL-4 and mGM-CSF interact with shared receptor subunits, it is predicted that Glu at position 13 in IL-13 molecule is the “hot residue,” and it may also interact with shared receptor subunit. Recombinant wtIL-13, IL-13E13K, and IL-13R112D in which the 112th Arg (R) residue of IL-13 molecule was substituted for Asp (D) were expressed inE. coli and purified from inclusion bodies as previously described (51Oshima Y. Joshi B.H. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14375-14380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After purification, each recombinant protein was analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue. Each protein showed a prominent single band at ∼13 kDa with purity of at least 95% (Fig.2). Binding studies were performed using U251 glioblastoma and PM-RCC renal cell carcinoma cell lines, both of which express type I IL-13 receptors (8Obiri N.I. Leland P. Murata T. Debinski W. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 756-764PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, wtIL-13 displaced specific binding of radiolabeled IL-13 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, IL-13E13K also inhibited binding of125I-IL-13 (Fig. 3). IL-13E13K was better in displacing125I-IL-13 binding as compared with wtIL-13. In the experiment shown, the EC50 (concentration causing 50% inhibition of 125I-IL-13 binding) of wtIL-13 and IL-13E13K on U251 cells was ∼20 and 2.5 nm, respectively. On PM-RCC, it was ∼100 and 25 nm, respectively. Thus, IL-13E13K appeared to show ∼4.0–8-fold better binding avidity than wtIL-13 in displacing 125I-IL-13 binding. TF-1 erythroleukemia cells proliferate in response to IL-13 (51Oshima Y. Joshi B.H. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14375-14380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We, therefore, measured proliferative activity of wtIL-13 and IL-13E13K (Fig.4 A) either alone or in combination of both (Fig. 4, B and C). As expected, wtIL-13 stimulated the grow"

Again, this links the loss of a functional RING finger with tumorigenesis. In industrialized countries, lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death. One of our research interests is to identify important RING finger family genes including oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in lung alveolar cells. In this study, we employed the PCR approach and degenerate primers corresponding to the RING finger motif. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of LUN, a new member of the RING finger proteins family that might be associated with tumorigenesis and/or tumor suppression. LUN mRNAs are expressed at high levels in alveolar epithelium of the lung. The LUN gene is localized to chromosome 9p21, which contains candidate tumor suppressor genes associated with loss of heterozygosity in more than 86% of small cell lung cancer. LUN is a 119-kDa nuclear protein and shows Zn2+-dependent and sequence-specific DNA binding ability. A novel palindromic binding consensus sequence for LUN51–374 was found in the upstream transcriptional regulatory region of the E-cadherin gene and introns of thetalin gene. Our findings provide an important clue in the further study of the function of LUN and the mechanism of its involvement in tumorigenesis in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). First-strand cDNA was prepared from human lung poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH). This cDNA was then used as a template for PCR with an oligo(dT) primer and two degenerate primers (5′-TG(T/C) CTI CA(T/C) TCI TT(T/C) TGC-3′ and 5′-TG(T/C) TT(A/G) CA(T/C) AG(T/C) TT(T/C) TGC-3′) homologous to an amino acid sequence (CLHSFC) that is conserved among several members of the RING finger family. The PCR products were hybridized with a second degenerate oligonucleotide (5′-CA(T/C) TCI TT(T/C) TGI AA(A/G) TCI TGC-3′) homologous to an overlapping region of the RING finger domain (HSFCKSC). DNA from random positive clones was sequenced and compared with the GenBankTM data base. Two of the clones contained partial cDNAs for a novel RING finger protein, which we named LUN. The full-length human LUN cDNA was generated by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The cDNA was reverse-transcribed from poly(A)+ mRNA from human lung, brain, the glioma cell line T98 or T-cell line Molt-4 using the cDNA synthesis primer provided with the kit. The first round of PCR was carried out using an adapter primer 1 and gene-specific reverse primer (5′-TAACTCGAGCACCAGCACGATAAAG-3′). The second round of PCR was performed using the first round gene-specific PCR amplification product as the template, adapter primer 2, and a nested gene-specific primer (5′-CAAAGATCTTTCATCTGCCGTAGTTG-3′). The cDNA amplified by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was then subcloned and sequenced. Replication G-banded chromosomes were prepared from the phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes from a normal male donor using the thymidine synchronization/bromodeoxyuridine release technique (20Inazawa J. Sasaki H. Nagura K. Kakazu N. Abe T. Sasaki T. Hum. Genet... 1996; 98: 508-510Google Scholar). Just before hybridization, the chromosome slides were denatured with 70% formamide in 2× sodium saline citrate at 70 °C for 2 min. The 3549-bp fragment (corresponding to nt 270–3818 of the LUN cDNA) was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by nick translation. The probes were denatured at 75 °C for 10 min and then mixed with an equal volume of hybridization buffer (20% dextran sulfate in 4× sodium saline citrate). The hybridization mixture was placed on the denatured chromosome slides. After overnight hybridization, signal detection was achieved in three amplification steps, one with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector), one with biotinylated anti-avidin D (Vector), and one with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate. Chromosomes were counter-stained with propidium iodide. FISH signals and the replicate G-bands for the same metaphase were detected under fluorescence microscopy (Nikon) through a B-2A filter and a UV-2A filter, respectively, and photographed separately. The precise assignment of the LUN gene to chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals over the G-banded chromosomes (21Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Abe T. Druck T. Ohta M. Huebner K. Yanagisawa J. Reed J.C. Sato T. Genomics.. 1996; 31: 240-242Google Scholar). Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from several different adult human tissues (Invitrogen) were probed for expression of LUN mRNA as previously described (22Adachi Y. Kitahara-Ozawa A. Sugamura K. Lee W.J. Yodoi J. Maki M. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 19373-19378Google Scholar). The probe, a 3549-bp fragment (corresponding to nt 270–3818 of the LUN cDNA), was random-primed with [α-32P]dCTP (220 TBq/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Megaprime random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C with the radiolabeled LUN cDNA probe. After hybridization, the blots were washed at 65 °C for 10 min with 2× sodium saline citrate containing 0.1% SDS and for 30 min with 0.1× sodium saline citrate containing 0.1% SDS. The probed blots were subjected to autoradiography with intensifying screens at −80 °C. To generate probes for in situ hybridization, we cloned a 236-bp BamHI fragment (nt 1–236) and a 588-bp BamHI fragment (nt 270–857) of the LUN cDNA into the pBluescript II KS(−) vector (Stratagene), respectively. The plasmids were linearized with EcoRI and transcribed with T7 polymerase to yield an antisense RNA probe or linearized with NotI and transcribed with T3 polymerase to yield a sense RNA probe. Transcription reactions included digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as a label. A human multi-tissue set was purchased from Novagen. Hybridization and high stringency washes were carried out according to established procedures (23Morimoto M. Morita N. Ozawa H. Yokoyama K. Kawata M. Neurosci. Res... 1996; 26: 235-269Google Scholar). After deparaffinization and acetylation, digoxigenin-labeled probe was hybridized at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. After the final high stringency wash, slides were washed successively in digoxigenin buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.5) and digoxigenin buffer containing 1.5% blocking reagent and reacted with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin (1:500 dilution; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the dark. The slides were then washed in digoxigenin buffer and alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, pH 9.0). The colorimetric reaction product was developed at room temperature for 18 h with 50 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 75 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium in alkaline phosphatase buffer. The BamHI to EcoRI fragment of the cDNA encoding LUN51–1045 was ligated into the BglII and EcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), which allows in-frame fusion with enhanced Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter and contains SV40 polyadenylation signals (referred to as pGFP-LUN51–1045). HeLa cells were seeded on chamber slides and incubated for 16 h. Cells were then washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium twice and transfected with 1.4 μg of plasmid DNA by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies)-mediated transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. A 3-fold volume of 15% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added 3 h later. The transfection mixture was removed 21 h later, and the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for an additional 24 h. At 48 h after transfection, confocal imaging analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning microscope. For GFP visualization, an fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set was used. Segments of the LUN cDNA encoding aa 51–1045, and aa 51–374 were cloned into the BamHI andEcoRI/SmaI sites of the vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate the plasmids pGST-LUN51–1045 and pGST-LUN51–374, respectively. Each plasmid produces an in-frame fusion of GST with LUN51–1045 or LUN51–374 (containing RING finger and leucine zipper coiled-coil domains). For isolation of GST fusion proteins, transformed bacteria were grown to early log phase and induced for 3 h with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-galactoside. The resuspended bacterial pellet was then sonicated in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, pH 8.0). The supernatant was then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 12 h at 4 °C and washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times. Finally, the GST fusion proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm glutathione, pH 8.0). The GST fusion proteins were radiolabeled at their N-terminal amino group and ε-amino group of lysine residues usingN-succinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-di[125I]iodophenyl) propionate (163 TBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The specific activities of 125I-labeled proteins were adjusted to ∼3 × 105 cpm/pmol. Each 125I-labeled GST fusion protein (6 × 105 cpm, 2 pmol) was diluted in 600 μl of binding buffer A (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, pH 7.1) and then incubated with 15 μl of calf thymus double-stranded DNA-cellulose or single-stranded DNA-cellulose (Sigma) in the presence of 1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, and/or 1 mm EDTA alone or in combination at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed three times with the same binding buffer A. The remaining radioactivity on the DNA-cellulose was measured by γ-counting. Human genomic DNA was digested to completion withMboI. The resultant mixture of digestion products was ligated into the BamHI site of the plasmid pUC118 followed by electroporation into competent DH5α bacteria, which were then grown in mass liquid culture. Plasmid DNA was then extracted from the cultured bacteria and used for screening. The primary library, taken for the first round of screening, contained 5.9 × 106clones, 80% of which contained genomic DNA inserts (data not shown). For screening, 20 μg of plasmid DNA from the library was mixed with GST-bound glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer B (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmZnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, pH 7.1). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, unbound DNA was recovered by centrifugation. Then, GST-LUN51–1045- or GST-LUN51–374-bound glutathione-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with washing buffer (identical to the above binding buffer B except for 2% glycerol). The DNA was released from the beads by incubation for 10 min at 45 °C in a solution containing 1% SDS and used to transform DH5α. This screening was repeated twice to generate a more enriched library. After the third screening, 72 colonies were picked up, and plasmid DNA was extracted from each colony. The inserted genomic fragments were purified and sequenced. For preparation of a DNA probe, the synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-CCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTTGGGAGGCTGAGG-3′ and its complementary oligonucleotide were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (111 TBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), annealed, and purified with MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each reaction mixture contained 8 pmol of 32P-labeled probe (∼4 × 104 cpm) and 8 pmol of GST fusion protein in binding buffer C (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, pH 7.1) in a total volume of 80 μl. For competition assay, the binding reaction was carried out in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe added simultaneously with the labeled probe to the reaction mixture. For all assays, the protein was added last, and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were resolved by nondenaturing electrophoresis through 5% polyacrylamide gels in running buffer (45 mmTris borate, pH 7.8). Gels were dried and analyzed with a BAS2000 imaging analyzer (FUJI Film). We sought to identify novel proteins of the RING finger family expressed in the lung. We used a PCR strategy with degenerate oligonucleotides to isolate partial cDNA clones of RING finger proteins using human lung cDNA as a template. Two of the partial cDNA clones isolated in this fashion encoded a novel RING finger protein, which we designated as LUN based on its unique expression pattern (see below). The cDNA clones isolated by PCR were subsequently used to generate 5′-overlapping clones by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNAs ends. Fig.1 A shows the complete nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of LUN cDNA. The LUN cDNA from lung and brain consisted of 3818 nt and contained a long open reading frame with one potential translational initiation codon (ATG) and in-frame upstream stop codons at the 5′ end of the cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AB045732). The sequence surrounding this ATG codon is in a favorable context for translational initiation as defined by Kozak (24Kozak M. J. Cell Biol... 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar). We also isolated a 3623-bp LUN cDNA with deletion of nt 123–317, possibly due to alternative splicing from the lung, the glioma cell line T98, and T-cell line Molt-4 (GenBankTM accession numberAB045733).Figure 1Nucleotide sequence of human LUN cDNA and its deduced amino acid sequence. A, the complete nucleotide sequence is shown along with the corresponding translation of the deduced open reading frame. The region (nt 123–317), which is excluded by alternative splicing, is indicated bysquare brackets. The first boxed region corresponds to the RING finger motif, in which the conserved residues are circled.

The positions of amino acid residues highly conserved in the family of RING finger proteins are highlighted withstippling.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) During the course of this study, 5055-bp and 3264-bp human cDNA clones that matched our cDNA clones were reported by Zhou et al. (25Zhou R. Wen H. Ao S.Z. Gene.. 1999; 235: 93-101Google Scholar) and Haluska et al. (26Haluska Jr., P. Saleem A. Rasheed Z. Ahmed F. Su E.W. Liu L.F. Rubin E.H. Nucleic Acids Res... 1999; 27: 2538-2544Google Scholar), respectively. However, the 5055-bp human cDNA isolated as a p53BP3 (p53-binding protein 3) cDNA (25Zhou R. Wen H. Ao S.Z. Gene.. 1999; 235: 93-101Google Scholar) was inconsistent with our clones in the 5′ end 1247 nt, which completely matched different human cDNA clones, NH0469M07 and RP11–422L5 (GenBankTMAC005037 and AC037455, respectively). On the other hand, although the 3264-bp human cDNA isolated as a Topors (topoisomerase I-bindingRS protein) cDNA (GenBankTMAF098300) (26Haluska Jr., P. Saleem A. Rasheed Z. Ahmed F. Su E.W. Liu L.F. Rubin E.H. Nucleic Acids Res... 1999; 27: 2538-2544Google Scholar) lacked a 3′-untranslated region of 555 nt and polyadenylation signal, it matched our complete cDNA sequence (3818 and 3624 bp) almost exactly, except for a short deletion due to alternative splicing (Fig.1 A). The predicted LUN protein consists of 1045 aa, with a calculated molecular mass of 119 kDa and pI 9.8. Sequence analysis revealed several distinctive features (Fig. 1, A and B). The most striking sequence of LUN is the RING finger motif (aa 103–141). The RING finger is one example of a Zn2+ binding motif defined by a conserved pattern of cysteine and histidine residues (C3HC4) that is found in a wide variety of proteins of diverse origins and functions (Fig. 1 C). The region from aa 293–365 is likely to adopt a leucine zipper and a coiled-coil structure. The N-terminal region (aa 51–374) containing a RING finger motif, a putative leucine zipper, and a predicted coiled-coil structure revealed a Zn2+-dependent and sequence-specific DNA binding activity (see below). There are five PEST sequences at aa 13–28, 386–432, 490–509, 921–950, and 999–1024. Two putative bipartite nuclear localization signals are present near the middle of the protein, indicating that LUN may function in the nucleus. In addition, a region rich in serine and arginine residues and two putative small ubiquitin-like protein (SUMO-1) modification sites (ψKxE) (27Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M.P. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 6455-6461Google Scholar, 28Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell.. 1998; 2: 233-239Google Scholar), which is modified in RanGAP1, IκBα, PML, and p53, was found in the C-terminal half of the protein. The C-terminal regions (aa 456–731 and 456–882) were reported to interact with p53 (25Zhou R. Wen H. Ao S.Z. Gene.. 1999; 235: 93-101Google Scholar) and topoisomerase I (26Haluska Jr., P. Saleem A. Rasheed Z. Ahmed F. Su E.W. Liu L.F. Rubin E.H. Nucleic Acids Res... 1999; 27: 2538-2544Google Scholar), respectively. To confirm the chromosomal mapping of the LUN gene, we performed FISH analysis on metaphase chromosomes from normal male lymphocytes using the 3549-bp LUN cDNA probe (corresponding to nt 270–3818). Several independent hybridizations exhibited a specific twin-spot signal on the short arm of a medium-sized chromosome, consistent with chromosome 9 on the basis of G-banding pattern (Fig. 2,A and B). No twin-spot signals were observed on other chromosomes. Fine analysis of 8 specifically hybridized chromosomes mapped the LUN gene to the p21 region of chromosome 9 (Fig. 2, C–E). As described in the cloning of LUN cDNAs (Fig. 1 A), we cloned the 3.8-kb LUN cDNA from adult human lung and brain and the 3.6-kb cDNA from lung, T98 cell line, and Molt-4 cell line. Northern blotting analysis was performed to examine the expression of LUN mRNAs in adult human tissues (Fig. 3). Two LUN mRNAs were detected differentially among the tissues: a 3.8-kb mRNA in the brain, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, pancreas, and skeletal muscle and a 3.6-kb mRNA in the heart and lung. Human LUN mRNAs were most highly expressed in the lung. Moderate expression with variation was detected in the heart, brain, kidney, liver, spleen, and skeletal muscle. Little expression of LUN mRNA was detected in the pancreas. Thus, it was remarkable that the highest level of LUN expression occurred in the lung. As shown in Fig. 3, LUN mRNAs were expressed at much higher levels in the lung than in other tissues. To better localize the lung cells expressing LUN mRNA, we performed in situ hybridization with adult lung sections (Fig. 4). Hybridization with the antisense LUN probe revealed specific signals in the alveolar epithelium (Fig. 4 A), whereas the sense probe did not show any signals in the lung tissue tested (Fig. 4 C). In particular, not all, but a number of squamous cells (type I) and cuboidal cells (type II), revealed specific signals of LUN mRNA in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 B). Because the LUN protein contains two putative bipartite nuclear localization signals (aa 616–645), it might function in the nucleus. To investigate the subcellular localization of LUN, HeLa cells were transformed with a plasmid expressing GFP alone or GFP-LUN fusion protein by DNA transfection. As shown in Fig. 5, cells expressing GFP-LUN exhibited nonhomogeneous fluorescent signals in the nucleus (panels A, C, and E). The nuclear localization pattern of LUN was similar to those of RING finger proteins, Mel-18, PML, RPT-1, and Vmw110 (6Tagawa M. Sak"

Therefore, prevention of IgE production in human B-cells represents an attractive therapeutic target. IL-4-induced IgE germline gene transcription represents a crucial early step during IgE isotype switch differentiation. Gene induction is orchestrated by the coordinated action of the transcription factors STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription), NF-κB, PU.1, and C/EBP. This study shows that 2′-aminoethoxy-modified oligonucleotides, which partially overlap with the STAT6 and the adjacent PU.1/NF-κB binding site, inhibit DNA binding of all three proteins with high affinity in a dose- and time-dependent fashion in vitro. Loss of protein binding correlated strongly with increasing DNA triplex formation. Importantly, the oligomers also effectively displaced pre-bound recombinant NF-κB p50 from double-stranded DNA in vitro. Functionally, the oligonucleotides led to a selective inhibition of IL-4-induced reporter gene activity from a construct driven by the IgE germline gene promoter in human B-cells. These data confirm the critical role of this cytokine-responsive regulatory region in IgE germline gene induction and further support the concept of specific modulation of gene expression by DNA triplex formation induced with chemically modified oligonucleotides.

Interleukin-4 (IL-4)1 is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a critical role in the regulation of immune responses.

In addition, IL-4 increases the expression of genes involved in cell activation and inflammation, such as class II major histocompatibility complex molecules on B cells (3Noelle R. Kramme R.P.

A number of studies have identified the minimal regulatory region in the IgE germline promoter responsible for mediating IL-4-induced activation of transcription (14Albrecht B. Peiritsch S.

The pivotal transcription factor appears to be STAT6 (18Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science.. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Google Scholar, 19Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Adv. Immunol... 1999; 71: 145-162Google Scholar), which interacts with DNA upon cytokine induction. Latent STAT6 is activated in the cytoplasm by tyrosine phosphorylation. In its activated state, it can dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to a specific DNA sequence in the regulatory region of the IgE germline gene (20Fenghao X. Saxon A. Nguyen A. Ke Z. Diaz-Sanchez D. Nel A. J. Clin. Invest... 1995; 96: 907-914Google Scholar). There it functionally interacts with other constitutively bound factors such as C/EBP (21Mikita T. Kurama M. Schindler U.

A number of studies have demonstrated DNA triplex structures with critical polypurine:polypyrimidine cis-acting DNA elements found in the regulatory region of genes and the prevention of DNA binding of regulatory proteins (30Postel E.H.

Recently, the synthesis and physicochemical properties of chemically modified oligonucleotides containing 2′-aminoethoxy-substituted riboses was reported (36Cuenoud B. Casset F. Hüsken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.-H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed... 1998; 37: 1288-1291Google Scholar). Such triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFO) assemble into very stable DNA-triplexes and display a > 1000-fold higher association rate constant compared with their unmodified counterparts (37Blommers M.J.J. Natt F. Jahnke W. Cuenoud B. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 17714-17725Google Scholar). The STAT6 binding site and the composite PU.1/NF-κB1 element in the IgE germline promoter are composed of an almost perfect DNA polypurine stretch. To explore the possibility, if the ”antigene“ approach can be applied to this regulon, 2′-aminoethoxy-modified oligonucleotides were tested for their ability to form DNA triplex structures with this region. The TFOs formed DNA triple-helix structures and inhibited the interaction of STAT6, NF-κB, and PU.1 in a dose-dependent fashion with high specificity and selectivity. As a functional consequence, the activity of the IgE germline promoter to drive transcription of a reporter gene was blocked. The human B-cell line DG75 was carried in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Purified human recombinant IL4 was obtained from Novartis AG (Basel, Switzerland) with a specific activity of 0.5 units/ng. The fusion protein composed of soluble mouse CD40 ligand and soluble mouse CD8 (sCD40L-sCD8) (38Lane P. Brocker T. Hubele S. Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A. McConnell F. J. Exp. Med... 1993; 177: 1209-1213Google Scholar), a kind gift of Dr. Peter Lane, was purified by immuno-affinity chromatography. The three TFOs were synthesized as described (36Cuenoud B. Casset F. Hüsken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.-H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed... 1998; 37: 1288-1291Google Scholar) and dissolved in 8% ammonium hydroxide. The MeC-3654 oligonucleotide was synthesized using 5′-methylcytidine (MeC) as building block like in the other three TFOs. It is identical in sequence to the 3654 TFO but does not contain the 2′-aminoethoxy modification. All oligonucleotides were characterized by analytical anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight. DG75 cells were cultured in fresh medium for 24 h at 37 °C, then harvested and washed twice in cold RPMI 1640. Before electroporation, 20 μg of the supercoiled reporter plasmid LUCwt (22Stütz A.M. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1999; 163: 4383-4391Google Scholar) was mixed with 1 μg of STAT6 expression vector (22Stütz A.M. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1999; 163: 4383-4391Google Scholar), 1 μg of the Renilla luciferase expression vector pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI), and increasing molar excess of TFOs in a final volume of 50 μl in phosphate-buffered saline. After 45 min at room temperature, 1 × 107 cells in 250 μl of cold RPMI 1640 were added and electroporated at 1500 microfarads and 240 V using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser™. Immediately after transfection, 700 μl of warm culture medium was added and the cells were diluted with 3 ml of complete culture medium. Aliquots were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of induction mixture consisting of 25 units/ml IL-4, 1 μg/ml sCD40L-sCD8 fusion protein (38Lane P. Brocker T. Hubele S. Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A. McConnell F. J. Exp. Med... 1993; 177: 1209-1213Google Scholar), and 1 μg/ml anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody. Firefly and Renillaluciferase activities were quantitated using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. TheRenilla luciferase values were used for normalization of differences in transfection efficiency. The normalized values were used to calculate the ratio of firefly luciferase activity between inducedversus uninduced cells (induction factor). Nuclear extracts from DG75 cells stimulated with 400 units/ml IL-4 for 2 h were prepared as described previously (39Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res... 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). Double-stranded (ds) DNA was end-labeled using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Klenow polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The labeled product was purified by size exclusion chromatography (G-25 Sephadex Microspin™ columns, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The binding reaction was done in a total volume of 20 μl containing 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mmNaCl, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm EDTA, 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 15% glycerol, 4 μm ZnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 fmol of end-labeled dsDNA, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 5 μg of nuclear extracts. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice and electrophoresed in a 4% native polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C in 1× TBE at 200 V for 1 h. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films at −70 °C (Kodak X-Omat MR). 320 fmol of recombinant NF-κB p50 (Promega) was incubated with 2 fmol of labeled ds-probe for 30 min at room temperature before 3.2 pmol of TFOs were added for various time periods. The DNA region of the IgE germline promoter encompassing the STAT6 site and the composite PU.1/NF-κB element represents an almost perfect polypurine DNA stretch. To investigate the biologic properties of 2′-aminoethoxy modified TFOs on protein binding and gene induction, complementary polypyrimidine TFOs were synthesized (Fig.1). The 21-mer 3654 TFO covers the 3′ half of the STAT6 site, the entire PU.1 motif, and the 5′ half of the NF-κB1 element. The 15-mer 3651 oligonucleotide is shorter at the 3′ end and does not cover the NF-κB1 site. Both TFOs contain one mismatch with the promoter sequence at position −82. The cytidine at that position in the TFO was chosen for optimized binding (39Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res... 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). To determine whether protein binding to this region can be blocked by TFOs, EMSA experiments were carried out using a radiolabeled ds-oligonucleotide probe spanning nucleotides −106 to −55 of the IgE germline promoter (22Stütz A.M. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1999; 163: 4383-4391Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of the two specific 2′-aminoethoxy-modified polypyrimidine oligonucleotides (3654 and 3651) or a 2′-aminoethoxy modified control oligonucleotide representing an irrelevant sequence (3595) were pre-incubated with the radiolabeled probe for 45 min at room temperature. Then, nuclear extract prepared from IL-4-treated DG75 cells was added for 30 min on ice. In the absence of TFOs, three distinct protein bands were observed, corresponding to a large composite STAT6/NF-κB complex, a predominant NF-κB, and a faster migrating PU.1 complex (Fig.2) (22Stütz A.M. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1999; 163: 4383-4391Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of both 3654 and 3651 triplex oligonucleotides led to a dose-dependent reduction of all three complexes. A 270-fold molar excess of oligonucleotide 3651 led to almost complete disappearance of the STAT6/NF-κB and the PU.1 complex and a 50% reduction of the NF-κB band. The same effect was observed with a 90-fold molar excess of the longer 3654 oligonucleotide, showing that the increased length of the TFO positively affected its inhibitory behavior. Increasing amounts of TFO led to the appearance of a new band representing the DNA triple helix, which migrated just above the free radiolabeled duplex and became more prominent with increasing TFO concentrations (Fig. 2, lower panel). The intensity of the triple helix band inversely correlated with the intensity of the nucleoprotein complexes, demonstrating a direct relationship between inhibition of protein factor binding and formation of DNA triplex structures. The observed inhibition of protein binding was sequence-specific since the control TFO 3595 had no effect. Similarly, the unmodified polypyrimidine single-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to position −106 to −55 of the IgE germline promoter sequence had no effect. The simultaneous presence of protein and TFO never led to the appearance of a slow migrating band indicative of a tetrameric complex consisting of ds-probe, TFO, and protein. This suggested that protein and TFO binding occurred in a mutually exclusive fashion.Figure 2Gel mobility shift assay of protein binding and triplex formation. An EMSA experiment with ds-probe 106/55 is shown. The name of the TFO and the molar excess versus the ds-probe are depicted above and below thebrackets, respectively. The nature of the individual bands is shown at the left. The lower panelrepresents a shorter exposure (12 h) of the lower third of the gel to better discriminate between the duplex and the triplex DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further confirmation for the sequence specificity of the TFOs came from experiments in which a different radiolabeled probe was used. Increasing amounts of the oligonucleotides were pre-incubated with another IgE germline promoter probe spanning positions −57 to −3 (41Albrecht B. Peiritsch S. Messner B. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1996; 157: 1538-1543Google Scholar). This DNA (57/3) contains the NF-κB2 element, which is very similar to the PU.1/NF-κB1 sequence in the 106/55 probe (23Messner B. Stütz A.M. Albrecht B. Peiritsch S. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1997; 159: 3330-3337Google Scholar). This sequence produces a complex banding pattern consisting of at least six different complexes, of which one has been identified to contain NF-κB family members (Fig. 3) (23Messner B. Stütz A.M. Albrecht B. Peiritsch S. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1997; 159: 3330-3337Google Scholar). Even a very high excess of the TFOs did not lead to DNA triplex formation or to changes in nucleoprotein complex formation compared with the positive 106/55 control, demonstrating high sequence specificity of the 3654 oligonucleotide. Identical results were obtained using a composite STAT6/NF-κB site (42Matsukara S. Stellato C. Plitt J.R. Bickel C. Miura K. Georas S.N. Casolaro V. Schleimer R.P. J. Immunol... 1999; 163: 6876-6883Google Scholar) from the human eotaxin gene promoter (data not shown). To characterize the triplex-forming reaction in more detail, the time of addition of the TFO relative to the nuclear extract was varied. The 106/55 ds-probe was either pre-incubated with a 300-fold molar excess of the 3654 TFO on ice for 45 or 15 min or added simultaneously with nuclear extract or was pre-incubated with the proteins for the same time periods before addition of the TFO. After addition of all components, all samples were further incubated for another 30 min on ice. The results demonstrated that triplex formation was strongest when the probe was pre-incubated with the TFO for 45 min and weakest when added 45 min after the nuclear extract (Fig.4, lower panel). Similar to the data shown in Fig. 2, increasing amounts of triplex DNA correlated with reduced protein binding. It should be noted that, even in the samples in which the TFO was added after the extract, all three nucleoprotein complexes were significantly reduced, suggesting that the TFO could interfere with already formed nucleoprotein complexes (Fig.4, upper panel). Again, this effect was not observed with the 3595 control TFO. To corroborate these results, the stability of the triplex structures at two different temperatures was measured. The 106/55 probe was simultaneously incubated with nuclear extract and a 300-fold molar excess of the 3654 TFO. Then the mixtures were incubated for different time periods on ice or 37 °C and subsequently analyzed. Incubation on ice in the absence of TFO led to a gradual increase in NF-κB and STAT6/NF-κB protein binding, while the PU.1 band remained constant. The STAT6/NF-κB complex became detectable only after 60 min, suggesting a slower on-rate than the one of the other two proteins (Fig. 5 A, upper panel). In the presence of the TFO, a gradual increase in triplex formation was apparent at the expense of free duplex DNA probe within the first 60 min. Thereafter, no significant amounts of free ds-probe could be detected (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). Simultaneously, at the longer time points, a gradual loss of protein binding was observed. At 240 min, no PU.1 and STAT6/NF-κB bands were measurable and the NF-κB complex was strongly reduced. It should be noted that inhibition of protein binding was only observable when all the free available ds-duplex was converted to the triplex form (Fig. 5 A). When the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C in the absence of TFO, not much difference in NF-κB and PU.1 protein binding was seen with time, suggesting that the interaction with the probe occurred much faster, was nearly complete even after 10 min and remained stable during the experiment (Fig. 5 B). The STAT6/NF-κB complex was not formed at the higher temperature possibly due to instability under the experimental conditions used. In the presence of the 3654 oligonucleotide, most of the available duplex DNA was converted to the triple helix structure already after 10 min, probably due to an increased association rate at 37 °C. Thereafter, a slight and constant increase of the triplex signal over the observation period could be measured (Fig.5 B, lower panel). Protein binding was severely reduced at 10 min and resembled the one observed at 240 min upon incubation on ice. At later time points, an additional decrease of the remaining NF-κB signal occurred. This suggested that, in the absence of excess free dsDNA, the TFO actively displaced the remaining NF-κB molecules from the DNA probe and thus may explain the increase of triplex DNA at the later time points. In addition, the triplex structures appeared to be stable, since no duplex DNA or PU.1 protein binding could be detected over time. To further substantiate the possibility that the TFOs can displace dsDNA-bound protein, recombinant NF-κB p50 was incubated with the radiolabeled 106/55 probe such that all available DNA was occupied by protein. Then, 3654 TFO was added at a 10-fold higher molar concentration than the protein and incubated for various time periods at room temperature (Fig.6). In the absence of TFO, p50 produced two nucleoprotein complexes. The lower band likely represents a p50 homodimer, based on the finding that it migrated at the same position as the NF-κB complex in crude nuclear extracts, which contains p50 (Ref. 23Messner B. Stütz A.M. Albrecht B. Peiritsch S. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1997; 159: 3330-3337Google Scholar, and data not shown). The upper complex may consist of a higher order p50 multimer. The presence of 3654 TFO led to increasing formation of triplex DNA in a time-dependent fashion. At the same time, a loss of intensity of protein binding was observed, which was most prominent at the longest time point. This effect was specific since the irrelevant 3595 TFO did not lead to triplex formation. The experiment confirms the importance of the 2-aminoethoxy substitution to mediate triplex formation since an oligonucleotide with the same sequence but lacking this side chain (MeC-3654) was not able to displace p50. Identical results, albeit weaker, were obtained when equimolar amounts of TFO and p50 was used (data not shown). These experiments demonstrated that the specific TFO could efficiently displace DNA-bound NF-κB p50 by forming DNA triplex structures, which are then inaccessible for the protein.Figure 6NF-κB displacement from dsDNA by 2′-aminoethoxy-modified TFOs. EMSA experiment with ds-probe 106/55 and recombinant NF-κB p50. The probe was pre-incubated with saturating amounts of p50 before a 10-fold excess of TFO was added for various times.

A reporter gene plasmid (LUCwt) in which the human IgE germline promoter drives expression of the luciferase gene was used (22Stütz A.M. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1999; 163: 4383-4391Google Scholar). IL-4-induced reporter gene expression in this construct is mediated by a functional cooperation of STAT6 with PU.1 and NF-κB. Cross-linking of CD40 leads to further stimulation in a synergistic fashion. This effect is also mediated by the PU.1/NF-κB1 element (26Iciek L.A. Delphin S.A. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol... 1997; 158: 4769-4779Google Scholar). 2A. M. Stütz, and M. Woisetschläger, unpublished observations. The LUCwt DNA was mixed with increasing concentrations of TFOs and then transfected into DG75 cells by electroporation. STAT6 expression vector was also included to maximize IL-4 inducibility (22Stütz A.M. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1999; 163: 4383-4391Google Scholar, 43Lu B. Reichel M. Fisher D.A. Smith J.F. Rothman P. J. Immunol... 1997; 159: 1255-1264Google Scholar). The transfectants were induced with a mixture containing IL-4, a fusion protein consisting of soluble murine CD40 ligand and soluble murine CD8 (38Lane P. Brocker T. Hubele S. Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A. McConnell F. J. Exp. Med... 1993; 177: 1209-1213Google Scholar), and anti-CD8 antibodies to cross-link the CD40 receptor for 24 h. IgE germline promoter activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the 3654 TFO compared with the solvent control. The shorter 3651 oligonucleotide also inhibited reporter gene expression but with less efficiency (Fig. 7). This is in line with the results obtained in the EMSA assays, in which the 3651 TFO was also less effective compared with the 3654 oligonucleotide. In contrast, the 3595 control TFO had no effect. These data demonstrated that the loss of transcription factor binding due to triplex formation correlated strongly with the inhibition of gene induction. It also underscores the importance of this regulatory region of the promoter as mediator of IL-4/CD40 triggered activation of IgE germline gene expression. An almost perfect polypurine stretch in the promoter region of the IgE germline gene is part of the critical regulatory region involved in activation by IL-4 and CD40 triggering. The transcription factors binding to this sequence after activation have been identified to be STAT6, PU.1, and members of the NF-κB family such as p50 (22Stütz A.M. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1999; 163: 4383-4391Google Scholar, 23Messner B. Stütz A.M. Albrecht B. Peiritsch S. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1997; 159: 3330-3337Google Scholar, 24Delphin S. Stavnezer J. J. Exp.

Immunol... 1997; 158: 4769-4779Google Scholar). 2′-Aminoethoxy-modified oligonucleotides complementary to this polypurine target formed a triplex structure in a dose-dependent fashion. Triplex DNA formation occurred with high sequence specificity since two other similar targets were not recognized. The binding affinity of the specific TFOs was more than 800-fold higher than that of an unrelated TFO (3595). These numbers are in good agreement with previous results obtained in surface plasmon resonance experiments (36Cuenoud B. Casset F. Hüsken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.-H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed... 1998; 37: 1288-1291Google Scholar). In addition, the binding reaction in the EMSA assays were carried out at pH > 7, which does not favor the formation of protonated cytidines, even considering that 5′-methylcytidine was used in the synthesis of the TFOs. These results support previous findings showing that the interaction of the 2′-aminoethoxy side chains of the TFO with phosphate groups of the duplex DNA is a very important contribution to the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds for the total affinity of the observed DNA triplexes (36Cuenoud B. Casset F. Hüsken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.-H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed... 1998; 37: 1288-1291Google Scholar, 37Blommers M.J.J. Natt F. Jahnke W. Cuenoud B. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 17714-17725Google Scholar). Although the shorter 3651 TFO does not hybridize directly with the NF-κB site, protein binding was inhibited to a similar degree as PU.1 or STAT6. This suggests either that the triplex structure affects the conformation of the neighboring duplex to an extent that precludes binding of NF-κB proteins or that steric hindrance does not allow access of the proteins. Alternatively, the presence of STAT6 or PU.1 may be a pre-requirement for NF-κB nucleoprotein complex formation. This alternative seems unlikely, however, because ds-oligonucleotides containing point mutations that specifically abolished protein binding of STAT6 or PU.1 were still able to bind NF-κB factors (22Stütz A.M. Woisetschläger M. J. Immunol... 1999; 163: 4383-4391Google Scholar). A time kinetic at 37 °C demonstrated that the simultaneous incubation of protein and TFO with dsDNA led to an increase in triplex DNA at the expense of protein binding in the absence of free ds-probe. This effect was even evident when the TFO was added after the nuclear extract. This strongly suggested competition of the TFOs with the transcription factors for duplex DNA binding. The K dvalue for a 15-mer 2′-aminoethoxy-modified oligonucleotide has been determined to be 0.9–4.8 × 10−9m (36Cuenoud B. Casset F. Hüsken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.-H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed... 1998; 37: 1288-1291Google Scholar). This interaction is considerably weaker than the one measured for NF-κB proteins (10−12-10−13m) (44Zabel U. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 252-260Google Scholar) and thus could argue against a competition mechanism. However, it is difficult to compare these numbers since different methods, conditions, oligonucleotide lengths, and ds-targets were used to determine these values. Therefore, it is possible that, under the conditions used in this study, the 21-mer 3654 TFO has a binding affinity similar or higher than NF-κB, making a dsDNA interaction with the TFO over that with protein more likely. The observed shift from nucleoprotein complexes to DNA-triplex structures with time may also be driven by the large excess of TFO molecules compared with the amount of protein and perhaps by a possible difference in half-lives of the complexes. It has been shown that the half-life of NF-κB proteins on its target was 45 min (45Zabel U. Baeuerle P.A. Cell.. 1990; 61: 255-265Google Scholar). In the absence of free ds-target DNA, shorter-lived dissociating protein-DNA complexes may be converted to DNA-triplexes with a longer half-life. In fact, it has been measured that a 2′-aminoethoxy-modified TFO dissociated at one fortieth the rate from its target duplex than an unmodified oligonucleotide with the same sequence (36Cuenoud B. Casset F. Hüsken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.-H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed... 1998; 37: 1288-1291Google Scholar). In addition, triplex DNA formed with a 2′-aminoethoxy-modified TFO was stable at 55 °C (37Blommers M.J.J. Natt F. Jahnke W. Cuenoud B. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 17714-17725Google Scholar), whereas NF-κB binding was not possible anymore at this temperature (44Zabel U. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 252-260Google Scholar). It is also possible that the 3654 TFO first binds to the adjacent STAT6 binding site and then ”zips“ through the NF-κB site, competing for both bases and phosphates binding, resulting in efficient NF-κB displacement. Such a mechanism is not possible with unmodified oligonucleotides, as they can only interact weakly with the bases of the dsDNA target. Although our experiments cannot discriminate between these various possibilities, it is worth noting that the TFOs were capable of displacing DNA-bound p50 protein. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of an NF-κB binding inhibitor that exerts its biological activity on a pre-formed NF-κB nucleoprotein complex as opposed to an experimental set-up in which the inhibitor was pre-incubated with the dsDNA (35Kochetkova M. Shannon M.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 14438-14444Google Scholar, 46Kochetkova M. Iversen P.O. Lopez A.F. Shannon M.F. J. Clin. Invest... 1997; 99: 3000-3008Google Scholar, 47Grigoriev M.

The simultaneous transfection of a reporter gene plasmid and TFO led to inhibition of reporter gene activity after stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion. This result demonstrated that loss of DNA-protein interaction resulted in inhibition of IgE germline promoter activation and thus underscores the importance of the targeted promoter region in activating gene expression. Although our data do not prove the existence of triplex structures within the transfected cells, it is worth noting that the amounts of triplex oligonucleotide necessary to inhibit gene expression by 50% was similar to that required to block protein binding to DNA to the same extent. This suggests that the mechanism(s) responsible for the inhibitory effect was due to blockade of critical nucleoprotein complex formation caused by the presence of a local DNA-triplex structure in the IgE germline promoter. Overall, this first demonstration of the biological effects of 2′-aminoethoxy-modified oligonucleotides represents a step forward to overcome the lack of binding affinity and the slow association rate for the DNA target classically associated with conventional oligonucleotides. With this type of chemically modified oligonucleotides, displacement of already DNA-bound transcription factors may become feasible in a therapeutic setting. This may be important not only for inducible genes such as the IgE germline gene but also for constitutively active genes whose activity is associated with the disease phenotype. Further efforts are aimed to explore the properties of these oligonucleotide derivatives with regard to nuclease resistance and cellular uptake.

Although the molecular details of the mechanism of DNA unwinding is unknown for any helicase, it is likely that the unwinding reaction requires the coupling of several events such as ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, single strand and double strand DNA binding, and translocation along the DNA. Many helicases function as multimers such as dimers (e.g. Escherichia coli Rep (22Wong I. Chao K.L. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wong I. Lohman T.M.

Although it has been suggested that oligomeric structures provide multiple DNA binding sites, which are required for helicase action (28Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it appears that at least two helicases, E. coliDNA helicase II and Bacillus stearothermophilus PcrA, are active as monomers (29Mechanic L.E. Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12488-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Three models to explain the mechanism of helicase activity have been proposed. The inchworm model posits that conformational changes caused by binding and hydrolysis of ATP cause a helicase monomer to “inch” along the DNA (30Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 31Yarranton G.T. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Monomeric helicases would presumably contain at least two nonidentical DNA binding sites on each monomer. The rolling model, which is based on the dimeric Rep protein, posits that a helicase must act as (at least) a dimer and that each subunit of the dimer can bind to either ssDNA or duplex DNA (23Wong I. Lohman T.M. Science. 1992; 256: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). According to this model, a helicase rolls along the DNA with alternating subunits binding first to ds then to ssDNA. A third model proposed for the hexameric helicases posits that the core of the hexameric unit provides a channel through which a single strand of DNA can be threaded (32Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowska D. Bujalowski W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9058-9069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The protein would move along one strand with alternating subunits responsible for ATP hydrolysis. To distinguish between these models and to understand the mechanism of helicase action, it will be necessary to obtain more detailed information about how helicases contact DNA. Two members of SF1 helicases, Rep and PcrA, have been crystallized in the presence of DNA (30Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 35Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the E. coli Rep helicase bound to ssDNA, and ADP revealed putative contact residues for ssDNA on the protein (35Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar); however, many of these assignments have not been confirmed by genetic analysis. Previous DNA binding studies revealed that the UL5-UL52 subcomplex binds to ssDNA more effectively than to dsDNA and that the minimum length of ssDNA that can bind and stimulate its ATPase activity is about 12 nucleotides (36Healy S. You X. Dodson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3411-3415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Herein we show that the UL5-UL52 subcomplex binds much more efficiently to a forked substrate than to either ss or dsDNA. The fact that the HSV-1 helicase is part of a multiprotein complex complicates the analysis of the DNA binding sites of the individual subunits. We have previously shown that both subunits can contact single-stranded DNA in a photocross-linking assay (37Biswas N. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8068-8076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown a complex interdependence on both subunits for DNA binding, in that a mutation in the putative Zinc binding domain of the UL52 subunit has drastic effects on the ability of UL5 to cross-link single-stranded DNA. In this paper we have taken two approaches to study the interaction of the UL5-UL52 subcomplex with DNA. Cross-linking studies using forked substrates with substitutions of deoxyuridine (dIU) in three different positions indicate that the UL5 and UL52 subunits contact the forked substrates at different positions; UL5 appears to contact DNA near the fork, whereas UL52 appears to contact the ss tail of the forked substrate. Neither subunit appears to directly contact dsDNA. In a second approach, we performed DNA binding and cross-linking assays on a series of UL5 mutants whose mutations lie in conserved helicase motifs shared by other SF1 members (38Graves-Woodward K. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13629-13635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 39Graves-Woodward K.L. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4623-4630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The results confirm a complex interdependence between the two subunits and indicate that the UL52 subunit may play a more active role in helicase activity than had previously been thought. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the HSV-1 helicase-primase may act as a monomer (one heterotrimer per replication fork) and favor the inchworm model for the mechanism for helicase activity.

The wild type and variant UL5-UL52 subcomplexes were purified essentially as described earlier with an additional gel filtration step. Cells were dounced using 15 strokes of a tight fitting pestle in Buffer A, and the cytosolic extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min. UL5-UL52 subcomplexes were precipitated from the cytosolic extract by the addition of an equal volume of Buffer B containing 0.2m NaCl and 2 m ammonium sulfate and incubation on ice for 4 h. The resultant protein pellets were resuspended in Buffer B containing 0.1 m NaCl and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with Buffer B containing 0.1 m NaCl, and the column was washed with 5 column volumes of the equilibration buffer. Fractions containing the UL5-UL52 subcomplex were identified by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The UL5-UL52 subcomplex elutes from the column in the void volume. Pooled fractions from the SP-Sepharose column were loaded onto a 12-ml Uno Q column equilibrated with Buffer B containing 0.1 m NaCl. The column was washed with five column volumes of Buffer B containing 0.1 m NaCl, and the protein was eluted using a 185-ml linear gradient of Buffer B containing 0.1–1 m NaCl. Pooled fractions from the Uno Q column were concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator with a 10-kDa cut-off (MicrosepTM, Pall Filtron) and loaded onto a 25-ml Superose 12 HR column equilibrated with Buffer B containing 0.1m NaCl. The fractions containing the peak activities were pooled, concentrated, and frozen at −70 °C. An 18-mer of oligo(dT), PCdT18(5), with a dIU substitution at the 5th T from the 5′ end was synthesized by Cruachem and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Forked DNA substrate A was constructed by heat denaturing and annealing 80 pmol of the helicase 48C/FS oligonucleotide (5′ CGAAAGTACGTTATTGCGACTGGCCGTCGCTCTACAACGTCGTGACTG 3′) radiolabeled at its 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP and 80 pmol of unlabeled 48FS oligonucleotide (5′CAGTCACGACGTTGTAGAGCGACGGCCAGTCGGTTATTGCATGAAAGC 3′). The underlined residues are complementary and create the duplex region of the molecule. After annealing, the products were subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the forked substrate was purified by electroelution and ethanol precipitation. Forked substrates (FS B, FS C, and FS D) were prepared by annealing 80 pmol of each of the end-labeled 48C/FSM oligonucleotide (5′ CGAAAGdIUACGTTATTGCGACTGGCCGTCGCTCTACAACGTCGTGACTG3′), 48C/FSM27 oligonucleotide (5′ CGAAAGTACGTTATTGCGACTGGCCGdIUCGCTCTACAACGTCGTGACTG3′), or 48C/FSM15 oligonucleotide (5′ CGAAAGTACGTTATdIUGCGACTGGCCGTCGCTCTACAACGTCGTGACTG3′), respectively, to 80 pmol of the unlabeled 48FS oligonucleotide. In FS B, the substitution is in the 7th position from the 5′ end of the lower (labeled) strand (see Fig. 2). In FS C, the dIU substitution is within the duplex region (see Fig. 2), and in FS D, the substitution is within the ss region of the lower (labeled) strand very near the ss/dsDNA junction. The duplex DNA substrate was prepared in a similar manner; 80 pmol of 32 S oligonucleotide (5′CAGTCACGACGTTGTAGAGCGACGGCCAGTCG3′) was annealed to the complementary 32 CS oligonucleotide (5′CGACTGGCCGTCGCTC- TACAACGTCGTGACTG3′). Gel mobility shift assays were essentially performed as described previously (39Graves-Woodward K.L. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4623-4630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 20 mm Na+ HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.2 pmol (molecules) of the DNA substrates labeled with [γ-P32]ATP and 4 pmol of the UL5-UL52 subcomplex with or without UL8 protein (12 pmol), ATP (5 mm), ADP (5 mm), or ATPγS (5 mm). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min on ice and terminated by the addition of one-tenth of a volume of a loading solution (80% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Reaction products were analyzed on a 4% nondenaturing acrylamide, 0.11% bisacrylamide gel at 150 V at 4 °C. The gels were dried and exposed to film at −70 °C. Photocross-linking experiments were performed essentially as described previously with 1.2 pmol of the indicated DNA substrate molecules and 4 pmol of UL5-UL52 subcomplex in 20 mm Na+ HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 5 mmMgCl2 (37Biswas N. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8068-8076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min before irradiation. An IK series He-Cd laser (IK 3302R-E, KIMMON; Kimmon Electric Co., Ltd.) was used to achieve monochromatic 325-nm light. The laser beam output was 34 milliwatts measured with a power meter, Mentor MA10, Scientech® (Scientech, Inc., Boulder, CO). Samples were irradiated in a methacrylate cuvette (catalog number 14-385-938; Fisherbrand) at room temperature. At different time points aliquots were withdrawn, boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel. The gels were dried and exposed to film at −70 °C. Previous studies with the UL5-UL52 subcomplex indicated a preference for ssversus dsDNA; in a filter-binding experiment the subcomplex bound ssDNA about 5-fold more effectively than it did dsDNA (36Healy S. You X. Dodson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3411-3415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the UL5-UL52 subcomplex could bind a forked substrate generated by the annealing of partially complementary oligonucleotides (39Graves-Woodward K.L. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4623-4630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here we compare the binding efficiencies of UL5-UL52 to the forked substrate and to single- and double-stranded DNA using a mobility shift experiment. Fig. 1shows that the UL5-UL52 subcomplex can bind forked, ss, and dsDNA (Fig.1, lanes b, i, and p, respectively). The gel shift data indicate that the binding of the UL5-UL52 subcomplex to a forked substrate is at least 8-fold higher than to ssDNA and is at least 35-fold higher than to dsDNA. Addition of UL8 to the binding reaction resulted in a supershift to a slower migrating species (Fig.1, lanes c, j, and q); in the case of the forked substrate (Fig. 1, lane c), the supershifted band is somewhat smeared, perhaps reflecting the complex interactions exhibited by UL5-UL52 with forked DNA (see below). Quantification of the gel shift data indicates that the UL8 stimulates the binding of UL5-UL52 to both forked (1.8-fold) and ss (2.2-fold) DNA substrates (Table I). To determine whether nucleotide di- and triphosphates play a role in the DNA binding properties of UL5-UL52, the binding of the subcomplex with ss and forked DNA substrates was tested in the presence of ATP, ADP, and ATPγS (Fig. 1). Single strand DNA binding was stimulated 1.6-fold in the presence of ADP, and the binding of UL5-UL52 to forked substrate was stimulated in the presence of ATP (1.4-fold), ADP (1.3-fold), and ATPγS (1.5-fold) (Table I). In summary, it appears that the UL5-UL52 subcomplex binds much more efficiently to the forked substrate than to either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA; the addition of UL8 or nucleotide cofactors exhibited modest but reproducible stimulatory effects on DNA binding of the subcomplex. The similar levels of stimulation observed with ADP, ATP, and ATPγS suggest that the binding of ATP but not its hydrolysis is important for optimal binding of UL5-UL52 to the forked substrate.Table IRelative affinity of UL5-UL52 for forked and single strand oligo DNA substrates in the presence and absence of UL8 and nucleotides% Shifted DNA substrate 1-aDNA binding was measured with a phosphorimager system.

Open table in a new tab We have previously used a photocross-linking assay to show that both UL5 and UL52 subunits of the wild type UL5-UL52 subcomplex can contact a short ss oligomer (37Biswas N. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8068-8076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). During replication, the helicase-primase would presumably contact a replication fork consisting of double- and single-stranded DNA; we therefore initiated cross-linking studies using a series of forked substrates shown in Fig.2. A He-Cd light source that emits at 325 nm was used to photocross-link the UL5-UL52 subcomplex to a32P end-labeled forked substrate in which dIU was substituted for one of the thymidine residues. In FS B, dIU was placed in the ss portion of the substrate at a position 7 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the lower strand (Fig. 2). The UL5-UL52 subcomplex was cross-linked to a 5′ 32P-labeled single strand oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 A,lane a) or to a 5′ 32P-labeled forked substrate (FS B) (Fig. 3 A, lane b). As previously reported (37Biswas N. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8068-8076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), when the subcomplex was cross-linked to the single strand oligonucleotide, two labeled bands were observed by SDS-PAGE, one migrating at ∼100 kDa corresponding to UL5 and a slower band migrating at 120 kDa corresponding to UL52 (Fig. 3 A,lane a). When the UL5-UL52 subcomplex was cross-linked to FS B, however, slower migrating bands were observed (Fig. 3 A,lane b); the uppermost band migrates at a position corresponding to ∼220 kDa and a lower set of smeared bands, which may contain two or more species migrating at a position corresponding to 170–195 kDa. A time course of binding in which the UL5-UL52 subcomplex was incubated with FS B irradiated for varying lengths of times was performed to determine whether the pattern of cross-linked bands changes with time. Fig. 3 B shows that the time of irradiation correlates with the amount of cross-linked material and that the pattern of bands, a 220-kDa band and two or more bands migrating between 170 and 195 kDa, remains constant throughout the experiment.

https://openalex.org/W2098558197,"During infection of Escherichia coli, the phage T4 early protein AsiA inhibits open complex formation by the RNA polymerase holoenzyme Eς70 at −10/−35 bacterial promoters through binding to region 4.2 of the ς70subunit. We used the −10/−35 lacUV5 promoter to study the properties of the Eς70·AsiA complex in the presence of the glutamate anion. Under these experimental conditions, inhibition by AsiA was significantly decreased. KMnO4 probing showed that the observed residual transcriptional activity was due to the slow transformation of the ternary complex Eς70·AsiA·lacUV5 into an open complex. In agreement with this observation, affinity of the enzyme for the promoter was 10-fold lower in the ternary complex than in the binary complex Eς70·lacUV5. A tau plot analysis of abortive transcription reactions showed that AsiA binding to Eς70 resulted in a 120-fold decrease in the second-order on-rate constant of the reaction of Eς70with lacUV5 and a 55-fold decrease in the rate constant of the isomerization step leading to the open complex. This ternary complex still responded to activation by the cAMP·catabolite activator protein complex. We show that compensatory Eς70/promoter upstream contacts involving the C-terminal domains of α subunits in Eς70 become essential for the binding of Eς70·AsiA to the lacUV5promoter.

A tau plot analysis of abortive transcription reactions showed that AsiA binding to Eς70 resulted in a 120-fold decrease in the second-order on-rate constant of the reaction of Eς70with lacUV5 and a 55-fold decrease in the rate constant of the isomerization step leading to the open complex. This ternary complex still responded to activation by the cAMP·catabolite activator protein complex. We show that compensatory Eς70/promoter upstream contacts involving the C-terminal domains of α subunits in Eς70 become essential for the binding of Eς70·AsiA to the lacUV5promoter. α-carboxyl-terminal domain base pair catabolite activator protein potassium glutamate In Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, the core enzyme E (subunit composition α2ββ′ω) associates with the ς subunit to form the holoenzyme Eς, the species able to initiate transcription at specific promoter sites on bacterial or phage genomes. The nature and properties of the ς subunit present in a holoenzyme at a given promoter, together with the ability of the α-carboxyl-terminal domain (α-CTD)1 to recognize an upstream element of the promoter, determine whether and how often transcription will start at this site (1Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These principles are nicely illustrated by the regulation of transcription during the development of phage T4 in E. coli. Here, all the phage genes are transcribed by the host RNA polymerase, the structure and molecular properties of which are modified by phage-coded proteins, resulting in the sequential utilization of early, middle, and late promoters (2Kolesky S. Ouhammouch M. Brody E.N. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Brody E.N. Kassavetis G.A. Ouhammouch M. Sanders G.M. Tinker R.L. Geiduschek E.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immediately after infection, T4 early promoters, with their bacterium-like −10 and −35 recognition sequences, are transcribed by Eς70, the host holoenzyme harboring ς70, the major host ς factor. T4 middle promoters contain a −10 element closely matching the −10 consensus sequence for ς70, but the −35 element is replaced by a so-called MotA box, a −30 binding site for the phage-coded middle transcriptional activator MotA (4Schmidt R.P. Kreuzer K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11399-11407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hinton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18034-18044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Eς70 and MotA, middle mode transcription also requires the presence of another phage early protein, the anti-ς factor AsiA (6Ouhammouch M. Orsini G. Brody E.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3956-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding the MotA box, MotA protein activates recognition of middle promoters by a holoenzyme Eς70·AsiA complex (7Hinton D.M. March-Amegadzie R. Gerber J.S. Sharma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Ouhammouch M. Adelman K. Harvey S.R. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here, AsiA appears to act as a molecular device that switches ς70 from the early to the middle class of T4 promoters. Transcription at late promoters is closely coupled with T4 DNA replication and requires a novel T4-encoded ς subunit, gp55 (9Fu T.J. Sanders G.M. O'Donnell M. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Because it is a coactivator of transcription from T4 middle promoters and, simultaneously, a transcription inhibitor of bacterial or T4 early promoters (3Brody E.N. Kassavetis G.A. Ouhammouch M. Sanders G.M. Tinker R.L. Geiduschek E.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), AsiA might also be able to cause the rapid arrest of transcription from early promoters, concomitant with the start of MotA-dependent middle transcription. Assigning this function is a long-standing and unresolved question in phage T4 biology (10Alberts B.M. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiolgy, Washington, D. C.1994: 487-488Google Scholar). It has been recently shown, however, that this transcription shutoff also occurs in the absence of AsiA (11Pene C. Uzan M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1180-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although the same study confirmed that transcription of E. coli genes is rapidly and strongly inhibited in vivo when AsiA is overproduced.In vitro transcription studies have helped to outline the mechanism of inhibition by AsiA. This 10-kDa protein binds to region 4.2 of ς70. In the Eς70·AsiA complex, this binding blocks the normal interaction between ς70and the −35 upstream promoter element (12Colland F. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Buc H. Kolb A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5855-5859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although AsiA strongly inhibits open promoter complex formation and transcription by Eς70 from a −10/−35 promoter like lacUV5 or the T4 early promoter P15.0, the holoenzyme is resistant to AsiA inhibition at promoters that, like galP1, lack a −35 consensus motif and contain an “extended −10” motif (12Colland F. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Buc H. Kolb A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Mol.

Graziani L. Brody E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27435-27443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These observations led to a simple model in which the interactions of domain 4.2 in ς70 with the −35 promoter element or with AsiA are mutually exclusive. This model explains the effect of AsiA on Eς70 at a −10/−35 promoter under classical assay conditions (13Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, at lacUV5, these experimental conditions preclude a detailed analysis of the repression mechanism. In this study, we have looked for conditions allowing the maintenance of residual transcriptional activity. For this purpose, we selected a salt that enhances the interactions between the RNA polymerase partners. Replacing the chloride anion by glutamate increases the affinity of RNA polymerase for its promoters (17Record Jr., M.T. Courtenay E.S. Cayley S. Guttman H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 190-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Such a change is also likely to improve the interaction between protein partners (19Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4979-4986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We expected, and indeed observed, that in the presence of the Glu− anion, Eς70 could still form a kinetically competent complex in the presence of AsiA. This allowed us to quantify free energy changes occurring in the overall reaction and to identify specific compensatory interactions between the holoenzyme and the promoter that permit RNA polymerase to overcome the otherwise strong inhibition brought about by AsiA.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we describe the behavior of the Eς70·AsiA complex in the presence of KCl and KGlu, two salts widely used in transcription studies. We have studied the mechanism of inhibition exerted by AsiA when it is bound to Eς70 acting upon a −10/−35 promoter in greater detail (13Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Pahari S. Chatterji D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 60-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Adelman K. Orsini G. Kolb A. Graziani L. Brody E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27435-27443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By runoff transcription analysis on thelacUV5 promoter, we show that the species Eς70·AsiA is much less inhibited in KGlu than in KCl (Fig. 1). These observations suggested the existence of a transcriptionally active ternary complex at lacUV5, a typical bacterial promoter with −10 and −35 recognition sequences. Active ternary complexes containing AsiA have been previously observed at several promoters that do not require a −35 motif for open complex formation (12Colland F. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Buc H. Kolb A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Pahari S. Chatterji D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 60-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A number of convergent observations support the hypothesis of a ternary complex at a −10/−35 promoter. First, we showed that AsiA was present in a stoichiometric amount when the Eς70·AsiA entity was first incubated withlacUV5 in KGlu (Fig. 2), but not in KCl. Thus, we ruled out the possibility that, in the presence of KGlu, a spurious loss of AsiA could explain the restoration of Eς70 activity. Furthermore, in Glu− buffer, only the extended DNase I footprint formed by Eς70·AsiA at lacUV5possessed a distinctive AsiA “signature” in the −35 region (Fig.7 A, lanes 3 and 11). In contrast, with AsiA bound to the holoenzyme in KCl, we observed only a weak protection against DNase I, which we interpreted as due to residual amounts of the binary Eς70·lacUV5 complex (Fig.7 B, lane 5). A third piece of evidence comes from an investigation of the structure of the ternary complex by laser UV photoreactivity. 2G. Orsini and M. Buckle, unpublished results. Laser UV photo-footprinting of a RNA polymerase·promoter complex allows precise probing of changes in the local structure of DNA (37Buckle M. Geiselmann J. Kolb A. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When we formed an open complex at lacUV5 with Eς70 in 200 mm KGlu, thymine dimer formation at positions −34 and −33 was suppressed, probably due to contacts between ς70and the −35 region (37Buckle M. Geiselmann J. Kolb A. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, no such effect was found when AsiA was previously bound to Eς70. However, in this case, we observed signals in the −10 region, indicative of contacts that are normally present in open complexes (38Buckle M. Pemberton I.K. Jacquet M.A. Buc H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This again strongly suggests that even when access to open complex formation via the −35 region is prevented by AsiA, RNA polymerase can nevertheless form a transcriptionally competent species possessing the downstream structural characteristics of a normal open complex. The presence of a significant fraction of binary complex would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the −34 dimer signal. This was not observed. We conclude that the effects we observed in the presence of glutamate belong to a real and probably unique ternary complex referred to as Eς70·AsiA·lacUV5.AsiA inhibits open complex formation by binding directly to the conserved region 4.2 of the ς70 subunit. At a−10/−35 promoter, this binding interferes with the interactions between ς70 region 4.2 and the −35 motif (12Colland F. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Buc H. Kolb A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Sharma U.K. Ravishankar S. Shandil R.K. Praveen P.V. Balganesh T.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5855-5859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hindrance of these crucial interactions with concurrent inhibition of open complex formation has been recently described in the case of the gene 2 protein of bacteriophage T7 (39Nechaev S. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here, however, the inhibitor gp2 binds to the β′ subunit of Eς70 and thus indirectly disrupts the −35/ς70 region 4.2 interaction (39Nechaev S. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both inhibitors T4 AsiA and T7 gp2 are believed to operate in a mutually exclusive mode: either the inhibitor is bound to the enzyme with ensuing inhibition, or the polymerase is bound to the promoter without inhibition. Moreover, in the latter case, the inhibitor can no longer be bound to the enzyme (13Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 39Nechaev S. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).By analyzing the mode of action of AsiA in the presence of the glutamate anion, we show that this mutual exclusion can be by-passed. As for many other DNA/protein systems in which Cl− has been replaced by Glu−, our results illustrate the general observation that, in the presence of Glu−, there is a substantial increase in the affinity of the proteins for their binding sites on DNA (17Record Jr., M.T. Courtenay E.S. Cayley S. Guttman H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 190-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 40Ha J.H. Capp M.W. Hohenwalter M.D. Baskerville M. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The apparent KD values determined by gel shift assay (see above and Fig. 3) are totally in line with previous reports on the “glutamate effect” (40Ha J.H. Capp M.W. Hohenwalter M.D. Baskerville M. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Using the abortive initiation assay and a simple two-state model (Equation 1) for open complex formation, we showed by tau plot analysis that the rate constant kf of the isomerization step was decreased 55-fold when AsiA was present in the complex (Table I). Inhibition by AsiA was therefore strongly maintained, as shown by the global 120-fold effect on the second-order association constantKB kf. In a parallel study, we used the abortive initiation assay to assess the stability of the ternary complex by heparin challenge (data not shown). The binary complex (without AsiA) formed in 200 mm KGlu was absolutely stable for >1 day. The ternary complex was much less stable and showed a first-order decay with a half-life of ∼18 h. This value is considerably larger that the half-life associated with the conversion of the closed to the open complex. The final ternary open complex formed in KGlu is therefore clearly more stable than the closed intermediate.The transcriptional activity of the ternary complex strongly implied the existence of a compensatory mechanism. It is well documented that the α subunit of RNA polymerase can also participate in promoter recognition through specific interactions between α-CTD and upstream regions of the −35 hexamer called “UP elements” (41Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E.E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 42Noel Jr., R.J. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 43Ross W. Aiyar S.E. Salomon J. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5375-5383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In glutamate, we show here that the contribution to the binding energy brought about by α-CTD binding to lacUV5 is sufficient to partially overcome inhibition by AsiA and to allow the formation of a ternary Eς70·AsiA·lacUV5active complex. Using the reconstituted holoenzyme Eς70(Δα), we show that the deletion of the α-CTD totally prevents the formation of the ternary complex. This complex displays RNA polymerase/promoter upstream contacts as revealed by a characteristic DNase I footprinting pattern that depends on α-CTD binding upstream of position −40 (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and11). A similar differential pattern was previously observed in the absence of AsiA at promoters where the UP elements are essential (34Kolb A. Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Lavigne M. Buckle M. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 43Ross W. Aiyar S.E. Salomon J. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5375-5383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, α-CTD binding can be facilitated by the binding of the cAMP·CAP complex at a site centered at −61.5. Interactions between α-CTD and CAP allow one of the two α-CTDs to anchor more tightly in the minor groove around position −43, upstream of the −35 hexamer (44Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this interaction occurs regardless of whether AsiA is bound to the adjacent ς70 subunit, and it allows CAP to activate the ternary complex Eς70·AsiA·lacUV5, thereby forming a quaternary transcriptionally competent complex (Fig. 6).The compensatory mechanism documented here at lacUV5 has also been observed, almost unmodified, on lacP S, a parent and weaker promoter in which the −10 region is altered, but not the sequences participating in upstream contacts. Conversely, when, at lacUV5, the UP element is reinforced by insertion of a proper canonical sequence, the inhibition due to AsiA was found to be already attenuated in the KCl-containing buffer. 3G. Orsini and A. Kolb, unpublished results. It is therefore likely that a better anchoring of the RNA polymerase·AsiA complex can conceivably take place on the UP element at any promoter, but that a clear balance favoring this repositioning might or might not require the presence of potassium glutamate depending on the relative strengths of the interactions at the −35 hexamer and at the UP element.At this point, we will briefly consider the transcription properties of the Eς70·AsiA complex relative to phage T4 early and MotA-dependent middle promoters. AsiA inhibits complex formation at the T4 early promoter P15.0, possessing both a −35 recognition element and an extended −10 motif (16Adelman K. Orsini G. Kolb A. Graziani L. Brody E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27435-27443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When assayed in KCl buffer, transcription from the T4 middle promoters PuvsX, PrIIB1, PrIIB2, and P1 is strictly dependent on the presence of both activators: MotA bound to the −30 middle promoter sequence, and AsiA bound to ς70 (8Ouhammouch M. Adelman K. Harvey S.R. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Remarkably, when assayed in KGlu, Eς70 is able to transcribe correctly from PuvsX (5Hinton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18034-18044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hinton D.M. March-Amegadzie R. Gerber J.S. Sharma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This basal transcription by Eς70 at a middle promoter is not activated by MotA (45Stitt B. Hinton D. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 142-160Google Scholar). Furthermore, in KGlu, addition of AsiA to Eς70 inhibits both open complex formation at a PuvsX DNA fragment and transcription from this middle promoter (7Hinton D.M. March-Amegadzie R. Gerber J.S. Sharma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations emphasize the point that AsiA acting alone behaves as a repressor. It inhibits transcription from a MotA-dependent promoter in a manner reminiscent of its action upon a −10/−35 promoter. It is therefore likely that most of the RNA polymerase/promoter contacts at −35 (and at −30 as well) are perturbed by a local conformational change affecting ς70when it binds AsiA. This perturbation is, in turn, relieved by the new contacts and therefore the new specificity conferred by the addition of MotA.In this view, this study demonstrates that promoter upstream contacts mediated by α-CTD of Eς70 are able to reduce the strong structural and kinetic block brought about by AsiA. As a repressor, AsiA changes radically the potential use of the enzyme modules involved in the formation of contacts with the upstream region of the promoter. We propose that in vivo, this drastic change also occurs. Here, however, the α-CTDs are first ADP-ribosylated at the onset of T4 infection (46Goff C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 418-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This modification plays a major role in regulating promoter utilization since it irreversibly blocks the use of the rescued pathway documented here. The efficiency of the Eς70·AsiA complex will now crucially depend on the binding of MotA to those promoters containing the −30 middle promoter motif (47Marshall P. Sharma M. Hinton D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 48Sharma M. Marshall P. Hinton D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and on the establishment of the proper contacts between the ς70 subunit and MotA (49Gerber J.S. Hinton D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6133-6139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, the core enzyme E (subunit composition α2ββ′ω) associates with the ς subunit to form the holoenzyme Eς, the species able to initiate transcription at specific promoter sites on bacterial or phage genomes. The nature and properties of the ς subunit present in a holoenzyme at a given promoter, together with the ability of the α-carboxyl-terminal domain (α-CTD)1 to recognize an upstream element of the promoter, determine whether and how often transcription will start at this site (1Gross C.A.

Immediately after infection, T4 early promoters, with their bacterium-like −10 and −35 recognition sequences, are transcribed by Eς70, the host holoenzyme harboring ς70, the major host ς factor. T4 middle promoters contain a −10 element closely matching the −10 consensus sequence for ς70, but the −35 element is replaced by a so-called MotA box, a −30 binding site for the phage-coded middle transcriptional activator MotA (4Schmidt R.P.

Because it is a coactivator of transcription from T4 middle promoters and, simultaneously, a transcription inhibitor of bacterial or T4 early promoters (3Brody E.N. Kassavetis G.A. Ouhammouch M.

Although AsiA strongly inhibits open promoter complex formation and transcription by Eς70 from a −10/−35 promoter like lacUV5 or the T4 early promoter P15.0, the holoenzyme is resistant to AsiA inhibition at promoters that, like galP1, lack a −35 consensus motif and contain an “extended −10” motif (12Colland F.

These observations led to a simple model in which the interactions of domain 4.2 in ς70 with the −35 promoter element or with AsiA are mutually exclusive. This model explains the effect of AsiA on Eς70 at a −10/−35 promoter under classical assay conditions (13Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, at lacUV5, these experimental conditions preclude a detailed analysis of the repression mechanism. In this study, we have looked for conditions allowing the maintenance of residual transcriptional activity. For this purpose, we sele"
