https://openalex.org/W3120750707,"The molecular pathology of multi-organ injuries in COVID-19 patients remains unclear, preventing effective therapeutics development. Here, we report a proteomic analysis of 144 autopsy samples from seven organs in 19 COVID-19 patients. We quantified 11,394 proteins in these samples, in which 5,336 were perturbed in the COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Our data showed that cathepsin L1, rather than ACE2, was significantly upregulated in the lung from the COVID-19 patients. Systemic hyperinflammation and dysregulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism were detected in multiple organs. We also observed dysregulation of key factors involved in hypoxia, angiogenesis, blood coagulation, and fibrosis in multiple organs from the COVID-19 patients. Evidence for testicular injuries includes reduced Leydig cells, suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis, and sperm mobility. In summary, this study depicts a multi-organ proteomic landscape of COVID-19 autopsies that furthers our understanding of the biological basis of COVID-19 pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3125484908,"Naturally occurring protein switches have been repurposed for the development of biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications1. However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3, we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions."
https://openalex.org/W3125097268,"The COVID-19 pandemic and government imposed social restrictions like lockdown exposed most individuals to an unprecedented stress, increasing mental health disorders worldwide. We explored subjective cognitive functioning and mental health changes and their possible interplay related to COVID-19-lockdown. We also investigated potential risk factors to identify more vulnerable groups. Across Italy, 1215 respondents completed our Qualtrics-based online-survey during the end of a seven to 10-week imposed lockdown and home confinement (from April 29 to May 17, 2020). We found subjective cognitive functioning and mental health severely changed in association with the lockdown. Under government regulations, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in routine tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functions—with no changes in language abilities. A paradoxical effect was observed for memory, with reduced forgetfulness compared to pre-lockdown. We found higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, abnormal sleep, appetite changes, reduced libido and health anxiety: with mild-to-severe depression and anxiety prevalence climbing to 32 and 36 percent, respectively, under restrictions. Being female, under 45 years, working from home or being underemployed were all identified as relevant risk factors for worsening cognition and mental health. Frequent consumers of COVID-19 mass media information or residents in highly infected communities reported higher depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly hypochondria in the latter. If similar restrictions are reimposed, governments must carefully consider these more vulnerable groups in their decisions, whilst developing effective global and long-term responses to the cognitive and mental health challenges of this type of pandemic; as well as implementing appropriate psychological interventions with specific guidelines: particularly regarding exposure to COVID-19 mass-media reports."

We thus refocus attention on this critical barrier and suggest solutions on how it can be dismantled. Our nationwide network of BME women faculty collectively argue that racial funding disparity by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) remains the most insidious barrier to success of Black faculty in our profession. We thus refocus attention on this critical barrier and suggest solutions on how it can be dismantled. We are at a historic moment in time: a mainstream awakening to the pain that stems from racial injustice, with our scientific communities openly acknowledging that our practices promote racial inequity and disparity (Barber et al., 2020Barber P.H. Hayes T.B. Johnson T.L. Márquez-Magaña L. 10,234 signatoriesSystemic racism in higher education.Science. 2020; 369: 1440-1441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Cell Editorial Team, 2020Cell Editorial TeamScience Has a Racism Problem.Cell. 2020; 181: 1443-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To address racial injustice in our profession and society, we established a national network of 260+ women faculty in biomedical engineering from all academic ranks, including chairs, deans, and distinguished scientists, such as the few women of color elected into the National Academies. Over the past few months, we have exchanged >24,000 messages discussing racial inequities that pervade our profession. One issue keeps rising to the top throughout these discussions: our Black colleagues’ grief about insufficient National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for their research laboratories. These human experiences are backed by years of data. The first study documenting racial disparity in NIH funding hit the field like a shockwave in 2011 (Ginther et al., 2011Ginther D.K. Schaffer W.T. Schnell J. Masimore B. Liu F. Haak L.L. Kington R. Race, ethnicity, and NIH research awards.Science. 2011; 333: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). This study showed that award probability for Black principal investigators (PIs) in 2000–2006 was ∼55% that of white PIs of similar academic achievement (Ginther et al., 2011Ginther D.K. Schaffer W.T. Schnell J. Masimore B. Liu F. Haak L.L. Kington R. Race, ethnicity, and NIH research awards.Science. 2011; 333: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). NIH scrambled to study potential reasons for this injustice (Barber et al., 2020Barber P.H. Hayes T.B. Johnson T.L.

NIH peer review: Criterion scores completely account for racial disparities in overall impact scores.Sci Adv. 2020; 6: eaaz4868Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We, as scientists and engineers, wrote editorials and promised to do better. Yet, over a decade later, this gap persists (Barber et al., 2020Barber P.H. Hayes T.B. Johnson T.L. Márquez-Magaña L. 10,234 signatoriesSystemic racism in higher education.Science. 2020; 369: 1440-1441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Dzirasa, 2020Dzirasa K.

We exist. We are your peers.Nat. Rev. Mater. 2020; 5: 783-784Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In 2014–2016, Black applicants’ award rates remained at ∼55% of those for white PIs (Figure 1A) (Erosheva et al., 2020Erosheva E.A. Grant S. Chen M.C. Lindner M.D. Nakamura R.K. Lee C.J. NIH peer review: Criterion scores completely account for racial disparities in overall impact scores.Sci Adv. 2020; 6: eaaz4868Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While we continue to nitpick about reasons for this disparity, one fact remains widely agreed upon: the disparity is real. Why does this matter? Promotion and tenure committees frequently use research grants, especially NIH R01-equivalent grants, to gauge a biomedical research program’s long-term viability. Thus, the racial disparity in NIH R01 awarding leads to failed tenure cases for Black faculty (Cropsey et al., 2008Cropsey K.L. Masho S.W. Shiang R. Sikka V. Kornstein S.G. Hampton C.L. Committee on the Status of Women and Minorities, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia CampusWhy do faculty leave?

Womens Health (Larchmt.). 2008; 17: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar; Fang et al., 2000Fang D. Moy E. Colburn L. Hurley J. Racial and ethnic disparities in faculty promotion in academic medicine.JAMA. 2000; 284: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Others burn out and exit the academy before reaching the tenure threshold (Cropsey et al., 2008Cropsey K.L. Masho S.W. Shiang R. Sikka V. Kornstein S.G. Hampton C.L. Committee on the Status of Women and Minorities, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia CampusWhy do faculty leave? Reasons for attrition of women and minority faculty from a medical school: four-year results.J. Womens Health (Larchmt.). 2008; 17: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We thus ask our non-Black colleagues to consider being in our Black colleagues’ shoes for a moment: imagine needing to spend twice the amount of time grant writing to achieve the same funding level as white PIs, while also performing substantially more service (Hare, 2018Hare H.E. Service Work of Underrepresented Faculty. PhD thesis (UCLA).2018Google Scholar). This excessive burden no doubt leaves Black faculty less time to do research, publish papers, gain exposure, train and inspire diverse students, and attain the promotions and positions needed to achieve the highest levels of academic power (Dzirasa, 2020Dzirasa K. Revising the a Priori Hypothesis: Systemic Racism Has Penetrated Scientific Funding.Cell. 2020; 183: 576-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar; Erosheva et al., 2020Erosheva E.A.

We exist. We are your peers.Nat. Rev. Mater. 2020; 5: 783-784Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To add salt to this wound, we worry that NIH does not fully understand the critical deleterious impact of this disparity. For example, we applaud the NIH Common Fund FIRST program, which offers $241 million to recruit new faculty committed to inclusive excellence. Yet, any new Black researcher recruited as a result of this program will be set up to fail if NIH doesn’t aggressively work to eliminate racial funding disparity. At least 10 editorials have been written about this NIH racial funding disparity (Dzirasa, 2020Dzirasa K. Revising the a Priori Hypothesis: Systemic Racism Has Penetrated Scientific Funding.Cell. 2020; 183: 576-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar; Platt, 2020Platt M.O. We exist. We are your peers.Nat. Rev. Mater. 2020; 5: 783-784Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with no sign of real effort from NIH or other entities to dismantle it. Meanwhile, our Black colleagues continue to be disenfranchised. We need radical solutions that produce racial funding equity now. Our hope is that this commentary refocuses attention on this critical issue. We also suggest solutions on how this barrier can be dismantled. The NIH director and leadership must recognize that its previous approaches, most of which have focused on filling the “pipeline” without simultaneously addressing our profession’s systemic racism, have failed. NIH must change course. We suggest the following: Thousands of Black voices have long lamented the racism prevalent in this country. We refer readers to the thousands of reports, studies, and personal introspections written on this topic (Dzirasa, 2020Dzirasa K. Revising the a Priori Hypothesis: Systemic Racism Has Penetrated Scientific Funding.Cell. 2020; 183: 576-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar; Erosheva et al., 2020Erosheva E.A.

We are your peers.Nat. Rev. Mater. 2020; 5: 783-784Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). More recently, 10,234 of our faculty colleagues, including the authors here, signed a statement acknowledging the presence of systemic racism in academia (Barber et al., 2020Barber P.H. Hayes T.B. Johnson T.L. Márquez-Magaña L. 10,234 signatoriesSystemic racism in higher education.Science. 2020; 369: 1440-1441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the silence from NIH on this topic remains deafening. We ask: if racism is present in academia, how can it not be present in NIH grant review and research, which are performed by academics? NIH must break its cycle of denial, which in the words of leading antiracism scholar Ibram X. Kendi, is “the heartbeat of racism.” NIH must acknowledge that racism exists in order to build the foundation of understanding needed to overcome it. We urge NIH to release a public statement signed by the NIH director that:•Acknowledges that racism persists in the US academic research enterprise and that it must be expelled.•Describes metrics, a timeline, a plan for public progress updates, and funds committed for how NIH will build and fund a scientific workforce that reflects the diversity of the US population. Afterall, all Americans pay the tax dollars that fund NIH. Inequitable distribution of these dollars is discrimination.•Describes how NIH will invest in understanding the impact of racism in NIH grant review. For example, the NIH should study the cultural competency and unconscious bias harbored by its reviewers, differential review practices and funding disparity between NIH and the National Science Foundation (NSF), and why “matching criteria” (Erosheva et al., 2020Erosheva E.A. Grant S. Chen M.C. Lindner M.D. Nakamura R.K. Lee C.J. NIH peer review: Criterion scores completely account for racial disparities in overall impact scores.Sci Adv. 2020; 6: eaaz4868Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) affect the funding disparity gap. These studies should be done in parallel with and not before immediate dismantling of racial funding disparity using approaches such as those below."
https://openalex.org/W3071479733,"The over-purchasing and hoarding of necessities is a common response to crises, especially in developed economies where there is normally an expectation of plentiful supply. This behaviour was observed internationally during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the absence of actual scarcity, this behaviour can be described as 'panic buying' and can lead to temporary shortages. However, there have been few psychological studies of this phenomenon. Here we propose a psychological model of over-purchasing informed by animal foraging theory and make predictions about variables that predict over-purchasing by either exacerbating or mitigating the anticipation of future scarcity. These variables include additional scarcity cues (e.g. loss of income), distress (e.g. depression), psychological factors that draw attention to these cues (e.g. neuroticism) or to reassuring messages (eg. analytical reasoning) or which facilitate over-purchasing (e.g. income). We tested our model in parallel nationally representative internet surveys of the adult general population conducted in the United Kingdom (UK: N = 2025) and the Republic of Ireland (RoI: N = 1041) 52 and 31 days after the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 were detected in the UK and RoI, respectively. About three quarters of participants reported minimal over-purchasing. There was more over-purchasing in RoI vs UK and in urban vs rural areas. When over-purchasing occurred, in both countries it was observed across a wide range of product categories and was accounted for by a single latent factor. It was positively predicted by household income, the presence of children at home, psychological distress (depression, death anxiety), threat sensitivity (right wing authoritarianism) and mistrust of others (paranoia). Analytic reasoning ability had an inhibitory effect. Predictor variables accounted for 36% and 34% of the variance in over-purchasing in the UK and RoI respectively. With some caveats, the data supported our model and points to strategies to mitigate over-purchasing in future crises."
https://openalex.org/W3124009158,"<h2>Summary</h2> Astrocytes metabolically interact with neighboring neurons by providing multiple substances to neurons. How astrocytes regulate neural functions via altering the neuronal metabolic state remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that astrocytic ApoE vectors a variety of microRNAs (miRNAs), and these miRNAs specifically silence genes involved in neuronal cholesterol biosynthesis, ultimately accounting for accumulation of the pathway-initiating substrate acetyl-CoA. Consequently, histone acetylation is promoted, and transcription is activated in neurons. Functionally, we demonstrate that ApoE-mediated neuronal histone acetylation leads to increased H3K27ac enrichment in the promoters of multiple neuronal immediate early genes and subsequently to enhanced memory consolidation in mice. Importantly, human ApoE4 vectors lower levels of miRNAs than ApoE3 and therefore is less capable of metabolic and epigenetic regulation in neurons. Collectively, our findings define an astrocytic ApoE-mediated neuronal epigenetic mechanism as a novel means through which astrocytes modulate brain connectivity and function."

https://openalex.org/W3125418989,"Many women going through the menopausal transition experience vasomotor symptoms (VMS), and research has shown that there is a large amount of variation in their frequency and severity. Many lifestyle factors have been found to co-vary with VMS, including the level of social support received by the woman, and how stressed she is. Stress is well documented to worsen menopause symptoms, and there is some evidence that support eases them; however, there is little research into whether support is an effective buffer against the negative effects of stress on VMS. Using nine years of data from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (n = 2718), we use multilevel Poisson regression with random effects to test: 1) if more social support is associated with decreased VMS frequency, 2) if increased life stress worsens VMS, and 3) if support acts as a buffer against stress. After adjusting for age, marital status, smoking, self-perceived overall health, ethnicity, and menopausal status, we find that stress increases the frequency of VMS. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find strong evidence that emotional support led to lower VMS frequency, or that support buffers against the effects of stress. Experience of a stressful event, but not amount of social support, was included in the best fitting model; with the degree to which the woman was upset by the life stressor having the largest effect on menopause symptoms. Here, women who said they were currently upset by a stressful event experienced 21% more VMS than women who had experienced no life stressor. This research highlights that social factors may impact the menopausal transition."

https://openalex.org/W3122475062,"The Nicaraguan COVID-19 situation is exceptional for Central America. The government restricts testing and testing supplies, and the true extent of the coronavirus crisis remains unknown. Dozens of deaths have been reported among health-care workers. However, statistics on the crisis’ effect on health-care workers and their risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 are lacking. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers and to examine correlations with risk factors such as age, sex and comorbidities. Study participants (N = 402, median age 38.48 years) included physicians, nurses and medical assistants, from public and private hospitals, independent of symptom presentation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on saliva samples using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay. A questionnaire was employed to determine subjects’ COVID-19-associated symptoms and their vulnerability to complications from risk factors such as age, sex, professional role and comorbidities. The study was performed five weeks into the exponential growth period in Nicaragua. We discovered that 30.35% of health-care workers participating in our study had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. A large percentage (54.92%) of those who tested positive were asymptomatic and were still treating patients. Nearly 50% of health-care workers who tested positive were under 40, an astonishing 30.33% reported having at least one comorbidity. In our study, sex and age are important risk factors for the probability of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with significance being greatest among those between 30 and 40 years of age. In general, being male resulted in higher risk. Our data are the first non-governmental data obtained in Nicaragua. They shed light on several important aspects of COVID-19 in an underdeveloped nation whose government has implemented a herd-immunity strategy, while lacking an adequate healthcare system and sufficient PPE for health-care workers. These data are important for creating policies for containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3122914594,"The COVID-19 pandemic, the accompanying lockdown measures, and their possible long-term effects have made mental health a pressing public health concern. Acts that focus on benefiting others-known as prosocial behaviors-offer one promising intervention that is both flexible and low cost. However, neither the range of emotional states prosocial acts impact nor the size of those effects is currently clear, both of which directly influence its attractiveness as a treatment option. Using a large online sample from Canada and the United States, we will examine the effect of a three-week prosocial intervention on two indicators of emotional well-being (happiness and the belief that one's life is valuable) and mental health (anxiety and depression). Respondents will be randomly assigned to perform prosocial, self-focused, or neutral behaviors each week. Two weeks after the intervention, a final survey will assess whether the intervention has a lasting effect on mental health and emotional well-being. Our results will illuminate whether prosocial interventions are a viable approach to addressing mental health needs during the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well for those who face emotional challenges during normal times."
https://openalex.org/W3121715645,"Background Grief following stillbirth and child death are one of the most traumatic experience for parents with psychosomatic, social and economic impacts. The grief profile, severity and its impacts in Indian context are not well documented. This study documented the grief and coping experiences of the Indian parents following stillbirth and child death. Methods This exploratory qualitative study in Delhi (India) included in-depth interviews with parents (50 mothers and 49 fathers), who had stillbirth or child death, their family members (n = 41) and community representatives (n = 12). Eight focus group discussions were done with community members (n = 72). Inductive data analysis included thematic content analysis. Perinatal Grief Scale was used to document the mother’s grief severity after 6–9 months of loss. Results The four themes emerged were grief anticipation and expression, impact of the bereavement, coping mechanism, and sociocultural norms and practices. The parents suffered from disbelief, severe pain and helplessness. Mothers expressed severe grief openly and some fainted. Fathers also had severe grief, but didn’t express openly. Some parents shared self-guilt and blamed the hospital/healthcare providers, themselves or family. Majority had no/positive change in couple relationship, but few faced marital disharmony. Majority experienced sleep, eating and psychological disturbances for several weeks. Mothers coped through engaging in household work, caring other child(ren) and spiritual activities. Fathers coped through avoiding discussion and work and professional engagement. Fathers resumed work after 5–20 days and mothers took 2–6 weeks to resume household chores. Unanticipated loss, limited family support and financial strain affected the severity and duration of grief. 57.5% of all mothers and 80% mothers with stillbirth had severe grief after 6–9 months. Conclusions Stillbirth and child death have lasting psychosomatic, social and economic impacts on parents, which are usually ignored. Sociocultural and religion appropriate bereavement support for the parents are needed to reduce the impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3124054505,"Understanding how perceptions around motivation, capacity, and climate change’s impacts relate to the adoption of adaptation practices in light of experiences with extreme weather events is important in assessing farmers’ adaptive capacity. However, very little of this work has occurred in islands, which may have different vulnerabilities and capacities for adaptation. Data of surveyed farmers throughout Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria (n = 405, 87% response rate) were used in a structural equation model to explore the extent to which their adoption of agricultural practices and management strategies was driven by perceptions of motivation, vulnerability, and capacity as a function of their psychological distance of climate change. Our results show that half of farmers did not adopt any practice or strategy, even though the majority perceived themselves capable and motivated to adapt to climate change, and understood their farms to be vulnerable to future extreme events. Furthermore, adoption was neither linked to these adaptation perceptions, nor to their psychological distance of climate change, which we found to be both near and far. Puerto Rican farmers’ showed a broad awareness of climate change’s impacts both locally and globally in different dimensions (temporal, spatial, and social), and climate distance was not linked to reported damages from Hurricane Maria or to previous extreme weather events. These results suggest that we may be reaching a tipping point for extreme events as a driver for climate belief and action, especially in places where there is a high level of climate change awareness and continued experience of compounded impacts. Further, high perceived capacity and motivation are not linked to actual adaptation behaviors, suggesting that broadening adaptation analyses beyond individual perceptions and capacities as drivers of climate adaptation may give us a better understanding of the determinants to strengthen farmers’ adaptive capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3124325833,"Motor-learning literature focuses on simple laboratory-tasks due to their controlled manner and the ease to apply manipulations to induce learning and adaptation. Recently, we introduced a billiards paradigm and demonstrated the feasibility of real-world-neuroscience using wearables for naturalistic full-body motion-tracking and mobile-brain-imaging. Here we developed an embodied virtual-reality (VR) environment to our real-world billiards paradigm, which allows to control the visual feedback for this complex real-world task, while maintaining sense of embodiment. The setup was validated by comparing real-world ball trajectories with the trajectories of the virtual balls, calculated by the physics engine. We then ran our short-term motor learning protocol in the embodied VR. Subjects played billiard shots when they held the physical cue and hit a physical ball on the table while seeing it all in VR. We found comparable short-term motor learning trends in the embodied VR to those we previously reported in the physical real-world task. Embodied VR can be used for learning real-world tasks in a highly controlled environment which enables applying visual manipulations, common in laboratory-tasks and rehabilitation, to a real-world full-body task. Embodied VR enables to manipulate feedback and apply perturbations to isolate and assess interactions between specific motor-learning components, thus enabling addressing the current questions of motor-learning in real-world tasks. Such a setup can potentially be used for rehabilitation, where VR is gaining popularity but the transfer to the real-world is currently limited, presumably, due to the lack of embodiment."

Here, we present FA profiles of five common habitat-building deep-sea sponges (class Demospongiae, order Tetractinellida), which are classified as high microbial abundance (HMA) species. Geodia hentscheli , G . parva , G . atlantica , G . barretti , and Stelletta rhaphidiophora were collected from boreal and Arctic sponge grounds in the North-Atlantic Ocean. Bacterial FAs dominated in all five species and particularly isomeric mixtures of mid-chain branched FAs (MBFAs, 8- and 9-Me-C 16:0 and 10- and 11-Me-C 18:0 ) were found in high abundance (together ≥ 20% of total FAs) aside more common bacterial markers. In addition, the sponges produced long-chain linear, mid- and a(i)- branched unsaturated FAs (LCFAs) with a chain length of 24‒28 C atoms and had predominantly the typical Δ 5,9 unsaturation, although the Δ 9,19 and (yet undescribed) Δ 11,21 unsaturations were also identified. G . parva and S . rhaphidiophora each produced distinct LCFAs, while G . atlantica , G . barretti , and G . hentscheli produced similar LCFAs, but in different ratios. The different bacterial precursors varied in carbon isotopic composition (δ 13 C), with MBFAs being more enriched compared to other bacterial (linear and a ( i )-branched) FAs. We propose biosynthetic pathways for different LCFAs from their bacterial precursors, that are consistent with small isotopic differences found in LCFAs. Indeed, FA profiles of deep-sea sponges can serve as chemotaxonomic markers and support the concept that sponges acquire building blocks from their endosymbiotic bacteria."

Three replicates of 20 gilts were blocked by initial body weight, individually-housed, and assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments: a low-fiber control (LF), a 30% corn bran high-fiber control (HF), HF+100 mg/kg xylanase (HF+XY), and HF+50 mg/kg arabinoxylan oligosaccharide (HF+AX). Gilts were fed their respective treatments for 46 days. On day 46, pigs were euthanized and ileal digesta and mucosa were collected. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced, generating a total of 2,413,572 and 1,739,013 high-quality sequences from the digesta and mucosa, respectively. Sequences were classified into 1,538 mucosa and 2,495 digesta operational taxonomic units (OTU).

Compared to LF, HF increased Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG-002 , and Turicibacter in the digesta, Lachnospiraceae_unclassified in the mucosa, and decreased Actinobacillus in both ( Q &lt;0.05). Relative to HF, HF+XY increased 19 and 14 of the 100 most abundant OTUs characterized from digesta and mucosa, respectively ( Q &lt;0.05). Notably, HF+XY increased the OTU_23_ Faecalibacterium by nearly 6 log 2 -fold change, compared to HF. Relative to HF, HF+XY increased genera Bifidobacterium , and Lactobacillus , and decreased Streptococcus and Turicibacter in digesta ( Q &lt;0.05), and increased Bifidobacterium and decreased Escherichia-Shigella in the mucosa ( Q &lt;0.05). Compared to HF, HF+AX increased 5 and 6 of the 100 most abundant OTUs characterized from digesta and mucosa, respectively, ( Q &lt;0.05), but HF+AX did not modulate similar taxa as HF+XY. The PICRUST2 predictions revealed HF+XY increased gene-predictions for enzymes associated with arabinoxylan degradation and xylose metabolism in the digesta, and increased enzymes related to short-chain fatty acid production in the mucosa. Collectively, these data suggest xylanase elicits a stimbiotic and prebiotic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3088811431,"Religious rituals are associated with health benefits, potentially produced via social bonding. It is unknown whether secular rituals similarly increase social bonding. We conducted a field study with individuals who celebrate secular rituals at Sunday Assemblies and compared them with participants attending Christian rituals. We assessed levels of social bonding and affect before and after the rituals. Results showed the increase in social bonding taking place in secular rituals is comparable to religious rituals. We also found that both sets of rituals increased positive affect and decreased negative affect, and that the change in positive affect predicted the change in social bonding observed. Together these results suggest that secular rituals might play a similar role to religious ones in fostering feelings of social connection and boosting positive affect."
https://openalex.org/W3121891702,"Background While the proportion of HIV-positive children (under 15 years) enrolled on antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased in recent years, up to 60% of children started on ART do not achieve virological suppression. We set out to determine the factors associated with virological non-suppression among children living with HIV receiving ART at a peri-urban HIV care clinic in Kampala, Uganda. Method This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at the pediatric HIV/AIDS clinic at the Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC) in Kampala, Uganda. Three hundred (300) HIV-positive children (0–14 years) were randomly selected from existing medical records and data on children’s socio-demographic and clinical characteristics (age at ART initiation, WHO clinical staging, and ART-induced side effects) were abstracted using a data abstraction form. Virological non-suppression was defined as a viral load ≥1000 copies/Ml of blood after six months of ART initiation. Incident rate ratios (IRRs) were determined as a measure of association between virological non-suppression and child/patient characteristics. The IRRs were obtained via a modified Poisson regression with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). All analyses were done using statistical package, Stata version 15. Results The overall non-suppression rate among HIV-positive children on ART was 23%. Being at WHO clinical stage 4 at ART initiation [adj. IRR 2.74; 95%CI: 1.63, 4.61] and ART-induced side effects [adj. IRR 1.77; 95%CI: 1.06, 2.97] were significantly associated with non-suppression. Older age at ART initiation (age 5–9 years: [adj. IRR 0.42; 95%CI: 0.28, 0.65]; age 10–14 years: [adj. IRR 0.34; 95%CI: 0.18, 0.64] was less likely to be associated with virological non-suppression. Conclusion Nearly a quarter of HIV-positive children on ART had a non-suppressed viral load after six months of treatment. Being at WHO clinical stage 4 at ART initiation and ART-induced side effects were significantly associated with virological non-suppression while older age at ART initiation was protective. Our findings suggest a need for age-specific interventions, particularly those targeting children below five years of age, to improve virological suppression among HIV-positive children receiving ART in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W3122831043,"Concentration difficulties, forgetfulness and mental slowness are common in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS); initial findings suggest that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may also be accompanied by cognitive impairments. This study aimed to compare attentional performance between patients with FMS and RA. Attention was quantified in the domains of alerting, orienting and executive control using the Attentional Network Test–Interaction (ANT-I) in 56 women with FMS, 41 women with RA and 50 healthy women. Pain severity was statistically controlled in the group comparison. While FMS patients exhibited longer reaction times and made more errors on the ANT-I than RA patients and healthy women, performance did not differ between RA patients and healthy women. The magnitude of group differences did not vary by the experimental conditions of the ANT-I, suggesting a general attentional deficit in FMS rather than specific impairments in the domains of alerting, orienting and executive control. Differences between patient groups may relate to the different pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the disorders, i.e. inflammatory processes in RA and central nervous sensitization in FMS. In FMS, heightened activity in the pain neuromatrix may interfere with attention, because it requires enhanced neural resources in brain areas that are involved in both pain and attentional processing."
https://openalex.org/W3122842586,"Background Globally, diabetes mellitus exerts an economic burden on patients and their families. However, the economic burden of diabetes mellitus and its associated factors were not well studied in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the economic burden of diabetes mellitus and its associated factors among diabetic patients in public hospitals of Bahir Dar city administration, Ethiopia. Methods Across sectional study was conducted on 422 diabetic patients. The patients were selected by simple random sampling method. The prevalence-based model was used to estimate the costs on patients’ perspective. Bottom up and human capital approaches were used to estimate the direct and indirect costs of the patients respectively. Wealth index was constructed using principal component analysis by SPSS. Forty percent of nonfood threshold level was used to measure catastrophic diabetic care expenditure of diabetic patients. Whereas, the World Bank poverty line (the $1.90-a-day poverty line) was used to measure impoverishment of patients due to expenses of diabetes mellitus care. Data were entered by Epi data version 3.1and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were used. Results Four hundred one respondents were interviewed with response rate of 95%. We found that 239 (59.6%) diabetic patients incurred catastrophic diabetic care expenditure at 40% nonfood threshold level. Whereas, 20 (5%) diabetic patients were impoverished by diabetic care spending at the $1.90-a-day poverty line. Educational status of respondent, educational status of the head of household, occupation and wealth status were statistically associated with the catastrophic diabetic care expenditure. Conclusions The study revealed that the economic burden of diabetic care is very disastrous among the less privileged populations: the less educated, the poorest and unemployed. Therefore, all concerned stakeholders should design ways that can reduce the financial hardship of diabetic care among diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W3120562649,"Introduction The primary aim of this study is to investigate the impact of a 13-week anomaly scan on the experienced levels of maternal anxiety and well-being. Secondly, to explore women’s knowledge on the possibilities and limitations of the scan and the preferred timing of screening for structural abnormalities. Material and methods In a prospective-cohort study conducted between 2013–2015, pregnant women in the North-Netherlands underwent a 13-week anomaly scan. Four online-questionnaires (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4) were completed before and after the 13- and the 20-week anomaly scans. In total, 1512 women consented to participate in the study and 1118 (74%) completed the questionnaires at Q1, 941 (64%) at Q2, 807 (55%) at Q3 and 535 (37%) at Q4. Psychological outcomes were measured by the state-trait inventory-scale (STAI), the patient’s positive-negative affect (PANAS) and ad-hoc designed questionnaires. Results Nine-nine percent of women wished to be informed as early as possible in pregnancy about the absence/presence of structural abnormalities. In 87% of women levels of knowledge on the goals and limitations of the 13-week anomaly scan were moderate-to-high. In women with a normal 13-week scan result, anxiety levels decreased ( P &lt; .001) and well-being increased over time ( P &lt; .001). In women with false-positive results (n = 26), anxiety levels initially increased (STAI-Q1: 39.8 vs. STAI-Q2: 48.6, P = 0.025), but later decreased around the 20-week anomaly scan (STAI-Q3: 36.4 vs. STAI-Q4: 34.2, P = 0.36). Conclusions The 13-week scan did not negatively impact the psychological well-being of pregnant women. The small number of women with screen-positive results temporarily experienced higher anxiety after the scan but, in false-positive cases, anxiety levels normalized again when the abnormality was not confirmed at follow-up scans. Finally, most pregnant women have moderate-to-high levels of knowledge and strongly prefer early screening for fetal structural abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W3123989985,"Road traffic injuries are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Understanding circumstances leading to road traffic injury is crucial to improve road safety, and implement countermeasures to reduce the incidence and severity of road trauma. We aimed to characterise crash characteristics of road traffic collisions in Victoria, Australia, and to examine the relationship between crash characteristics and fault attribution. Data were extracted from the Victorian State Trauma Registry for motor vehicle drivers, motorcyclists, pedal cyclists and pedestrians with a no-fault compensation claim, aged &gt; = 16 years and injured 2010–2016. People with intentional injury, serious head injury, no compensation claim/missing injury event description or who died &lt; = 12-months post-injury were excluded, resulting in a sample of 2,486. Text mining of the injury event using QDA Miner and Wordstat was used to classify crash circumstances for each road user group. Crashes in which no other was at fault included circumstances involving lost control or avoiding a hazard, mechanical failure or medical conditions. Collisions in which another was predominantly at fault occurred at intersections with another vehicle entering from an adjacent direction, and head-on collisions. Crashes with higher prevalence of unknown fault included multi-vehicle collisions, pedal cyclists injured in rear-end collisions, and pedestrians hit while crossing the road or navigating slow traffic areas. We discuss several methods to promote road safety and to reduce the incidence and severity of road traffic injuries. Our recommendations take into consideration the incidence and impact of road trauma for different types of road users, and include engineering and infrastructure controls through to interventions targeting or accommodating human behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3121148964,"Hereditary breast cancer accounts for 5–10% of all breast cancer cases. So far, known genetic risk factors account for only 50% of the breast cancer genetic component and almost a quarter of hereditary cases are carriers of pathogenic mutations in BRCA1/2 genes. Hence, the genetic basis for a significant fraction of familial cases remains unsolved. This missing heritability may be explained in part by Copy Number Variations (CNVs). We herein aimed to evaluate the contribution of CNVs to hereditary breast cancer in Tunisia. Whole exome sequencing was performed for 9 BRCA negative cases with a strong family history of breast cancer and 10 matched controls. CNVs were called using the ExomeDepth R-package and investigated by pathway analysis and web-based bioinformatic tools. Overall, 483 CNVs have been identified in breast cancer patients. Rare CNVs affecting cancer genes were detected, of special interest were those disrupting APC2 , POU5F1 , DOCK8 , KANSL1 , TMTC3 and the mismatch repair gene PMS2 . In addition, common CNVs known to be associated with breast cancer risk have also been identified including CNVs on APOBECA/B , UGT2B17 and GSTT1 genes. Whereas those disrupting SULT1A1 and UGT2B15 seem to correlate with good clinical response to tamoxifen. Our study revealed new insights regarding CNVs and breast cancer risk in the Tunisian population. These findings suggest that rare and common CNVs may contribute to disease susceptibility. Those affecting mismatch repair genes are of interest and require additional attention since it may help to select candidates for immunotherapy leading to better outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3123126114,"Objectives To compare non-motor symptoms (NMSs) among patients with essential tremor (ET), Parkinson’s disease (PD) subtypes (akinetic-rigid type (ART) and tremor-dominant type (TDT)), and healthy controls. Patients and methods This retrospective study included 129 participants, 72 PD (33 PD-ART, 33 PD-TDT, and 6 Mixed), 29 ET patients, and 28 controls. PD patients were assessed by the unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS), Hoehn, and Yahr scale (H&amp;Y), while ET patients were evaluated by the Fahn Tolosa Marin Tremor Rating Scale. All subjects were evaluated by non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) for NMSs and Beck depression inventory (BDI) for depression. Results PD subtypes groups, ET, and controls were age and gender-matched. Compared to controls, all PD, PD subtypes, and ET showed significantly worse most of NMSs (p&lt;0.001) and depression. Compared to ET, all PD and PD-ART had significantly worse gastrointestinal (p = 0.002), urinary symptoms (p = 0.001, p = 0.003) and depression (p = 0.002) and PD-TDT worse depression, while ET patients showed worse memory/attention than PD subtypes. Total NMSS of ET is highly correlated to depression and moderately to tremor severity and age of onset, while total of NMSS is highly correlated to depression, disease severity, and disability. Conclusion The current study demonstrated several comparable domains of NMSs of PD subtypes and ET, except worse gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms among PD-ART. Identifying different NMSs profiles is important for predicting, better assessing, and tailoring management of ET and PD subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W3124749691,"The Pinyon Jay is a highly social, year-round inhabitant of pinyon-juniper and other coniferous woodlands in the western United States. Range-wide, Pinyon Jays have declined ~ 3–4% per year for at least the last half-century. Occurrence patterns and habitat use of Pinyon Jays have not been well characterized across much of the species’ range, and obtaining this information is necessary for better understanding the causes of ongoing declines and determining useful conservation strategies. Additionally, it is important to better understand if and how targeted removal of pinyon-juniper woodland, a common and widespread vegetation management practice, affects Pinyon Jays. The goal of this study was to identify the characteristics of areas used by Pinyon Jays for several critical life history components in the Great Basin, which is home to nearly half of the species’ global population, and to thereby facilitate the inclusion of Pinyon Jay conservation measures in the design of vegetation management projects. To accomplish this, we studied Pinyon Jays in three widely separated study areas using radio telemetry and direct observation and measured key attributes of their locations and a separate set of randomly-selected control sites using the U. S. Forest Service’s Forest Inventory Analysis protocol. Data visualizations, principle components analysis, and logistic regressions of the resulting data indicated that Pinyon Jays used a distinct subset of available pinyon-juniper woodland habitat, and further suggested that Pinyon Jays used different but overlapping habitats for seed caching, foraging, and nesting. Caching was concentrated in low-elevation, relatively flat areas with low tree cover; foraging occurred at slightly higher elevations with generally moderate but variable tree cover; and nesting was concentrated in slightly higher areas with high tree and vegetation cover. All three of these Pinyon Jay behavior types were highly concentrated within the lower-elevation band of pinyon-juniper woodland close to the woodland-shrubland ecotone. Woodland removal projects in the Great Basin are often concentrated in these same areas, so it is potentially important to incorporate conservation measures informed by Pinyon Jay occurrence patterns into existing woodland management paradigms, protocols, and practices."
https://openalex.org/W3121862538,"Objective Evaluate whether the risk of falls and fractures differs between patients with Parkinson disease with psychosis (PDP) and patients with Parkinson disease (PD) without psychosis at similar disease stages. Methods Patients with PD without psychosis were identified in the Medicare claims databases (2008–2018) and followed from the first PD diagnosis date during the study period. Patients with a subsequent diagnosis of psychosis were included in the PDP group. Patients with PDP and PD without psychosis were propensity score-matched based on characteristics within blocks of time since cohort entry. The incidence rates (IRs), expressed per 100 person-years, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of falls and fractures were evaluated as composite and separate outcomes. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were used to compare patients with PDP and PD without psychosis in the matched cohort. Results 154,306 patients had PD without psychosis and no falls or fractures before cohort entry; the IR for falls and fractures was 11.41 events (95% CI, 11.29–11.53). 12,127 patients (7.8%) had a subsequent PDP diagnosis. PDP patients had a higher prevalence of most comorbidities and risk factors for falls and fractures than those without psychosis. The crude IR for falls and fractures among PDP patients was 29.03 events (95% CI, 28.27–29.81). PD without psychosis and PDP groups had more falls than fractures. After matching, 24,144 PD patients without psychosis (15.6%) and 12,077 PDP patients (99.6%) were retained. Matched PDP patients had a higher incidence of falls and fractures than PD patients without psychosis (IRR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.39–1.49). The higher increased rate was noted separately for falls (IRR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.43–1.54) and any fractures (IRR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08–1.27) as well as within specific types of fracture, including pelvis and hip fractures. Conclusions Our findings suggest a modest but consistently higher increased risk of falls and fractures in PDP patients compared with PD patients without psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W3123444509,"The objective of this study is to determine the effect of Chinese wolfberry (Lycium barbarum) and Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) extract (WAE) on the antioxidant capacity of Tibetan pig liver, and discussed the regulatory effect of WAE on the liver antioxidant mechanism. Twelve healthy 120-day-old Tibetan black pigs (35±2 kg) were divided randomly into two groups. The WAE group was fed a basal diet supplemented with 1% WAE for 90 days. The control group was fed the same diet, but without the WAE. We found that liver superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) activity (P&lt;0.05), total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) (P&lt;0.05), and catalase (CAT) activity (P&lt;0.01) significantly increased in the WAE group compared with the control group; malondialdehyde (MDA) content decreased, but this was not significant (P &gt;0.05). Transcriptome sequencing analysis detected 106 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to oxidative stress. GO enrichment analysis showed these DEGs were involved in the positive regulation of reactive oxygen metabolism and biosynthesis, process regulation, and regulation of the oxidative stress response. KEGG Pathway enrichment analysis showed they were enriched in the PI3K-Akt, AMPK, Rap1, and peroxisome signaling pathways. The expression levels of key peroxisome biosynthesis genes (e.g., PEX3 and PEX11B) and key antioxidant genes (e.g., CAT and SOD1) were significantly higher in the WAE group than in the control group. The PRDX1 and PRDX5 content also was significantly higher in the WAE group. This study showed that the WAE regulated the antioxidant and anti-stress ability of Tibetan pig liver through a “peroxisome antioxidant-oxidant stress” signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3123482626,"Background Preterm birth (PTB) and particularly late preterm PTB has become a research focus for obstetricians, perinatologists, neonatologists, pediatricians and policy makers alike. Translational models are useful tools to expedite and guide clinical but presently no model exists that contextualizes the late PTB scenario. Herein we aimed to develop a rabbit model that echo’s the clinical neurocognitive phenotypes of early and late PTB. Methods Time mated rabbit does underwent caesarean delivery at a postconceptional age (PCA) of either 28 (n = 6), 29 (n = 5), 30 (n = 4) or 31 (n = 4) days, term = 31 d. Newborn rabbits were mixed and randomly allocated to be raised by cross fostering and underwent short term neurobehavioral testing on corrected post-natal day 1. Open field (OFT), spontaneous alteration (TMT) and novel object recognition (NORT) tests were subsequently performed at 4 and 8 weeks of age. Results PTB was associated with a significant gradient of short-term mortality and morbidity inversely related to the PCA. On postnatal day 1 PTB was associated with a significant sensory deficit in all groups but a clear motor insult was only noted in the PCA 29d and PCA 28d groups. Furthermore, PCA 29d and PCA 28d rabbits had a persistent neurobehavioral deficit with less exploration and hyperanxious state in the OFT, less alternation in TMT and lower discriminatory index in the NORT. While PCA 30d rabbits had some anxiety behavior and lower spontaneous alteration at 4 weeks, however at 8 weeks only mild anxiety driven behavior was observed in some of these rabbits. Conclusions In this rabbit model, delivery at PCA 29d and PCA 28d mimics the clinical phenotype of early PTB while delivery at PCA 30d resembles that of late PTB. This could serve as a model to investigate perinatal insults during the early and late preterm period."
https://openalex.org/W3125063517,"Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer is needed to reduce the mortal consequence by cancer. Lipid mediators play critical role in progression of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) and some of their metabolites are excreted in urine. Here, we attempted to find novel biomarkers in urinary lipid metabolite of a murine model of CAC. Mice were received single administration of azoxymethane (AOM) and repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Lipid metabolites in their urine was measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and their colon was collected to perform morphological study. AOM and DSS caused inflammation and tumor formation in mouse colon. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based comprehensive analysis of lipid metabolites showed that cyclooxygenase-mediated arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, prostaglandins, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated AA metabolites, isoprostanes, were predominantly increased in the urine of tumor-bearing mice. Among that, urinary prostaglandin (PG)E 2 metabolite tetranor-PGEM and PGD 2 metabolite tetranor-PGDM were significantly increased in both of urine collected at the acute phase of colitis and the carcinogenesis phase. On the other hand, two F 2 isoprostanes (F 2 -IsoPs), 8-iso PGF 2α and 2,3-dinor-8-iso PGF 2α , were significantly increased only in the carcinogenesis phase. Morphological study showed that infiltrated monocytes into tumor mass strongly expressed ROS generator NADPH (p22 phox ). These observations suggest that urinary 8-iso PGF 2α and 2,3-dinor-8-iso PGF 2α can be indexes of CAC."
https://openalex.org/W3121399681,"During the past decade, the age-adjusted mortality rate for endometrial cancer (EC) increased 1.9% annually with TP53 mutant ( TP53 -mu) EC disproportionally represented in advanced disease and deaths. Therefore, we aimed to assess pivotal molecular parameters that differentiate clinical outcomes in high- and low-risk EC. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas, we analyzed EC specimens with available DNA sequences and quantitative gene-specific RNA expression data. After polymerase ɛ ( POLE )-mutant specimens were excluded, differential gene-specific mutations and mRNA expressions were annotated and integrated. Consequent to TP53 -mu failure to induce p21, derepression of multiple oncogenes harboring promoter p21 repressive sites was observed, including CCNA2 and FOXM1 ( P &lt; .001 compared with TP53 wild type [ TP53 -wt]). TP53 -wt EC with high CCNA2 expression ( CCNA2 -H) had a targeted transcriptomic profile similar to that of TP53 -mu EC, suggesting CCNA2 is a seminal determinant for both TP53 -wt and TP53 -mu EC. CCNA2 enhances E2F1 function, upregulating FOXM1 and CIP2A , as observed in TP53 -mu and CCNA2 -H TP53 -wt EC ( P &lt; .001). CIP2A inhibits protein phosphatase 2A, leading to AKT inactivation of GSK3β and restricted oncoprotein degradation; PPP2R1A and FBXW7 mutations yield similar results. Upregulation of FOXM1 and failed degradation of FOXM1 is evidenced by marked upregulation of multiple homologous recombination genes ( P &lt; .001). Integrating these molecular aberrations generated a molecular biomarker panel with significant prognostic discrimination ( P = 5.8×10 −7 ); adjusting for age, histology, grade, myometrial invasion, TP53 status, and stage, only CCNA2 -H/ E2F1 -H ( P = .0003), FBXW7 -mu/ PPP2R1A -mu ( P = .0002), and stage ( P = .017) were significant. The generated prognostic molecular classification system identifies dissimilar signaling aberrations potentially amenable to targetable therapeutic options."
https://openalex.org/W3122001706,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is lethal and causes myocardial necrosis via time-dependent ischemia due to prolonged occlusion of the infarct-related artery. No effective therapy or potential therapeutic targets can prevent myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Targeted temperature management (TTM) may reduce peri-infarct regions by inhibiting the extracellular release of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) as a primary mediator of the innate immune response. We used a rat left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation model to determine if TTM at 33°C and 36°C had similar myocardial protective effects. Rats were divided into sham, LAD I/R+37°C normothermia, LAD I/R+33°C TTM, and LAD I/R+36°C TTM groups (n = 5 per group). To verify the cardioprotective effect of TTM by specifically inhibiting HMGB1, rats were assigned to sham, LAD I/R, and LAD I/R after pre-treatment with glycyrrhizin (known as a pharmacological inhibitor of HMGB1) groups (n = 5 per group). Different target temperatures of 33°C and 36°C caused equivalent reductions in infarct volume after myocardial I/R, inhibited the extracellular release of HMGB1 from infarct tissue, and suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines from peri-infarct regions. TTM at 33°C and 36°C significantly attenuated the elevation of cardiac troponin, a sensitive and specific marker of heart muscle damage, after injury. Similarly, glycyrrhizin alleviated myocardial damage by suppressing the extracellular release of HMGB1. TTM at 33°C and 36°C had equivalent myocardial protective effects by similar inhibiting HMGB1 release against myocardial I/R injury. This is the first study to suggest that a target core temperature of 36°C is applicable for cardioprotection."
https://openalex.org/W3123106976,"What drives the formation and evolution of the global refugee flow network over time? Refugee flows in particular are widely explained as the result of pursuits for physical security, with recent research adding geopolitical considerations for why states accept refugees. We refine these arguments and classify them into explanations of people following existing migration networks and networks of inter-state amity and animosity. We also observe that structural network interdependencies may bias models of migration flows generally and refugee flows specifically. To account for these dependencies, we use a dyadic hypothesis testing method—Multiple Regression- Quadratic Assignment Procedure (MR-QAP). We estimate MR-QAP models for each year during the 1991–2016 time period. K-means clustering analysis with visualization supported by multi-dimensional scaling allows us to identify categories of variables and years. We find support for the categorization of drivers of refugee flows into migration networks and inter-state amity and animosity. This includes key nuance that, while contiguity has maintained a positive influence on refugee flows, the magnitude of that influence has declined over time. Strategic rivalry also has a positive influence on refugee flows via dyad-level correlations and its effect on the structure of the global refugee flow network. In addition, we find clear support for the global refugee flow network shifting after the Arab Spring in 2011, and drivers of refugee flows shifting after 2012. Our findings contribute to the study of refugee flows, international migration, alliance and rivalry relationships, and the application of social network analysis to international relations."
https://openalex.org/W3123678846,"Background GeneXpert is a new introduction in the diagnostic modality to fight tuberculosis (TB) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) under the program of intensified TB case finding. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of GeneXpert under the program of intensified TB cases finding among PLHIV. Methods Cross-sectional study was conducted by recruiting individuals attending an HIV clinic from February 2018 to January 2019. Data on clinical parameters were collected using a standardized tool. Two-morning sputum samples were collected and processed for smear microscopy and GeneXpert. SPSS 21 used for data analysis. Proportion, percentage, and mean with SD were used to describe variables. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with the GeneXpert. Values for which the 95% CI interval not includes 1 and for which P&lt;0.05 were considered significant. Result A total of 384 presumptive TB-HIV co-infection cases were included, of which 166 (43%) were diagnosed to have TB. Fifty-four (32.5%) TB cases were smear AFB positive while 79 (47.7%) TB cases were GeneXpert positive. The GeneXpert detection rate was almost two-fold of that of smear microscopy and all smear positive TB cases were detected by GeneXpert. Moreover, GeneXpert was able to detect an additional third of TB confirmed cases among smear AFB negative cases. Advanced stage of the disease, high viral load and presence of anemia were significantly associated with TB. The WHO TB screening tool remained least sensitive with the lowest positive predictive value. Conclusion GeneXpert demonstrated two-fold case detection rate compared to the sputum smear microscopy and additional third TB case detection rate among smear AFB negative cases. Clinical screening tool for evaluation of TB-HIV co-infection showed poor performance in TB case notification."
https://openalex.org/W3123999068,"Introduction The independent role of serum uric acid (SUA) on kidney disease is controversial due to its association with metabolic syndrome. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of baseline SUA with development of chronic kidney disease and eGFR decline in normotensive, normoglycemic and non-obese individuals during follow up period. Materials and methods We included non-hypertensitive, non-diabetic, and non-obese 13,133 adults with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m 2 who had a voluntary health check-up during 2004–2017. Results SUA was positively related to adjusted means of systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglyceride, body mass index, and body fat percent. SUA was inversely associated with high density lipoprotein HDL (P for trend ≤0.001). SUA was an independent risk factor for the development of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. During 45.0 [24.0–76.0] months of median follow up, the highest quartiles of SUA showed significant risks of 30% eGFR decline compared than the lowest quartile (RR:3.701; 95% CI: 1.504–9.108). The highest quartile had a 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.182–4.177) increase in risk for incident chronic kidney disease (CKD). Conclusions SUA is an independent risk factor for the development of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in the healthy population.

Novel biomarkers for the tumorigenesis and lifetime of LGG are critically demanded to be investigated. In this study, the expression levels of procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenases (PLODs) were analyzed by ONCOMINE, HPA and GEPIA. The GEPIA online platform was applied to evaluate the interrelation between PLODs and survival index in LGG. Furthermore, functions of PLODs and co-expression genes were inspected by the DAVID. Moreover, we used TIMER, cBioportal, GeneMINIA and NetworkAnalyst analysis to reveal the mechanism of PLODs in LGG. We found that expression levels of each PLOD family members were up-regulated in patients with LGG. Higher expression of PLODs was closely related to shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The findings showed that LGG cases with or without alterations were significantly correlated with the OS and DFS. The mechanism of PLODs in LGG may be involved in response to hypoxia, oxidoreductase activity, Lysine degradation and immune cell infiltration. In general, this research has investigated the values of PLODs in LGG, which could serve as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and potential therapeutic targets of LGG patients."
https://openalex.org/W3122272436,"The use of agents that target both glia and neurons may represent a new strategy for the treatment of ageing disorders. Here, we confirmed the presence of the novel cyclic peptide Naturido that originates from a medicinal fungus ( Isaria japonic a) grown on domestic silkworm ( Bombyx mori ). We found that Naturido significantly enhanced astrocyte proliferation and activated the single copy gene encoding the neuropeptide VGF and the neuron - derived NGF gene. The addition of the peptide to the culture medium of primary hippocampal neurons increased dendrite length, dendrite number and axon length. Furthermore, the addition of the peptide to primary microglial cultures shifted CGA-activated microglia towards anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective phenotypes. These findings of in vitro glia–neuron interactions led us to evaluate the effects of oral administration of the peptide on brain function and hair ageing in senescence-accelerated mice (SAMP8). In vivo analyses revealed that spatial learning ability and hair quality were improved in Naturido-treated mice compared with untreated mice, to the same level observed in the normal ageing control (SAMR1). These data suggest that Naturido may be a promising glia–neuron modulator for the treatment of not only senescence, but also Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3124028415,"Emotion regulation is a central task of daily life. Difficulty regulating emotions is a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD), one of the most common and impairing personality disorder diagnoses. While anger and symptoms of depression are instantiated in the criteria for BPD, anxiety is not, despite being among the most common psychiatric symptoms. In a sample of online respondents (N = 471), we explored the interactions between anxiety symptoms and BPD traits in predicting well-being (WHO-5) as well as poorer work and social adjustment (WSAS), while controlling for anger and depression. We hypothesized that anxiety would lead to more impairment (i.e., lower well-being and poorer work and more difficulties with work and social adjustment) as BPD traits increased. BPD traits and symptoms of anxiety both contributed to overall lower levels well-being and higher levels of psychosocial dysfunction. However, contrary to our expectations, at higher (vs. lower) levels of BPD traits, symptoms of anxiety were less conducive to lower well-being on the WHO-5. For the WSAS, there was no consistent evidence for an interaction between BPD traits and anxiety in predicting functioning. By and large, our results do not support the idea that anxiety contributes to more impairment at higher levels of BPD traits."
https://openalex.org/W3124404964,"In this study, a dynamic water budget model is developed for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (EAD) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The model, called Abu Dhabi Water Budget Model (ADWBM), accounts for a number of drivers such as population growth, economic growth, consumption pattern and climatic factors. Model formulation, calibration, validation as well as simulation results for two future situations are presented in this paper. The two water simulations discuss demand-side options in response to different future water conditions until 2050. The first simulation, namely, baseline (BL) simulation examined water balance in the emirate assuming no change in both water production and consumption. BL simulation results highlight the expected shortages in water resources assuming no modification in the supply side. The second simulation, a more conservative and practical simulation considering water conservation options and sustainable improvements to the supply side was developed to achieve a balanced water budget by reducing the baseline consumption rates. The results show that a significant demand reduction is needed in all demand sectors, reaching 60% in the potable sectors and above 70% in non-potable sectors. Overall, results show that the ADWBM can be used as a numerical tool to produce accurate figures of water supply and demand for the sake of planning and decision making in the water sector of the EAD until 2050."
https://openalex.org/W3124522643,"Seed germination is a complex process enabling plant reproduction. Germination was found to be regulated at the proteome, metabolome and hormonal levels as well as via discrete post-translational modification of proteins including phosphorylation and carbonylation. Redox balance is also involved but less studied. Acer seeds displaying orthodox and recalcitrant characteristics were investigated to determine the levels of redox couples of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) phosphate (NADP) and integrated with the levels of ascorbate and glutathione. NAD and NADP concentrations were higher in Norway maple seeds and exceptionally high at the germinated stage, being the most contrasting parameter between germinating Acer seeds. In contrast, NAD(P)H/NAD(P) + ratios were higher in sycamore seeds, thus exhibiting higher reducing power. Despite distinct concentrations of ascorbate and glutathione, both seed types attained in embryonic axes and cotyledons had similar ratios of reduced/oxidized forms of ascorbate and half-cell reduction potential of glutathione at the germinated stage. Both species accomplished germination displaying different strategies to modulate redox status. Sycamore produced higher amounts of ascorbate and maintained pyridine nucleotides in reduced forms. Interestingly, lower NAD(P) concentrations limited the regeneration of ascorbate and glutathione but dynamically drove metabolic reactions, particularly in this species, and contributed to faster germination. We suggest that NAD(P) is an important player in regulating redox status during germination in a distinct manner in Norway maple and sycamore seeds."
https://openalex.org/W3122076764,"Prior reports have documented extremely poor adherence to evidence-based medications among South Asian patients with established chronic cardiovascular diseases. Treatment adherence is now considered a part of the 'self-care' process, the determinants of which have not been adequately explored or explained among South Asian patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Our objective was to qualitatively ascertain the determinants of the self-care process among Indian patients with a lived experience of heart failure.We conducted in-depth interviews (audio-recorded) among 22 purposively sampled patients living with chronic heart failure, diagnosed at least 4 weeks prior to the interview and 17 caregivers (n = 39) in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Southern India. We employed an inductive analytical approach using Charmaz's constructivist grounded theory. Initial line-by-line coding and categorization was followed by memo writing, reflexive analysis after interviewing and analyzing four, eight and twelve patients, and at each stage further theoretical sampling was carried out until we reached thematic saturation. We used NVivo ver. 12 to analyze and organize data.The mean age of our patients was 61 years and they represented 5 Indian states and spoke seven languages, distributed across socio-economic strata and literacy levels. We classified self-care determinants into 3 broad, simple categories and defined underlying themes namely, negative determinants (passivity, entrenched beliefs, negative affect, lack of knowledge, financial difficulties, and fatalism), intermediate factors (patient expectations, provider/hospital hopping) and facilitators or positive self-care determinants (intrinsic and extrinsic facilitators). Gender and the cultural background of patients' upbringing appear to shape these determinants, thereby affecting self-care decision making in chronic heart failure.We have empirically described a unique set of self-care determinants among Indian chronic heart failure patients, which in turn are shaped by economic and socio-cultural factors. Assessing for and addressing these determinants during clinical interactions through multi-factorial approaches may help improve self-care among Indian CHF patients, thus improving treatment adherence and clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3122888160,"The main objective of current study was to identify the fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) expressed in both adipocytes and macrophages in vitreous fluid from patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Patients with RVO (n = 14, CRVO; central RVO n = 5, BRVO; branch RVO n = 9) and non-RVO (macular hole or epiretinal membrane, n = 18) were surgically treated by a 25 or 27G vitrectomy. Undiluted vitreous fluid samples obtained as the result of surgery were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure the levels of FABP4 and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA).Data including ocular blood flow by laser speckle flow graphy (LSFG), height and weight, systemic blood pressures and several blood biochemistry values were collected. Among the LSFG mean blur rate (MBR) values of the optic nerve head (ONH) at baseline, MA (MBR of all area), MV (MBR of the vascular area), and MV-MT (MBR of the tissue area) were significantly decreased in patients with CRVO. The levels of V-FABP4 and V-VEGFA were relatively or significantly (P&lt; 0.05) higher in the BRVO or CRVO patients compared to the non-RVO patients, respectively. A positive correlation (r = 0.36, P = 0.045) or a negative correlation (r = -0.51, P = 0.006) was observed between Log V-FABP4 and Log V-VEGF, or Log V-FABP4 and MV-MT at post-operative 1-week, respectively. Furthermore, neither of these factors were affected with respect to sex, body mass index and several clinical parameters that were collected, except that a positive correlation was observed for Log V-FABP4 with blood urea nitrogen. Stepwise multivariable regression analyses indicated that MV-MT at post-operative 1week was independently associated with Log V-FABP4 after adjustment for age and gender, and gender and Log V-FABP4 were independently associated with Log V-VEGFA after adjustment for age. The findings reported herein suggest that an independent factor, FABP4 may be synergistically involved in the pathogenesis of RVO with VEGFA."
https://openalex.org/W3123280803,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are effective antibody-based therapeutics for hematopoietic and lymphoid tumors. However, there is need to identify new targets for ADCs, particularly for solid tumors and cancers with unmet needs. From a hybridoma library developed against cancer cells, we selected the mouse monoclonal antibody 33B7, which was able to bind to, and internalize, cancer cell lines. This antibody was used for identification of the target by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis, followed by target validation. After target validation, 33B7 binding and target positivity were tested by flow cytometry and western blot analysis in several cancer cell lines. The ability of 33B7 conjugated to saporin to inhibit in vitro proliferation of PTFRN positive cell lines was investigated, as well as the 33B7 ADC in vivo effect on tumor growth in athymic mice. All flow cytometry and in vitro internalization assays were analyzed for statistical significance using a Welsh’s T-test. Animal studies were analyzed using Two-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) utilizing post-hoc Bonferroni analysis, and/or Mixed Effects analysis. The 33B7 cell surface target was identified as Prostaglandin F2 Receptor Negative Regulator (PTGFRN), a transmembrane protein in the Tetraspanin family. This target was confirmed by showing that PTGFRN-expressing cells bound and internalized 33B7, compared to PTGFRN negative cells. Cells able to bind 33B7 were PTGFRN-positive by Western blot analysis. In vitro treatment PTGFRN-positive cancer cell lines with the 33B7-saporin ADC inhibited their proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. 33B7 conjugated to saporin was also able to block tumor growth in vivo in mouse xenografts when compared to a control ADC. These findings show that screening antibody libraries for internalizing antibodies in cancer cell lines is a good approach to identify new cancer targets for ADC development. These results suggest PTGFRN is a possible therapeutic target via antibody-based approach for certain cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3123800769,"Introduction Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a group of drugs that are essential for the treatment of acid-related disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), dyspepsia, gastric ulcers and Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) infection. PPIs such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole are metabolized by the CYP2C19 enzyme, which is encoded by a polymorphic gene. Four polymorphisms have an impact on the speed of PPI metabolism: CYP2C19*1/*1 (extensive metabolizers), CYP2C19*2/*2 (intermediate metabolizers), CYP2C19*3/*3 (poor metabolizers) and CYP2C19*17/*17 (ultrarapid metabolizers). Extensive and ultrarapid metabolizers inactivate PPIs quickly, which consequently causes low plasma concentrations of PPIs, while intermediate or poor metabolizers have higher plasma concentrations of PPIs and, therefore, PPIs have greater therapeutic efficacy in individuals with these polymorphisms. Objective To determine the frequency of genetic polymorphisms of the CPY2C19 enzyme in Bogotá, Colombia. Methods This observational study was conducted in Bogotá between 2012 and 2015 and was part of a clinical trial (ID: NCT03650543). It included 239 subjects with dyspepsia, H . pylori infection, or GERD symptoms. CYP2C19 genotyping was performed on gastric biopsy samples. Polymorphisms *1, *2, and *3 were analyzed by real-time PCR (Roche ® ), and PCR-RFLP was used to determine the presence of polymorphism *17. Results The distribution of different types of PPI metabolizers was as follows: extensive (70.7%), ultrarapid (12.9%), intermediate (8.8%) and poor (0.8%). Conclusion The population studied consisted mainly of extensive and ultrarapid PPI metabolizers. These findings show that it is necessary to increase PPI doses in this group of subjects or to use PPIs that are not metabolized by CYP2C19 (rabeprazole). This is the first Colombian work to identify ultrarapid metabolizers."
https://openalex.org/W3125971712,"The objective of this study was to compare the effects of supplementation with two methionine isoforms, L-methionine (L-Met) or D-methionine (D-Met), on transcriptome expression in broiler chickens under acute heat stress. A total of 240 one-day-old chicks were randomly assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement: thermo-neutral vs. acute heat-stress and L-Met vs. D-Met supplementation. On day 14, the heat-stressed group was exposed to 32°C for 5 h, while the others remained at 25°C. Six chicks were randomly selected per treatment and total RNA was isolated from whole blood, ileum, and liver tissues. Two RNA samples from each tissue of each treatment group were randomly selected and pooled in equal amounts. A total of 1.87 billion raw reads obtained from 36 samples (four treatments × three tissues × three composited replicates) were mapped to the reference genome build (Gallus_gallus-5.0) and used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using DESeq2. Functional enrichment of DEGs was tested using DAVID. Comparing the two isoforms of supplemented methionine, two, three, and ten genes were differentially expressed (&gt; 1 or &lt; -1 log 2 fold change) in whole blood, ileum, and liver, respectively. A total of 38, 71, and 16 genes were differentially expressed in response to the interaction between heat stress and Met isoforms in the blood, ileum, and liver, respectively. Three-tissue-specific DEGs were functionally enriched for regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and metabolism, glucose metabolism, and vascular patterning. Chicks fed with L-Met had lower immune (e.g., IL4I1 and SERPINI1 ) and intestinal angiogenic responses (e.g., FLT1 and FGD5 ), and stable glucose and lipid metabolism (e.g., PCK1 and LDLR ) under heat stress conditions. In conclusion, unlike D-Met, L-Met supplementation seems to help maintain physiological homeostasis and enhances cellular defense systems against external stresses like high environmental temperature."
https://openalex.org/W3016879215,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are growth factors that belong to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, and till date 15 BMPs have been described. BMPs, first described for their role in bone and cartilage formation, also play a role in renal fibrosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD). There is evidence to indicate that in rodent models of CKD, administration of recombinant BMP1–3 increases renal fibrosis whereas administration of a BMP1–3-neutralizing antibody or BMP-7 antibody reduces renal fibrosis and preserves renal function. The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in gene expression in the renal cortex obtained from cats with kidney disease or calcium oxalate stone formers (CaOx) at necropsy, to identify BMPs associated with renal dysfunction in cats and potential fibrosis. At time of death the circulating levels of creatinine as well as symmetric dimethyl arginine (SDMA), both markers of kidney decline in cats, were significantly higher in cats with renal disease (n=11) or stone-forming cats (CaOx, n=12) when compared to controls (n=19). Using RNAseq in kidney tissue, we found a modest, but significant, increase in the expression of BMP-1 in cats with kidney disease (2.48 fold) and stone formers (1.72 fold), compared to controls (both p<0.01). While the increase in BMP-2 in CaOx cats was significant (1.46 fold; p<0.05 vs Con), the increase in cats with kidney disease was not (1.23 fold; NS). BMP2K, a BMP-2 inducible kinase, was significantly increased in both kidney disease (1.43 fold) and CaOX (1.46 fold) (both p<0.05). In contrast, a significant decrease in BMP4 was observed in both groups (<2.2 fold and 1.68 fold in kidney disease and CaOx, respectively; both p<0.001 vs Con). A decrease was also seen in CRIM 1, a protein associated with podocyte filtration function and whose reduction is associated with fibrosis, in both groups. BMP-7, whose potential therapeutic role in treating CKD and reversing fibrosis has been documented, was modestly decreased in both groups (both less than 1.5 fold) compared to controls. Given that there was an increase in all three forms of TGFβ (TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and TGFβ3), a potent initiator of renal fibrosis, in both groups, and a decline in BMP-7, an endogenous inhibitor of TGFβ signaling in fibrosis, compared to controls, our results profile the BMPs potentially associated with renal fibrosis in cats that may contribute to kidney dysfunction. In summary, a nutritional therapy to slow the progression of kidney dysfunction may benefit from the inclusion of dietary ingredients that attenuate renal fibrosis in cats.

https://openalex.org/W3121492379,"Studies show that Democrats and Republicans treat copartisans better than they do non-copartisans. However, party affiliation is different from other identities associated with unequal treatment. Compared to race or gender, people can more easily falsify, i.e., lie about, their party affiliation. We use a behavioral experiment to study how people allocate resources to copartisan and non-copartisan partners when partners are allowed to falsify their affiliation and may have incentives to do so. When affiliation can be falsified, the gap between contributions to signaled copartisans and signaled non-copartisans is eliminated. This happens in part because some participants-especially strong partisans-suspect that partners who signal a copartisan affiliation are, in fact, non-copartisans. Suspected non-copartisans earn less than both partners who signal that they are non-copartisans and partners who withhold their affiliation. The findings reveal an unexpected upside to the availability of falsification: at the aggregate level, it reduces unequal treatment across groups. At the individual-level, however, falsification is risky."
https://openalex.org/W3123782093,"Stochastic computing has recently gained attention due to its low hardware complexity and better fault tolerance against soft errors. However, stochastic computing based circuits suffer from different errors which affect the output accuracy of these circuits. In this paper, an accurate and area-efficient stochastic computing based digital finite impulse response filter is designed. In the proposed work, constant uniform patterns are used as stochastic numbers for the select lines of different MUXes in the filter and the error performance of filter is analysed. Based on the error performance, the combinations of these patterns are proposed for reducing the output error of stochastic computing based filters. The architectures for generating these uniform patterns are also proposed. Results show that the proposed design methodology has better error performance and comparable hardware complexity as compared to the state-of-the-art implementations."
https://openalex.org/W3124896986,"Conventional empirical studies of foodborne-disease outbreaks (FDOs) in agricultural markets are linear-stochastic formulations hardwiring a world in which markets self-correct in response to external random shocks including FDOs. These formulations were unequipped to establish whether FDOs cause market reaction, or whether markets endogenously propagate outbreaks. We applied nonlinear time series analysis (NLTS) to reconstruct annual dynamics of FDOs in US cattle markets from CDC outbreak data, live cattle futures market prices, and USDA cattle inventories from 1967–2018, and used reconstructed dynamics to detect causality. Reconstructed deterministic nonlinear market dynamics are endogenously unstable—not self-correcting, and cattle inventories drive futures prices and FDOs attributed to beef in temporal patterns linked to a multi-decadal cattle cycle undetected in daily/weekly price movements investigated previously. Benchmarking real-world dynamics with NLTS offers more informative and credible empirical modeling at the convergence of natural and economic sciences."
https://openalex.org/W3125072986,"Scientific management of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool, e.g., through a reasonable tillage system, is a potential way to mitigate global climate change. There is scarce information about the effect of tillage during the summer fallow period on the SOC pool in rainfed winter-wheat fields. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of tillage practices, i.e., plow tillage (PTF), subsoiling (STF) and no tillage (NTF), during the summer fallow period on SOC sequestration in winter-wheat fields in the rainfed area of the eastern Loess Plateau of China. The SOC, mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC), permanganate-oxidizable organic carbon (POxC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations were determined after four years of tillage implementation during the summer fallow period. Our results showed that in comparison to the adoption of NTF, the adoption of STF significantly increased POxC, POC and MOC concentrations by 56.6–111.2%, 45.7–118.7% and 26.2–29.4%, respectively, at the 10–20 and 30–40 cm soil depths before sowing ( P &lt; 0.05). The POxC and MOC concentrations under STF at depths of 0–10, 10–20, 20–30 and 30–50 cm were significantly greater than those under PTF and NTF after harvesting ( P &lt; 0.05). In addition, the SOC concentration and SOC stock under STF were significantly greater than those under NTF at the 0–10, 10–20, 20–30 and 30–40 cm soil depths before sowing and after harvesting ( P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, in comparison to PTF and NTF, STF resulted in significantly higher SOC stocks by 12.0–25.3% and 7.1–19.2% than PTF and NTF, respectively, in the 0–10, 0–20, 0–30, 0–40 and 0–50 cm soil profiles at harvesting ( P &lt; 0.05). In summary, the adoption of STF could be beneficial to the management of the SOC pool in the 0–50 cm soil profile in the rainfed area of winter-wheat on the Loess Plateau of China."
