Here we present a comprehensive image-based map of subcellular protein distribution, the Cell Atlas, built by integrating transcriptomics and antibody-based immunofluorescence microscopy with validation by mass spectrometry. Mapping the in situ localization of 12,003 human proteins at a single-cell level to 30 subcellular structures enabled the definition of the proteomes of 13 major organelles. Exploration of the proteomes revealed single-cell variations in abundance or spatial distribution and localization of about half of the proteins to multiple compartments. This subcellular map can be used to refine existing protein-protein interaction networks and provides an important resource to deconvolute the highly complex architecture of the human cell."

Sun et al. developed a Nb 2 O 5 /holey graphene framework composite with tailored porosity. The three-dimensional, hierarchically porous holey graphene acted as a conductive scaffold to support Nb 2 O 5 . A high mass loading and improved power capability were reached by tailoring the porosity in the holey graphene backbone with higher charge transport in the composite architecture. The interconnected graphene network provided excellent electron transport, and the hierarchical porous structure in the graphene sheets facilitated rapid ion transport and mitigated diffusion limitations.

Minutti et al. studied mouse models of helminth infection and fibrosis. They expressed surfactant protein A (a member of the complement component C1q family) in the lung, which enhanced interleukin-4 (IL-4)-mediated proliferation and activation of alveolar macrophages. This activation accelerated helminth clearance and reduced lung injury. In the peritoneum, C1q boosted macrophage activation for liver repair after bacterial infection. By a different approach, Bosurgi et al. discovered that after wounding caused by migrating helminths in the lung or during inflammation in the gut of mice, IL-4 and IL-13 act only in the presence of apoptotic cells to promote tissue repair by local macrophages.

Bastin et al. provide a global estimate of forest extent in drylands, calculated from high-resolution satellite images covering more than 200,000 plots. Forests in drylands are much more extensive than previously reported and cover a total area similar to that of tropical rainforests or boreal forests. This increases estimates of global forest cover by at least 9%, a finding that will be important in estimating the terrestrial carbon sink. Science , this issue p. 635"

https://openalex.org/W3100334085,"A correlation between giant-planet mass and atmospheric heavy elemental abundance was first noted in the past century from observations of planets in our own Solar System, and has served as a cornerstone of planet formation theory. Using data from the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes from 0.5 to 5 microns, we conducted a detailed atmospheric study of the transiting Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26b. We detected prominent H2O absorption bands with a maximum base-to-peak amplitude of 525ppm in the transmission spectrum. Using the water abundance as a proxy for metallicity, we measured HAT-P-26b's atmospheric heavy element content [4.8 (-4.0 +21.5) times solar]. This likely indicates that HAT-P-26b's atmosphere is primordial and obtained its gaseous envelope late in its disk lifetime, with little contamination from metal-rich planetesimals."
https://openalex.org/W2612351849,"The type 2 immune response controls helminth infection and maintains tissue homeostasis but can lead to allergy and fibrosis if not adequately regulated. We have discovered local tissue-specific amplifiers of type 2-mediated macrophage activation. In the lung, surfactant protein A (SP-A) enhanced interleukin-4 (IL-4)-dependent macrophage proliferation and activation, accelerating parasite clearance and reducing pulmonary injury after infection with a lung-migrating helminth. In the peritoneal cavity and liver, C1q enhancement of type 2 macrophage activation was required for liver repair after bacterial infection, but resulted in fibrosis after peritoneal dialysis. IL-4 drives production of these structurally related defense collagens, SP-A and C1q, and the expression of their receptor, myosin 18A. These findings reveal the existence within different tissues of an amplification system needed for local type 2 responses."

In different animals, the chromosomes and specific genes that function in sex determination vary widely. As a case in point, the familiar housefly displays a highly variable sex determination system. In this animal, the male determiner (M-factor) instructs male development when it is active, but female development results when it is inactive. Sharma et al. now identify the housefly M-factor, which arose via the co-option of existing genes, gene duplication, and neofunctionalization. The findings elucidate the remarkable diversity in sex-determining pathways and the forces that drive this diversity. Science , this issue p. 642"
https://openalex.org/W2612421949,"ER-PM contacts in nonclathrin endocytosis The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is internalized through both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and nonclathrin endocytosis (NCE). The two pathways act in concert to sustain EGFR signaling or its long-term attenuation. The mechanistic underpinnings of EGFR-NCE are unclear. Caldieri et al. used a variety of cell and molecular biology approaches to identify nine regulators of EGFR-NCE (see the Perspective by Tan and Anderson). They also identified an additional cargo of the pathway (CD147). One of the regulators of the pathway was the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein reticulon 3 (RTN3). Unexpectedly, EGFR-NCE required the formation of specific contacts between the plasma membrane (PM) and the cortical ER, mediated by RTN3. ER-PM contact sites were required in the very early steps of the internalization process for the maturation of NCE tubular intermediates. Science , this issue p. 617 ; see also p. 584"

https://openalex.org/W2614024591,"In 2007, the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation-Translation of Research Into Practice Study (SAFE-TRIPS) reported that 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) were the most commonly used resuscitation fluids in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Evidence has emerged since 2007 that these fluids are associated with adverse patient-centred outcomes. Based on the published evidence since 2007, we sought to determine the current type of fluid resuscitation used in clinical practice and the predictors of fluid choice and determine whether these have changed between 2007 and 2014.In 2014, an international, cross-sectional study was conducted (Fluid-TRIPS) to document current patterns of intravenous resuscitation fluid use and determine factors associated with fluid choice. We examined univariate and multivariate associations between patients and prescriber characteristics, geographical region and fluid type. Additionally, we report secular trends of resuscitation fluid use in a cohort of ICUs that participated in both the 2007 and 2014 studies. Regression analysis were conducted to determine changes in the administration of crystalloid or colloid between 2007 and 2014.In 2014, a total of 426 ICUs in 27 countries participated. Over the 24 hour study day, 1456/6707 (21.7%) patients received resuscitation fluid during 2716 resuscitation episodes. Crystalloids were administered to 1227/1456 (84.3%) patients during 2208/2716 (81.3%) episodes and colloids to 394/1456 (27.1%) patients during 581/2716 (21.4%) episodes. In multivariate analyses, practice significantly varied between geographical regions. Additionally, patients with a traumatic brain injury were less likely to receive colloid when compared to patients with no trauma (adjusted OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.1 to 0.62; p = 0.003). Patients in the ICU for one or more days where more likely to receive colloid compared to patients in the ICU on their admission date (adjusted OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.41; p = <0.001). For secular trends in fluid resuscitation, 84 ICUs in 17 countries contributed data. In 2007, 527/1663 (31.7%) patients received fluid resuscitation during 1167 episodes compared to 491/1763 (27.9%) patients during 960 episodes in 2014. The use of crystalloids increased from 498/1167 (42.7%) in 2007 to 694/960 (72.3%) in 2014 (odds ratio (OR) 3.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.95 to 4.77; p = <0.001), primarily due to a significant increase in the use of buffered salt solutions. The use of colloids decreased from 724/1167 (62.0%) in 2007 to 297/960 (30.9%) in 2014 (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.43; p = <0.001), primarily due to a decrease in the use of HES, but an overall increase in the use of albumin.Clinical practices of intravenous fluid resuscitation have changed between 2007 and 2014. Geographical location remains a strong predictor of the type of fluid administered for fluid resuscitation. Overall, there is a preferential use of crystalloids, specifically buffered salt solutions, over colloids. There is now an imperative to conduct a trial determining the safety and efficacy of these fluids on patient-centred outcomes.Clinicaltrials.gov: Fluid-Translation of research into practice study (Fluid-TRIPS) NCT02002013."

https://openalex.org/W2613808212,"Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues used for pathological diagnosis are valuable for studying cancer genomics. In particular, laser-capture microdissection of target cells determined by histopathology combined with FFPE tissue section immunohistochemistry (IHC) enables precise analysis by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the genetic events occurring in cancer. The result is a new strategy for a pathological tool for cancer diagnosis: 'microgenomics'. To more conveniently and precisely perform microgenomics, we revealed by systematic analysis the following three details regarding FFPE DNA compared with paired frozen tissue DNA. 1) The best quality of FFPE DNA is obtained by tissue fixation with 10% neutral buffered formalin for 1 day and heat treatment of tissue lysates at 95°C for 30 minutes. 2) IHC staining of FFPE tissues decreases the quantity and quality of FFPE DNA to one-fourth, and antigen retrieval (at 120°C for 15 minutes, pH 6.0) is the major reason for this decrease. 3) FFPE DNA prepared as described herein is sufficient for NGS. For non-mutated tissue specimens, no artifactual mutation occurs during FFPE preparation, as shown by precise comparison of NGS of FFPE DNA and paired frozen tissue DNA followed by validation. These results demonstrate that even FFPE tissues used for routine clinical diagnosis can be utilized to obtain reliable NGS data if appropriate conditions of fixation and validation are applied."

Methods This retrospective cohort study, based on electronic medical record data, included 105 patients from two outpatient clinics in Western Norway with a new diabetic foot ulcer during 2009–2011. The associations of duration of ulcer and ulcer severity with healing time were assessed using cumulative incidence curves and subdistribution hazard ratio estimated using competing risk regression with adjustment for potential confounders. Results Of the 105 participants, 45.7% achieved ulcer healing, 36.2% underwent amputations, 9.5% died before ulcer healing and 8.5% were lost to follow-up. Patients who were referred to specialist health care by a general practitioner ≥ 52 days after ulcer onset had a 58% (SHR 0.42, CI 0.18–0.98) decreased healing rate compared to patients who were referred earlier, in the adjusted model. High severity (grade 2/3, stage C/D) according to the UT classification system was associated with a decreased healing rate compared to low severity (grade1, stage A/B or grade 2, stage A) with SHR (95% CI) equal to 0.14 (0.05–0.43) after adjustment for referral time and other potential confounders. Conclusion Early detection and referral by both the patient and general practitioner are crucial for optimal foot ulcer healing. Ulcer grade and severity are also important predictors for healing time, and early screening to assess the severity and initiation of prompt treatment is important."
https://openalex.org/W2614102372,"The dopamine transporter (DAT) regulates dopamine (DA) neurotransmission by recapturing DA into the presynaptic terminals and is a principal target of the psychostimulant cocaine. The sigma-1 receptor (σ1R) is a molecular chaperone, and its ligands have been shown to modulate DA neuronal signaling, although their effects on DAT activity are unclear. Here, we report that the prototypical σ1R agonist (+)-pentazocine potentiated the dose response of cocaine self-administration in rats, consistent with the effects of the σR agonists PRE-084 and DTG (1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine) reported previously. These behavioral effects appeared to be correlated with functional changes of DAT. Preincubation with (+)-pentazocine or PRE-084 increased the Bmax values of [3H]WIN35428 binding to DAT in rat striatal synaptosomes and transfected cells. A specific interaction between σ1R and DAT was detected by co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays. Mutational analyses indicated that the transmembrane domain of σ1R likely mediated this interaction. Furthermore, cysteine accessibility assays showed that σ1R agonist preincubation potentiated cocaine-induced changes in DAT conformation, which were blocked by the specific σ1R antagonist CM304. Moreover, σ1R ligands had distinct effects on σ1R multimerization. CM304 increased the proportion of multimeric σ1Rs, whereas (+)-pentazocine increased monomeric σ1Rs. Together these results support the hypothesis that σ1R agonists promote dissociation of σ1R multimers into monomers, which then interact with DAT to stabilize an outward-facing DAT conformation and enhance cocaine binding. We propose that this novel molecular mechanism underlies the behavioral potentiation of cocaine self-administration by σ1R agonists in animal models.

A recent behavioral study showed that σ1R agonists such as PRE-084 and 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG), but not σ1R antagonists, increased the potency of cocaine in a self-administration procedure (22Hiranita T.

Ther. 2010; 332: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cocaine self-administration experience induced self-administration of σ1R agonists, an effect not likely mediated by changes of DA receptors (23Hiranita T. Mereu M. Soto P.L. Tanda G.

In the present study we investigated the effects of σ1R ligands on DAT function using behavioral, pharmacological, and biochemical methods. We present several lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that interaction of σ1R with DAT modulates the outward-facing conformation of DAT and facilitates cocaine binding to DAT. This molecular mechanism underscores a novel modulatory role of σ1R on DA neurotransmission and suggests therapeutic potentials of σ1R ligands in treating cocaine addiction. Rats with indwelling venous catheters were trained to self-administer cocaine using an established procedure in which each fifth press on a lever produced an injection. Lever-press responding maintained by cocaine injections was similar to that reported previously with cocaine or other more conventional reinforcers under similar schedules. A brief pause was followed by a sequence of five responses made in rapid succession producing the injection (Fig. 1A; top panel, see the inset for a magnified display of the micro-temporal pattern). Few if any responses were emitted on the inactive lever (vertical marks on the line below cumulative curve) or during the 2-min timeout periods (lower event line displaced upward) between successive components. In the extinction (EXT) component no injections were delivered, and response rates were low. As the dose of cocaine increased in successive components, response rates also increased. The highest rate of responding was obtained in the fourth component in which injections of 0.32 mg/kg were available (Fig. 1A, top record). When saline injections were available in the second through fifth components (data not shown), responses were never emitted at rates greater than those maintained in EXT. The average response rates were a bell-shaped function of cocaine dose (Fig. 1B, filled symbols). The maximum response rate averaging 0.339 (± S. E. 0.073) responses/s was obtained with a dose of 0.32 mg/kg/injection and was significantly greater than the rates averaging 0.023 (± S. E. 0.003) responses/s during EXT. Pre-session intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with (+)-pentazocine dose-dependently shifted the cocaine self-administration dose-effect curve leftward, without affecting maximum response rate (Fig. 1B). The lowest dose of (+)-pentazocine (1.0 mg/kg) was inactive, whereas doses of 3.2 and 10 mg/kg produced leftward shifts that approximated 3- and 10-fold, respectively. These changes were obtained without appreciable effects on the temporal patterns of responding (Fig. 1A, bottom record). The major difference in the performances after (+)-pentazocine or vehicle pretreatment were that the highest response rates were obtained at lower doses of cocaine after (+)-pentazocine. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated a significant effect on response rate (F4,60 = 5.60; p = 0.003), with drug pretreatment dose and component (EXT and cocaine dose) as factors. Post-hoc Tukey comparisons indicated that response rates maintained at 0.32 mg/kg/injection of cocaine were significantly decreased by 3.2 and 10 mg/kg of (+)-pentazocine (q = 5.78, 6.25, respectively; p values <0.001). However, the low response rates at 0.032 mg/kg/injection of cocaine were increased by 10.0 mg/kg of (+)-pentazocine (q = 4.66; p = 0.009). Overall, after (+)-pentazocine pretreatment lower doses of cocaine maintained the highest responses rates compared with vehicle pretreatment. Such potentiating effects on cocaine self-administration by (+)-pentazocine were consistent with those produced by other σ1R agonists (PRE-084 and DTG) in a previous report (22Hiranita T. Soto P.L. Tanda G. Katz J.L. Reinforcing effects of sigma-receptor agonists in rats trained to self-administer cocaine.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 332: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The relation between cocaine self-administration and DAT function suggests that potentiation of cocaine self-administration by σ1R agonists may involve modulation of DAT by these drugs. Because cocaine inhibits the DAT by direct binding, we tested the effects of σ1R ligands on the binding of [3H]WIN35428, a radiolabeled cocaine analog, in rat brain tissues with a high density of DAT. Freshly harvested rat striatal slices were incubated with σ1R agonists, washed multiple times to remove residual drugs, then homogenized to measure binding the of [3H]WIN35428. Specific binding was adjusted for variations of protein concentrations among treatment groups. After preincubation with 10 μm (+)-pentazocine or PRE-084, Bmax values of [3H]WIN35428 binding in striatal homogenates were significantly increased (mean ± S.E.: 187 ± 30% and 166 ± 15% of vehicle, respectively; Fig. 2, A and B), whereas Ki values were not substantially changed. We further examined the effects of σ1R agonists on DAT function in HEK293 cells co-transfected with DAT and σ1R. Because cocaine preferentially binds to DAT in the outward-facing conformation (7Wang K.H. Penmatsa A. Gouaux E. Neurotransmitter and psychostimulant recognition by the dopamine transporter.Nature. 2015; 521: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we reasoned that potential changes of DAT conformation and cocaine binding might be more easily unmasked under conditions of low extracellular Na+, in which the conformational equilibrium of DAT is shifted toward the inward-facing state. We found that [3H]WIN35428 binding was correlated with increasing extracellular Na+ in a dose-dependent manner in these cells, and that although binding at 50 mm Na+ was reduced to half that in normal Na+ (150 mm), it still could be measured reliably (data not shown). Thus, cells were incubated with σ1R ligands and subsequently assayed for DAT binding or substrate uptake in a buffer with 50 mm NaCl and 100 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine. Similar to results obtained using striatal tissues, there was a significant increase of [3H]WIN35428 binding Bmax in these cells pretreated with (+)-pentazocine or PRE-084 (130 ± 7% or 125 ± 6% of vehicle, respectively; Fig. 2, C and D) without substantial changes in Ki values. Similar effects of σ1R agonists on DAT binding were observed in another cell line expressing HA-tagged DAT and Myc-tagged σ1R (data not shown). Additionally, there was a significant increase of [3H]DA uptake Vmax values in cells preincubated with (+)-pentazocine or PRE-084 (133 ± 8% or 145 ± 12% of vehicle, respectively; Fig. 2, E and F) without substantial changes of Km values. As σ1R has been shown to be a versatile molecular chaperone that can interact with multiple membrane proteins (25Kourrich S. Su T.P. Fujimoto M. Bonci A. The sigma-1 receptor: roles in neuronal plasticity and disease.Trends Neurosci. 2012; 35: 762-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we examined whether σ1R could interact with neurotransmitter transporters. In HEK293 cells GST-tagged-σ1R was co-expressed together with Myc-tagged-σ1R, DAT, or the excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2). When GST-σ1R was affinity-purified from cell lysates by glutathione beads, a strong signal of Myc-σ1R was observed, suggesting the existence of a robust constitutive interaction that facilitated the formation of multimers. Substantial signals from the DAT were also detected, whereas no signal of EAAT2 was detected despite its higher expression level (Fig. 3A). The bands detected for DAT corresponded to unglycosylated (∼55 kDa), glycosylated (∼80–90 kDa), and high molecular weight (Mr) oligomeric forms, suggesting that σ1R likely interacts with DAT directly or indirectly in various cellular compartments, including those mature, glycosylated DAT on the cell surface. Furthermore, in cells co-transfected with σ1R and DAT, σ1R could be co-immunoprecipitated with DAT using DAT-specific antibody MAB369 but not with control IgG (Fig. 3B). The interaction between σ1R and DAT was further verified in live cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) method. Consistent with the results using GST pulldown assays, co-expression of σ1R and DAT resulted in substantially higher BRETmax signals than co-expression of σ1R and EAAT2 (Fig. 3C, ▴ and ●, respectively), whereas DAT-DAT and EAAT2-EAAT2 interactions (Fig. 3C, inset, ▵ and ○, respectively) showed similar BRETmax values, indicating that the difference between the BRETmax between σ1R-DAT and σ1R-EAAT2 was significant. The σ1R-σ1R BRET pair exhibited the most robust signals (Fig. 3C, inset, □), confirming the multimerization of σ1R, as shown in Fig. 3A. Several splice variants of σ1R display different lengths in their cytoplasmic domains, including one variant (GenBankTM NM_147157.2) lacking exon 3 (σ1-Δ3) that encodes amino acids 119–149 and another (GenBankTM BC007839.2) that has a frameshift-induced early termination and deletion of amino acids 103–223 (σ1R-xs). When GST-tagged σ1R-Δ3 and σ1R-xs were examined for interaction with DAT in transfected cells, both exhibited stronger association than the full-length (FL) σ1R, whereas σ1R-xs showed the strongest interaction with DAT (Fig. 3D). These surprising results suggested that the interaction between DAT and σ1R was likely mediated by the TM of σ1R, as deletion of its cytoplasmic domain did not impair but, instead, enhanced DAT-σ1R association. We previously studied conformational changes of DAT using cysteine accessibility assays. Upon cocaine binding, the conformation of DAT was changed so that several residues exhibited altered accessibility, including cysteine 306 (Cys-306) and threonine 316 (Thr-316) on TM6a (Fig. 4A), a key domain forming a part of the extracellular vestibule in the outward-facing conformation of DAT (26Hong W.C. Amara S.G. Membrane cholesterol modulates the outward facing conformation of the dopamine transporter and alters cocaine binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To understand why preincubation with σ1R agonists increased cocaine binding (Fig. 2), we examined whether σ1R drugs could modulate the DAT conformation. In HEK293 cells co-transfected with wild-type DAT and Myc-tagged σ1R, exposure of 1 μm cocaine substantially increased the accessibility of Cys-306 (253 ± 29%, mean ± S.E., compared with vehicle), as probed by maleimide-PEG2-biotin, a sulfhydryl-specific, membrane-impermeant reagent. Preincubation with PRE-084 increased the cocaine-induced effects in a dose-dependent manner, with 10 μm PRE-084 producing a significant enhancement to 364 ± 36% of vehicle (Fig. 4B). Similarly, 10 μm (+)-pentazocine enhanced cocaine-induced changes in Cys-306 accessibility from 273 ± 20% to 349 ± 29% of vehicle treatment (Fig. 4C). However, neither PRE-084 nor (+)-pentazocine pretreatment significantly altered Cys-306 accessibility in the absence of cocaine (Fig. 4, B and C). Moreover, neither σ1R agonists changed the cell-surface expression levels of DAT, as measured by cell-surface biotinylation using sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, a membrane-impermeant probe that selectively reacts with primary amine moieties in proteins (Fig. 4D). Pretreatment with 2 μm CM304, a novel antagonist with subnanomolar affinity and a high selectivity for σ1R (27James M.L. Shen B. Zavaleta C.L. Nielsen C.H. Mesangeau C. Vuppala P.K. Chan C. Avery B.A. Fishback J.A. Matsumoto R.R. Gambhir S.S. McCurdy C.R. Chin F.T. New positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging sigma-1 receptors in living subjects.J. Med.

Blockade of cocaine or sigma receptor agonist self-administration by subtype-selective sigma receptor antagonists.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2016; 358: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), effectively blocked the potentiating effects of 10 μm PRE-084 (Fig. 4E), verifying that these effects were mediated specifically through σ1R. CM304 alone did not alter cocaine-induced changes in Cys-306 accessibility on DAT. We then probed the cysteine accessibility at a position in closer proximity to the inhibitor-binding pocket of DAT, using a substituted cysteine construct T316C/C306A in which Thr-316 and Cys-306 were mutated to cysteine and alanine, respectively. In cells co-transfected with T316C/C306A DAT and Myc-tagged σ1R, cocaine binding significantly increased T316C thiol side-chain reactivity toward maleimide-PEG2-biotin to 387 ± 22% of vehicle (Fig. 4F). The effect of cocaine was significantly enhanced after preincubation with 20 μm (+)-pentazocine or PRE-084 to 487 ± 26% or 548 ± 49%, respectively (Fig. 4F). As in Fig. 4, B and C, neither PRE-084 nor (+)-pentazocine altered T316C accessibility in the absence of cocaine (Fig. 4F). Together, these biochemical data indicated that pre-exposure to σ1R agonists enhanced cocaine-induced conformational changes of DAT, suggesting that the interaction with σ1R likely shifted the conformational equilibrium of DAT toward the outward-facing state which preferentially binds cocaine. Because σ1R agonists did not directly alter DAT conformation or its cell-surface expression levels, their modulatory effects on DAT conformation are most likely mediated by σ1R-DAT interactions. The crystal structure of σ1R showed a homotrimeric assembly (17Schmidt H.R. Zheng S. Gurpinar E. Koehl A. Manglik A. Kruse A.C. Crystal structure of the human sigma1 receptor.Nature. 2016; 532: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Each monomer has a single TM and a cytoplasmic portion comprising a ligand-binding pocket and trimerization interface. Because oligomerization of membrane proteins may regulate their function, we devised a novel biochemical method to detect σ1R multimerization. HEK293 cells were transfected with σ1R containing N-terminal FLAG-2 × His8 tag (FH-σ1R), which has a predicted Mr of 32 kDa (25 kDa σ1R + 7 kDa tags with linker). After incubation with σ1R ligands, cells were solubilized using a mild detergent, glyco-diosgenin (GDN), and electrophoretically separated under non-denaturing conditions using another mild detergent, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFO). FLAG antibodies detected immunoreactive signals of two lower Mr bands (∼40 and 70 kDa) and high-Mr diffused bands (>150 kDa), likely corresponding in apparent Mr to the σ1R monomer, dimer, and oligomer (possibly larger than trimer). Compared with vehicle, the agonist (+)-pentazocine significantly decreased, whereas the antagonist CM304 significantly increased signals of σ1R oligomers (Fig. 5A), suggesting that ligand binding to σ1R has distinct effects on the multimeric states of σ1R. When GDN lysates of FH-σ1R were run under denaturing conditions in SDS-PAGE, only one band (∼30 kDa) was seen, similar to σ1R signals in Fig. 3, A and B. Because cell surface DAT is vital in its function, and σ1R can interact with glycosylated DAT, which is likely in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, A and D), we further examined the multimeric status of σ1R on the cell surface. The FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) and enterokinase cleavage sequence (DDDDK) in FH-σ1R has three lysine residues whose primary amine side chain can react with sulfo-NHS-biotin, a membrane-impermeant cell-surface biotinylation reagent. FH-σ1R-expressing cells were treated with σ1R ligands at 37 °C for 1 h in culture medium, washed with cold PBSCM (PBS containing 0.10 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, pH 7.1), and biotinylated at 4 °C. After cell lysis with GDN, biotinylated proteins were enriched with NeutrAvidin beads, then eluted with sample buffer containing 4% PFO to preserve the multimeric states of σ1R. Although the majority of σ1R was intracellular, a portion of σ1R was present on the cell surface and labeled by sulfo-NHS-biotin. In PFO-PAGE three different bands (∼40, ∼70, and >150 kDa) of FH-σ1R were observed, likely corresponding to the monomer, dimer, and multimer (Fig. 5B). With (+)-pentazocine pretreatment, the fraction of σ1R monomers on the cell surface was significantly increased compared with vehicle (Fig. 5C). However, if the NeutrAvidin beads PFO eluates were then incubated with SDS sample buffer and run in SDS-PAGE, only one band of ∼30 kDa was seen, which represented the denatured σ1R monomer derived from monomer, dimer, and multimer under native conditions. No statistical difference in σ1R band densities in SDS-PAGE was seen with σ1R drug treatment (Fig. 5D). These results demonstrate that (+)-pentazocine does not change the overall amount of FH-σ1R on the cell surface but specifically alters its quaternary organization to induce more monomer formation. In the present study we explored molecular mechanisms underlying behavioral potentiation of cocaine self-administration by σ1R agonists. Our data in native tissues and transfected cells show that pretreatment of σ1R agonists shifts DAT conformation toward an outward-facing conformation (Fig. 4), which facilitates cocaine binding (Fig. 2) and enhances cocaine self-administration potency (Fig. 1). Furthermore, σ1R agonists did not directly affect DAT conformation or cell-surface expression levels but likely exert their effects by altering multimeric states of σ1R, thus modulating its dynamic interaction with DAT. The agonist (+)-pentazocine dissociated σ1R multimers to monomers and dimers (Fig. 5) and potentiated cocaine-induced changes in DAT conformation (Fig. 4), whereas the antagonist CM304 had the opposite effects on σ1R oligomerization and no effects on DAT conformation. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that the dissociation of σ1R multimers to monomers by σ1R agonists facilitates the interaction of σ1R with DAT and promotes an outward-facing conformation of DAT, thus enhancing cocaine binding and potentiating the response to cocaine (Fig. 6). The transport cycle of DAT involves coordinated movement of key domains that enables DAT to switch between the outward-facing and inward-facing conformations. Pharmacological studies (26Hong W.C.

https://openalex.org/W2612530212,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of disorders of connective tissue, caused mainly by mutations in the collagen I genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2). Dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI) and other dental aberrations are common features of OI. We investigated the association between collagen I mutations and DGI, taurodontism, and retention of permanent second molars in a retrospective cohort of 152 unrelated children and adolescents with OI. The clinical examination included radiographic evaluations. Teeth from 81 individuals were available for histopathological evaluation. COL1A1/2 mutations were found in 104 individuals by nucleotide sequencing. DGI was diagnosed clinically and radiographically in 29% of the individuals (44/152) and through isolated histological findings in another 19% (29/152). In the individuals with a COL1A1 mutation, 70% (7/10) of those with a glycine substitution located C-terminal of p.Gly305 exhibited DGI in both dentitions while no individual (0/7) with a mutation N-terminal of this point exhibited DGI in either dentition (p = 0.01). In the individuals with a COL1A2 mutation, 80% (8/10) of those with a glycine substitution located C terminal of p.Gly211 exhibited DGI in both dentitions while no individual (0/5) with a mutation N-terminal of this point (p = 0.007) exhibited DGI in either dentition. DGI was restricted to the deciduous dentition in 20 individuals. Seventeen had missense mutations where glycine to serine was the most prevalent substitution (53%). Taurodontism occurred in 18% and retention of permanent second molars in 31% of the adolescents. Dental aberrations are strongly associated with qualitatively changed collagen I. The varying expressivity of DGI is related to the location of the collagen I mutation. Genotype information may be helpful in identifying individuals with OI who have an increased risk of dental aberrations."

However, because of the subjectivity and conflicting evaluation criteria in its process, green material selection, as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, has been a widespread concern to the relevant experts. Thus, this study proposes a hybrid MCDM approach that combines decision making and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), analytical network process (ANP), grey relational analysis (GRA) and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to select the optimal green material for sustainability based on the product's needs. A nonlinear programming model with constraints was proposed to obtain the integrated closeness index. Subsequently, an empirical application of rubbish bins was used to illustrate the proposed method. In addition, a sensitivity analysis and a comparison with existing methods were employed to validate the accuracy and stability of the obtained final results. We found that this method provides a more accurate and effective decision support tool for alternative evaluation or strategy selection."

SRL172, an inactivated whole cell booster derived from a non-tuberculous mycobacterium, is the only new vaccine against tuberculosis to have demonstrated efficacy in a Phase 3 trial. In the present study we sought to determine if a three-dose series of DAR-901 manufactured from the SRL172 master cell bank by a new, scalable method was safe and immunogenic. Methods We performed a single site, randomized, double-blind, controlled, Phase 1 dose escalation trial of DAR-901 at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in the United States. Healthy adult subjects age 18–65 with prior BCG immunization and a negative interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) were enrolled in cohorts of 16 subjects and randomized to three injections of DAR-901 (n = 10 per cohort), or saline placebo (n = 3 per cohort), or two injections of saline followed by an injection of BCG (n = 3 per cohort; 1–8 x 106 CFU). Three successive cohorts were enrolled representing DAR-901 at 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg per dose. Randomization was performed centrally and treatments were masked from staff and volunteers. Subsequent open label cohorts of HIV-negative/IGRA-positive subjects (n = 5) and HIV-positive subjects (n = 6) received three doses of 1 mg DAR-901. All subjects received three immunizations at 0, 2 and 4 months administered as 0.1 mL injections over the deltoid muscle alternating between right and left arms. The primary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity. Subjects were followed for 6 months after dose 3 for safety and had phlebotomy performed for safety studies and immune assays before and after each injection. Immune assays using peripheral blood mononuclear cells included cell-mediated IFN-γ responses to DAR-901 lysate and to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) lysate; serum antibody to M. tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan was assayed by ELISA. Results DAR-901 had an acceptable safety profile and was well-tolerated at all dose levels in all treated subjects. No serious adverse events were reported. Median (range) 7-day erythema and induration at the injection site for 1 mg DAR-901 were 10 (4–20) mm and 10 (4–16) mm, respectively, and for BCG, 30 (10–107) mm and 38 (15–55) mm, respectively. Three mild AEs, all headaches, were considered possibly related to DAR-901. No laboratory or vital signs abnormalities were related to immunization. Compared to pre-vaccination responses, three 1 mg doses of DAR-901 induced statistically significant increases in IFN-γ response to DAR-901 lysate and MTB lysate, and in antibody responses to M. tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan. Ten subjects who received 1 mg DAR-901 remained IFN-γ release assay (IGRA) negative after three doses of vaccine. Conclusions A three-injection series of DAR-901 was well-tolerated, had an acceptable safety profile, and induced cellular and humoral immune responses to mycobacterial antigens.

https://openalex.org/W2613485280,"The main objective of this study was to utilize high field (7T) in vivo proton magnetic resonance imaging to increase the ability to detect metabolite changes in people with ALS, specifically, to quantify levels of glutamine and glutamine separately. The second objective of this study was to correlate metabolic markers with clinical outcomes of disease progression. 13 ALS participants and 12 age-matched healthy controls (HC) underwent 7 Tesla MRI and MRS. Single voxel MR spectra were acquired from the left precentral gyrus using a very short echo time (TE = 5 ms) STEAM sequence. MRS data was quantified using LCModel and correlated to clinical outcome markers. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and total NAA (tNA, NAA + NAAG) were decreased by 17% in people with ALS compared to HC (P = 0.004 and P = 0.005, respectively) indicating neuronal injury and/or loss in the precentral gyrus. tNA correlated with disease progression as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC) (P = 0.014; Rρ = 0.66) and tNA/tCr correlated with overall functional decline as measured by worsening of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) (P = 0.004; Rρ = -0.74). These findings underscore the importance of NAA as a reliable biomarker for neuronal injury and disease progression in ALS. Glutamate (Glu) was 15% decreased in people with ALS compared to HC (P = 0.02) while glutamine (Gln) concentrations were similar between the two groups. Furthermore, the decrease in Glu correlated with the decrease in FVC (P = 0.013; Rρ = 0.66), a clinical marker of disease progression. The decrease in Glu is most likely driven by intracellular Glu loss due to neuronal loss and degeneration. Neither choline containing components (Cho), a marker for cell membrane turnover, nor myo-Inositol (mI), a suspected marker for neuroinflammation, showed significant differences between the two groups. However, mI/tNA was correlated with upper motor neuron burden (P = 0.004, Rρ = 0.74), which may reflect a relative increase of activated microglia around motor neurons. In summary, 7T 1H MRS is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique to study molecular changes related to neuronal injury and/or loss in people with ALS."

The key advantage of this research work is to resolve the privacy and secrecy issues raised during the data transmission over the internet. Firstly, data is decomposed into sub-bands using the integer wavelets. For decomposition, the Fresnelet transform is utilized which encrypts the secret data by choosing a unique key parameter to construct a dummy pattern. The dummy pattern is then embedded into an approximated sub-band of the cover image. Our proposed method reveals high-capacity and great imperceptibility of the secret embedded data.

We used the hindlimb unloading (HU) mouse model to simulate a microgravity condition and investigated the changes in intestinal microbiota and colonic epithelial cells. Compared with ground-based controls (Ctrls), HU affected fecal microbiota composition with a profile that was characterized by the expansion of Firmicutes and decrease of Bacteroidetes. The colon epithelium of HU mice showed decreased goblet cell numbers, reduced epithelial cell turnover, and decreased expression of genes that are involved in defense and inflammatory responses. As a result, increased susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium-induced epithelial injury was observed in HU mice. Cohousing of Ctrl mice with HU mice resulted in HU-like epithelial changes in Ctrl mice. Transplantation of feces from Ctrl to HU mice alleviated these epithelial changes in HU mice. Results indicate that HU changes intestinal microbiota, which leads to altered colonic epithelial cell homeostasis, impaired barrier function, and increased susceptibility to colitis. We further demonstrate that alteration in gastrointestinal motility may contribute to HU-associated dysbiosis.

This is different in other prokaryotes, where the enzyme is dispensable for growth on fermentable carbon sources and where increased glycolytic flux can compensate for the loss of oxidative phosphorylation (4Santana M.

Cook G.M. Growth regulation in the mycobacterial cell.Curr. Mol. Med. 2007; 7: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A special feature of the mycobacterial F-ATP synthase is its inability to establish a significant proton gradient during ATP hydrolysis, and its low or latent ATPase activity in the fast- or slow-growing form (6Haagsma A.C.

The mycobacterial F1F0-ATP synthase is composed of nine subunits with a stoichiometry of α3:β3:γ:δ:ϵ:a:b:b′:c9, and organized as a membrane-embedded F0 complex (abb′c9), and a water-soluble F1 complex (α3β3γδϵ). The F1 part contains three catalytic αβ-pairs that form an α3β3-hexamer, in which ATP synthesis or -hydrolysis takes place. This catalytic α3β3-headpiece is linked with the ion-pumping F0 part via the two rotating central stalk subunits γ and ϵ, as well as the peripheral stalk subunits b, b′, and δ (3Lu P. Lill H. Bald D. ATP synthase in mycobacteria: special features and implications for a function as drug target.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1837: 1208-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The F0 domain contains subunit a, and a ring structure consisting of 9 c subunits (15Preiss L. Langer J.D. Yildiz Ö. Eckhardt-Strelau L. Guillemont J.E. Koul A. Meier T. Structure of the mycobacterial ATP synthase Fo rotor ring in complex with the anti-TB drug bedaquiline.Sci. Adv. 2015; 1: e1500106Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The latter are proposed to form a helix-loop-helix structure, where the loops dock to the membrane facing, globular domain of the rotary γ subunit and enable the coupling to the F1 portion to transfer torque, derived by ion transport, to the catalytic α3β3-headpiece (16Okuno D. Iino R. Noji H. Rotation and structure of FoF1-ATP synthase.J. Biochem. 2011; 149: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, the rotational movement of the c-ring forces the central subunits γ and ϵ to rotate (17Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S.

In the case of ATP hydrolysis, the cleavage of ATP to ADP + Pi in the interfaces of three αβ-pairs leads to conformational changes in their C-terminal domains and subsequently to the stepwise counterclockwise 120° rotation of the central γ subunit (when viewed from the membrane side) (19Adachi K.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), each 120° rotation is divided into 40° and 80° substeps, where ATP binding to an empty αβ-pair (αβ)E induces the 80° substep, followed by ATP hydrolysis and ADP release in (αβ)TP, and inorganic phosphate (Pi) release from (αβ)DP that induces the 40° substep. Amino acid sequence alignments of subunit α (Fig. 1) reveal that the mycobacterial F-ATP synthase subunit α has a unique extension of 36 amino acid residues at the very C terminus of subunit α, Mtα(514–549) (according to M. tuberculosis numbering), which is not present in any other known prokaryotic or eukaryotic α subunit. Questions arise whether this extension contributes to important enzymatic differences of mycobacterial F-ATP synthases such as: (i) the latency of ATP hydrolysis activity and suppression of proton pumping. Thus, activation of the latent ATP hydrolysis driven H+-pumping could reduce ATP reserves to alter the proton motive force (PMF) and to decrease the viability of the bacteria. (ii) Whether the C-terminal extension is related to possible mechanistic processes of the rotary F-ATP synthase motor, and (iii) whether this 36-amino acid extension can be employed as a potential drug target. Using a combination of recombineering, ensemble, and single molecule assays, solution X-ray scattering (SAXS), and NMR spectroscopy we demonstrated for the first time that this unique subunit α C-terminal stretch is at least one of the regulatory elements inside mycobacterial F-ATP synthases that affects ATP hydrolysis and synthesis. Removal of this C-terminal extension was found to increase the rate of ATP cleavage and therefore provides energy to enable ATP-driven H+-translocation. The ATP hydrolysis suppressing function of the mycobacterial C-terminal extension was confirmed by replacing the mycobacterial subunit α with the subunit α (502 residues) of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus PS3 or TF1), which does not contain a C-terminal extension. Furthermore, by generating an α3chiβ3γ complex, containing the chimeric α consisting of subunit α of the G. stearothermophilus F-ATP synthase (Gsα(1–502)) and Mtα(514–549), we demonstrated, that the extension alters ATPase activity also in the chimeric complex. Single molecule rotation experiments revealed that the C-terminal stretch affects ATPase activity by reducing the angular velocity of the rotating α3chiβ3γ complex after binding of ATP. In addition, solution structural and cross-linking studies lead to a model, in which the C-terminal extension of Mtα comes in close proximity with subunit γ, whose interaction may influence its rotation. To gain insight into the enzymatic effect of the specific C-terminal domain of the mycobacterial F-ATP synthase subunit α as well as the C-terminal helix (residues 521–540) inside this extension, the M. smegmatis F-ATP synthase mutants Δα514–548 and Δα521–540 with deletion of amino acids 514–548 or 521–540 of the respective C terminus of subunit α were engineered. The effect of the C-terminal deletions of the Δα514–548 mutant on ATP hydrolysis was investigated using inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs). As demonstrated in Fig. 2, A and B, IMVs of wild type (wt) M. smegmatis revealed an ATPase activity of about 37.5 ± 1.3 nmol min−1 (mg of total protein)−1, confirming recent results that demonstrated that M. smegmatis, although at a relatively low level, hydrolyzes ATP (6Haagsma A.C. Driessen N.N. Hahn M.M. Lill H. Bald D. ATP synthase in slow- and fast-growing mycobacteria is active in ATP synthesis and blocked in ATP hydrolysis direction.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2010; 313: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Hotra A. Suter M. Biuković G. Ragunathan P. Kundu S. Dick T. Grüber G. Deletion of a unique loop in the mycobacterial F-ATP synthase γ subunit sheds light on its inhibitory role in ATP hydrolysis-driven H+ pumping.FEBS J. 2016; 283: 1947-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, when IMVs containing the F-ATP synthase mutant Δα514–548 were used, an ATPase activity of 61.4 ± 0.4 nmol min−1 (mg of total protein)−1 was observed. Thus, deletion of the C-terminal domain caused a 64% increase in ATPase activity, which suggests that the C-terminal domain in the wt enzyme suppresses ATPase activity. To confirm that the additional C terminus causes suppression of ATPase hydrolysis, subunit α of the G. stearothermophilus F-ATP synthase, which does not include the C-terminal extension, was engineered into M. smegmatis F-ATP synthase. IMVs of the Gsα replacement mutant showed also an increase in ATP hydrolysis (80.6 ± 0.2 nmol min−1 (mg of total protein)−1) (data not shown) in comparison to the wt, supporting that the unique C-terminal extension of mycobacterial subunit α suppresses ATPase activity. To determine whether the predicted helix inside the C-terminal extension of α (Fig. 2, A and B) may be critical for this suppression, the ATPase activity of IMVs of the Δα521–540 mutant was measured and found to be 56.0 ± 0.3 nmol min−1 (mg of total protein)−1 (49% increase compared with wt activity), suggesting that the C-terminal helix contributes to this suppression. To determine whether ATP hydrolysis is coupled with proton-pumping, IMVs containing M. smegmatis wt F-ATP synthase were tested for proton pumping activity in the presence of the fluorescent dye 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA). As shown in Fig. 2C, adding the substrate ATP to the assay containing IMVs resulted in no further drop of fluorescence other than the typical slight ATP-induced signal quenching. This lack of ATP-dependent fluorescence quenching was not the result of leaky IMVs, because (i) addition of NADH caused a significant and fast quenching of ACMA due to the proton-pumping of the respiratory chain complexes (Fig. 2C), and (ii) upon addition of the uncoupler SF6847 the observed fluorescence was increased. These data correlate with recent results (23Hotra A. Suter M. Biuković G. Ragunathan P. Kundu S. Dick T. Grüber G.

Jarlier V. A diarylquinoline drug active on the ATP synthase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Science. 2005; 307: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) that showed that ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the M. smegmatis F-ATP synthase is not coupled to proton-pumping. Addition of ATP to IMVs containing either the M. smegmatis Δα(514–548) or Δα(521–540) mutant protein quenched ACMA fluorescence by about 10% (Fig. 2D) in a manner that was sensitive to the uncoupler SF6847. These data reveal that the increases in ATPase activity that resulted from the Δα(514–548) and Δα(521–540) deletions were sufficient to create a small proton gradient across the membrane. Because the rate of H+-conduction of both mutant proteins is similar, one can conclude that deletion of the C-terminal helix mainly causes the observed effect. In parallel, ATP synthesis activities of the wt, the Δα(514–548) and Δα(521–540) mutants in IMVs were measured. As shown in Fig. 2E, the IMVs of wt revealed an ATP synthesis activity of 2.27 ± 0.05 nmol min−1 (mg of total protein)−1, which is similar to the value (0.96 ± 0.15 nmol min−1 (mg of total protein)−1) determined recently (6Haagsma A.C. Driessen N.N. Hahn M.M. Lill H. Bald D. ATP synthase in slow- and fast-growing mycobacteria is active in ATP synthesis and blocked in ATP hydrolysis direction.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2010; 313: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In comparison, the Δα(514–548) and Δα(521–540) mutants were active in ATP synthesis with values of 1.55 ± 0.03 nmol min−1 (mg of total protein)−1 and 1.37 ± 0.04 nmol min−1 (mg of total protein)−1, respectively, demonstrating a decrease of about 40% in ATP synthesis activity for both mutant enzymes when compared with the wt. In addition, the inhibitory effect of the TB drug bedaquiline (TMC207) (24Andries K. Verhasselt P. Guillemont J. Göhlmann H.W. Neefs J.M. Winkler H. Van Gestel J. Timmerman P. Zhu M. Lee E.

This is in line with those reported recently for M. smegmatis (2.5–12.9 nm) (25Haagsma A.C. Abdillahi-Ibrahim R. Wagner M.J. Krab K. Vergauwen K. Guillemont J. Andries K. Lill H. Koul A. Bald D. Selectivity of TMC207 towards mycobacterial ATP synthase compared with that towards the eukaryotic homologue.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 1290-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and Mycobacterium phlei (20–25 nm) (15Preiss L. Langer J.D. Yildiz Ö. Eckhardt-Strelau L. Guillemont J.E. Koul A. Meier T. Structure of the mycobacterial ATP synthase Fo rotor ring in complex with the anti-TB drug bedaquiline.Sci. Adv. 2015; 1: e1500106Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) F-ATP synthase. These data as well as Western blot analyses (data not shown) confirm that the amount of F-ATP synthases located in the Δα(514–548) mutant vesicles is comparable with that of the wt vesicles. The data above raise the question, whether the apparent ATPase activity suppressing function of the Mycobacterium-specific α domain can be transplanted in F-ATP synthases of other organisms. We used the ATPase proficient and mechanistically well understood α3β3γ complex of the G. stearothermophilus F-ATP synthase (Gsα3β3γ) as a prototype with an engineered cysteine at position γ109 essential for single molecule rotation experiments (see below). An α3chiβ3γ complex with a chimeric subunit α (Gsα(1–502)), and the very C-terminal α(514–549)-segment of the M. tuberculosis F-ATP synthase (Mtα(514–549)), was compared with the Gsα3β3γ complex. Highly purified complexes were produced (Fig. 3A) to deduce the effect of subunit αchi on the ATP hydrolysis reaction (Fig. 3, B and C). At 37 °C, the Gsα3β3γ complex showed an ATPase activity of 4.9 ± 0.04 μmol min−1 (mg of protein)−1, whereas α3chiβ3γ revealed a 12% decreased ATPase activity (4.3 ± 0.01 μmol min−1 (mg of protein)−1), when the rates of the first 10 s of the reactions were compared, i.e. the time frames that were not affected by ADP inhibition of the enzyme. The effect of ADP inhibition is shown in Fig. 3D. In an additional experiment we removed all nucleotides from the enzymes prior to ATP hydrolysis measurements. A similar reduction of ATP hydrolysis (10%) was observed for the nucleotide-depleted α3chiβ3γ compared with -Gsα3β3γ (Fig. 3E). These results show that the Mycobacterium-specific C-terminal extension is indeed able to suppress ATPase activity when transplanted onto the C terminus of an ATPase proficient prokaryotic enzyme. This concurs with the complementary finding above, showing the increase of ATPase activity of IMVs from the M. smegmatis deletion mutant Δα514–548. To further investigate the enzymatic influence of the C-terminal extension of mycobacterial subunit α, and to gain insight into a possible mechanistic event, we tested the Gsα3β3γ and α3chiβ3γ complexes in a single molecule rotation assay, where the rotation can be visualized directly (26Ho J. Sielaff H. Nadeem A. Svanborg C. Grüber G. The molecular motor F-ATP synthase is targeted by the tumoricidal protein HAMLET.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A fluorescently labeled 300-nm bead was attached to subunit γ of immobilized Gsα3β3γ or α3chiβ3γ complexes (Fig. 4A). Upon addition of saturating MgATP concentrations rotating beads were observed via TIRF microscopy. Fig. 4B shows the trajectory of a rotating Gsα3β3γ-bead complex, derived from a frame-by-frame analysis (Fig. 4C) of the recorded video (26Ho J. Sielaff H. Nadeem A. Svanborg C. Grüber G. The molecular motor F-ATP synthase is targeted by the tumoricidal protein HAMLET.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The average rotational rate of the Gsα3β3γ complex was 4.6 ± 1.0 s−1 (n = 9 particles). When a 600-nm bead duplex was attached to the protein, the average rotational rate under these conditions was 1.9 ± 0.5 s−1 (n = 8 particles) due to the high viscous drag. The rotation rates for this complex were similar to those reported previously (26Ho J. Sielaff H. Nadeem A. Svanborg C. Grüber G.

J. 2005; 88: 2047-2056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The question was addressed, whether the C terminus of αchi in the α3chiβ3γ complex affects the rotation and dwell times of the α3chiβ3γ complex. As demonstrated in a video (supplemental Video S1) and in Fig. 4D, all α3chiβ3γ-bead complexes rotated continuously counterclockwise without backward steps. At saturating ATP concentrations, the rotational rate measured by the bead assay was dominated by the dwell time of the catalytic dwell. A very prolonged catalytic dwell would decrease the overall rotational rate. The ATP-waiting dwell is not rate-limiting here, but again a largely increased dwell time at this position would also affect the overall rate. However, when the α3chiβ3γ complex was used in the rotation assay, we observed the same rotational rates of 4.8 ± 2.0 s−1 (n = 13 particles) and 2.1 ± 0.7 s−1 (n = 6 particles) for complexes with single beads and bead duplexes, respectively. These experiments show that ATP hydrolysis results in the unidirectional counterclockwise rotation of the chimeric complex, and that the chimeric subunit α does not alter the duration of the dwells significantly. Changes in angular velocity as a function of rotational position during the power stroke cannot be investigated in detail with the bead assay because the movement of subunit γ is damped by the viscous drag of the large bead. In addition, the temporal and spatial resolution of the bead assay is too low to resolve the detailed motion during the power stroke. To overcome these limitations, we used a 40 × 76-nm gold nanorod as a probe of rotation. The viscous drag on these nanorods is not rate-limiting to the power stroke of the Escherichia coli α3β3γ (Ecα3β3γ) (28Spetzler D. York J. Daniel D. Fromme R. Lowry D. Frasch W.

The light scattered from the nanorod was detected by an avalanche photo diode (APD) after passing through a polarizing filter using dark-field microscopy (Fig. 5A).

https://openalex.org/W2612350007,"Myogenic stem cells are a promising avenue for the treatment of muscular disorders. Freshly isolated muscle stem cells have a remarkable engraftment ability in vivo, but their cell number is limited. Current conventional culture conditions do not allow muscle stem cells to expand in vitro with their bona fide engraftment efficiency, requiring the improvement of culture procedures for achieving successful cell-therapy for muscle disorders. Here we expanded mouse muscle stem cells and human myoblasts with Notch ligands, DLL1, DLL4, and JAG1 to activate Notch signaling in vitro and to investigate whether these cells could retain their engraftment efficiency. Notch signaling promotes the expansion of Pax7+MyoD- mouse muscle stem-like cells and inhibits differentiation even after passage in vitro. Treatment with Notch ligands induced the Notch target genes and generated PAX7+MYOD- stem-like cells from human myoblasts previously cultured on conventional culture plates. However, cells treated with Notch ligands exhibit a stem cell-like state in culture, yet their regenerative ability was less than that of freshly isolated cells in vivo and was comparable to that of the control. These unexpected findings suggest that artificial maintenance of Notch signaling alone is insufficient for improving regenerative capacity of mouse and human donor-muscle cells and suggest that combinatorial events are critical to achieve muscle stem cell and myoblast engraftment potential."

Patients with tendon injuries, such as tendinopathy or tendon rupture, were often observed with matrix degeneration, and the healing of tendon injuries remains a challenge as a result of the limited understanding of tendon biology. Our study demonstrates that the stretch-mediated activation channel, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), was up-regulated in tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs) during tenogenic differentiation under mechanical stretching. Tendon tissues in CFTR-dysfunctional DF508 mice exhibited irregular cell arrangement, uneven fibril diameter distribution, weak mechanical properties, and less matrix formation in a tendon defect model. Moreover, both tendon tissues and TDSCs isolated from DF508 mice showed significantly decreased levels of tendon markers, such as scleraxis, tenomodulin, Col1A1 (collagen type I α 1 chain), and decorin. Furthermore, by RNA sequencing analysis, we demonstrated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was abnormally activated in TDSCs from DF508 mice, thereby further activating the pERK1/2 signaling pathway. Of most importance, we found that intervention in pERK1/2 signaling could promote tenogenic differentiation and tendon regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our study demonstrates that CFTR plays an important role in tenogenic differentiation and tendon regeneration by inhibiting the β-catinin/pERK1/2 signaling pathway. The therapeutic strategy of intervening in the CFTR/β-catenin/pERK1/2 regulatory axis may be helpful for accelerating tendon injury healing, which has implications for tendon injury management.—Liu, Y., Xu, J., Xu, L., Wu, T., Sun, Y., Lee, Y.-W., Wang, B., Chan, H.-C., Jiang, X., Zhang, J., Li, G.

https://openalex.org/W2613151205,"The proper regulation of spermatogenesis is crucial to ensure the continued production of sperm and fertility. Here, we investigated the function of the H3K4me2 demethylase KDM1A/LSD1 during spermatogenesis in developing and adult mice. Conditional deletion of Kdm1a in the testis just prior to birth leads to fewer spermatogonia and germ cell loss before 3 weeks of age. These results demonstrate that KDM1A is required for spermatogonial differentiation, as well as germ cell survival, in the developing testis. In addition, inducible deletion of Kdm1a in the adult testis results in the abnormal accumulation of meiotic spermatocytes, as well as apoptosis and progressive germ cell loss. These results demonstrate that KDM1A is also required during adult spermatogenesis. Furthermore, without KDM1A, the stem cell factor OCT4 is ectopically maintained in differentiating germ cells. This requirement for KDM1A is similar to what has been observed in other stem cell populations, suggesting a common function. Taken together, we propose that KDM1A is a key regulator of spermatogenesis and germ cell maintenance in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2612926595,"Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) is an important insect pest, causing severe damage to agricultural crops. The pest was recorded in a commercial rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis, Lamiaceae) field, colonizing rosemary variety (var.) '2', but not '11'. A series of field and controlled laboratory choice bioassays confirmed the observed phenomenon. Mature potted plants of the two varieties were randomly organized in a lemon verbena (Lippia citrodora) and lemon grass (Cymbopogon spp.) fields. Seven days later var. '2' was significantly more colonized by whiteflies than var. '11'. Under lab conditions, whiteflies were significantly more attracted to var. '2' plantlets than to var. '11' following choice bioassays. Furthermore, cotton plants dipped in an essential oil emulsion of var. '2' had significantly greater colonization than cotton plants dipped in the essential oil emulsion of var. '11'. Similar results were obtained in 'plant-plant', 'plant-no plant' as well as, 'essential oil-essential oil' choice bioassay designs. Analyses of the essential oils of the two varieties identified a set of common and unique volatiles in each variety. Among these volatiles were β-caryophyllene and limonene, two compounds known to be associated with plant-insect interactions. The attraction of B. tabaci to pure (>95%) β-caryophyllene and limonene using a range of concentrations was examined in vitro by choice bioassays. The compounds were attractive to the insect at moderate concentration, but not at the lowest or highest concentrations used, where the insect was not attracted or repelled, respectively. Limonene attracted the insects at rates that were 10-fold lower than β-caryophyllene. The results emphasized the role of host plant volatiles in shaping the structure of B. tabaci populations in nature and in agricultural systems, and provided insights into the factors that contribute to the development of insect populations with unique characteristics. The results could also serve for future development of bio-pesticides and in breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2612030172,"Background Although the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) showed good efficacy against pneumococcal disease in the the CAPiTA trial, the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination (PPSV23) program has been ongoing for older adults aged ≥ 65 years in Korea since May of 2013. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the current vaccination strategy (a single-dose PPSV23 vaccination) compared to a single-dose PCV13 vaccination and sequential PCV13-PPSV23 vaccinations in the elderly population aged ≥ 65 years. Methods Using a Markov model, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of three vaccination strategies were assessed in a societal context. The transition probabilities, utility weights to estimate quality adjusted life year (QALY), and disease treatment costs were either calculated or cited from published data and the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Simulations were performed in hypothetical cohorts of Korean adults aged ≥ 19 years. The vaccine effectiveness of PPSV23 was cited from a Cochrane Review report, while PCV13 effectiveness data were gathered from the CAPiTA trial. Results Current PPSV23 vaccination strategies were cost-effective (ICER, $25,786 per QALY). However, the administration of PCV13 as a substitute for PPSV23 was shown to be more cost-effective than PPSV23 vaccination (ICER, $797 per QALY). Sequential PCV13-PPSV23 vaccination was also more cost-effective than PPSV23 for elderly people aged ≥ 65 years. In sensitivity analysis assuming significant PPSV23 effectiveness (50%) against non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, the PCV13 vaccination strategy was superior to the PPSV23 vaccination strategy in terms of cost-effectiveness. Conclusion The results suggest that PCV13 vaccination is more cost-effective in elderly subjects aged ≥ 65 years compared to the current PPSV23 vaccination strategy. When complete data is obtained in 2018 on the maximal herd effects of childhood PCV13 immunization, the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia and the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies need to be reassessed."
https://openalex.org/W2612132372,"Estimating balanced nutrient requirements for soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr) in China is essential for identifying optimal fertilizer application regimes to increase soybean yield and nutrient use efficiency. We collected datasets from field experiments in major soybean planting regions of China between 2001 and 2015 to assess the relationship between soybean seed yield and nutrient uptake, and to estimate nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) requirements for a target yield of soybean using the quantitative evaluation of the fertility of tropical soils (QUEFTS) model. The QUEFTS model predicted a linear-parabolic-plateau curve for the balanced nutrient uptake with a target yield increased from 3.0 to 6.0 t ha-1 and the linear part was continuing until the yield reached about 60-70% of the potential yield. To produce 1000 kg seed of soybean in China, 55.4 kg N, 7.9 kg P, and 20.1 kg K (N:P:K = 7:1:2.5) were required in the above-ground parts, and the corresponding internal efficiencies (IE, kg seed yield per kg nutrient uptake) were 18.1, 126.6, and 49.8 kg seed per kg N, P, and K, respectively. The QUEFTS model also simulated that a balanced N, P, and K removal by seed which were 48.3, 5.9, and 12.2 kg per 1000 kg seed, respectively, accounting for 87.1%, 74.1%, and 60.8% of the total above-ground parts, respectively. These results were conducive to make fertilizer recommendations that improve the seed yield of soybean and avoid excessive or deficient nutrient supplies. Field validation indicated that the QUEFTS model could be used to estimate nutrient requirements which help develop fertilizer recommendations for soybean."

We investigated whether PHD3 controls HIF-1 transcriptional activity in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells through the pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM)-2-Jumonji domain--containing protein (JMJD5) axis. PHD3-/- mice (12.5 mo old) showed increased incidence of intervertebral disc degeneration with a concomitant decrease in expression of the HIF-1α targets VEGF-A, glucose transporter-1, and lactate dehydrogenase A. PHD3 silencing decreased hypoxic activation of HIF-1α C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD), but not HIF-1α-N-terminal-(N)-TAD or HIF-2α-TAD. Moreover, PHD3 suppression in NP cells resulted in decreased HIF-1α enrichment on target promoters and lower expression of select HIF-1 targets. Contrary to other cell types, manipulation of PKM2 and JMJD5 levels had no effect on HIF-1 activity in NP cells. Likewise, stabilization of tetrameric PKM2 by a chemical approach had no effect on PHD3-dependent HIF-1 activity. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed lack of association between HIF-1α and PKM2 in NP cells. Results support the role of the PHD3 as a cofactor for HIF-1, independent of PKM2-JMJD5.-Schoepflin, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2613793199,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mislocalization of improperly folded proteins have been shown to contribute to photoreceptor death in models of inherited retinal degenerative diseases. In particular, mice with cone cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel deficiency, a model for achromatopsia, display both early-onset ER stress and opsin mistrafficking. By 2 weeks of age, these mice show elevated signaling from all three arms of the ER-stress pathway, and by 1 month, cone opsin is improperly distributed away from its normal outer segment location to other retinal layers. This work investigated the role of Ca2+-release channels in ER stress, protein mislocalization, and cone death in a mouse model of CNG-channel deficiency. We examined whether preservation of luminal Ca2+ stores through pharmacological and genetic suppression of ER Ca2+ efflux protects cones by attenuating ER stress. We demonstrated that the inhibition of ER Ca2+-efflux channels reduced all three arms of ER-stress signaling while improving opsin trafficking to cone outer segments and decreasing cone death by 20–35%. Cone-specific gene deletion of the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type I (IP3R1) also significantly increased cone density in the CNG-channel-deficient mice, suggesting that IP3R1 signaling contributes to Ca2+ homeostasis and cone survival. Consistent with the important contribution of organellar Ca2+ signaling in this achromatopsia mouse model, significant differences in dynamic intraorganellar Ca2+ levels were detected in CNG-channel-deficient cones. These results thus identify a novel molecular link between Ca2+ homeostasis and cone degeneration, thereby revealing novel therapeutic targets to preserve cones in inherited retinal degenerative diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2612270829,"In many developing countries, male circumcision has been promoted as an effective HIV prevention strategy, and medical randomized controlled trials have indeed shown a causal link. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support this conclusion in countries where individuals can voluntary opt for different types of circumcision. The present study considers male circumcision in Lesotho, where HIV prevalence is among the highest in the world (23%). Here, men can opt for one of two types of circumcision: traditional male circumcision in initiation schools, or the medical option in health clinics. This paper investigates whether the former has medical effects on individual HIV status that are as beneficial as those shown for the latter. Controlling for the potential individual behavioral response after the operation, it was found that circumcision performed in initiation schools wholly offset the medical benefits of the surgical procedure. This supports anecdotal evidence that the operation performed by traditional circumcisers does not have the same protective effect against HIV transmission as the medical operation. No evidence of “disinhibition” behavior among circumcised men was found, nor differential risky sexual behavior among men circumcised, traditionally or medically. Considering that, in Lesotho, traditional male circumcision is undertaken by more than 90% of circumcised men, the findings highlight the need for further research into how the operation in initiation schools is performed and its medical benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2613168165,"One of the most terrible famines last century was Great Chinese Famine (GCF) in 1959~1961 when millions of people died from starving. Under-nutrition during famine between the Western and Eastern (Dutch Hungry vs. GCF) was similar, while cardiovascular consequences might not be the same. Addressing such questions may gain new insight into prevention of cardiovascular diseases.A retrospective cohort of 18,593 participants aged 43-49 years of old, was from Suzhou, China. Logistic regression model was used to calculate the relative risk (RR) of hypertension and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The multivariate RRs were adjusted for age, plasma glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol.The multivariate RRs of systolic and diastolic pressure were not significantly elevated in the rural subgroups, but was higher in the urban population born in the famine (systolic pressure adjust RR 1.382, 95% CI 1.235-1.545, diastolic pressure adjust RR 1.569, 95% CI 1.415-1.740). The risks of hypertension were significantly higher among the urban subjects than that in the rural subgroups (systolic hypertension adjust RR 2.915, 95% CI 2.616-3.249, diastolic hypertension adjust RR 4.568, 95% CI 4.079-5.116). Percentile of optimal diastolic pressure at mid-age was significantly lower in the urban population prenatally exposed to the famine regardless of sexes. However, a similar reduction of percentage of optimal systolic pressure was only seen in the female, not the male population in the urban region.The data suggest Asian genetic basis was not able to block famine-programmed vascular diseases as that happened in Europe, and the programmed problems due to under-nutrition could be reversed after birth. Protective mechanisms may be related to diet habits before age of 30 years old, which is important contribution to early prevention of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2612012716,"The interactions between the plant-derived bioflavonoid, naringenin, and prokaryotic microalgae representatives (cyanobacteria), were investigated with respect to its influence on the growth and metabolic response of these microorganisms. To achieve reliable results, the growth of cyanobacteria was determined based on measurements of chlorophyll content, morphological changes were assessed through microscopic observations, and the chemical response of cells was determined using liquid and gas chromatography (HPLC; GC-FID). The results show that micromolar levels of naringenin stimulated the growth of cyanobacteria. Increased growth was observed for halophilic strains at naringenin concentrations below 40 mg L-1, and in freshwater strains at concentrations below 20 mg L-1. The most remarkable stimulation was observed for the freshwater species Nostoc muscorum, which had a growth rate that was up to 60% higher than in the control. When naringenin was examined at concentrations above 40 mg L-1, the growth of the tested microorganisms was inhibited. Simultaneously, an intensive excretion of exopolysaccharides was observed. Microscopic observations strongly suggest that these effects resulted from a structural disturbance of cyanobacterial cell walls that was exerted by naringenin. This phenomenon, in combination with the absorption of naringenin into cell wall structures, influenced cell permeability and thus the growth of bacteria. Fortunately, almost all the naringenin added to the culture was incorporated into to cell substructures and could be recovered through extraction, raising the possibility that this modulator could be recycled."

We used microsatellite genotyping to characterise the micro-epidemiology of P. vivax and P. falciparum diversity to inform malaria control strategies in Timika, Papua Indonesia.Genotyping was undertaken on 713 sympatric P. falciparum and P. vivax isolates from a cross-sectional household survey and clinical studies conducted in Timika. Standard population genetic measures were applied, and the data was compared to published data from Kalimantan, Bangka, Sumba and West Timor.Higher diversity (HE = 0.847 vs 0.625; p = 0.017) and polyclonality (46.2% vs 16.5%, p<0.001) were observed in P. vivax versus P. falciparum. Distinct P. falciparum substructure was observed, with two subpopulations, K1 and K2. K1 was comprised solely of asymptomatic infections and displayed greater relatedness to isolates from Sumba than to K2, possibly reflecting imported infections.The results demonstrate the greater refractoriness of P. vivax versus P. falciparum to control measures, and risk of distinct parasite subpopulations persisting in the community undetected by passive surveillance. These findings highlight the need for complimentary new surveillance strategies to identify transmission patterns that cannot be detected with traditional malariometric methods."

Repeated tsunami waves brought a large volume of silica-containing sludge inland after the Great East Japan earthquake in 2011. We aimed to determine if the serious disaster influenced the clinical features of the microscopic polyangiitis. Methods This is an observational retrospective study conducted in a single institute. A total of 43 patients were included based on the CHCC2012 criteria for microscopic polyangiitis from 2007 to 2015. We used the Poisson regression model to determine the incidence of microscopic polyangiitis within the annual population of the medical district. The participants were selected during a 3-year period from before (N = 13) to after the disaster (N = 20). The differences of parameters and the overall survival between the groups were analyzed. Results The incidence of microscopic polyangiitis increased after the disaster (λ = 17.4/million/year [95%CI: 7.66–39.6] before the disaster and λ = 33.1/million/year [17.7–61.7] after the disaster, P = 0.044). A high Birmingham Activity Score was associated with a high incidence of microscopic polyangiitis after the disaster. The overall survival of the patients with microscopic polyangiitis declined significantly after the disaster. Conclusions The Great East Japan earthquake influenced the development of the microscopic polyangiitis in our restricted area. The patients who developed after the disaster had severe symptoms and a high mortality rate."

We developed a systemic inflammation score (SIS) based on preoperative serum albumin and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in OCCC patients. A retrospective review was performed in 155 patients with OCCC undergoing primary debulking and chemotherapy at a single institute between 1995 and 2010. Cox regression models were fitted to analyze the effect of prognostic factors on PFS and OS. Harrell's concordance index was calculated to assess predictive accuracy. The SIS consisting of serum albumin and NLR was retained as an independent indicator adjusting for traditional clinicopathological features. A high SIS was significantly associated with aggressive tumor behavior, platinum resistance, and served as an independent predictor of reduced PFS (P = 0.006) and OS (P = 0.019). The SIS had a good discrimination ability for the predictive PFS (c-index = 0.712) and OS (c-index = 0.722).

It is unclear whether this relationship depends on the specific types of traumatic experiences. Moreover, the association has never been tested in displaced individuals with substantial levels of traumatic experiences. The present study assessed risk-taking behavior in 56 displaced individuals by means of the balloon analogue risk task (BART). Exposure to traumatic events, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression were assessed by means of semi-structured interviews. Using a novel statistical approach (stochastic gradient boosting machines), we analyzed predictors of risk-taking behavior. Exposure to organized violence was associated with less risk-taking, as indicated by fewer adjusted pumps in the BART, as was the reported experience of physical abuse and neglect, emotional abuse, and peer violence in childhood. However, civil traumatic stressors, as well as other events during childhood were associated with lower risk taking. This suggests that the association between global risk-taking behavior and exposure to traumatic stress depends on the particular type of the stressors that have been experienced."
https://openalex.org/W2612268936,"Colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer in both men and women, has gradually increased in recent years. MYSM1has been investigated as a regulator of hematopoiesis and lymphocyte development in human. It has been reported that some tumor-related genes were modulated by MYSM1. However, its exact role in cancer development remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to examine the expression level of MYSM1 in tumor tissues and its correlation with clinicopathology and survivals of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).MYSM1expressions in tumor specimens resected from 123 CRC patients were detected by immunochemistry and Western blot analysis. The results showed that MYSM1 was significantly highly expressed in carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent normal mucosa tissues (P<0.05). Correlation analyses by Pearson's chi-square test demonstrated that MYSM1 in tumors was positively correlated with tumor status (pathological assessment of the primary tumor (pT, P<0.001), regional lymph nodes (pN, P = 0.013), distant metastasis (pM, P<0.001)) and clinic stage (P<0.001); Whereas, MYSM1 was not associated with tumor size of CRC patients and was positively associated with tumor differentiation grade (P = 0.015). Patients with positiveMYSM1expression showed poor survival compared with the MYSM1 negative group (P<0.001).Simultaneously, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated thatMYSM1 expression in tumor cells was an independent factor for reduced overall survival in CRC patients (P<0.001).Additionally,MYSM1 in CRC SW480 cells was silenced by small interference RNA (siRNA) technology. Scratch assay and Transwell assay showed that MYSM1 silencing decreased migration and invasion abilities of SW480 cells. These data suggested that expression of MYSM1 was associated with the progression of CRC and might be a potential biomarker for clinical prognosis."

We aim to assess the impact of myopia on the risk of having depressive symptoms in a community-based cohort of elderly Chinese. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study of 4611 Chinese adults aged 60 years or older was conducted. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale in 4597 adults. Refraction was determined by auto-refraction followed by subjective refraction. Myopia was defined as spherical equivalent (SE) < -0.50 diopters (D) and high myopia as SE < -6.00 D. Results After adjusting for age, gender, education, lifestyle-related exposures, presenting visual acuity and age-related cataract, myopic adults were more likely to have any depressive symptoms compared with non-myopic ones (odds ratio = 1.39; 95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.92). There were no significant differences in the risk of having any depressive symptoms between those with and without high myopia. Myopia or high myopia was not associated with having moderate depressive symptoms. The impact of myopia on depressive symptoms was stronger in adults with no formal education compared with those with formal education. Conclusions Myopia was related with the presence of depressive symptoms among older adults."

More than 36 million clean reads were generated for each sample and the portions mapped to the reference genome were all above 67.0%. Our results show that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between room temperature and the early stage of vernalization (4,845) are the most in all treatments pairs. A series of vernalization related genes, including two FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) genes, were screened according to the annotations. A total of 775 genes were also filtered as the vernalization related candidates based on their expression profiles. Cold stress responsive genes were also analyzed to further confirm the sequencing result. Several key genes in vernalization or cold stress response were validated by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). This study identified a number of genes that may be involved in vernalization, which are useful for other functional genomics research in radish."

Understanding how analysts form their forecasts is important in better understanding the financial market. Carrying out big-data analysis of the analyst forecast data from I/B/E/S for nearly thirty years, we find skew distributions as evidence for emergence of complexity, and show how information asymmetry or disparity affects financial analysts’ forming their forecasts. Here regulations, information dissemination throughout a fiscal year, and interactions among financial analysts are regarded as the proxy for a lower level of information disparity. It is found that financial analysts with better access to information display contrasting behaviors: a few analysts become bolder and issue forecasts independent of other forecasts while the majority of analysts issue more accurate forecasts and flock to each other. Main body of our sample of optimistic forecasts fits a log-normal distribution, with the tail displaying a power law. Based on the Yule process, we propose a model for the dynamics of issuing forecasts, incorporating interactions between analysts. Explaining nicely empirical data on analyst forecasts, this provides an appealing instance of understanding social phenomena in the perspective of complex systems."

The full complement of subunits is required to reconstitute the native-like properties of L-type Ca2+ currents, but the molecular determinants responsible for the formation of the heteromeric complex are still being studied. Enzymatic treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, a phospholipase C specific for the cleavage of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, disrupted plasma membrane localization of the cardiac CaVα2δ1 prompting us to investigate deletions of its hydrophobic transmembrane domain. Patch-clamp experiments indicated that the C-terminally cleaved CaVα2δ1 proteins up-regulate CaV1.2 channels. In contrast, deleting the residues before the single hydrophobic segment (CaVα2δ1 Δ1059–1063) impaired current up-regulation. CaVα2δ1 mutants G1060I and G1061I nearly eliminated the cell-surface fluorescence of CaVα2δ1, indicated by two-color flow cytometry assays and confocal imaging, and prevented CaVα2δ1-mediated increase in peak current density and modulation of the voltage-dependent gating of CaV1.2. These impacts were specific to substitutions with isoleucine residues because functional modulation was partially preserved in CaVα2δ1 G1060A and G1061A proteins. Moreover, C-terminal fragments exhibited significantly altered mobility in denatured immunoblots of CaVα2δ1 G1060I and CaVα2δ1 G1061I, suggesting that these mutant proteins were impaired in proteolytic processing. Finally, CaVα2δ1 Δ1059–1063, but not CaVα2δ1 G1060A, failed to co-immunoprecipitate with CaV1.2. Altogether, our data support a model in which small neutral hydrophobic residues facilitate the post-translational cleavage of the CaVα2δ1 subunit at the predicted membrane interface and further suggest that preventing GPI anchoring of CaVα2δ1 averts its cell-surface expression, its interaction with CaVα1, and modulation of CaV1.2 currents.

Altogether, our data support a model in which small neutral hydrophobic residues facilitate the post-translational cleavage of the CaVα2δ1 subunit at the predicted membrane interface and further suggest that preventing GPI anchoring of CaVα2δ1 averts its cell-surface expression, its interaction with CaVα1, and modulation of CaV1.2 currents. In cardiac cells, Ca2+ signals control the force necessary for the myocardium to meet the physiological needs of the body (1Bers D.M. Calcium fluxes involved in control of cardiac myocyte contraction.Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). During diastole, the intracellular free ionized Ca2+ is maintained in the nanomolar range by the concerted action of mechanisms that prevent Ca2+ entry, promote its extrusion (mostly via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger), and ensure its storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (2Richard S. Perrier E. Fauconnier J. Perrier R. Pereira L. Gõmez A.M. Bénitah J.P. Calcium-induced calcium entry or how the L-type calcium channel remodels its own signalling pathway in cardiac cells.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2006; 90: 118-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Upon depolarization, Ca2+ enters the cell through the cardiac high-voltage-activated L-type CaV1.2 channel and initiates the myocardium contraction via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Regulation of the L-type Ca2+ current has profound physiological significance. Alterations in density or the activation/inactivation gating of L-type CaV1.2 channels have been implicated in a variety of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension (3Bannister J.P. Bulley S.

Over the last 15 years, structural studies have revealed the high-affinity interaction between CaVβ and CaVα1 as well as the Ca2+-calmodulin/CaVα1 association by X-ray crystallography (29Van Petegem F. Minor Jr., D.L. The structural biology of voltage-gated calcium channel function and regulation.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By contrast, there was until recently little structural information on CaVα2δ1. The reason can be found in the extreme complexity of the CaVα2δ1 protein topology that results from multiple co- and post-translational modifications. CaVα2δ1 arises from a single gene and is post-translationally cleaved into the large extracellular CaVα2 and the single-pass transmembrane CaVδ proteins bound by disulfide bridges (30Jay S.D.

CaVα2δ1 includes 20 cysteine residues, and it has been argued that intra-molecular disulfide bonds are required to stabilize its higher order structure. In addition, CaVα2δ1 is glycosylated at 16 asparagine sites, which are required for the protein folding and stability (27Tétreault M.P. Bourdin B. Briot J. Segura E. Lesage S. Fiset C. Parent L.

These features represent significant hurdles for carrying the conventional protein expression and purification in bacterial systems. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the skeletal muscle CaV1.1 channel, recently solved by single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), provides so far the best high-resolution look at the native CaVα2δ1 protein purified from a rabbit skeletal muscle T-tubule preparation in complex with the pore-forming CaVα1 from CaV1.1 (Fig. 1A) (17Wu J.

The extracellular portion of the CaVα2δ1 protein is constructed around five structural domains as follows: Cache1, von Willebrand factor A, Cache2, Cache3, and Cache4. There was, however, insufficient electron density to support amino acid assignment in a few specific regions, most notably in the “913–972” region and at the C-terminal domain between residues 1074 and 1106 (rabbit numbering) (17Wu J.

These gaps in the 3D structure might be a consequence of the unintended action of proteases during the purification process, intrinsically disordered segments, or from an actual post-translational deletion. Although more than 11 different proteases can theoretically target 250 different sites in CaVα2δ1 (36Song J. Tan H. Perry A.J. Akutsu T. Webb G.I. Whisstock J.C. Pike R.N.

Herein, we show that the native CaVα2δ1 protein from rat cardiomyocytes is a substrate for prokaryotic phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Deletion of the last 24 C-terminal residues, including the hydrophobic domain of the rat CaVα2δ1, had little impact on CaV1.2 currents demonstrating that the C-terminally cleaved CaVα2δ1 proteins achieve the conformation congruent with the modulation of CaV1.2 channels. In contrast, deletion of four residues surrounding Cys-1059 (rat isoform), which was the last amino acid identified in the 3D structure, impaired up-regulation of CaV1.2 currents. The migration profile of the C-terminal fragments was also significantly altered by single mutations in the “1059–1061” region, suggesting that the proteolytic cleavage was influenced by the chemical nature of the side chain in the site. More importantly, mutations of the predicted GPI-anchor sites markedly reduced the plasma membrane localization of CaVα2δ1 proteins and prevented its co-immunoprecipitation with CaV1.2. Altogether, our data are compatible with a model where GPI-anchored CaVα2δ1 proteins are preferentially assembled and trafficked to the cell surface with the CaV1.2 channel complex. The high-resolution 3D cryo-EM structure of the purified rabbit CaVα2δ1 subunit did not resolve the last 31 C-terminal residues, deduced from the nucleotide sequence suggesting that these residues are cleaved in the mature protein and replaced by a GPI anchor in the skeletal L-type Ca2+ channel (Fig. 1A) (17Wu J.

To examine the presence of the GPI-anchored CaVα2δ1 subunit in cardiomyocytes, rat ventricular myocytes were treated with prokaryotic phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC), which cleaves GPI anchors and releases lipid-anchored proteins (52Mayor S.

As seen, the cell-surface fraction of the PLC-treated cardiac CaVα2δ1 proteins was significantly decreased (41 ± 5%, n = 3) but not completely eradicated (Fig. 2), suggesting that transmembrane and GPI-anchored forms of CaVα2δ1 may co-exist in native tissues as shown for other proteins (53Ferguson M.

To evaluate the functional impact of the C-terminal residues, deletion mutants of the rat mCherry-CaVα2δ1-HA construct (Fig. 1B) were produced, and whole-cell currents were measured after recombinant expression with CaV1.2 and CaVβ3 (Fig. 3A). The mCherry-CaVα2δ1-HA construct, described earlier (25Bourdin B. Shakeri B. Tétreault M.P. Sauvé R. Lesage S. Parent L.

A 9-residue hemagglutinin (HA) tag from the human influenza virus, inserted in the extracellular domain, enables the identification of CaVα2 at the cell surface using a FITC-conjugated anti-HA antibody.Figure 3Deletion of the 1059–1063 region in CaVα2δ1 prevents functional up-regulation of CaV1.2 currents.

The distribution of the ΔGact values for the deleted constructs but for Δ1059–1063, overlapped with the ΔGact values measured in the presence of mCherry-CaVα2δ1-HA WT. D, representative two-dimensional plots of mCherry versus FITC fluorescence. The cell-surface expression of the mCherry-CaVα2δ1-HA construct was measured using a flow cytometry assay with 10,000 intact cells. The construct allows for detection of N- and C-terminal fragments using, respectively, a FITC-conjugated anti-HA (x axis of left, middle, and right panels) and an anti-mCherry (y axis of"
https://openalex.org/W2612677622,"Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, which arises from malfunctions in the intracellular insulin signaling network. Knowledge of the insulin signaling network is fragmented, and because of the complexity of this network, little consensus has emerged for the structure and importance of the different branches of the network. To help overcome this complexity, systems biology mathematical models have been generated for predicting both the activation of the insulin receptor (IR) and the redistribution of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane. Although the insulin signal transduction between IR and GLUT4 has been thoroughly studied with modeling and time-resolved data in human cells, comparable analyses in cells from commonly used model organisms such as rats and mice are lacking. Here, we combined existing data and models for rat adipocytes with new data collected for the signaling network between IR and GLUT4 to create a model also for their interconnections. To describe all data (>140 data points), the model needed three distinct pathways from IR to GLUT4: (i) via protein kinase B (PKB) and Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160), (ii) via an AS160-independent pathway from PKB, and (iii) via an additional pathway from IR, e.g. affecting the membrane constitution. The developed combined model could describe data not used for training the model and was used to generate predictions of the relative contributions of the pathways from IR to translocation of GLUT4. The combined model provides a systems-level understanding of insulin signaling in rat adipocytes, which, when combined with corresponding models for human adipocytes, may contribute to model-based drug development for diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2613141908,"Anthracyclines are chemotherapeutic drugs known to induce heart failure in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanisms involved in anthracycline cardiotoxicity are an area of relevant investigation. Caveolins bind, organize and regulate receptors and signaling molecules within cell membranes. Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), integrins and related membrane repair proteins can function as cardioprotective proteins. Expression of these proteins in anthracycline-induced heart failure has not been evaluated. We tested the hypothesis that daunorubicin alters cardioprotective protein expression in the heart. Rabbits were administered daunorubicin (3 mg/kg, IV) weekly, for three weeks or nine weeks. Nine weeks but not three weeks of daunorubicin resulted in progressive reduced left ventricular function. Cav-3 expression in the heart was unchanged at three weeks of daunorubicin and increased in nine week treated rabbits when compared to control hearts. Electron microscopy showed caveolae in the heart were increased and mitochondrial number and size were decreased after nine weeks of daunorubicin. Activated beta-1 (β1) integrin and the membrane repair protein MG53 were increased after nine weeks of daunorubicin vs. controls with no change at the three week time point. The results suggest a potential pathophysiological role for Cav3, integrins and membrane repair in daunorubicin-induced heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2613324993,"Background Azithromycin is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital chlamydia infection although the standard 1gram dose sometimes fails to eradicate the infection (treatment failure). One hypothesis proposed for treatment failure has been insufficient levels of the antibiotic at the site of infection. We developed an assay using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure azithromycin concentration in high-vaginal swabs and monitor how concentration changes over time following routine azithromycin treatment. Methods Azithromycin concentrations were measured in two groups of women either within the first 24h of taking a 1g dose (N = 11) or over 9 days (N = 10). Azithromycin concentrations were normalised to an internal standard (leucine enkephalin), and the bulk lipid species phosphatidylcholine [PC(34:1)], using an Agilent 6490 triple quadrupole instrument in positive ionisation mode. The abundances of azithromycin, PC(34:1), and leu-enkephalin were determined by multiple reaction monitoring and absolute levels of azithromycin estimated using standard curves prepared on vaginal specimens. Results Vaginal azithromycin concentrations of women were rapidly obtained after 5h post-treatment (mean concentration = 1031mcg/mg of lipid, range = 173-2693mcg/mg). In women followed for 9 days, peak concentrations were highest after day 2 (mean concentration = 2206mcg/mg, range = 721-5791mcg/mg), and remained high for at least 9 days with a mean concentration of 384mcg/mg (range = 139-1024mcg/mg) on day 9. Conclusion Our study confirmed that a single 1g dose of azithromycin is rapidly absorbed and remains in the vagina at relatively high levels for at least a week, suggesting that poor antibiotic absorption is unlikely to be an explanation for treatment failure."
https://openalex.org/W2612219980,"Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent in the population of the United States, affecting roughly 2/3 of Americans. These diseases, along with their associated conditions, are a major burden on the healthcare industry in terms of both dollars spent and effort expended. Volitional weight loss is attempted by many, but weight regain is common. The ability to predict which patients will lose weight and successfully maintain the loss versus those prone to regain weight would help ease this burden by allowing clinicians the ability to skip treatments likely to be ineffective. In this paper we introduce a new windowed approach to the persistent homology signal processing algorithm that, when paired with a modified, semimetric version of the Hausdorff distance, can differentiate the two groups where other commonly used methods fail. The novel approach is tested on accelerometer data gathered from an ongoing study at the University of Michigan. While most standard approaches to signal processing show no difference between the two groups, windowed persistent homology and the modified Hausdorff semimetric show a clear separation. This has significant implications for clinical decision making and patient care."

The cold outer reaches of our solar system host an array of orbiting bodies and may even hide a distant planet. Gerdes et al. have searched for new bodies in that region by using an optical survey that is primarily used for cosmology. They discovered an object, designated 2014 UZ224, located 92 times as far from the Sun as Earth—making it the second-most distant body whose orbit is known. Follow-up millimeter-wavelength observations allowed them to measure the thermal emission and thereby estimate the body's size and temperature. With a diameter of around 600 km, it is probably a dwarf planet.
