Although various regulatory proteins affecting TGF-β-mediated events have been described, relatively little is known about receptor interactions at the level of the plasma membrane. Caveolae are cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains that, along with their marker protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1), have been implicated in the compartmentalization and regulation of certain signaling events. Here, we demonstrate that specific components of the TGF-β cascade are associated with caveolin-1 in caveolae and that Cav-1 interacts with the Type I TGF-β receptor. Additionally, Cav-1 is able to suppress TGF-β-mediated phosphorylation of Smad-2 and subsequent downstream events. We localize the Type I TGF-β receptor interaction to the scaffolding domain of Cav-1 and show that it occurs in a physiologically relevant time frame, acting to rapidly dampen signaling initiated by the TGF-β receptor complex.

Members of this superfamily include the bone morphogentic proteins, the activins, and the TGF-βs, each with distinct roles in cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration/motility, among others (see Refs. 1Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar and 2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar for reviews). The prototype member of the group, TGF-β1, whose mechanism of action has been a focus of research for the past decade, classically initiates signaling at the plasma membrane by binding to a heterotetrameric complex consisting of two transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, known as Type I and Type II TGF-β receptors (TβR-I and TβR-II) (3Franzen P. ten Dijke P.

Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). The activation of this membrane complex occurs via the ligand-dependent phosphorylation of TβR-I by TβR-II (5Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J.

In turn, TβR-I can act to phosphorylate its immediate downstream effectors, Smad-2 and Smad-3, members of the SMAD family of intracellular signaling molecules (7Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S.

Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation induces a conformational change in Smad-2 and -3, thereby facilitating their heteromerization with another member of the family, Smad-4 (9Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The SMAD complex then translocates to the nucleus, where it acts to regulate the transcription of various target genes (7Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

As in numerous other cellular processes, TGF-β-mediated signaling is subject to regulation and inhibition by a variety of mechanisms. The p42/44 MAP kinase pathway, interferon-γ/STAT cascade, NF-κB, SnoN/Ski oncoproteins, among others have been shown to act as negative regulators of TGF-β signaling primarily by interacting with, modifying, or regulating the SMAD proteins (10Kretzschmar M.

Various groups have also observed regulation at the receptor level by the showing the interaction of certain intracellular proteins with the TβR-I. Of specific interest are the inhibitory proteins, Smad-6 and Smad-7, a functionally divergent subset of the SMAD protein family that can inhibit TGF-β signaling by directly interacting with the TβR-I (16Imamura T.

Other proteins such as FKBP12 have also been shown to interact with and negatively regulate TβR-I (19Chen Y.G. Liu F. Massague J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly little is known about the interactions of the TGF-β receptor complex with other membrane proteins. Although the compartmentalization of signaling molecules via scaffolding proteins is an emerging theme in signal transduction biology (20Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar), the behavior and regulation of the TGF-β receptors at the membrane has thus far been a matter of speculation. Previous reports addressing the heterotetramerization of the TβR-I/II complex have shown a characteristically punctate membrane distribution (21Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Wells R.G. Gilboa L. Sun Y. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5716-5722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and recently, the cloning of a SMAD anchor protein, SARA, also revealed a punctate distribution for both SARA and the TGF-β receptor complex (23Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Caveolae are ∼50–100 nm vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane and are thought to form as a result of a local accumulation of cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and caveolin-1 (24Fra A.M. Masserini M. Palestini P. Sonnino S. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 25Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1, a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal component of caveolae membranes in vivo (27Glenney J.R. Soppet D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10517-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 28Kurzchalia T. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J.

Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar). Structurally, a hallmark of caveolin-1 and by extension, caveolae, is a characteristically punctate staining pattern at the plasma membrane (30Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Chun M.C. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although caveolae function in vesicular and cholesterol trafficking (31Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 32Razani B. Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2103-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they have also been implicated in signal transduction (33Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Scherer P.S. Lisanti M.P.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Biochemical and morphological experiments have shown that a variety of signaling molecules are concentrated within these plasma membrane microdomains, such as Src family tyrosine kinases, Ha-Ras, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and heterotrimeric G proteins (35Li S.

Furthermore, several independent lines of evidence suggest that caveolin-1 plays a regulatory role in signaling, i.e. by functioning as a direct inhibitor of a variety of plasma-membrane initiated signaling cascades (reviewed in Ref. 41Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Given the punctate plasmalemmal distribution of Cav-1 and its emerging role in various signaling cascades, we set out to investigate its relationship with the TGF-β receptor complex and substrate SMADs. Here, we demonstrate that Cav-1 and TβR-I are highly colocalized at the membrane, that TβR-I, TβR-II, and Smad-2 (but not Smad-4) cofractionate with caveolin-1 in caveolae enriched microdomains, and that caveolin-1 directly interacts with TβR-I in both heterologous and endogenous settings. We show that this interaction has functional consequences because Cav-1 is able to suppress TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation. In addition, we demonstrate that Cav-1 diminishes the phosphorylation of Smad-2, disrupts its interaction with Smad-4, and prevents Smad-2 translocation to the nucleus in the ligand-activated state. This inhibition is mediated by an interaction between TβR-I and the scaffolding domain of Cav-1 and occurs in a physiologically relevant time frame. We show a rapid increase in the TβR-I/Cav-1 interaction upon ligand binding, and, by using an antisense strategy, we demonstrate that targeted down-regulation of caveolin-1 is sufficient to hyperactivate TGF-β signaling. The caveolin-1 mAb 2297 (used for immunoblotting) and mAb 2234 (used for immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation) (30Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Chun M.C. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J.

The phospho-specific anti-SMAD2 rabbit pAb was a gift of Peter ten Dijke (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research). The anti-FLAG tag mAb (Sigma), the anti-SMAD2 mAb (Transduction Laboratories, Inc.), and the anti-HA as well as the anti-TGF-β type I receptor rabbit pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were obtained commercially. Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Recombinant human TGF-β1 was obtained from R&D systems. NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 293T cells were similarly cultured, with the exception of serum (10% fetal bovine serum in lieu of donor calf serum). The cDNAs encoding caveolin-1 (full-length and deletion mutants) were C-terminally Myc-tagged and subcloned into the pCB7 mammalian expression vector, as described previously (42Scherer P.E.

All transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as described previously (48Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P.

Where indicated, protein concentrations were quantified using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S (to visualize protein bands) followed by immunoblot analysis. All subsequent wash buffers contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, which was supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) for the blocking solution and 1% bovine serum albumin for the antibody diluent. Primary antibodies (either polyclonal or monoclonal) were used at a 1:500 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution, Transduction Laboratory) were used to visualize bound primary antibodies with a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The procedure was performed as we previously described (35Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). For colocalization studies, NIH-3T3 cells (transfected with caveolin-1 and either TβR-I w.t. or TβR-I (T204D)) were fixed for 30 min in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde, rinsed with PBS, and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. The cells were then incubated in permeabilization buffer (PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min, washed with PBS, and double-labeled with a 1:400 dilution of anti-caveolin-1 mAb 2234 and 1:200 dilution of anti-HA rabbit pAb for 60 min. After rinsing three times with PBS, secondary antibodies (7.5 μg/ml) [(lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse) antibodies] were added for a period of 60 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and slides were mounted with Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). A Bio-Rad MR600 confocal fluorescence microscope was used for visualization of bound secondary antibodies. For assessment of SMAD2 translocation to the nucleus, a similar procedure was followed with the following differences: NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with caveolin-1, serum-starved for 20 h, and treated with TGF-β1 (4 ng/ml) for 45 min. A 1:400 dilution of anti-caveolin-1 mAb 2234 and a 1:200 dilution of anti-SMAD2 mAb were used for the caveolin-1 and endogenous SMAD2 staining, respectively. Caveolae-enriched membrane fractions were purified essentially as previously described (44Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 50Schlegel A. Schwab R. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22660-22667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 293T cells plated on a 150-mm diameter plate were transfected with the appropriate plasmid(s). 36 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice in cold PBS, scraped into 2 ml of MBS (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, passed 10 times through a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer, and mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose (prepared in MBS lacking Triton X-100). The sample was then transferred to a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient (4 ml of 30% sucrose, 4 ml of 5% sucrose, both prepared in MBS, lacking detergent). The samples were subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 ×g (39,000 rpm in a Sorval rotor TH-641) for 16 h. A light scattering band was observed at the 5/30% sucrose interface. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected, and 50-μl aliquots of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For coimmunoprecipitation of heterologously expressed proteins, 293T cells plated on 100-mm dishes were transfected with the appropriate plasmids. 36 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (see “Immunoblotting”), clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, and precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to separate 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing anti-HA pAb or appropriate control antibodies (beads alone, preimmune serum) prebound to protein-A Sepharose. After incubation by rotating overnight at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the anti-caveolin-1 2297 mAb probe. For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, NIH-3T3 cells were plated on 100-mm dishes and lysed at confluency. The procedure was as described above with the anti-caveolin-1 2234 mAb, anti-TβR-I pAb, or preimmune serum pAbs serving as the precipitating antibodies. Sets of 100-mm NIH-3T3 plates were transfected with the appropriate plasmids. 36 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in RIPA/Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 μg/ml okadiac acid, and protease inhibitors), sonicated briefly to disrupt nuclei, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 mAb. Immunoblot analysis with anti-HA pAb visualized bound SMAD4 in the SMAD2/SMAD4 complex. NIH-3T3 cells plated on 100-mm dishes were transfected with the appropriate plasmids. 36 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking phosphate and incubated for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking phosphate supplemented with 1 mCi [32P]orthophosphate/100-mm dish. Indicated plates were then additionally treated with TGF-β1 (4 ng/ml) for 45 min. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and subjected to lysis in RIPA/Nonidet P-40 buffer and immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 mAb as outlined above. SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography visualized the phosphorylated SMAD2 proteins. 293T cells plated on a 150-mm diameter plates were transfected with TβR-I (T204D), SMAD2, and either caveolin-1 or empty vector. Caveolae-enriched membrane fractions were purified as outlined above. Dilution with 1× MBS and subsequent centrifugation was used to concentrate the caveolar membranes into a 50-μl volume. Approximately 5 μg of these membranes was mixed 1:1 with 10 μl of 2× kinase reaction buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 4 mm ATP (Sigma) for 15 min. Extent of phosphorylation was determined by immunoblot analysis with anti-phospho-SMAD2 pAb. NIH-3T3 cells plated on 100-mm dishes were transfected with the appropriate plasmids. 36 h post-transfection, cells were washed once with PBS, scraped in 1 ml of Hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors), passed 10 times through a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant (i.e. cytoplasmic fraction) was saved, whereas the pellet (nuclear fraction) was washed twice with hypotonic lysis buffer before resuspending in the same buffer and sonicating to disrupt nuclear membranes. Protein concentrations from both fractions were quantified using the BCA reagent, and equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the anti-FLAG mAb as the probe.

Briefly, 150,000 NIH-3T3 cells were seeded per well in 6-well plates 12–24 h prior to transfection. For assays involving TGF-β1 stimulation, each plate was transfected with the reporter of interest (A3-lux/Fast-1 or 3TP-lux), caveolin-1 (pCB7-Cav-1), or empty vector (pCB7) and pRSV-Gal (Promega, Madison, WI). 12 h post-transfection, the cells were rinsed with PBS, incubated in 0.2% donor calf serum starvation medium for 20 h and then, where indicated, treated with TGF-β1 (4 ng/ml). 8 h post-stimulation, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of extraction buffer, 100 μl of which was used to measure luciferase activity as described (53Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Hollenberg A. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were normalized for galactosidase activity assayed by a galactosidase assay system (Promega). For the analysis of the effects of caveolin-1 and the deletion mutant Cav-1 Δ61–100 on the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor, all points were additionally transfected with TβR-I (T204D), and the cells were serum-starved but not stimulated with TGF-β1 post-transfection. Results were expressed as a ratio of luciferase activity to galactosidase activity. Each experimental value represents the average of three separate transfections performed in parallel; error bars represent the observed S.D. All experiments were performed at least three times independently and yielded virtually identical results. The kinase substrate used in this assay, the GST-SMAD2 fusion protein, was a gift of Mark de Caestecker (National Cancer Institute) (54Lechleider R.J. de Caestecker M.P. Dehejia A.

Briefly, after expression in Escherichia coli (BL21 strain; Novagen, Inc.), GST-SMAD2 was affinity purified on glutathione-agarose beads, using the detergent sarcosyl for initial solubilization (56Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) and washed three times with TNET buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining was used to determine the approximate molar quantities of the fusion protein/100 μl of packed bead volume. GST-SMAD2 was then eluted with an appropriate volume of TNET buffer containing 20 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). An anti-HA rabbit pAb was used to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged TβR-I (T204D) from transiently transfected 293T cells. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (35Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, immunoprecipitates and an appropriate fraction of the GST-SMAD2 eluate were equilibrated with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 4 mm ATP (Sigma). After 15 min of incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 4 min. Phosphorylated GST-SMAD2 was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-phospho-SMAD2 rabbit pAb. In reactions involving the use of caveolin-derived peptides, prior to initiating the reaction, the immunoprecipitates were preincubated in kinase reaction buffer with the indicated peptide for 30 min at 4 °C. The caveolin-based peptides were synthesized using standard methodology and subjected to amino acid analysis and mass spectroscopy (Massachusetts Institute of Technology Biopolymers Laboratory and Research Genetics) to confirm their purity and composition, as we described previously (35Li S.

Histone acetylation is correlated with transcriptional activity or competence such that hyperacetylation within chromatin domains favors transcriptional competency, whereas hypoacetylation favors transcriptional silencing. Acetylation neutralizes positive charges on lysine ε-amino groups and may alter nucleosome conformation by weakening interactions of the N-terminal domains with DNA or adjacent nucleosomes. In addition, acetylation at specific residues may create or abolish binding sites for non-histone chromosomal proteins (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar, 2Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 3Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Acetylation states are maintained by the coordinate activity of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs).1 Histone acetyltransferases are oxidoreductases, transferring an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA, whereas HDACs remove acetyl groups by hydrolysis (4Kuo M.-H.

Most HDACs belong to a superfamily of zinc metalloenzymes with a conserved ∼380-residue catalytic domain (6Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R.

The class I HDACs (∼500 residues in length) are the best characterized with respect to function. These HDACs are involved in maintaining both short-term (induction/repression) and long-term (epigenetic) patterns of gene activity (8Struhl K.

It is unclear whether HDAC1 and HDAC2 have distinct functions, but they appear to play complementary roles in transcriptional repression. For example, in GH3 pituitary cells, thyroid-stimulating hormone-β expression is negatively regulated by the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine. This triiodothyronine-dependent regulation requires HDAC activity, as indicated by its sensitivity to the inhibitor trichostatin A. An HDAC1 multiprotein complex binds constitutively to a negative regulatory element in the thyroid-stimulating hormone-β promoter. However, chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression at the thyroid-stimulating hormone-β promoter require (in addition) triiodothyronine-dependent recruitment of an HDAC2 complex to the negative regulatory element (19Sasaki S. Lesoon-Wood L.A. Dey A. Kuwata T. Weintraub B.D. Humphrey G. Yang W.-M. Seto E. Howard B.H. Ozato K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5389-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Immunopurification of either HDAC1 or HDAC2 from human cell lines typically yields multiprotein complexes containing both HDAC1 and HDAC2.

To gain further insight into the mechanism by which HDAC1 and HDAC2 complexes may be independently recruited to specific sites in chromatin, we have analyzed core complexes containing either HDAC1 or HDAC2. Two major HDAC1/2 complexes were identified in HeLa cells: cI is a novel complex containing transcriptional corepressor CoREST/kiaa0071 (29Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallman J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and protein kiaa0601, inferred to be an FAD-dependent enzyme; cII is similar to the Mi-2 remodeling complex. Under native conditions, cI and cII may contain HDAC1, HDAC2, or both, but these can be dissociated by a mild chaotrope to core complexes containing only HDAC1 or HDAC2. This behavior suggests a general model for interaction between HDAC1 and HDAC2 via dimerization of cI- or cII-specific components. We identified a potential HDAC-targeting factor,mCpG-binding protein MBD2 (30Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), as an integral component of the HDAC1 cII complex. MBD2 was not detected in HDAC2 cII complexes, implying that targeting of HDAC2 may occur via dimerization with HDAC1. Finally, we note that a region of sequence similarity exists between cI component CoREST/kiaa0071 and cII component Mta-L1 (31Futamura M. Nishimori H. Shiratsuchi T. Saji S. Nakamura Y. Tokino T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 52-56Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), containing SANT domains (32Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Gibson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 87-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). SANT domain proteins are also components of HDAC3 core complexes (33Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W. Verdin E. Lazar M.A. Shiekhattar R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1048-1057PubMed Google Scholar) and may play a general role in HDAC complex assembly. HeLa S3 cells were grown in suspension culture as previously described (34Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Cells were transduced with a retroviral construct (pOZ) expressing a bicistronic mRNA encoding FLAG-tagged HDAC1 protein linked to an interleukin-2 receptor subunit surface marker, and the transduced population was purified by repeated cycles of affinity cell sorting (34Ogryzko V.V.

A cDNA construct encoding human HDAC1 with a C-terminal FLAG tag, used to construct the retroviral vector, was generously provided by Dr. Stuart L. Schreiber. A cDNA encoding human HDAC2 (accession number NP_001518) was isolated by performing polymerase chain reaction using gene-specific primers located in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions with a CLONTECH Marathon cDNA library; this cDNA clone was used to prepare an expression construct with a C-terminal FLAG tag (see above). For detection of FAD, 2.8 × 108cells were radiolabeled with 1 mCi of [3H]riboflavin (25 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in 350 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (minus riboflavin) for 16 h prior to harvest. Rabbit antisera were raised against 16-mer peptides representing the C termini of human HDAC1 (15Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L.

Mouse mAbs 13D10 and 15G12, raised against human RbAp48, were obtained from GeneTex (38Qian Y.-W. Lee E.Y.H.P. J. Biol.

Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to HDAC2 (sc-6296) and mSin3A (sc-767) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies for Western blotting were obtained from Pierce. In view of reports that histone deacetylases may be resistant to extraction from isolated nuclei (39Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we employed a sequential extraction procedure to facilitate recovery of soluble complexes from the transduced cells. For preparation of nuclei, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT), and lysed by Dounce homogenization (40Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar), yielding nuclei and cytosol. The nuclear pellet was washed in isotonic sucrose buffer (STM: 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmDTT), yielding STM wash, and the nuclear envelope was removed by addition of 1‥ Triton X-100, yielding Triton wash. Nuclei were sequentially extracted with low magnesium buffer (10 mmTris (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT), yielding low magnesium wash, and then with low magnesium buffer plus 0.5 m NaCl (41Buckler-White A.J. Humphrey G.W. Pigiet V. Cell. 1980; 22: 37-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 42Kaufmann S.H. Coffey D.S. Shaper J.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1981; 132: 105-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), yielding high salt extract and residual nuclei. All buffers contained Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Most of HDAC1/2 was obtained in the high salt extract (see Fig.1 A). The high salt extract was dialyzed in ion-exchange chromatography buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 m urea, 1 mm DTT, 10‥ glycerol, and 0.005‥ CHAPS), centrifuged at 27,000 ×g, and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with chromatography buffer. The column was eluted with a gradient of 100–750 mm NaCl, and the HDAC1-containing fractions (∼250–350 mm NaCl) were pooled and dialyzed in immunopurification buffer (20 mmTris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10‥ glycerol, and 0.1‥ Tween 20). The Q-Sepharose pool was mixed with either anti-FLAG or anti-HDAC1 antibody-agarose for 3 h on a rotator, packed into a column, and washed in ∼50 volumes of immunopurification buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from anti-FLAG antibody-agarose by incubation with immunopurification buffer containing FLAG peptide (50 μg/ml) or from anti-HDAC1 antibody-agarose with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5) and 0.1‥ Tween 20. (Note that removal of urea by dialysis was required to efficiently bind the FLAG epitope; endogenous HDAC1 could be immunopurified without dialysis. The same proteins co-immunopurified with endogenous HDAC1 in the presence or absence of 1 murea.) To resolve HDAC1/2 complexes, 200 μl of anti-FLAG eluate was centrifuged in a 3.7-ml 10–35‥ glycerol gradient for 5.5 h at 55,000 rpm using an SW 60Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments) (43Westwood J.T. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Twenty 200-μl fractions were collected. Marker proteins (ovalbumin (4.54 S), aldolase (7.3 S), catalase (11.3 S), and thyroglobulin (19 S)) were centrifuged in parallel gradients. Histone deacetylase activity was measured using human core histones radiolabeled with [3H]acetate in vivo as substrate (44Candido E.P.M. Reeves R. Davie J.R. Cell. 1978; 14: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Aliquots (1–10 μl) were incubated with 10 μg of [3H]histone in 100 μl of assay buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 75 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT) for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by addition of 20 μl of 12 n HCl and extracted with 0.5 ml of ethyl acetate. Acetate release was measured by liquid scintillation counting of the ethyl acetate (organic) phase. As a specificity control, release of [3H]acetate was inhibited by either 0.1 μm trichostatin A or 10 mmsodium butyrate. Protein identification by mass spectrometry was carried out as described (34Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. An electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) coupled on line with a Magic 2002 capillary HPLC (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA) was used to acquire tandem mass spectra. A 0.1 × 50-mm Magic MS C18 column (5-μm particle diameter, 200-Å pore size) with mobile phases A (methanol/water/acetic acid, 5:95:1) and B (methanol/water/acetic acid, 85:15:1) was used with a gradient of 2–98‥ mobile phase B over 2.5 min, followed by 98‥ mobile phase B for 2 min. Specific protein bands from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels were excised, destained, and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were extracted. 20–50‥ of the sample was used to obtain liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectra. The tandem mass spectra were used to search the compiled NCBI nonredundant protein and expressed sequence tag data bases with the program PepFrag to identify the proteins. HDAC1 and HDAC2 were extracted from isolated HeLa cell nuclei with 0.5 m NaCl (high salt extract) (see Fig.1 A (HS) and “Experimental Procedures”). Endogenous HDAC1 and HDAC2 were isolated using specific immunoadsorbents recognizing their (nonconserved) C-terminal 16 residues. When HDAC1 was isolated directly from the high salt extract under non-stringent conditions, some HDAC2 co-immunopurified with it (Fig. 1 B), as in previous studies (22Zhang Y. Iratni R.

Histone deacetylase enzymatic activity was stable indefinitely in 1 m urea, but was irreversibly lost at higher concentrations (2–4 m). HDAC1 and HDAC2 were fully dissociated by Q-Sepharose chromatography in 1 murea. The proteins coeluted in the Q-Sepharose pool (0.25–0.35m NaCl), but bound independently to the immunoadsorbents (Fig. 1 B). To facilitate physical characterization of purified, native HDAC1 and HDAC2 multiprotein complexes, we expressed recombinant proteins with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag (HDAC1-F and HDAC2-F) in HeLa S3 cells. Cell lines with stable expression of either HDAC1-F or HDAC2-F were obtained by transduction with a bicistronic retroviral vector and repeated cycles of magnetic affinity cell sorting (see “Experimental Procedures”). Endogenous and recombinant HDAC1/2 proteins expressed in these cells were quantified by Western blotting using affinity-purified antibody specific to the C terminus of either HDAC1 or HDAC2, respectively, and mouse anti-FLAG mAb M2. Levels of endogenous and recombinant HDAC1 proteins were compared using a baculovirus-expressed HDAC1 protein with an N-terminal FLAG tag as a standard; approximately equal amounts of endogenous and recombinant HDAC1 proteins were expressed in the transduced cells (Fig.1 A). Endogenous and FLAG-tagged HDAC1 proteins were isolated from the Q-Sepharose pool (see above) using anti-HDAC1 or anti-FLAG immunoadsorbents, respectively. The polypeptides copurifying with either endogenous or FLAG-tagged HDAC1 from the Q-Sepharose pool were compared by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The polypeptide composition of the anti-FLAG eluate was generally similar to that of the anti-HDAC1 eluate, except for the presence of several additional bands. These additional bands were also present in the control anti-FLAG eluate, indicating that they were contaminants; they were removed by further purification of the HDAC1-F complexes (see below). The polypeptides common to both endogenous and FLAG-tagged HDAC1 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (34Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), kiaa0601 (p115, a protein homologous to FAD-dependent enzymes) (see Fig. 8), and an additional SANT domain protein (kiaa0071) (see Fig. 9), comigrating with HDAC1 (p63) (35Ohara O. Nagase T. Ishikawa K.-I. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The p63 and p61 bands both contained HDAC1; no HDAC2-specific peptides were detected in either band.Figure 9Sequence similarity among CoREST/kiaa0071, Mta-L1, and Mta1.

We employed velocity sedimentation in a glycerol density gradient to separate HDAC1-F complexes differing in size and shape. Histone deacetylase enzyme activity sedimented as a 15 S peak with a 9.5 S shoulder (Fig. 3, upper panel). The distribution of HDAC1-F by Western blotting (Fig. 3,lower panel) was similar to the activity profile, indicating similar specific activities for all sedimenting species of HDAC1. Different polypeptides co-sedimented with HDAC1-F in the 9.5 S and 15 S regions of the gradient (Fig. 3, middle panel), indicating that these fractions represent different core complexes, designated cI (9.5 S) and cII (15 S). The polypeptide components of cI (fractions 6 and 7) and cII (fractions 9 and 10) were analyzed by mass spectrometry (see above). The p63 band in both cI and cII contained HDAC1 and kiaa0071. The p115 band in cI contained kiaa0601. cII contained the remodeling complex components Mi-2 (p240), Mta-L1 (p78), RbAp48/46 (p55/p53), and MBD3 (p36/p33) and, in addition, MBD2 (p50/p30). Additional bands were identified in cII: p70 is a human homolog of theXenopus laevis HDAC-associated zinc finger protein p66 (24Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar); p59 and p38 represent truncated forms of Mta-L1. The narrow width of the 15 S peak (same as the sedimentation standards) suggests that cII represents a single multiprotein complex. (This idea is further supported by immunopurification studies described below.) The variation in staining intensity of the bands could be due either to different stoichiometries (i.e. 3–5 mol of p240/p78/p63/p55/p53 per mol of p50/p36/p33) or to differences in the amount of Coomassie Blue dye bound per mol of each protein. To obtain specific probes for cI and cII, affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies were prepared against the C-terminal 16 residues of kiaa0601, kiaa0071, Mta-L1, and MBD2. kiaa0601 and kiaa0071 were found predominantly in cI, whereas Mta-L1 and MBD2 were found exclusively in cII (Fig. 3, lower panel). The data from Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting suggest that cI is a multiprotein complex composed of kiaa0601 (p115), kiaa0071 (p63), HDAC1 (p63), and p37, which is consistent with the predicted molecular mass for a 9.5 S complex, ∼200 kDa. The predicted molecular mass for a 15 S complex, ∼400 kDa, would appear to be an underestimate for cII. Assuming only 1 mol of each visible band in the multiprotein complex would indicate a molecular mass of at least 1 MDa. However, sedimentation coefficients are a function of both the molecular mass and frictional ratio, the latter being related to particle asymmetry (43Westwood J.T. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In view of the wide size range of the proteins in cII, it is likely to have a greater frictional ratio than the sedimentation standards; thus, 400 kDa would represent only a minimum estimate. FLAG-tagged HDAC2 was isolated using the same procedures employed for HDAC1 (see above). In contrast to HDAC1, HDAC2 deacetylase activity sedimented as a single broad peak centered around 15 S (Fig.4). This HDAC2 core complex contained the same major components as the HDAC1 cII complex: Mi-2 (p240), Mta-L1 (p78), p70, RbAp48/46 (p55/p53), and MBD3 (p36); but did not contain MBD2, as judged by Western blotting. To determine whether endogenous HDAC1 and HDAC2 in normal (untransduced) HeLa cells exist as distinct cI and cII core complexes, we employed antibody adsorbents specific for cI (anti-kiaa0601 and anti-kiaa0071) and cII (anti-Mta-L1 and anti-MBD2) components. Binding was performed using the native high salt extract (no urea treatment) under non-stringent conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). After extensive washing, the adsorbents were eluted with pH 2.5 buffer, and the eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.5 A). As expected, all adsorbents (except the control) bound HDAC1. (Protein recovery from the anti-MBD2 adsorbent was relatively low.) Also as predicted, the cI components kiaa0601 and kiaa0071 bound to anti-HDAC1, anti-kiaa0601, and anti-kiaa0071 adsorbents, but not to anti-Mta-L1 and anti-MBD2 adsorbents; conver"

Genetically obese rodents with mutations of leptin or the leptin receptor are defective in leptin signaling and develop morbid obesity and diabetes. Interestingly, the levels of both leptin mRNA and protein are increased by up to 20-fold in these animals, suggesting the existence of a feedback mechanism controlling the amount of leptin in circulation. In this report, we attempted to determine whether the up-regulation of circulating leptin in Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats, which are nonresponsive to leptin due to a receptor point mutation, is entirely due to increased expression of leptin. We demonstrate that the high level of circulating leptin in these rats is attributable to at least two factors: increased leptin expression by the adipose tissue and delayed clearance of leptin from circulation due to binding to its soluble receptor. The latter conclusion was supported by three lines of evidence: 1) The soluble leptin receptor is up-regulated by about 20-fold in Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats; 2) Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the soluble leptin receptor results in a similar -fold increase of circulating leptin; 3) In ob/ob mice, which have no endogenous leptin, exogenously administered leptin reaches a higher level when the soluble leptin receptor is overexpressed. The weight-reducing effect of leptin is enhanced in C57Bl/6 ob/ob mice with overexpression of the soluble leptin receptor.

Proenca P. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11755) Google Scholar). It has potent weight-reducing effects in vivo (2Campfield L.A.

Inob/ob mice, the gene encoding leptin is mutated, resulting in morbid obesity and associated abnormalities, including hyperphagia, hypothermia, diabetes, and infertility. The leptin receptor, OB-R,1is a member of the cytokine receptor family (5Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J. Devos R. Richards G.J. Campfield L.A. Clark F.T. Deeds J. Muir C. Sanker S. Moriarty A. Moore K.J. Smutko J.S. Mays G.G. Woolf E.A. Monroe C.A. Tepper R.I. Cell. 1995; 83: 1263-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3231) Google Scholar). It is encoded by thediabetes (db) gene, mutation of which also results in morbid obesity and other abnormalities similar to that inob/ob mice. OB-R is alternatively spliced into at least five transcripts from a single gene. These transcripts encode proteins that are called the long (OB-Rb), short (OB-Ra, -c, and -d), and soluble (OB-Re) forms of the leptin receptor. With the exception of the soluble leptin receptor, receptor isoforms differ from each other by the alternative use of a unique terminal coding exon (6Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar). OB-Rb is essential in mediating leptin's weight-reducing and other biological effects (6Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar, 7Chen H. Charlat O. Tartaglia L.A. Woolf E.A. Weng X. Ellis S.J. Lakey N.D. Culpepper J. Moore K.J. Breitbart R.E. Duyk G.M. Tepper R.I. Morgenstern J.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 491-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar). OB-R is expressed in both the nervous system and peripheral tissues. The relative levels of expression of different receptor isoforms vary among different tissues, providing a possible mechanism of regulating leptin's biological activity at various leptin target sites (8Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A. Stoffel R. Heim M.H. Skoda R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6231-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). OB-Rb is enriched in the hypothalamus, the site of leptin's action on food intake and body weight. Leptin activation of OB-Rb within this brain region results in the inhibition of neuropeptide Y/agouti-related protein neurons and activation of pro-opiomelanocortin/cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript neurons (9Friedman J.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). These neural circuits in turn mediate leptin's biological effect centrally. OB-Rb can also activate signal transduction in a variety of peripheral tissues, including the adipose tissue, T cells, endothelial cells, and the pancreatic ² cells (10Kim Y.B. Uotani S. Pierroz D.D.

Direct leptin signaling at these additional sites may contribute to the many biological effects of leptin. Although OB-Rb is essential in mediating leptin's biological effects, other receptor isoforms may still be necessary for leptin to exert its full spectrum of in vivo functions. Among the short forms of the leptin receptor, OB-Ra is most abundantly expressed (15Fei H. Okano H.J. Li C. Lee G.-H. Zhao C. Darnell R. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7001-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). It is enriched at the choroid plexus and brain microvessels, sites of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and blood-brain barrier, suggesting that it may be involved in the transport of leptin across these barriers to reach the hypothalamus. One of the mutant OB-R alleles in rats, fa k /fa k, does not have this form of the leptin receptor. They have reduced levels of leptin in the cerebrospinal fluid, supporting a role of the short form leptin receptor in leptin transport to the hypothalamus (16Wu-Peng X.S. Chua Jr., S.C. Okada N. Liu S.M. Nicolson M. Leibel R.L. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 17Kastin A.J. Pan W. Maness L.M. Koletsky R.J. Ernsberger P. Peptides. 1999; 20: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that the secreted form of the leptin receptor, OB-Re, circulates in mouse plasma and is capable of binding to leptin (18Li C. Ioffe E. Fidahusein N. Connolly E. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10078-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The level of both OB-Re and leptin increased by up to 40-fold during late stages of mouse pregnancy, suggesting that the soluble leptin receptor may modulate leptin's biological activityin vivo (19Gavrilova O. Barr V. Marcus-Samuels B. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30546-30551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that, in leptin nonresponsive ZDF rats, OB-Re expression is increased by more than 20-fold. We also show that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the soluble leptin receptor causes increases of circulating leptin without affecting leptin expression. The elevation of circulating leptin results from delayed clearance in the presence of overexpressed OB-Re. Finally, we show that in ob/ob mice, leptin's effect on food intake and body weight is enhanced when its soluble receptor is overexpressed. The cDNA encoding the soluble leptin receptor was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and subcloned into a shuttle vector pAdCMV. The shuttle vector containing the soluble leptin receptor was first transfected into 293T cells to verify the correct expression of the encoded protein. It was then recombined with the adenovirus backbone vector pJM17 by cotransfection into 293 cells. Viruses were plaque-purified on soft agar and amplified to a titer of 1012 virus particles/ml before being used for injection. Adenoviruses encoding leptin (Ad-CMV-leptin) (20Chen G. Koyama K. Yuan X. Lee Y. Zhou Y.T. O'Doherty R. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. C. B. Newgard (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Male Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats and Zucker lean rats at 9 weeks of age were obtained from Dr. Roger Unger's laboratory (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Lean rats were divided into two groups. The experimental group received AdCMV-OB-Re (OB-Re) virus, whereas the control group received AdCMV-²-Gal virus. After virus injection, rats were fed with high fat diet containing 20% fat (Teklad, Madison, WI). Female C57Bl/6Job/ob mice at 5 weeks of age were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice received virus injection similarly as performed in rats. All animals used were housed and cared by the staff in the Animal Resource Center of University of Texas Southwestern. Adenoviruses encoding OB-Re or ²-galactosidase were injected into the jugular vein of rats weighing between 250 and 300 g. Each rat received ∼1 × 1012 total virus particles in 0.5 ml of PBS. For expression in mice, each mouse received ∼1 × 1011 virus particles in 0.1 ml of PBS via the tail vein. Three days after adenovirus injection, one group of ob/ob mice was implanted subcutaneously with Alzet osmotic pumps (model 1002D, Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA). The pumps delivered 12.5 ¼g of mouse recombinant leptin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) per day continuously for 12 days. Food intake and body weight were measured daily. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein into Eppendorf tubes coated with EDTA. Plasma was prepared by low speed centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min) and used for measurement of glucose, free fatty acids, triglyceride, insulin, the soluble leptin receptor, and leptin. Mice that received adenovirus injection were sacrificed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. Epididymal fat was dissected immediately, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from tissues with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blotting of leptin was performed as described previously. Probes were derived by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers specific for leptin. Primer sequences were: forward primer, 5′-TGAGTTTGTCCAAGATGGAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCCATCCAGGCTCTCTGG-3′. Product size was expected to be 190 base pairs. Probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a random primer labeling kit (New England BioLabs). Plasma from ZDF rats and lean rats was diluted in PBS and incubated with leptin-Sepharose resin overnight. Leptin beads were washed with PBS three times. After boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min, resin suspension was loaded directly onto an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted with an anti-leptin receptor polyclonal antibody as described previously (18Li C.

Circulating levels of leptin in plasma of rats and mice overexpressing the soluble leptin receptor were detected by Western blotting. Leptin levels in animals that did not receive AdCMV-OB-Re virus were measured by a rat leptin RIA kit (Linco Research, St. Louis, MO). Polyclonal antibodies against leptin and the soluble leptin receptor were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or as described previously (18Li C. Ioffe E. Fidahusein N.

Similar increases of both leptin mRNA and protein also occur in ZDF rats, which have a single amino acid mutation within the extracellular domain of the leptin receptor (Gln-269 → Pro) (24Maffei M. Halaas J. Ravussin E. Pratley R.E. Lee G.H. Zhang Y. Fei H. Kim S. Lallone R. Ranganathan S. Kern P.A. Friedman J.M. Nature Medicine. 1995; 1: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar). Because leptin signaling is absent indb/db mice or ZDF rats, elevated leptin levels in these mutant animals raises the possibility of a feedback control mechanism regulating leptin expression. We asked if the expression of the soluble form of leptin receptor is changed when leptin signaling is absent, such as in db/dbmice or ZDF rats. Previously, we have established an assay to measure the level of circulating leptin receptor with leptin-Sepharose beads, which is a useful method for concentrating available receptor protein for detection (18Li C. Ioffe E. Fidahusein N. Connolly E. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10078-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The protein level of other forms of the leptin receptor is too low to be detected directly. Plasma from Zucker lean or ZDF rats was prepared and incubated with leptin-Sepharose resin to determine the circulating soluble leptin receptor level. The soluble leptin receptor present in plasma was estimated by its ability to bind an excess amount of added immobilized leptin that was coupled to Sepharose beads. Bound receptor protein is then separated by SDS-PAGE gel and detected with a polyclonal antibody. This method, however, cannot be used to concentrate and measure membrane-bound receptors, because leptin binding is very sensitive to the presence of detergents (data not shown). To compare the relative abundance of the soluble leptin receptor in Zucker lean and ZDF rats, a fixed amount of plasma from lean Zucker rats and varying amounts of plasma from ZDF rats were used to incubate with leptin-Sepharose beads. The amount of receptor present in each sample did not saturate the binding capacity of the leptin resin used, because controls with a high level of recombinant receptor protein recovered from leptin-Sepharose resin or loaded directly to SDS-PAGE give rise to receptor signals with indistinguishable intensity (data not shown). We also measured the amount of leptin present in each sample using leptin radioimmunoassay (RIA). Fig.1 A shows the amount of leptin present in each plasma sample in Zucker lean and ZDF rats. There is about a 10-fold elevation of leptin in plasma from ZDF rats compared with lean rats. Fig. 1 B is a Western blot of bound soluble leptin receptor from each plasma sample after incubation with the leptin-Sepharose beads. Samples containing 2–5 ¼l of plasma from ZDF rats generated signal density that is about equal to that from 100 ¼l of plasma from Zucker lean rats, indicating that the plasma concentration of soluble leptin receptor in ZDF rats is elevated by at least 20-fold. Although the plasma levels of the soluble leptin receptor from rats of the same genotype vary, a similar -fold increase of the soluble leptin receptor was found in ZDF rats compared with Zucker lean rats. This result demonstrates that, in the absence of leptin signaling, expression of both leptin and its soluble receptor is elevated in plasma. Because OB-Re level is elevated in plasma of ZDF rats, we asked if it plays a role in modulating the level of total circulating leptin. We chose to test this hypothesis by overexpressing the soluble leptin receptor in both Zucker lean and ZDF rats. High level in vivo expression of the soluble leptin receptor was achieved by administration of a recombinant adenovirus containing its cDNA (AdCMV-OB-Re). When transfected into 293T cells, virally expressed receptor protein migrated at the same position on SDS-PAGE as the soluble leptin receptor purified from plasma, suggesting that there is correct post-translational modification (data not shown). Before adenovirus-mediated overexpression of OB-Re, there were comparable amounts of leptin present in plasma samples in each genotype as assayed with RIA; the levels of the soluble leptin receptor were also comparable in Zucker lean or ZDF rats using the leptin pull-down assay (data not shown). Two days after adenovirus injection, the leptin pull-down assay was repeated. Robust expression of the soluble leptin receptor was detected in both lean and ZDF rats that received AdCMV-OB-Re virus compared with those that received AdCMV-²-Gal virus (Fig. 2). In parallel, we measured the levels of circulating leptin in these OB-Re-overexpressing rats with RIA. Surprisingly, the leptin level was over the upper limit of detection in both Zucker lean and ZDF rats overexpressing the soluble leptin receptor (data not shown). These results suggest that expression of the soluble leptin receptor leads to a concomitant increase of circulating leptin. The robust expression of OB-Re in vivo via adenovirus and a similar rise of circulating leptin prompted us to test if it is possible to detect both proteins from plasma directly. In normal rats, the amount of circulating leptin is too low to be detectable by direct blotting of plasma proteins. When samples from OB-Re-overexpressing rats were run on an 8% or 16% SDS-PAGE and detected with antibodies specific for soluble leptin receptor or leptin, strong signals were obtained for both proteins in lanes containing samples from rats that received AdCMV-OB-Re virus (Fig. 3). The signal for leptin or its soluble receptor was absent in rats that received AdCMV-²-Gal virus or were sham-operated, suggesting that the elevation of circulating leptin is the result of overexpression of its soluble receptor. Adenoviruses that are injected via the jugular vein or tail vein preferentially infect the liver. To verify that the soluble leptin receptor we detected in plasma indeed comes from adenovirus-mediated overexpression of OB-Re but not from induction of endogenous soluble leptin receptor, we performed Northern blot analysis. Rats were sacrificed 2 weeks after treatment with AdCMV-OB-Re or AdCMV-²-Gal. Total RNA was prepared from liver and other tissues, and virally mediated expression of OB-Re was detected with a cDNA probe for OB-R. Fig. 4 A shows that the livers of rats that received AdCMV-OB-Re contain a high level OB-Re mRNA, which is not detected in the livers of rats that received AdCMV-²-Gal. AdCMV-OB-Re-treated rats also have a high level of circulating OB-Re protein, demonstrating that it is produced from the adenoviruses administered (Fig. 4 B). To estimate the -fold increase of the soluble leptin receptor and leptin after adenovirus treatment, we performed serial dilution analysis of both proteins in plasma. Plasma samples from AdCMV-OB-Re virus-treated ZDF rats were diluted and compared with undiluted sample before adenovirus injection. Antibody against leptin or its soluble receptor was used to detect the amount of each protein present in all samples. Fig. 5 shows that, compared with the undiluted plasma sample obtained prior to virus treatment, a rise of about 25-fold for leptin and about 100-fold for its soluble receptor was achieved. Hyperleptinemia induced by its soluble receptor may be explained by the following three possibilities: increased leptin synthesis, increased leptin stability by binding to its overexpressed soluble receptor or other proteins, or a combination of both. We first tested whether the soluble leptin receptor affects leptin expression at the transcriptional level by Northern blot analysis. In bothob/ob and db/db mice, expression of leptin is increased by up to 20-fold at the mRNA level (24Maffei M. Halaas J. Ravussin E. Pratley R.E. Lee G.H. Zhang Y. Fei H. Kim S. Lallone R. Ranganathan S. Kern P.A. Friedman J.M. Nature Medicine. 1995; 1: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar). To test whether the soluble leptin receptor plays a role in leptin expression in animals with normal leptin function, we overexpressed the soluble leptin receptor in wild type mice for 3 days and compared the leptin mRNA levels in mice that received AdCMV-OB-Re virus or AdCMV-²-Gal control virus. This time point was chosen, because adenovirus-mediated overexpression reaches a peak level 2–3 days after virus injection. Total RNA was prepared from the white adipose tissue of mice treated with AdCMV-OB-Re or AdCMV-²-Gal and blotted with a cDNA probe specific for leptin. As shown in Fig. 6, mice that received OB-Re virus expressed various amounts of the soluble leptin receptor. In all cases, the levels of circulating leptin were also elevated. However, the leptin mRNA is not increased in adipose tissue in response to OB-Re overexpression. We also examined other tissues to test whether they express leptin after adenovirus-mediated OB-Re overexpression. No leptin signal was detected from all other tissues examined (data not shown). To further understand the mechanism by which leptin levels are increased by OB-Re overexpression, ob/ob mice were given leptin continuously via a subcutaneous miniature osmotic pump. This method has been used successfully to achieve delivery of leptin at controlled rates (25Halaas J.L. Boozer C. Blair-West J. Fidahusein N. Denton D. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8878-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). ob/ob mice have no endogenous leptin due to a mutation in its coding region (1Zhang Y. Proenca P. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11755) Google Scholar). Consequently, all circulating leptin will be derived from material released from the pump. If the soluble leptin receptor increases the stability of leptin, we would predict that it would cause an elevation in circulating leptin. As shown in Fig.7, the soluble leptin receptor reached a very high level in mice that received AdCMV-OB-Re, but not in those that received AdCMV-²-Gal. As predicted, circulating leptin is also elevated by manyfold in mice that received AdCMV-OB-Re. The increased leptin level in OB-Re-overexpressing mice can be completely explained by its delayed clearance. Does the hyperleptinemia induced by the soluble leptin receptor affect leptin's effects on food intake and body weight? To answer this question, we studied the response of ob/ob mice to exogenous leptin when they are also treated with AdCMV-OB-Re or Ad-CMV-²-Gal virus. After leptin pump implantation, both groups of ob/ob mice (with or without OB-Re overexpression) started to lose body weight at similar rates. Food intake was also similarly reduced (Fig.8). Interestingly, when OB-Re is overexpressed, a further reduction of food intake and body weight was observed, beginning at day 7 after pump implantation. Because leptin activity is determined by the amount of free leptin, this result suggests that similar levels of free leptin may be present in both groups of mice at the start of the experiment. The increased biological activity of leptin may be the result of extra free leptin that has saturated the binding capacity of overexpressed OB-Re or that was dissociated from its soluble leptin receptor. The absolute concentration of free leptin in the absence or presence of its soluble receptor at each time point remains to be determined. Taken together, our data demonstrate that leptin level in plasma is determined by at least two factors, as depicted in Fig.9. Its production is controlled primarily by the degree of adiposity, with acute regulation by feeding state, insulin, and other factors. Its steady-state level is also modulated by its soluble receptor and other binding proteins. A combination of factors regulating leptin synthesis and stability may determine the total circulating level of leptin in different nutritional and physiological states. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the soluble leptin receptor circulates in plasma and is capable of binding to leptin (18Li C. Ioffe E. Fidahusein N. Connolly E. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10078-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Other groups also found that soluble leptin receptor level is elevated by up to 40-fold at late stages of mouse gestation (19Gavrilova O. Barr V. Marcus-Samuels B. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30546-30551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), suggesting that expression of the soluble leptin receptor is regulated and that it may modulate leptin's biological activity in vivo. In the current study, we extended these observations further and demonstrate that a feedback regulation of the expression of both leptin and its soluble receptor occurs in vivo. In the absence of leptin signaling, both proteins are increased by more than 20-fold in plasma. Although plasma leptin level is closely correlated with adiposity in most individuals (26Considine R.V. Sinha M.K. Heiman M.L. Kriauciunas A. Stephens T.W. Nyce M.R. Ohannesian J.P. Marco C.C. McKee L.J. Bauer T.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 324-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (5547) Google Scholar), our data demonstrate that its soluble receptor also plays key roles in determining the amount of leptin in circulation. This may be an important mechanism of regulating leptin's availability and bioactivity, because no post-translational modification of leptin occurs in vivo (27Cohen S.L. Halaas J.L. Friedman J.M. Chait B.T. Bennett L. Chang D. Hecht R. Collins F. Nature. 1996; 382: 589Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The simultaneous upsurge of both leptin and its soluble receptor during late stages of mouse pregnancy could be explained by the stabilization of leptin by its soluble receptor (19Gavrilova O. Barr V. Marcus-Samuels B. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30546-30551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Similarly, elevated leptin levels infa/fa pups compared with lean controls (fa/+ and +/+) may also be the combined effect of increased leptin expression and delayed clearance (28Zhang Y. Olbort M. Schwarzer K. Nuesslein-Hildesheim B. Nicolson M. Murphy E. Kowalski T.J. Schmidt I. Leibel R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mechanism governing the expression of soluble leptin receptor remains to be determined. The main site of expression of the soluble leptin receptor in vivo is not known. Previously, we failed to detect a signal for OB-Re when Northern blot analysis was performed (15Fei H. Okano H.J. Li C. Lee G.-H. Zhao C. Darnell R. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7001-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Available data have demonstrated that OB-Re is expressed by the placenta in mice. Its expression starts at day 14 of pregnancy, peaking just before parturition to about 40-fold the level found in nonpregnant mice (19Gavrilova O. Barr V. Marcus-Samuels B. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30546-30551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,29Yamaguchi M. Murakami T. Yasui Y. Otani S. Kawai M. Kishi K. Kurachi H. Shima K. Aono T. Murata Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In rats and humans, the pregnancy-associated rise of circulating leptin and its soluble receptor is relatively modest, achieving only a 2-fold increase versus a more than 40-fold increase in mice (30Lewandowski K. Horn R. O'Callaghan C.J. Dunlop D. Medley G.F. O'Hare P. Brabant G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Alternatively, soluble leptin receptor may also be produced by proteolytic cleavage of membrane-associated receptor. Why is leptin expression in the adipose tissue of db/db mice or ZDF rats increased? One possibility is the feedback inhibition of leptin via its receptor in wild type animals. It is known that OB-R is expressed on the surface of adipocytes (6Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar, 10Kim Y.B. Uotani S. Pierroz D.D. Flier J.S. Kahn B.B. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2328-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). At a certain threshold concentration, leptin may directly signal the adipocyte to stop its own production utilizing the receptor on the surface of these adipocytes. Alternatively, the central nervous system may also respond to leptin signaling by releasing neurotransmitters or neuropeptides to control the synthesis and release of leptin into circulation. A loss of these pathways due to leptin signaling deficiency in db/db mice or ZDF rats may contribute to the increased production of leptin. Our findings provided a plausible explanation of several unexplained observations regarding the level of circulating leptin. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the leptin mRNA level and protein level in some obese subjects. The leptin mRNA level is lower in obese subjects than expected based on differences of circulating leptin (31Ranganathan S. Maffei M. Kern P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 724-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This could be explained by the presence of increased soluble leptin receptor in these individuals. A support for this hypothesis came from a recent clinical study of patients with the same mutations of the leptin receptor that truncate OB-R 5′ of the transmembrane region. The truncated product resembles the soluble leptin receptor. As a result, circulating levels of leptin in these patients are very high (32Lahlou N. Clement K. Carel J.C. Vaisse C. Lotton C. Le Bihan Y. Basdevant A. Lebouc Y. Froguel P. Roger M. Guy-Grand B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1347-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), analogous to the elevation of leptin by its soluble receptor that we reported here. Similarly, the circulating level of leptin in C57BL/Ks db/db mice was unchanged after 15 days of food restriction, whereas its level became undetectable in lean mice 6 days after food restriction (24Maffei M. Halaas J. Ravussin E. Pratley R.E. Lee G.H. Zhang Y. Fei H. Kim S. Lallone R. Ranganathan S. Kern P.A. Friedman J.M. Nature Medicine. 1995; 1: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar). The persistence of circulating leptin in food-restricted db/db mice may also be regulated by its soluble leptin receptor. Alternatively, other leptin binding protein in serum may also play a role (33Houseknecht K.L. Mantzoros C.S. Kuliawat R. Hadro E. Flier J.S. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1638-1643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Landt M. Clin Chem. 2000; 46: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We did not observe a major change of food intake or body weight in Zucker lean rats overexpressing the soluble leptin receptor. Although OB-Re overexpression raises circulating leptin by manyfold, it is obviously inactive when bound to its soluble receptor. The slightly enhanced leptin effect on food intake and body weight inob/ob mice may be due to a higher level of free leptin in the presence of OB-Re overexpression. When a large pool of leptin-receptor complex is present in circulation, bound leptin is constantly released, resulting in a net increase of free leptin in plasma. Conversely, when new leptin release is low, such as during food restriction, free leptin may not decrease as rapidly if a pool of leptin-receptor complex preexists in plasma. Studies are underway to determine whether bound leptin affects leptin signal transduction through its long form receptor in vitro. The new mechanism in regulation of circulating leptin concentration reported here has added an additional level of complexity to the modulation of leptin's biological activity and availability. In the absence of leptin signaling, increased output of its soluble receptor results in an elevation of circulating leptin that is not from leptin overexpression. The leptin that is bound by its soluble receptor appeared to be inactive but may be made available for release into circulation and activate leptin responses. It remains to be determined what is the main site of expression of the soluble leptin receptor and how its own stability is regulated. A fuller understanding of these issues should shed more light on the mechanisms of action used by leptin in the control of so many distinct yet important physiological processes, ranging from appetite and body weight to fertility, immune function, and bone formation.

https://openalex.org/W2127580293,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a blinding retinal disease in which the photoreceptor cells degenerate. Mutations in the gene for retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) are a frequent cause of RP. The function of RPGR is not well understood, but it is thought to be a putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor for an unknown G protein. Ablation of the RPGR gene in mice suggested a role in maintaining the polarized distribution of opsin across the cilia. To investigate its function, we used a protein interaction screen to identify candidate proteins that may interact physiologically with RPGR. One such protein, designated RPGR-interacting protein (RPGRIP), is expressed specifically in rod and cone photoreceptors. It consists of an N-terminal region predicted to form coiled coil structures linked to a C-terminal tail that binds RPGR. In vivo, both proteins co-localize in the photoreceptor connecting cilia. RPGRIP is stably associated with the ciliary axoneme independent of RPGR and is resistant to extraction under conditions that partially solubilized other cytoskeletal components. When over-expressed in heterologous cell lines, RPGRIP appears in insoluble punctate and filamentous structures. These data suggest that RPGRIP is a structural component of the ciliary axoneme, and one of its functions is to anchor RPGR within the cilium. RPGRIP is the only protein known to localize specifically in the photoreceptor connecting cilium. As such, it is a candidate gene for human photoreceptor disease.

Neither the disease mechanism nor the physiological function of RPGR is fully understood. Analyses of the RPGR protein sequence, however, provide some clues. The N-terminal domain of RPGR shares sequence similarity with the regulator of chromatin condensation (RCC1), a nuclear protein that catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange for the small GTPase Ran. RCC1 has an essential role in regulating nuclear import and export (4Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) by catalyzing the GTP exchange reaction for Ran. The presence of an RCC1 homology domain thus raises the possibility that RPGR may also regulate intracellular transport in photoreceptors via an unknown G protein. retinitis pigmentosa retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator RPGR-interacting protein regulator of chromatin condensation rapid amplification of cDNA ends glutathioneS-transferase phosphate-buffered saline dimethyl pimelimidate adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate kilobase pair(s) enhanced green fluorescent protein RPGR is ubiquitously expressed. In photoreceptor cells, however, it is concentrated in the connecting cilium (5Hong D.H. Pawlyk B.S. Shang J. Sandberg M.A. Berson E.L. Li T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3649-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We have previously studied the retinal phenotype of RPGR knockout mice (5Hong D.H. Pawlyk B.S. Shang J. Sandberg M.A. Berson E.L. Li T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3649-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Photoreceptor defects are detected at an early age in mice lacking RPGR. Cone photoreceptors exhibit ectopic localization of cone opsin (the photopigment in cones similar to rhodopsin in rods) in the cell body and synapse. Although ectopic distribution of rhodopsin is not apparent in rods by immunofluorescence, there is nevertheless a reduced level of rhodopsin in the outer segments. Subsequently, both cone and rod photoreceptors degenerate. These data are consistent with the proposal that RPGR plays a role in maintaining the polarized protein distribution across the connecting cilium by facilitating directional transport or restricting redistribution (5Hong D.H. Pawlyk B.S. Shang J. Sandberg M.A. Berson E.L. Li T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3649-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To investigate the in vivo function of RPGR and the disease mechanism associated with RPGR mutations, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify potential interacting partners of RPGR. This effort led to the discovery of a novel protein that interacts with the RCC1 domain of RPGR. After substantial completion of this work, two reports (6Boylan J.P. Wright A.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2085-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Roepman R. Bernoud-Hubac N. Schick D.E. Maugeri A. Berger W. Ropers H.-H. Cremers F.P.M. Ferreira P.A. Hum. Mol.

Comparison of the sequences shows that the protein we have identified is the murine ortholog of the bovine and human RPGR-interacting protein. Adopting their designation, we refer to this protein in the present report as RPGRIP (for RPGR interacting protein). We further demonstrate that RPGRIP is a structural component of the ciliary axoneme. We propose that RPGRIP serves as a scaffold to anchor regulatory complexes including RPGR within the connecting cilium. A GAL4-based two-hybrid system was employed. Cloning vectors, yeast host cells, and reagents were purchased from CLONTECH Laboratory (Palo Alto, CA). A retinal cDNA library was constructed using poly(A)+RNA from C57BL/6 mouse retinas. The cDNAs were inserted into the pACT2 plasmid vector downstream from the GAL4 activation domain. The resulting cDNA library contained ∼1 × 106independent colonies. The bait plasmid was constructed by inserting a cDNA encoding the bait protein into the pGBKT7 plasmid vector downstream from the GAL4-DNA binding domain. The bait protein consisted of the RCC1 homology domain of murine RPGR (residues 39–460). Reference to the numbering of the RPGR sequence in this report is based on a previously published sequence (GenBankTM accession number AAC40190) (8Yan D. Swain P.K. Breuer D. Tucker R.M. Wu W. Fujita R. Rehemtulla A. Burke D. Swaroop A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19656-19663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A sequential transformation protocol was used to introduce bait and library plasmids into yeast. Yeast AH109 cells were first transformed with the bait plasmid, and the bait protein expression was verified by immunoblotting. Competent cells were then prepared from a yeast clone harboring the bait plasmid and transformed with the library plasmids. Positive colonies were isolated based on their ability to express nutritional markers HIS3 and ADE2 and thelacZ reporter, driven by different Gal4-responsive promoters to minimize false positives due to fortuitous activation of a particular promoter. To rule out bait-independent activation, the candidate plasmids isolated from the initial screen were co-transformed with an irrelevant control bait and shown not to activate the nutritional markers. To isolate cDNAs encompassing the entire coding region of RPGRIP, one of the cDNA clones isolated from the initial screen was used as a probe to screen a second mouse retinal cDNA library constructed in a λ phage vector. Multiple overlapping clones covering the full-length coding region were obtained. The extreme 5′ untranslated sequence not represented in the phage clones were obtained by performing the RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) procedure using reagents fromCLONTECH. Sequences from the RACE product and from the phage cDNA clones were joined to yield the final cDNA sequence of RPGRIP (GenBankTM accession no. AY008297). Total RNA isolated from a variety of mouse tissues was separated on denaturing agarose gels, blotted to nylon membranes, and hybridized to radiolabeled probes under high stringency conditions, with the final wash carried out in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 70 °C. Four different probes were used in separate experiments to determine the origins of the bands seen in different tissues. P1 was a double-stranded DNA probe spanning ∼1000 base pairs of the coding region near the C terminus (beginning at amino acid codon 1025) plus 750 base pairs of the 3′ untranslated region. P2 was also a double-stranded DNA probe located upstream from P1 (corresponding to codons 77–773). The P3 and P4 probes spanned the same region as P1 but were synthesized in vitro using T7 or T3 RNA polymerases as single-stranded RNA probes in either the sense (P3) or the antisense (P4) orientation. The locations of the probes are shown at the bottom of Fig. 1. A polyclonal RPGRIP antibody was generated by immunizing a rabbit with a truncated recombinant RPGRIP. A cDNA fragment corresponding to amino acid codons 991–1331(inclusive of the RPGR binding domain) of RPGRIP was inserted into the pGEX4T-2 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and expressed inEscherichia coli as a GST fusion protein. The GST moiety was removed from the purified fusion protein by thrombin digestion and the purified RPGRIP fragment used as the immunogen. Affinity purification of the specific antibodies was carried out with the same immunogen immobilized in an AminoLink column (Pierce). A polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal 253 amino acids of mouse RPGR (RPGR-253) was described previously (5Hong D.H. Pawlyk B.S. Shang J. Sandberg M.A. Berson E.L. Li T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3649-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of RPGR is variable because of alternative splicing (3Vervoort R. Lennon A. Bird A.C. Tulloch B. Axton R. Miano M.G. Meindl A. Meitinger T. Ciccodicola A. Wright A.F. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To follow all the major variants, the RPGR-253 antibody was further fractionated by affinity chromatography using as ligands recombinant proteins representing smaller fragments within the original immunogen. One such fraction, RPGR-S1, would be specific for residues 494–563 common in all variants. RPGR-S1 was used for immunofluorescence detection of RPGR in this study. Antibodies against actin, γ-tubulin, and acetylated α-tubulin (clone 6–11B-1) were obtained from Sigma. Antibody against a mouse tektin (tektin-t) (9Iguchi N. Tanaka H. Fujii T. Tamura K. Kaneko Y. Nojima H. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Yoshitake Nishimune (Osaka University). This antibody recognizes an 86-kDa tektin specific in testes as well as a 60-kDa tektin-like protein in lungs. 2Y. Nishimune, personal communication. For immunoblotting, samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and were developed by ECL or color substrates. Detection of RPGR and RPGRIP in the retina by immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on frozen sections. Optimal labeling was obtained only if the mouse eyes was unfixed before freezing and sectioning. Freshly cut sections, 5–10 μm in thickness, were post-fixed on slides for 1–2 min with 2% formaldehyde/PBS, blocked in 5% normal goat serum/PBS, and incubated with primary and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. After the final wash, slides were stained with the nuclear dye Hoechst 33342 and mounted in aqueous mounting media. Dissociated photoreceptor cells were prepared and stained as described (10Muresan V. Joshi H.C. Besharse J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To perform immunofluorescence microscopy on transiently transfected cells, cells grown on coverslips were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 5 min, washed with 1% Triton X-100/PBS, blocked in 5% goat serum/PBS, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa488 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed as above and mounted on slides in ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes). In experiments utilizing immunostaining, pre-immune serum or non-immune normal rabbit IgG was included, as appropriate, for negative controls. Mouse eyes were fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 1 h. Retinas were dissected out, soaked in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thin (70 nm) sections were cut on a Leica cryo-ultramicrotome and collected on Formvar-coated nickel grids. Grids were incubated sequentially with 0.15 m glycine/PBS, TTBS (Tween/Tris-buffered saline) supplemented with 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and blocked in 5% goat serum, 1% fish gelatin in TTBS. Incubation with the primary antibody diluted in the blocking solution proceeded overnight at room temperature. After washing in TTBS, grids were incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 5 nm gold and washed again. To perform silver enhancement, a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 1 nm gold particles was used instead. Sections were then treated with the Aurion R-Gent silver enhancement reagents (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 8 min. Sections were post-stained with 4% uranyl acetate, washed through drops of methyl cellulose, and air dried. Sections were viewed and photographed on a JEOL 100CX electron microscope. Purified GST-RPGRIP (residues 991–1331) fusion protein and the native RPGR present in mouse brain lysate were used in the pull-down assays. Mouse brain was mechanically homogenized in a lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. GST-RPGRIP or GST (negative control) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with the indicated amounts of brain lysates adjusted to the same final volume in lysis buffer at 4 °C overnight. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. COS-7 cells were maintained in dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection was carried out using the Geneshuttle 40 reagent (Quantum Biotechnologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To express RPGRIP, three expression plasmids were constructed. The full-length coding region of RPGRIP was inserted into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate the pRPGRIP plasmid for expression of untagged RPGRIP. To generate recombinant RPGRIP that were tagged at the N terminus with either a Myc or an EGFP epitope, coding sequences for myc or EGFP were introduced into pRPGRIP upstream and in frame with the RPGRIP coding sequence, generating plasmids pMyc-RPGRIP and pEGFP-RPGRIP, respectively. For co-immunoprecipitation of recombinant RPGRIPs, COS cells were co-transfected with pmyc-RPGRIP and pEGFP-RPGRIP. After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in an immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture). The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Immunoblot analyses indicated that about 1–5% of the total RPGRIP expressed in COS cells was recovered in this supernatant. Immunoprecipitation was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C by incubating the cleared lysate with either an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10) and anti-mouse IgG-agarose or with an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) and protein A-agarose. After washing, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting with the anti-RPGRIP antibody. For chemical cross-linking, cells transiently transfected with pRPGRIP were washed with PBS and incubated with the indicated amount (Fig. 6 B) of dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) in 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8.2) for 1 h at 4 °C. The reaction was terminated with a quenching buffer (100 mmTris, pH 7.4, in PBS). After removal of the quenching buffer, the cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The procedure consisted of collecting and extracting the inner and outer segment enriched fraction produced by shaking freshly dissected retinas in a homogenization buffer (11Papermaster D. Dryer W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Under Nomarski optics, these preparations were seen to contain outer segments linked to the connecting cilia with variable portions of inner segment membranes attached (10Muresan V. Joshi H.C. Besharse J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remainder of the retinas usually remained as intact sheets, thus providing an enrichment of photoreceptor-derived material in the suspension. Unless otherwise noted, tissues were kept on ice or at 4 °C during the procedure. In a typical experiment, 16 freshly dissected mouse retinas were vortexed for 1 min in 0.6 ml of homogenization buffer (34% sucrose, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmiodoacetamide, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). The suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min to remove large debris. The supernatant was diluted 1:3 with a dilution buffer (homogenization buffer without sucrose) and centrifuged again at 170,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was removed to fresh tubes and was designated the cytosol fraction. The pellet was resuspended in the dilution buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Aliquots of 100 μl each were spun at 170,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was pooled and designated as the detergent-soluble fraction and the pellets the axoneme-enriched fraction. Although the scarcity of mouse retinal tissues precluded the use of sucrose gradient centrifugation, which would have yielded a cleaner axonemal preparation (12Horst C.J. Johnson L.V. Besharse J.C. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 17: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the enrichment of γ- and acetylated α-tubulins and tektin filaments in our preparation validates its designation as axoneme-enriched (see Fig. 7). Pellets were extracted for 30 min at room temperature in the dilution buffer supplemented with one of the following reagents: 0.5% SDS, 1m NaCl, 6 m urea, 0.5% saponin, 10 mm Mg2+-ATP, or 2.5 mm AMP-PNP. Samples were centrifuged again at 170,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To identify interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse retinal cDNA library using the RCC1 homology domain of RPGR as bait. From among 106 co-transformants, six independent clones were isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that one clone coded for the δ subunit of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDEδ), which had previously been reported (13Linari M. Ueffing M. Manson F. Wright A. Meitinger T. Becker J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The remaining clones contained overlapping cDNAs apparently derived from the same gene. To obtain the full-length coding sequence, we screened a second mouse retinal cDNA library constructed in a λ phage vector using one of the original cDNA isolates as a probe. The longest among the second set of cDNA clones contained an open reading frame of 1331 amino acid codons (Fig.1). The conceptually translated polypeptide has a predicted molecular weight of 152 kDa, is rich in glutamic acid residues, resulting in a rather acidic isoelectric point (pI = 4.8), and is highly hydrophilic with no predicted membrane spanning regions. This protein is referred to as RPGRIP, for RPGR-interacting protein, following the designation given in two recent reports (6Boylan J.P. Wright A.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2085-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Roepman R. Bernoud-Hubac N. Schick D.E. Maugeri A. Berger W. Ropers H.-H. Cremers F.P.M. Ferreira P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2095-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Search of the data base identified a BAC clone (GenBankTM accession no. Al135744) that encodes the human ortholog of RPGRIP. This places the human RPGRIP on chromosome 14q11. The next closely related sequence to RPGRIP in the data base is a human gene of unknown function (KIAA1005; GenBankTM accession no.AB023222). A comparison of the overlapping cDNA clones from the initial yeast two-hybrid screen localized the RPGR binding domain within the C-terminal 300 residues. A 90 amino acid linker region consisting mostly of glutamic acid residues separates the RPGR-binding domain from the rest of the polypeptide. A stretch of 340 amino acid residues near the N terminus (amino acid 210–550) is predicted to form a coiled coil structure (14Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). This region also exhibits sequence similarity to the coiled coil region of several motor proteins, a microtubule-binding protein (CLIP-170/restin), and intermediate filament binding proteins (desmoplakin I and II). Downstream from the coiled coil region lies a C2-like domain, found in several protein families with a role in phospholipid binding (15Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). To confirm that the coding sequence of RPGRIP was full-length at the 5′ end, the 5′ RACE procedure was performed. Sequences of the RACE products provided an additional 30 base pairs at the 5′ end but did not further extend the open reading frame. Subsequent immunoblotting analyses showed that the native RPGRIP from mouse retinas and a recombinant protein from transfected COS cells expressing the 1331 open reading frame had the same apparent molecular weight on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A), lending further support to the claim that this open reading frame is full-length. The apparent molecular mass of RPGRIP is 210 kDa, larger than the predicted 150 kDa. The reduced motility of the polypeptide on SDS-PAGE may be accounted for by the high glutamic acid content (14%) in this protein. Confirmation of a direct interaction between RPGR and RPGRIP was provided by an in vitro GST pull-down assay. A GST-RPGRIP fusion protein containing the RPGR binding domain was shown to co-sediment with RPGR from tissue lysate in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the recombinant RPGRIP interacts with native RPGR in vitro. A demonstration of the interaction between two native proteins by co-immunoprecipitation was not technically feasible because RPGRIP could not be solubilized under native conditions (see below). The tissue expression pattern of RPGRIP was examined by Northern blotting (Fig.3 A) and immunoblotting (Fig.3B). RNAs from a number of mouse tissues were examined. Initially a double-stranded DNA probe P1 (see bottom of Fig. 1) revealed a doublet band around 10 kb in the retina only and a 4.4-kb band that is more widely distributed. To determine which band(s) represented the authentic RPGRIP transcript, three additional probes were synthesized and used to probe Northern blots. Probe P2 was located upstream from P1 and entirely within the coding region. Probe P2 detected the 10-kb doublet but not the 4.4-kb band. Furthermore, the 10-kb doublet was present only in the wild type retina but not in the adult rdmouse retina in which the photoreceptors had degenerated, indicating a photoreceptor-specific origin of these transcripts. Thus, if the 4.4-kb band represented an RPGRIP transcript, it would have only the capacity to encode a protein comprising essentially the RPGR binding domain alone. Existence of such a variant would have functional implications. Alternatively, this band might be derived from an overlapping but otherwise unrelated gene. A data base search indicated that the gene for a chromatin-specific transcription elongation factor (16Orphanides G. Wu W. Lane W. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1999; 400: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) overlaps with RPGRIP at the 3′ end and is transcribed in the opposite orientation. To explore the latter possibility, probes P3 and P4, covering the same region as P1 but synthesized as single-stranded RNA probes in the antisense (P3) or sense (P4) orientation, were used to probe Northern blots. P3 detected only the 10-kb doublet, whereas P4 detected only the 4.4-kb band. This finding confirmed that the 4.40-kb band was derived from an overlapping gene transcribed in the reverse orientation. Therefore the 10-kb doublet represents the authentic RPGRIP transcripts, and both should encode the full-length RPGRIP protein. The size difference is likely to reside in the 3′ untranslated region because of alternative use of transcription termination signals. Finally, probe P2 detected a much smaller transcript (3 kb) found only in the testis. The functional significance of this variant, if any, is not clear. It should be noted that the testis is thought to express irrelevant transcripts which, in somatic tissues, may be tightly regulated (17Ivell R. Int. J. Androl. 1992; 15: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of RPGRIP protein indicates a similar photoreceptor-specific expression (Fig. 3 B). A polyclonal antibody raised against the RPGR binding domain of RPGRIP detects the 210-kDa polypeptide in the retina but not in a variety of other tissues. The RPGRIP band is also present in the retinas of RPGR knockout mice. Photoreceptors are highly polarized sensory neurons with their outer segments, inner segments, nuclei, and synapses organized into distinct layers on retinal sections, which makes it relatively simple to determine the subcellular localization of a protein on retinal sections. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we previously determined that RPGR is localized in the connecting cilia of rod and cone photoreceptors (5Hong D.H. Pawlyk B.S. Shang J. Sandberg M.A. Berson E.L. Li T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3649-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular location of RPGRIP in photoreceptor cells, we performed immunostaining of retinal sections using the polyclonal RPGRIP antibody. The data show RPGRIP is located at the junction between the inner and outer segments (Fig.4 A), suggesting a localization in the connecting cilia. This staining pattern is identical to that of RPGR (Fig. 4 A). The RPGRIP localization remains the same in the absence of RPGR (Fig. 4 A). This would suggest that RPGRIP is independently targeted to the connecting cilium, whereas RPGR is anchored to this location via its interaction with RPGRIP. Immuno"
https://openalex.org/W1980679007,"Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that transports a range of hydrophobic xenobiotics, as well as relatively hydrophilic organic anion conjugates. The protein is present at high levels in testicular Leydig and Sertoli cells. Studies with knockout mice suggest that MRP1 may protect germ cells from exposure to some cytotoxic xenobiotics, but potential endobiotic substrates in this organ have not been identified. Previously, we have shown certain D-ring, but not A-ring, estrogen glucuronides can act as competitive inhibitors of MRP1 mediated transport, suggesting that they are potential substrates for the protein. In the case of 17μ-estradiol-17μ-d-glucuronide, this has been confirmed by direct transport studies. The Leydig cell is the major site of estrogen conjugation in the testis. However, the principal products of conjugation are A-ring estrogen sulfates, which are then effluxed from the cell by an unknown transporter. To determine whether MRP1/mrp1 could fulfill this function, we used membrane vesicles from MRP1-transfected HeLa cells to assess this possibility. We found that estradiol and estrone 3-sulfate alone were poor competitors of MRP1-mediated transport of the cysteinyl leukotriene, leukotriene C4. However, in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH), their inhibitory potency was markedly increased. Direct transport studies using [3H]estrone 3-sulfate confirmed that the conjugated estrogen could be efficiently transported (Km = 0.73 μm,Vmax = 440 pmol mg−1protein min−1), but only in the presence of either GSH or the nonreducing alkyl derivative, S-methyl GSH. In contrast to previous studies using vincristine as a substrate, we detected no reciprocal increase in MRP1-mediated GSH transport. These results provide the first example of GSH-stimulated, MRP1-mediated transport of a potential endogenous substrate and expand the range of MRP1 substrates whose transport is stimulated by GSH to include certain hydrophilic conjugated endobiotics, in addition to previously identified hydrophobic xenobiotics.

The first substrate shown to be actively transported by MRP1 using inside-out membrane vesicles was the glutathione-conjugated leukotriene, LTC4 (3Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P.C.

Since then, the spectrum of molecules transported by MRP1 has been extended to include many other GSH conjugates, as well as several glucuronate and sulfate conjugates (5Loe D.W. Almquist K.C.

However, using an in vitro membrane vesicle system unmodified forms of the natural product drugs to which MRP1 confers resistance are not directly transported by this protein, although primary active transport of some of them has been observed in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH) (8Loe D.W.

MRP1/mrp1 is highly expressed in the sex hormone-producing Leydig cells of the human and mouse testis (16Flens M.J. Zaman G.J. van, d. V Izquierdo M.A. Schroeijers A.B. Scheffer G.L. van der, G.

Thus, the testes of mrp1-deficient mice treated with the anticancer drug, etoposide phosphate, showed aberrant spermatogenesis with no sign of meiotic divisions and an increased number of prematurely released round germ cells. In contrast, the same treatment of the wild-type mice produced only a partially distorted spermatogenesis and meiotic divisions still occurred. In addition to a protective role with respect to xenobiotic exposure, the relatively high levels of MRP1 in Leydig cells may also serve to protect the testis from the potential feminizing effects of endogenously produced estrogen conjugates. Estrogen is synthesized in the testis and is required for normal testicular function, as revealed by studies of mice in which the estrogen receptor α or P450 aromatase genes have been disrupted (20Eddy E.M.

MRP1 has been shown to transport certain estrogen glucuronides but the major metabolite in Leydig cells is estrogen sulfate produced by estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) (5Loe D.W. Almquist K.C.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5006-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Using 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate as a sulfate donor, this sulfation takes place at the 3-hydroxyl group of the parent molecule, generating the more hydrophilic estrogen 3-sulfate. The relative hydrophilicity of estrogen 3-sulfate prevents its ready diffusion across the plasma membrane. Thus, it has been assumed that an export pump is involved in its efflux from the cell. Testicular expression of estrogen sulfotransferase is mainly localized in Leydig cells and is regulated by luteinizing hormone via modulation of cAMP levels (23Song W.C. Qian Y.M. Sun X. Negishi M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5006-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Qian Y.M. Song W.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the testes of 9–12-month-oldest −/− mice displayed Leydig cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia, as well as seminiferous tubule disruption. 2Y. Qian, X. Sun, X. Li, and W. Song, submitted for publication. The colocalization of MRP1 and estrogen sulfotransferase in the testis prompted us to investigate whether estrogen sulfates were also substrates of MRP1. We found that estrogen sulfates alone were very poor substrates and competed poorly for transport and binding of the high affinity MRP1 substrate LTC4. However, in the presence of GSH, their inhibitory potency was significantly increased and GSH-enhanced direct transport of [3H]estrone sulfate could be easily detected. These results provide the first examples of potential endogenous MRP1 substrates that depend on the presence of GSH for efficient transport and the first examples of conjugated endobiotics that display this type of dependence. [6,7-3H]Estrone sulfate (53 Ci mmol−1), [2,4,6,7-3H]estradiol (87.6 Ci mmol−1), and [glycine-2-3H]GSH (42 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; [14,15-3H]-LTC4 (38 Ci mmol−1) and fluorographic reagent Amplify® were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Estrogen 3-sulfates, nucleotides, GSH, verapamil,S-methyl GSH, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), 2-mercaptoethanol, and DTT were purchased from Sigma. Estrogen 3-sulfates were dissolved with H2O to prepare stock solutions at 10 mm and diluted with transport buffer. The MRP1-specific murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) QCRL-1, QCRL-2, QCRL-3, and QCRL-4 have been described previously (25Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C.

Both T5 and C1 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% defined bovine calf serum and maintained in 400 μg ml−1 Geneticin (G418). HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared as described (8Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were covered with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 0.25 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors and frozen at −70 °C overnight. The cells were then thawed and disrupted by N2 cavitation (10-min equilibrium at 200 p.s.i.). EDTA was added to 1 mmbefore centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris. To increase the yield of membrane vesicles, the resulting pellet was washed once with 5 ml of transport buffer (50 mmTris-HCl and 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.5) and centrifuged again. The supernatants were pooled, layered over 35% (w/w) sucrose in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The interface was collected in washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 25 mm sucrose) and followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The membrane pellet resuspended in transport buffer and passed 10 times through a 27.5-gauge needle for vesicle formation. The membrane vesicles were then aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use. ATP-dependent transport of [3H]LTC4 into the inside-out membrane vesicles was measured by a rapid filtration technique (8Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In standard transport assays, 2.5 μg of membrane vesicles were used in a 25-μl reaction volume and incubated at 23 °C in the presence of 50 nm [3H]LTC4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 4 mm ATP or AMP in transport buffer. Where indicated, GSH was added to 1 mm unless otherwise stated. Uptake was stopped by rapid dilution in ice-cold transport buffer and followed by filtration through glass fiber (type A/E) filters (Gelman Sciences, Dorval, Quebec, Canada) that had been presoaked overnight at 4 °C in transport buffer. All of the data had been corrected for the amount of [3H]LTC4that remained bound to the filter in the absence of the membrane vesicles, which was usually less than 5–10% of the total radioactivity. For kinetic analysis of LTC4 transport in the presence of estrogen sulfates and/or GSH, LTC4 was included at concentrations ranging from 16 nm to 1 μm and ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake was determined as above. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]estrone 3-sulfate was measured by rapid filtration as above, except that the incubation temperature was 37 °C and substrate concentration was 300 nm unless otherwise indicated. Uptake was stopped after 60 s or at the time indicated by rapid dilution in ice-cold buffer, and the reaction mixture was filtered through glass fiber filters. Where indicated, MRP1-specific mAbs were added to 10 μg ml−1 and preincubated with membrane vesicles on ice for 1 h. All data were corrected by subtracting nonspecific binding of [3H]estrone 3-sulfate to the filter, which was usually less than 5% of the total radioactivity. For kinetic analysis of GSH-enhanced estrone 3-sulfate transport in the absence or presence of LTC4, estrone 3-sulfate was included at concentrations ranging from 125 nm to 16 μm and ATP-dependent [3H]estrone 3-sulfate uptake was determined as above. Transport of [3H] GSH into the membrane vesicles was also measured by rapid filtration as above. In a 50-μl reaction volume, 22 μg of membrane vesicle protein were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in the presence of 100 μm [3H]GSH (80 or 288 nCi/reaction), 10 mm DTT, 10 mmMgCl2, and 4 mm ATP or AMP in transport buffer. Estrone 3-sulfate or estradiol 3-sulfate was added to several concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 20 μm. Verapamil was used a positive control for stimulation of [3H]GSH transport (28Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 530-538PubMed Google Scholar) and was added to 100 μm. All data were corrected by subtracting the amount of [3H]GSH that remained bound to the filter in the presence of 4 mm AMP, which was usually less than 5% of the total radioactivity. Membrane vesicles (75 μg of protein in 35 μl) were incubated with [3H]LTC4 (0.25 μCi, 200 nm) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of estrone 3-sulfate or estradiol 3-sulfate at room temperature for 10 min and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were alternately irradiated for 30 s at 312 nm in a Stratalinker, followed by snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen, for a total of 10 min. Radiolabeled vesicles were solubilized in Laemmli's buffer and analyzed on a 7.5% gel by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was fixed in isopropanol:water:acetic acid (25:65:10) for 30 min and then soaked in Amplify for 15–20 min. After drying under vacuum at 80 °C, the gel was placed in close contact with x-ray film at −70 °C for 2 weeks (8Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol.

The expression vectors pCDNA3 containing mouse estrogen-sulfotransferase cDNA (pCDNA3-est) and pCEBV7 containing human MRP1 cDNA (pCEBV7-MRP1) were described previously (29Qian Y.M. Deng C. Song W.C.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar), and transfection was performed with FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HEK293 cells (2 × 106) were seeded into each T75 flask and transfected on the following day with a mixture of 40 μl of FuGENE™ reagent and 10 μg of pCDNA3-est or together with 10 μg of pCEBV7-MRP1. After 66 h, the cells were harvested. Half of the cells were then used for steroid accumulation experiments and the other half for an EST activity assay. [3H]Estradiol sulfate accumulation was initiated by addition of [3H]estradiol to a final concentration of 500 nm to a suspension of untransfected or transfected cells (5 × 105 cells in 100 μl of serum-free DMEM) at 37 °C and stopped at 20 min by adding 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline., solubilized in 200 μl of 0.5% SDS, and extracted with 400 μl of ethyl acetate. The aqueous phase was taken for liquid scintillation counting, and 3H-labeled aqueous soluble steroid accumulation was expressed as dpm/106 cells. The procedures for preparation of cytosolic proteins and EST activity assay were the same as described previously (29Qian Y.M. Deng C. Song W.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 555-560PubMed Google Scholar, 31Song W.C. Moore R. McLachlan J.A. Negishi M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2477-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine whether estrogen sulfates were potential substrates for MRP1, we initially tested the ability of estrone and estradiol 3-sulfate to compete for transport of the high affinity MRP1 substrate, LTC4. Neither estrogen sulfate alone was a potent inhibitor of [3H]LTC4 uptake by vesicles prepared from MRP1-transfected HeLa T5 (HeLa-MRP) cells (Fig.1, A and B). At lower concentrations of the conjugated estrogens (20–200 nm), a reproducible 25–50% increase in the rate of LTC4 transport was observed with significant inhibition of transport being observed when concentrations of the estrogen sulfates reached more than 20 μm. Previously, GSH has been shown to increase the inhibitory potency of some hydrophobic xenobiotics, which are themselves poor competitive inhibitors of LTC4transport (8Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). However, no effect on the transport of conjugated endobiotics has been reported. We found that addition of 1 mm GSH markedly increased the inhibitory potency of the sulfated estrogens, resulting in a decrease in IC50 values from 31 and 50 μm to 0.2 and 0.3 μm, for estrone sulfate and estradiol sulfate, respectively (Fig. 1,A and B). To determine whether inhibition of LTC4 transport by the estrogen sulfates was competitive, Eadie-Hofstee plots of LTC4 transport in the absence or presence of 2 μm estrogen sulfate were constructed. At this concentration, estrone sulfate alone inhibited [3H]LTC4 transport by ∼10% while estradiol sulfate stimulated transport by ∼25% (Fig. 1, A andB). However, in the presence of 1 mm GSH, both estrone and estradiol sulfate behaved as competitive inhibitors of [3H]LTC4 transport, with apparentKi values of 0.45 and 0.38 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). To determine whether inhibition of LTC4 transport was the result of direct competition for binding, we examined the ability of the conjugated estrogens to inhibit [3H]LTC4 photolabeling of MRP1 in T5 membrane vesicles in the absence or presence of GSH. GSH alone weakly inhibited photolabeling with [3H]LTC4 (Fig.2 A), decreasing labeling by 20–25% at a concentration of 1 mm. Low concentrations of estrone or estradiol sulfate alone (0.2 μm) resulted in small but reproducible increases in [3H]LTC4photolabeling of MRP1 (Fig. 2 B), while higher concentrations either decreased (20 μm) or abolished (200 μm) labeling. The enhanced photolabeling of MRP1 observed with low concentrations (0.2–2 μm) of sulfated estrogens alone was not apparent in the presence of 1 mm GSH (Fig.2 B), and [3H]LTC4 labeling was completely abolished in the presence of 1 mm GSH and 20 μm estrone sulfate or estradiol sulfate (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, the effect of GSH could be fully mimicked by a nonreducing GSH derivative, S-methyl GSH (Fig.2 C), indicating that GSH-enhanced inhibition of [3H]LTC4 labeling of MRP1 was not caused by a change in the redox state of the protein. To determine whether it was possible to detect ATP-dependent MRP1-mediated transport of the estrogen sulfates, we determined the rate of [3H]estrone 3-sulfate (300 nm) uptake using T5 membrane vesicles. The rate of ATP-dependent uptake of estrone 3-sulfate was very low (5–6 pmol mg−1 protein min−1). However, an approximate 10-fold increase in the rate of transport was observed when 1 mmGSH was present (Fig. 3 A). GSH-stimulated transport was linear for up to 60 s at a rate of ∼60 pmol mg−1 protein min−1 with an initial concentration of 300 nm estrone 3-sulfate. In the presence of 4 mmAMP and 1 mm GSH, estrone 3-sulfate uptake by the vesicles was 2–4 pmol mg−1 protein min−1. ATP-dependent and GSH-stimulated estrone 3-sulfate transport was not detected with membrane vesicles prepared from vector-transfected HeLa C1 control cells (Fig. 3 B). To confirm that vesicle-associated estrone sulfate was indicative of transport into the vesicle lumen, rather than surface or intramembrane binding, we determined the effect of increasing extravesicular osmolarity. As expected for true transport, the amount of vesicle-associated [3H]estrone sulfate decreased with increasing concentrations of sucrose extrapolating to zero at infinite osmolarity (Fig. 4 A). To confirm that transport was MRP1-mediated, we used previously characterized conformation-dependent MRP1-specific mAbs, which have been shown to inhibit MRP1-mediated transport of LTC4 and other MRP1 substrates (8Loe D.W.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As observed for other MRP1 substrates, three mAbs that recognize distinct conformation-dependent epitopes in the first (mAbs QCRL-2 and QCRL-3) and second (mAb QCRL-4) nucleotide-binding domains of MRP1 (26Hipfner D.R. Mao Q. Qiu W. Leslie E.M. Gao M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15420-15426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) completely inhibited ATP-dependent and GSH-stimulated estrone sulfate transport by T5 vesicles (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, mAb QCRL-1, which recognizes a linear epitope in the linker region of MRP1(33), had no inhibitory effect. To determine the kinetic parameters of estrone sulfate transport and the effect of GSH, rates of ATP-dependent uptake in the presence and absence of 1 mm GSH were determined at several concentrations of estrone 3-sulfate (125 nm to 16 μm) to obtain Km andVmax values (Fig. 3 C). A nonlinear regression analysis of the data yielded an apparentKm of 0.73 ± 0.17 μm for estrone 3-sulfate and a Vmax of 440 ± 27 pmol mg−1 protein min−1 in the presence of GSH, and an apparentKm of 4.2 ± 1.1 μm for estrone 3-sulfate and a Vmax of 107 ± 10 pmol mg−1 protein min−1 in its absence. The insetshows an Eadie-Hofstee transformation of the data (Fig. 3 C). When the nonreducing S-methyl GSH was used in place of GSH, 1 mm S-methyl GSH stimulated estrone 3-sulfate uptake by T5 membrane vesicles, somewhat more effectively than the same concentration of GSH (Fig.5 A). In contrast, the sulfhydryl reducing agents DTT (10 mm) and 2-mercaptoethanol (5 mm) and oxidized glutathione GSSG (0.05 mm) had no effect on estrone 3-sulfate transport. Since S-methyl GSH appeared to be a more potent stimulator of estrone sulfate transport than GSH, rates of transport were determined as a function of GSH or S-methyl GSH concentration (Fig. 5 B). Both compounds exhibited a similar concentration dependence with 50% of maximal stimulation being observed at a concentration of ∼0.5 mm. However, the maximal rate of estrone sulfate transport obtained withS-methyl GSH was ∼2.5-fold greater than with GSH itself. Since we found that estrogen sulfates competitively inhibited MRP1-mediated [3H]LTC4 transport in the presence of GSH, we determined whether the reverse was also true. Thus, the ability of LTC4 to inhibit [3H]estrone 3-sulfate transport by MRP1 was examined in T5 vesicles. GSH-enhanced estrone 3-sulfate uptake was inhibited by LTC4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6 A). An Eadie-Hofstee plot of estrone 3-sulfate uptake in the presence of 0.2 μmLTC4 indicated that the inhibition was competitive, with an apparent Ki (LTC4) of 0.2 μm (Fig. 6 B). Previous studies of the GSH stimulated transport of the unconjugated xenobiotic vincristine revealed a reciprocal stimulation of GSH transport by the drug, suggesting a cotransport mechanism (10Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, verapamil was shown to markedly stimulate GSH transport by MRP1, but in this case no transport of verapamil could be detected (28Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 530-538PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined the ability of the estrogen sulfates to stimulate GSH transport using verapamil as a positive control. As expected, verapamil at 100 μm significantly enhanced GSH transport by about 3-fold. In the first set of experiments, 80 nCi of [3H]GSH was used in each reaction and no stimulation of GSH transport was observed with either estrogen sulfate at 0.2 and 2 μm. A modes"

SAPKs relay signals in response to various extracellular stimuli, including environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines. In mammalian cells, two distinct classes of SAPKs have been identified: the c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3) and the p38 MAPKs (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) (1Garrington T.P.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Activation of SAPKs requires phosphorylation at conserved tyrosine and threonine residues in the catalytic domain. This phosphorylation is mediated by dual specificity protein kinases, which are the members of the MAPK kinase (MKK) family. Of these, MKK3 and MKK6 phosphorylate p38, MKK7 phosphorylates JNK, and MKK4 can phosphorylate either. These MKKs, in turn, are activated by phosphorylation of conserved serine and threonine residues (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 2Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Recently, several MKK-activating MKK kinases (MKKKs) have been identified. Some of these MKKKs are also known to be activated by phosphorylation, but the details are unclear at present.In the absence of signaling, SAPK cascades return to their inactive, dephosphorylated state, suggesting a possible role for phosphatases in SAPK regulation. In yeast cells, molecular genetic analysis has indicated that two distinct protein phosphatase groups, protein tyrosine phosphatase and protein serine/threonine phosphatase type 2C (PP2C), act as negative regulators of SAPK pathways (3Wurgler-Murphy S.M.

Studies on the regulation of TAK1 activity have revealed that a TAK1-binding protein, TAB1, functions as an activator promoting TAK1 autophosphorylation (21Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A.

In this study, we provide evidence indicating that PP2Cβ-1 selectively associates with TAK1 and inhibits the TAK1 signaling pathway by direct dephosphorylation.DISCUSSIONMAPK cascades are intracellular signaling modules composed of three tiers of sequentially activating protein kinases: MKKK, MKK, and MAPK (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 2Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of these components is essential for the activation of the MAPK cascades, protein phosphatases may be expected to play important roles in the regulation of these cascades. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that two major protein serine/threonine phosphatases, PP2Cα and PP2Cβ, inactivate the stress-activated JNK and p38 MAPK pathways (17Hanada M. Kobayashi T. Ohnishi M. Ikeda S. Wang H. Katsura K. Yanagawa Y. Hiraga A. Kanamaru R. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Takekawaet al. (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) showed that PP2Cα inhibits the JNK and p38 cascades by dephosphorylating MKK4, MKK6, and p38. TAK1 is a member of the MKKK family and activates the JNK and p38 pathways. In this study we elucidated the role of PP2Cβ in TAK1-mediated signaling pathways.We present several lines of evidence suggesting that PP2Cβ negatively regulates the TAK1 pathways by dephosphorylating and inactivating TAK1. First, ectopic expression of PP2Cβ inhibits the MKK4-JNK and MKK6-p38 pathways activated by TAK1 (Fig. 1). Second, it is known that the TAK1-binding protein TAB1 activates TAK1 by promoting its autophosphorylation (23Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We found that PP2Cβ overexpression decreased TAB1-induced TAK1 autophosphorylation in vivo(Fig. 2). Third, PP2Cβ dephosphorylates and inactivates TAK1 in vitro (Fig. 3) but fails to dephosphorylate MKK6 (Fig. 4). Finally, PP2Cβ interacts with TAK1 but not with MEKK3, MKK4, MKK6, JNK, or p38 (Figs. 5 and 7). Collectively, these data are consistent with the idea that PP2Cβ suppresses TAK1-mediated signaling by associating with and dephosphorylating TAK1. Because TAK1 functions in various biological responses, including acting as a positive regulator of transforming growth factor-β- and IL-1-induced signal transduction (18Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 21Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J.-I. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) and as a negative regulator in Wnt-induced signal transduction (22Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S.-I. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to examine whether PP2Cβ contributes to the control of these physiological responses.Coexpression of TAK1/TAB1 with PP2Cβ-1 did not result in complete dephosphorylation of TAK1, as judged by the fact that the mobility of TAK1 is still slower than that of TAK1 expressed by itself (Fig. 2). COS7 cells contain a substantial amount of free, endogenous TAB1. Therefore, we speculate that the reason for the incomplete dephosphorylation may be that the dephosphorylated TAK1 can be rephosphorylated, because both TAB1 and ATP are present in the cells. Alternatively, this may suggest that there are other phosphorylation sites in TAK1 that are not substrates for PP2C.TAK1 associates with PP2Cβ but not with PP2Cα (Fig. 5). Thus, the interaction of TAK1 with PP2Cβ is rather specific. TAK1 is activated via autophosphorylation of Ser-192 in the activation loop between kinase domains VII and VIII. Mutation of TAK1 Ser-192 to Ala to create TAK1(S/A) abolishes both phosphorylation and activation of TAK1 (23Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). TAK1(S/A) has an affinity for PP2Cβ similar to that of wild-type TAK1 (Fig. 5 C), indicating that phosphorylation of TAK1 is not required for its association with PP2Cβ. This suggests that the association of TAK1 with PP2Cβ does not occur simply through affinity of the enzyme (PP2Cβ) for its substrate (phosphorylated TAK1), but rather that PP2Cβ and TAK1 are stably associated. This may ensure appropriate localization of PP2Cβ and facilitate the specific and rapid deactivation of TAK1.The central region of TAK1 is required for its association with PP2Cβ (Fig. 6). A similar region of TAK1 is involved in its association with TAB1 (20Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), which suggests that PP2Cβ might prevent the association of TAK1 with TAB1. However, this possibility is unlikely, because we did not observe any competition between TAB1 and PP2Cβ in their association with TAK1. 2M. Hanada, J. Ninomiya-Tsuji, K.-i. Komaki, M. Ohnishi, K. Katsura, R. Kanamaru, K. Matsumoto, and S. Tamura, unpublished observation. Consistent with this, endogenous TAK1 constitutively associates with TAB1 in the absence of ligand stimulation (23Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Therefore, the minimum regions of TAK1 required for association with PP2Cβ and TAB1 must be different. It is still not clear whether PP2Cβ associates with TAK1 directly or indirectly. However, the observation that PP2Cβ fails to interact with TAB12 argues against the possibility that TAB1 mediates the association between PP2Cβ and TAK1.To understand what role PP2C may play in regulating SAPK signaling pathways, it is important to determine how cellular PP2C activity is affected by extracellular stimuli. In fission yeast cells, the expression of Ptc1 is enhanced by hyperosmotic stress (29Gaits F. Shiozaki K. Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17873-17879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression levels of PP2Cα and PP2Cβ-1 are not altered following stress treatment of cells (17Hanada M. Kobayashi T. Ohnishi M. Ikeda S. Wang H. Katsura K. Yanagawa Y. Hiraga A. Kanamaru R. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PP2Cα has been shown to preferentially bind to the phosphorylated form of p38 and may function in the adaptive phase of the stimulation cycle to restore p38 to the inactive state following stimulation by stress (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PP2Cβ may play an analogous role in maintaining TAK1 signaling. TAK1 mediates IL-1-induced JNK signaling (21Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J.-I. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), and ectopic expression of PP2Cβ blocks IL-1-induced AP-1 activation. PP2Cβ(R/G), a catalytically inactive mutant, has a higher affinity for TAK1 than does wild-type PP2Cβ and acts as a dominant negative factor, antagonizing the inhibitory effect of wild-type PP2Cβ on IL-1-induced AP-1 activation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of PP2Cβ(R/G) enhances IL-1-stimulated AP-1 activation but does not cause constitutive activation of AP-1.2 These results raise the possibility that PP2Cβ may down-regulate TAK1 activity after ligand stimulation. Because endogenous PP2Cβ constitutively associates with TAK1 (Fig. 5 D), and ligand stimulation does not affect this association,2 it is tempting to speculate that regulation of PP2Cβ enzymatic activity is involved in regulation of TAK1 signaling. Alternatively, PP2Cβ activity may be constitutive and serve to restore TAK1 to the inactive state following stimulation. Therefore it is important to determine whether the phosphatase activity of PP2Cβ is enhanced when cells are subjected to stress or treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines.Takekawa et al. (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) recently reported that PP2Cα dephosphorylates MKK4, MKK6, and p38 in vitro. In this study, we show that PP2Cβ dephosphorylates and inactivates TAK1. Thus, in mammalian cells, SAPK pathways are negatively regulated by multiple PP2C isoforms at different levels; PP2Cβ inhibits the pathways at the TAK1 MKKK level, and PP2Cα acts at the MKK and MAPK levels. In addition, two distinct groups of protein phosphatases other than PP2C also participate in the regulation of the SAPK pathways. The first group consists of the dual specificity phosphatases (also known as MAPK phosphatases) that inactivate MAPKs by dephosphorylating both tyrosine and threonine residues in the catalytic domains. Of the nine isolated MAPK phosphatases, M3/6 and MAPK phosphatase-5 have been shown to selectively dephosphorylate and inactivate p38 and JNK (30Muda M. Theodosius A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The second group includes PP2A, which inactivates partially purified p38 kinase in vitro (32Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Cells treated with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid show enhanced MKK6 activity in epithelial cells (27Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PP2A may also negatively regulate SAPK pathways and raise the possibility that several different groups of protein phosphatases each negatively regulate distinct targets in SAPK pathways. Stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs)1 are a subfamily of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily and are highly conserved from yeast to mammalian cells. SAPKs relay signals in response to various extracellular stimuli, including environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines. In mammalian cells, two distinct classes of SAPKs have been identified: the c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3) and the p38 MAPKs (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 2Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Activation of SAPKs requires phosphorylation at conserved tyrosine and threonine residues in the catalytic domain. This phosphorylation is mediated by dual specificity protein kinases, which are the members of the MAPK kinase (MKK) family. Of these, MKK3 and MKK6 phosphorylate p38, MKK7 phosphorylates JNK, and MKK4 can phosphorylate either. These MKKs, in turn, are activated by phosphorylation of conserved serine and threonine residues (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 2Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Recently, several MKK-activating MKK kinases (MKKKs) have been identified. Some of these MKKKs are also known to be activated by phosphorylation, but the details are unclear at present. In the absence of signaling, SAPK cascades return to their inactive, dephosphorylated state, suggesting a possible role for phosphatases in SAPK regulation. In yeast cells, molecular genetic analysis has indicated that two distinct protein phosphatase groups, protein tyrosine phosphatase and protein serine/threonine phosphatase type 2C (PP2C), act as negative regulators of SAPK pathways (3Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). InSchizosaccharomyces pombe, tyrosine phosphatase Pyp2 and the yeast homolog of PP2C (Ptc1 and Ptc3) have been shown to dephosphorylate and inactivate Spc1, the yeast homolog of SAPK (4Shiozaki K. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,5Nguyen A.N. Shiozaki K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). PP2C is one of four major protein serine/threonine phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C) in eukaryotes and is implicated in the regulation of various cellular functions. To date, at least six distinct PP2C gene products (2Cα, 2Cβ, 2Cγ, 2Cδ, Wip1, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphatase) have been found in mammalian cells (6Tamura S. Lynch K.R.

First, ectopic expression of PP2Cβ inhibits the MKK4-JNK and MKK6-p38 pathways activated by TAK1 (Fig. 1). Second, it is known that the TAK1-binding protein TAB1 activates TAK1 by promoting its autophosphorylation (23Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We found that PP2Cβ overexpression decreased TAB1-induced TAK1 autophosphorylation in vivo(Fig. 2). Third, PP2Cβ dephosphorylates and inactivates TAK1 in vitro (Fig. 3) but fails to dephosphorylate MKK6 (Fig. 4). Finally, PP2Cβ interacts with TAK1 but not with MEKK3, MKK4, MKK6, JNK, or p38 (Figs. 5 and 7). Collectively, these data are consistent with the idea that PP2Cβ suppresses TAK1-mediated signaling by associating with and dephosphorylating TAK1. Because TAK1 functions in various biological responses, including acting as a positive regulator of transforming growth factor-β- and IL-1-induced signal transduction (18Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K.

Inoue J.-I. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) and as a negative regulator in Wnt-induced signal transduction (22Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S.-I. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to examine whether PP2Cβ contributes to the control of these physiological responses.Coexpression of TAK1/TAB1 with PP2Cβ-1 did not result in complete dephosphorylation of TAK1, as judged by the fact that the mobility of TAK1 is still slower than that of TAK1 expressed by itself (Fig. 2). COS7 cells contain a substantial amount of free, endogenous TAB1. Therefore, we speculate that the reason for the incomplete dephosphorylation may be that the dephosphorylated TAK1 can be rephosphorylated, because both TAB1 and ATP are present in the cells. Alternatively, this may suggest that there are other phosphorylation sites in TAK1 that are not substrates for PP2C.TAK1 associates with PP2Cβ but not with PP2Cα (Fig. 5). Thus, the interaction of TAK1 with PP2Cβ is rather specific. TAK1 is activated via autophosphorylation of Ser-192 in the activation loop between kinase domains VII and VIII. Mutation of TAK1 Ser-192 to Ala to create TAK1(S/A) abolishes both phosphorylation and activation of TAK1 (23Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). TAK1(S/A) has an affinity for PP2Cβ similar to that of wild-type TAK1 (Fig. 5 C), indicating that phosphorylation of TAK1 is not required for its association with PP2Cβ. This suggests that the association of TAK1 with PP2Cβ does not occur simply through affinity of the enzyme (PP2Cβ) for its substrate (phosphorylated TAK1), but rather that PP2Cβ and TAK1 are stably associated. This may ensure appropriate localization of PP2Cβ and facilitate the specific and rapid deactivation of TAK1.The central region of TAK1 is required for its association with PP2Cβ (Fig. 6). A similar region of TAK1 is involved in its association with TAB1 (20Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), which suggests that PP2Cβ might prevent the association of TAK1 with TAB1. However, this possibility is unlikely, because we did not observe any competition between TAB1 and PP2Cβ in their association with TAK1. 2M. Hanada, J. Ninomiya-Tsuji, K.-i. Komaki, M. Ohnishi, K. Katsura, R. Kanamaru, K. Matsumoto, and S. Tamura, unpublished observation. Consistent with this, endogenous TAK1 constitutively associates with TAB1 in the absence of ligand stimulation (23Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Therefore, the minimum regions of TAK1 required for association with PP2Cβ and TAB1 must be different. It is still not clear whether PP2Cβ associates with TAK1 directly or indirectly. However, the observation that PP2Cβ fails to interact with TAB12 argues against the possibility that TAB1 mediates the association between PP2Cβ and TAK1.To understand what role PP2C may play in regulating SAPK signaling pathways, it is important to determine how cellular PP2C activity is affected by extracellular stimuli. In fission yeast cells, the expression of Ptc1 is enhanced by hyperosmotic stress (29Gaits F. Shiozaki K. Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17873-17879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression levels of PP2Cα and PP2Cβ-1 are not altered following stress treatment of cells (17Hanada M. Kobayashi T. Ohnishi M. Ikeda S. Wang H. Katsura K. Yanagawa Y. Hiraga A. Kanamaru R. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PP2Cα has been shown to preferentially bind to the phosphorylated form of p38 and may function in the adaptive phase of the stimulation cycle to restore p38 to the inactive state following stimulation by stress (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PP2Cβ may play an analogous role in maintaining TAK1 signaling. TAK1 mediates IL-1-induced JNK signaling (21Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J.-I. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), and ectopic expression of PP2Cβ blocks IL-1-induced AP-1 activation. PP2Cβ(R/G), a catalytically inactive mutant, has a higher affinity for TAK1 than does wild-type PP2Cβ and acts as a dominant negative factor, antagonizing the inhibitory effect of wild-type PP2Cβ on IL-1-induced AP-1 activation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of PP2Cβ(R/G) enhances IL-1-stimulated AP-1 activation but does not cause constitutive activation of AP-1.2 These results raise the possibility that PP2Cβ may down-regulate TAK1 activity after ligand stimulation. Because endogenous PP2Cβ constitutively associates with TAK1 (Fig. 5 D), and ligand stimulation does not affect this association,2 it is tempting to speculate that regulation of PP2Cβ enzymatic activity is involved in regulation of TAK1 signaling. Alternatively, PP2Cβ activity may be constitutive and serve to restore TAK1 to the inactive state following stimulation. Therefore it is important to determine whether the phosphatase activity of PP2Cβ is enhanced when cells are subjected to stress or treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines.Takekawa et al. (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) recently reported that PP2Cα dephosphorylates MKK4, MKK6, and p38 in vitro. In this study, we show that PP2Cβ dephosphorylates and inactivates TAK1. Thus, in mammalian cells, SAPK pathways are negatively regulated by multiple PP2C isoforms at different levels; PP2Cβ inhibits the pathways at the TAK1 MKKK level, and PP2Cα acts at the MKK and MAPK levels. In addition, two distinct groups of protein phosphatases other than PP2C also participate in the regulation of the SAPK pathways. The first group consists of the dual specificity phosphatases (also known as MAPK phosphatases) that inactivate MAPKs by dephosphorylating both tyrosine and threonine residues in the catalytic domains. Of the nine isolated MAPK phosphatases, M3/6 and MAPK phosphatase-5 have been shown to selectively dephosphorylate and inactivate p38 and JNK (30Muda M. Theodosius A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The second group includes PP2A, which inactivates partially purified p38 kinase in vitro (32Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Cells treated with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid show enhanced MKK6 activity in epithelial cells (27Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PP2A may also negatively regulate SAPK pathways and raise the possibility that several different groups of protein phosphatases each negatively regulate distinct targets in SAPK pathways. MAPK cascades are intracellular signaling modules composed of three tiers of sequentially activating protein kinases: MKKK, MKK, and MAPK (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 2Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of these components is essential for the activation of the MAPK cascades, protein phosphatases may be expected to play important roles in the regulation of these cascades. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that two major protein serine/threonine phosphatases, PP2Cα and PP2Cβ, inactivate the stress-activated JNK and p38 MAPK pathways (17Hanada M. Kobayashi T. Ohnishi M. Ikeda S. Wang H. Katsura K. Yanagawa Y. Hiraga A. Kanamaru R. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Takekawaet al. (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) showed that PP2Cα inhibits the JNK and p38 cascades by dephosphorylating MKK4, MKK6, and p38. TAK1 is a member of the MKKK family and activates the JNK and p38 pathways. In this study we elucidated the role of PP2Cβ in TAK1-mediated signaling pathways.

The conversion of this prepore to the pore complex was achieved by reducing the C190-C57 disulfide bond. PFOC190-C57 that was allowed to form the prepore prior to the reduction of the disulfide exhibited a dramatic increase in the rate of PFO-dependent hemolysis and the membrane insertion of its TMHs when compared with toxin that had the disulfide reduced prior mixing the toxin with membranes.

Alouf J. Freer J. Bacterial Toxins: A Comprehensive Sourcebook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London1999: 443-456Google Scholar) of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs). Two defining characteristics of CDC cytolysis are the formation of large homo-oligomeric structures (2Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Sziegoleit A. Alouf J.E. Fehrenbach F.J. Freer J.H. Jeljaszewicz J.

These toxins are produced as soluble monomers that ultimately form the large homo-oligomeric pore-forming structure on sterol-containing membranes. The only crystal structure of a soluble, monomeric form of a CDC was recently solved by Rossjohn et al. (6Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W.

The structure of the membrane-bound oligomeric structure of a CDC is not presently available; however, we have used multiple fluorescence techniques to identify the residues in domain 3 that form two β-hairpins that span the membrane in the inserted oligomeric PFO complex (7Shatursky O.

The corresponding residues were found to exist as six short α-helices in the crystal structure of the soluble PFO monomer (6Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W.

The α-helical to β-strand transition in the secondary structure together with the contribution of two β-hairpins per monomer to the transmembrane β-sheet are so far unique to PFO and perhaps the other CDCs. The timing of oligomer assembly and of the insertion of individual transmembrane domains is controversial. Rossjohn et al. (6Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W.

In the prepore model (9Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), individual membrane-spanning β-hairpins of each monomer are brought together to form an oligomeric prepore that coordinates the insertion of the pre-β-hairpins into the membrane as a single membrane-spanning β-barrel. This model has been shown to be used by toxins that form small oligomeric prepore complexes such as Aeromonas hydrophila aerolysin, Staphylococcus aureusα-hemolysin, and Clostridium septicum α-toxin (9Walker B.

In support of this model for the CDCs, we have recently shown (13Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) that PFO oligomerization can be uncoupled from the membrane insertion of the transmembrane β-hairpins by lowering the temperature. Shepardet al. (13Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that PFO insertion into planar bilayers resulted in the formation of discrete, large channels. Based on these findings, PFO was proposed to form a prepore complex prior to the insertion of its transmembrane domain. We have now trapped the PFO oligomer in a prepore state by the introduction of a disulfide bridge into the structure of the soluble PFO monomer. In the present study, a disulfide bridge was introduced between cysteine-substituted serine 190 of transmembrane hairpin 1 (TMH1) and glycine 57 of domain 2. In the oxidized state, the same large oligomeric prepore complex described by Shepard et al.(13Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) was found to form on the membrane surface. Furthermore, the initial rate of PFO binding to the membrane, mediated by domain 4 (Fig.1), was not altered by the presence or absence of the disulfide link in PFO (14Heuck A.P. Hotze E. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the disulfide-linked PFO oligomers were unable to insert their TMHs or form pores in the membrane. Thus, the disulfide-trapped PFO allowed us to convert the membrane-bound monomer into a prepore complex and then (at our discretion) to synchronize the conversion of the prepore to pore complex by the addition of reducing reagent. These studies provide the first direct evidence that the prepore facilitates the membrane insertion of the large transmembrane β-sheet of the CDCs into the bilayer. Potential sites for cysteine residue pairs that might form disulfide bonds were selected using the method of Hazes and Dijkstra (15Hazes B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, potential residue pairs were initially selected on the basis of appropriate Cβ-Cβ distances. Sulfur positions were generated for these residues, and a check was made to determine whether certain stereochemical criteria were obeyed. An important criterion was that the χ-3 angles of a potential bridge should not deviate by more than 30° from observed preferences. Selected pairs were subjected to energy minimization, and energetically favorable conformations were chosen (less than 10 kcal/mol). This method will be successful if main-chain conformations are very similar between wild-type and mutant. Calculations were based on the crystal structure of PFO (6Rossjohn J. Feil S.C.

The model had been refined to an R-factor of 0.211 (R free of 0.268) at 2.2 Å resolution with good stereochemistry. The best candidate for engineering a disulfide bridge between domain 2 and TMH1 was the residue pair of G57 and S190 (Fig.1). The two residues were predicted to form a bond that complied with the stereochemical (χ-3 approximately −57.0°) and conformational energy (7.9 kcal/mol) criteria. The cysteine-less gene for PFO encoding PFOC459A that was cloned in the expression vector pTrcHisA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (8Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R.

Four additional mutants of PFOC190-C57 were generated in which a cysteine was substituted for amino acid residues Ala215, Val202, Lys288, or Ile303. Ala215 and Val202 reside in TMH1, whereas Lys288 and Ile303 reside in TMH2. PFO derivatives were expressed and purified as before (7Shatursky O. Heuck A.P. Shepard L.A. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W.

Labeling of the cysteine derivatives, PFOC190-C57/C215, PFOC190-C57/C202, PFOC190-C57/C288, and PFOC190-C57/C303, with IANBD or IATR was performed as previously described (7Shatursky O. Heuck A.P.

The relative hemolytic activity of the NBD-labeled and unlabeled proteins were determined as described previously (8Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The extent of dye reaction with the PFOC190-C57 disulfide mutant was less than 9%, thereby indicating that >90% of the sulfhydryls were in disulfide bonds. The extent of labeling of the triple mutants, PFOC190-C57/C215, PFOC190-C57/C202, PFOC190-C57/C288, and PFOC190-C57/C303, was determined as before (8Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J.

All phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Cholesterol was obtained from Steraloids (Wilton, NH). Liposomes were prepared by extrusion using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and cholesterol at a ratio of 45:55 mol% as before (8Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J.

The disulfide-trapped mutant (900 nm) (± dithiothreitol) in buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 40 mm NaCl ± 1 mm DTT) in 12-μl droplets were coated with 0.5–1 μl of a 0.5 mg/ml lipid mixture containing ∼60 mol% cholesterol (Sigma) and 40 mol% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in chloroform. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the PFO oligomeric rings were transferred to carbon support films that coated electron microscope grids and then negatively stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate as described previously (16Darst S.A. Ribi H.O. Pierce D.W. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 173-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were recorded (magnification, ×40,000) with a Philips electron microscope model 208S. All fluorescence measurements were performed in a SLM-8100 photon counting spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments) as described previously (8Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). An excitation wavelength of 470 nm was used for NBD, and the emission intensity was measured between 500 and 600 nm. The bandpass was 4 nm for all experiments. Emission scans of NBD-labeled residues in TMH1 (Cys215 or Cys202) or TMH2 (Cys288 or Cys303) were recorded in both the presence and absence of 10 mm DTT in 2 ml of buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl) at 37 °C. Excess liposomes were added to monomeric NBD-labeled PFOC190-C57 derivatives (185 nm) and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 37 °C to ensure that oligomerization and insertion into the membrane were complete before the intensity measurements were made. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based kinetic experiments were carried out with only the following changes to our previous procedures (17Harris R.W. Sims P.J. Tweten R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6936-6941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The donor dye was NBD, and the acceptor dye was tetramethylrhodamine (final PFO concentration was 190 nm). The donor-labeled PFOC190-C57/C215 was mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio with acceptor-labeled PFOC190-C57/C215 in 2 ml of buffer A in the presence or absence of 10 mm DTT at 37 °C. The excitation wavelength was set at 470 nm, and the donor emission intensity was measured every 20 s at 540 nm. After 30 s, excess liposomes were injected into the mixture and the emission intensity was monitored for an additional 1170 s. The liposomes had been titrated as described previously to ensure that an excess of liposomes was used to quantitatively bind and insert the PFO (8Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Hemolysis was measured on the SLM 8100 at 37 °C by following the decrease in right-angle light scattering of erythrocytes as they lysed, using the procedures described previously by Harris et al. (17Harris R.W. Sims P.J. Tweten R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6936-6941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis was performed as described elsewhere (13Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, in all samples in which PFO was incubated with liposomes, the liposomes (45 mol% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 55 mol% cholesterol) were incubated with PFO for 30 min at 37 °C. Oligomeric complexes were solubilized with SDS sample buffer and separated on 1.5% SeaPlaque agarose (FMC, Rockland, ME) in SDS gel reservoir buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded and the gel was run at 100 V for 3 h. Gels were fixed in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, 30% (v/v) methanol overnight, then dried in an Easy Breeze gel dryer (Hoefer, San Francisco, CA). The dried gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R and then destained to visualize the protein bands. The substitution of cysteines for amino acid residues Ser190and Gly57, and the subsequent formation of the disulfide bridge between TMH1 and domain 2, rendered PFO hemolytically inactive (Table I). If the disulfide bridge alone were responsible for the lack of activity of the double mutant, then the activity would be restored when the disulfide bridge was reduced. As predicted, once reducing agent was added to the sample, the hemolytic activity was restored to nearly wild-type levels (TableI). Similarly, the NBD-labeled and unlabeled derivatives of PFOC190-C57 (PFOC190-C57/C215, PFOC190-C57/C202, PFOC190-C57/C288, and PFOC190-C57/C303) exhibited less than 6% of the hemolytic activity of the parent toxin PFOC459A in a nonreducing environment (Table I).Table IRelative hemolytic activity of cysteine-substituted mutants of PFO before and after derivation with IANBD under reducing and non-reducing conditionsMutantDTTHemolytic activityUnlabeledNBD-labeledPFOC190-C57−<1NAPFOC190-C57+92NAPFOC190-C57/C215−60PFOC190-C57/C215+8065PFOC190-C57/C202−20PFOC190-C57/C202+6767PFOC190-C57/C288−2<1PFOC190-C57/C288+8154PFOC190-C57/C303−2<1PFOC190-C57/C303+7565Hemolytic activity (average of three assays) is expressed as a percentage of the hemolytic activity of PFOC459A.

We have previously determined the kinetics of erythrocyte hemolysis by PFO by monitoring the decrease in right-angle light scattering that accompanies hemolysis (17Harris R.W. Sims P.J. Tweten R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6936-6941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In their studies, Harris et al.(17Harris R.W. Sims P.J. Tweten R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6936-6941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that PFO-dependent hemolysis exhibited a lag period prior to the onset of hemolysis. When pre-reduced PFOC190-C57 was injected into a stirred suspension of erythrocytes, the same hemolysis kinetics were observed. Hemolysis began after about 100 s and reached completion by ∼370 s after the injection of the toxin (Fig. 2). In contrast, no hemolysis was detected when the disulfide-trapped mutant PFOC190-C57 was examined by this method in the absence of DTT. However, when DTT was added to the disulfide-trapped mutant 370 s after it had been mixed with the erythrocytes, hemolysis began almost immediately and was complete within 60 s. The lysis of the erythrocytes was nearly 7 times faster than when the disulfide-trapped mutant was reduced with dithiothreitol prior to adding the toxin to the erythrocytes. Therefore, even though PFOC190-C57 was hemolytically inactive before reduction of the disulfide, it was clear that the cytolytic mechanism had progressed to a stage that largely eliminated the typical lag period. The rate-limiting step in hemolysis therefore must occur prior to the stage at which the oxidized PFOC190-C57 derivative is trapped. We therefore characterized the oligomeric state of the disulfide-trapped mutant and examined the environment of the two transmembrane domains in the disulfide-trapped state. As shown in Fig. 2, disulfide locking TMH1 to domain 2 of PFO trapped the PFO in a structural state that did not allow pore formation to occur, but did prime the system for hemolysis. Although the structural nature of this trapped state was initially unclear, we suspected that it was trapped in a prepore complex. Therefore, we employed a SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis (SDS-AGE) system, previously described by Shepardet al. (13Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), to directly examine the distribution of PFO oligomers under nonreducing and reducing conditions. As expected, in the absence of liposomes, PFO and PFOC190-C57 (unreduced or reduced) migrate as a monomer in the SDS-agarose gel system (Fig.3, lanes 1–3). In the presence of cholesterol-containing liposomes under nonreducing conditions, PFOC190-C57 (Fig. 3, lane 5) formed large oligomeric complexes comparable to the parent toxin PFOC459A (lanes 4 and6) and to those formed under conditions in which the disulfide of PFOC190-C57 was reduced (lane 7). Although oxidized PFOC190-C57 formed the same-sized oligomer as the cysteine-less parent toxin PFOC459A, it apparently was more susceptible to dissociation by SDS than if it was reduced and allowed to insert (compare lane 5 with lane 7). If a chemical cross-linker is first used to stabilize this complex, we do not observe the dissociation of the oxidized PFOC190-C57 oligomer into monomers (data not shown). The oligomer of the reduced form of PFOC190-C57 appeared to be as stable to SDS as the cysteine-less parent toxin PFOC459A. These data suggest that the formation of the transmembrane β-barrel additionally stabilizes the oligomer to dissociation by SDS. The oligomeric complexes formed by PFOC190-C57 were also examined by electron microscopy (EM) after their formation on lipid monolayers in the presence (Fig.4 A) or absence (Fig.4 B) of DTT. Primarily rings and some arcs were observed by EM and are typical of the structures typically seen by EM when membranes are treated with PFO (e.g. Ref. 13Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a comparison of the structures present in the presence or absence of DTT reveals that the oxidation state of the disulfide of PFOC190-C57 has little effect on the overall topography of the PFO oligomers as seen by EM. The extent of FRET between a donor dye and an acceptor dye depends upon, among other things, the distance between the dyes. FRET is therefore an excellent technique for detecting the proximity of two proteins if one polypeptide is labeled with a donor dye and the other is labeled with an appropriate acceptor dye. We have previously used this approach to monitor the oligomerization of PFO monomers (17Harris R.W. Sims P.J. Tweten R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6936-6941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, since fluorescence is a nondestructive technique, one can monitor the signal continuously and hence determine the kinetics of association. The rate of oligomerization of the disulfide-trapped PFO was examined by FRET between donor NBD-labeled PFOC190-C57/C215 and acceptor tetramethylrhodamine-labeled PFOC190-C57/C215 when cholesterol-containing liposomes were added to a 1:1 mixture of these proteins. The existence of FRET, and hence the close approach of donor- and acceptor-labeled subunits, can be detected by the reduction in donor emission intensity as excitation energy is transferred to the acceptor. As shown in Fig.5, the introduction of liposomes to a mixture of donor- and acceptor-labeled PFO subunits causes a decrease in NBD intensity, indicating that the subunits have associated. The decrease in NBD intensity is due to FRET because no decrease in NBD intensity was observed when the sample lacked acceptor dyes (Fig. 5). Most important, the rate and extent of FRET were virtually identical whether or not the disulfide was reduced. Hence, the introduction of the disulfide did not appreciably affect the rate of PFO oligomerization, thereby demonstrating that the rate-limiting step in the process that leads to oligomer formation is not significantly altered by the presence of the disulfide bond. Since hemolysis was prevented (Table I, Fig. 2), but the formation of the oligomer was unaffected by the introduction of the C190-C57 disulfide (Fig. 5), we presumed that the disulfide bond prevented the insertion of at least TMH1 because the disulfide bond covalently links residues 190 of TMH1 and 57 of domain 2 (Fig. 1). Although it was easy to envision that the disulfide bridge could prevent TMH1 from assuming the conformation necessary for proper insertion into the bilayer, it was not clear whether inhibiting the movement of TMH1 would also prevent TMH2 from moving into the membrane. In contrast to TMH1, which is partially buried in the core of the PFO molecule, TMH2 is largely exposed to the solvent (6Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) and hence this domain, unrestricted by a disulfide, might partially or fully insert into the membrane independent of TMH1. To determine whether either TMH in a disulfide-trapped PFO molecule could insert into the membrane, four derivatives of PFOC190-C57 were generated in which a cysteine was substituted for amino acid residues located either in TMH1 at amino acids Val202 or Ala215 or in TMH2 at amino acids Lys288 or Ile303. All four residues have been previously shown to face the membrane in TMH1 or TMH2 (7Shatursky O. Heuck A.P. Shepard L.A. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K.

These mutants were modified with NBD, an environmentally sensitive fluorescent dye that we have used previously to map the orientation of these residues in the membrane (7Shatursky O. Heuck A.P.

Since the emission of NBD is strongly quenched by water, the fluorescence intensity increases significantly when the dye at these locations in the TMHs moves from an aqueous to a nonaqueous environment (7Shatursky O.

The fluorescence emission spectrum of each mutant was determined spectroscopically before and after incubation with liposomes in the absence or presence of reducing reagent (Fig.6). In three cases, the fluorescence intensities of NBD in the PFOC190-C57 mutants that had been incubated with liposomes in the absence of DTT were nearly the same as those of the respective soluble monomers (Fig. 6). For the V202C mutant, which has the dye located at the tip of TMH1 near the β-turn of the hairpin, the NBD appeared to enter a somewhat more nonpolar environment, but not the environment observed when the protein is allowed to fully insert. It therefore appears that a probe at the other end of T"

The initiator caspases, which include caspase-8, -9, and -10, are activated in the earlier phase of apoptosis; the executioner caspases, which include caspase-3, -6, and-7, are activated by initiator caspases and are responsible for dismantling cells (10Depraetere V.

Two pathways lead to the activation of caspase-3 through release of cytochrome c and cleavage of pro-caspase-9 and through ligation of death receptors by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1and Fas ligand.

The role of mitochondria in apoptosis was first appreciated in a cell-free system when nuclear apoptotic events were induced only by cytoplasmic fractions enriched in mitochondria (21Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence now suggests that many apoptotic stimuli affect the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and cause the release of pro-apoptotic molecules such as cytochrome c and Apaf-1 from mitochondria (22Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 23Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar, 24Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J.

The subcellular distribution of pro-caspase-8 is not clear. Since knowledge about the localization of pro-caspase-8 could be important in understanding its role in apoptosis, we evaluated the subcellular localization of pro-caspase-8 in human fibroblasts and in a mouse clonal striatal cell line. The results suggest that pro-caspase-8 is predominantly found in the intermembrane space and inner membrane of mitochondria and can be released upon apoptotic stimulation. Human fibroblasts obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine, 100 units/ml penicillin G/streptomycin, 0.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, 2 mm glutamine, 2× final concentration minimum Eagle's medium vitamins, nonessential and essential amino acids (all from Life Technologies) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Clonal mouse striatal cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 glucose, and 50 units/ml penicillin G/streptomycin (30Wainwright M.S. Perry B.J. Won L. O'Malley K.L. Wang W.Y. Ehrlich M.E. Heller A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 676-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clonal striatal cells or human fibroblasts were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated microslips for 24 h. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (31Kegel K.B. Kim M. Sapp E.

To study the cellular localization of pro-caspase-8, cells were incubated with the rabbit polyclonal antibodies against pro-caspase-8 (SK-441, Ref. 32Qin Z-H. Chen R-W. Wang Y. Nakai M. Chuang D-M. Chase T.N. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with the mouse monoclonal antibody against cytochromec (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) for 24 h at 4 °C. Microslips were washed and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (or donkey against mouse IgG) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). To study the effects of TNF-α on localization of pro-caspase-8 and cytochrome c, clonal striatal cells were treated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 6 h and then processed for immunostaining as described above. The nuclei of these cells were stained with propidium iodide. Immunostained cells were examined with a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad 1024) and merged in Adobe Photoshop. Clonal striatal cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes, fixed, and incubated with polyclonal antibodies against pro-caspase-8 as described above and then with gold-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were post-fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in increasing grades of alcohol, and embedded in an ethanol-soluble epon (LX112, LADD). Embedded cells were sectioned (Ultracut E, Reichert-Jung) and examined with a JEOL 100CX electron microscope. Purification of mitochondria was performed using a Percoll gradient procedure described by Gasnier et al. (34Gasnier F. Rousson R. Lerme F. Vaganay E. Louisot P. Gateau-Roesch D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Clonal striatal cells were harvested and rinsed in Hanks' balanced salt solution twice. Cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.28 units/ml apotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 7 μg/ml pepstatin A (pH 7.4) and homogenized with a glass Pyrex microhomogenizer (30 strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the resultant supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min to obtain the mitochondrial pellet and supernatant. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to generate the cytosolic fraction. The mitochondrial pellet was washed in buffer B containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) three times to remove lysosome and microsome contamination. Crude mitochondria were further purified by layering the preparation on top of a gradient consisting of 2.2 ml of 2.5 m sucrose, 6.55 ml of Percoll solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 12.25 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA. The mixture was centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 45 min. A dense band recovered from approximately two-thirds down the tube, corresponding to purified mitochondria, was removed with a Pasteur pipette, diluted with 1 ml of buffer B, and washed twice by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min each to remove the Percoll solution. The purity and integrity of mitochondrial preparations were validated by electron microscopy. Protein concentration was determined with BCA kit (Pierce). The subfractionation of mitochondria was performed using a protocol described by Pederson et al. (35Pederson P.L. Greenawalt B. Reynafarje J. Hullihen G.L. Decker J.W. Bustamente E. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 20: 411-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, crude mitochondria were resuspended in H-medium containing 220 mmd-mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). The mitochondria suspension was mixed with equal volumes of H-medium containing 1.2% digitonin, incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with mild stirring, and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × gafter the addition of a 2-fold volume of H-medium. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the intermembrane space fraction (supernatant) and crude outer membrane fraction (pellet). The pellet fractions resulting from the 10,000 × g centrifugation were washed once with H-medium, suspended in H-medium, sonicated for 2 min on ice, and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants were used as the matrix fraction, and the pellet fractions were used as inner membrane fraction. Both outer and inner membrane fractions were solubilized with a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm calcium chloride (TNC, pH 8.0). Protein concentrations in all fractions were determined by the BCA kit. For purification of nuclei, human fibroblasts were lysed in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.8), and protease inhibitors tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Crude homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to obtain a low speed supernatant (S1) and a crude nuclear pellet (P1). The nuclear pellet was purified using iodixanol step gradients according to manufacturer's instructions (Optiprep, Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY). A protocol reported by Samali et al. (36Samali A. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with modifications was used. Mitochondria were incubated in H-medium containing 0.2 μg/ml proteinase K or in H-medium containing 1% Nonidet P-40 plus proteinase K (0.2 μg/ml) for 3 min at room temperature. Control mitochondria were incubated with H-medium only or H-medium with 1% Nonidet P-40. Proteolysis was terminated by adding an equal volume of TNC buffer containing 15 μg phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2% SDS, 20 μl of loading buffer, and boiling for 5 min. Samples were analyzed immediately by immunoblotting. We followed the protocol of Susin et al. (29Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Brenner C. Larochette N. Prévost M-C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 193-381Crossref Scopus (636) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A crude mitochondrial fraction, prepared as described above, was suspended in a cell-free system (CFS) containing 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm pyruvate, 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 50 μg of antipain, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4). The suspension was equally divided into several test tubes determined by the needs of the experiments. Release of pro-caspase-8 and cytochrome c was induced by the ADP/ATP carrier inhibitor atractyloside (Atr, 5 or 10 mm, Sigma). Atractyloside was dissolved in CFS and incubated with mitochondria for 1 h at room temperature. Separation of mitochondria and supernatant was achieved by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min). The supernatant was then further cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. To assess whether release of pro-caspase-8 is through MPTP, cyclosporin A (CsA, 25 μm, Sigma) was added together with Atr. After drug treatment, mitochondria suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet mitochondria. The supernatants were centrifuged again at 100,000 ×g. The levels of pro- and active caspase-8 and cytochromec were measured by Western blot analysis in mitochondrial and supernatant fractions. Clonal striatal cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes and treated with TNF-α (10 or 20 ng/ml, Sigma) after cells reached 80–90% confluence. Control cells received 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (vehicle for TNF-α). Cells were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline 6 h after drug administration. To study the effect of CsA on TNF-α-induced release of pro-caspase-8, clonal striatal cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes and treated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml plus vehicle), CsA (10 μm), or TNF-α plus CsA. Cells were harvested 6 h after drug administration and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Crude mitochondria and cytosol were prepared as described above. Protein concentrations in cytosol and mitochondria were determined by BCA kit. Levels of pro- and active caspase-8 and cytochromec were determined with Western blot analysis. Protein extracts were loaded onto 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (Bio-Rad) and exposed to electrophoresis for 1.5 h. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked and incubated in Tris-HCl-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.4) containing 3% nonfat dry milk. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against pro-caspase-8 (SK-441) or active caspase-8 (SK-440) (33Velier J.J. Ellison J.A. Kikly K.K. Spera P.A. Barone F.C. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5932-5941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or monoclonal antibodies against cytochrome c, HSP70 (StressGen BiotechnologiesCorp., Victoria, BC, Canada) or cytochrome oxidase IV (Molecular Probes) were applied at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min each with Tris-HCl-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20, and immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were analyzed by densitometry with image analysis software (SigmaScan Pro 4.0) after capturing the digital images with Hewlett Packard ScanJet 4C/T according to the manufacturer's protocol. The average density and area of each band were measured. The total values of pro-caspase-8, cytochrome c, actin, or cytochrome oxidase were calculated by multiplying the area and average density of each band. The values of pro-caspase-8 and cytochromec were then normalized to a loading control (actin for cytosolic fractions and cytochrome oxidase for mitochondrial fractions) and expressed as the mean ± S.E. Clonal striatal cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes and treated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 3–24 h. Cells were collected together with medium and centrifuged at 1000 ×g. Cell pellets were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) after removing the medium. Low molecular weight DNA fragments were extracted according to the protocol used by Chenet al. (37Chen R-W. Saunders P.A. Wei H. Li H. Seth P. Chuang D-M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9654-9662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragments were separated on 2% agarose gel (3:1 NuSive) and visualized with an UV transilluminator after ethidium bromide staining. In the cytoplasm of fibroblasts and clonal striatal cells, pro-caspase-8 immunostaining displayed a rod-shaped or punctate pattern with very little or no diffuse staining. The labeling for pro-caspase-8 overlapped with the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c, as revealed by double immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig. 1). There was diffuse staining for pro-caspase-8 in some cell nuclei. The intensity of nuclear labeling was stronger in human fibroblasts than in clonal striatal cells (Fig. 1). The specificity of the pro-caspase-8 antibody was fully characterized previously (33Velier J.J. Ellison J.A. Kikly K.K. Spera P.A. Barone F.C. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5932-5941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was tested in our studies by omitting primary or secondary antibodies (data not shown). To confirm the mitochondrial and nuclear localization of pro-caspase-8, protein extracts from crude mitochondria and Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria from clonal striatal cells and nuclei obtained from human fibroblasts were examined by Western blot. Results showed that pro-caspase-8 levels were strongly detected in both the crude mitochondria and Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria (Fig.2, A and B), whereas the cytosolic fractions showed relatively low levels of pro-caspase-8. As a marker for mitochondria enrichment, cytochromec or cytochrome oxidase was detected in the crude mitochondrial fraction and Percoll gradient-purified mitochondrial fraction, respectively. A similar enrichment of pro-caspase-8 was observed in purified mitochondria from COS-1 cells (data not shown). The purified nuclei also expressed readily detectable signal for pro-caspase-8 in Western blot (Fig. 2 C). The purity of the nuclear preparation was verified by the enrichment of histone and the absence of tubulin, cytochrome c, and calnexin (data not shown). To determine where pro-caspase-8 is localized in mitochondria, crude mitochondria were incubated with proteinase K in the absence or presence of the detergent Nonidet P-40 (1% final concentration). Results showed that proteinase K alone did not cause degradation of pro-caspase-8. In the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40, however, proteinase K degraded pro-caspase-8. In contrast, proteinase K alone caused partial degradation of heat shock protein (HSP70), a protein previously reported to be localized especially in the outer membrane and matrix (38Kang P.J. Ostermann J. Neupert W. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Nature. 1990; 348: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 39Klein K.G. Olson C.L. Engman D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 40Mooney B. Harmey M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When the detergent Nonidet P-40 was added, proteinase K completely degraded HSP70. Similar to pro-caspase-8, cytochromec, a protein known to be localized inside mitochondria, was degraded by proteinase K in the presence of Nonidet P-40 but not by proteinase K alone (Fig.3 A). The mitochondrial localization of pro-caspase-8 was further examined in mitochondrial fractions. Western blot analysis showed that pro-caspase-8 was detected in the intermembrane space, inner membrane, and matrix fractions (Fig. 3 B). In several independent experiments, outer membrane always contained little or no pro-caspase-8, whereas inner membrane contained the highest levels of pro-caspase-8. Both intermembrane space and matrix contained intermediate levels of pro-caspase-8. Cytochrome oxidase and HSP70 were examined for the purpose of monitoring separation of outer and inner membranes. Consistent with the known distribution of these proteins, cytochrome oxidase was found only in the inner membrane fraction, whereas HSP70 was enriched in the outer membrane and in the matrix fraction (Fig. 3 B). The localization of pro-caspase-8 inside mitochondria was also examined with immunogold electron microscopy. Numerous gold particles were found inside mitochondria, but none were seen on the outer mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 4). Gold particles were absent when primary antibody was omitted (data not shown). To assess whether mitochondria release pro-caspase-8, crude mitochondria were suspended in the cell-free system in the presence or absence of Atr (5 or 10 mm), which opens the MPTP. After incubation, mitochondria and supernatant were separated by centrifugation. Pro-caspase-8 was modestly decreased in mitochondria and robustly detected in the supernatant after Atr treatment. Quantitative analysis of three independent experiments showed pro-caspase-8 levels in mitochondrial fractions decreased to 86.2 ± 3% (5 mm) or 79.4 ± 3.8% (10 mm) of control (nontreated mitochondria) and in the supernatants increased to 267.7 ± 103 (5 mm) or 351.7 ± 73 (10 mm) of control. Concurrently, cytochrome c was markedly decreased in the mitochondrial fraction and strongly detected in the supernatant after Atr treatment. In mitochondrial fractions, cytochrome c decreased to 57.3% ± 15.1% (5 mm) or 34.8 ± 8.9% (10 mm) of control (nontreated mitochondria), whereas in the supernatants the levels were 246.3 ± 51.2% and 534 ± 199%, respectively (Fig. 5,top). To evaluate whether mitochondria release pro-caspase-8 through the MPTP, mitochondria were treated with Atr in the presence or absence of the MPTP inhibitor CsA (25 μm). Quantitative analysis of results from three independent experiments showed that CsA blocked the Atr-induced decrease in pro-caspase-8 levels in mitochondria (from 86.9 ± 9.7% of control to 113.7 ± 22% in the presence of CsA). CsA inhibited the Atr-induced increase in pro-caspase-8 levels in the supernatants (from 693.6 ± 206 to 109.8 ± 34.8% of control in the presence of CsA). CsA also inhibited the Atr-induced increase in cytochrome c in the supernatants (from 470.8 ± 170.5% of controls to 77.4 ± 22% in the presence of CsA) and prevented the Atr-induced decrease in cytochromec in mitochondria (from 65.9 ± 5 to 99.2 ± 16.3 in the presence of CsA). In addition, after Atr treatment, the pro-caspase-8 cleavage product (p10) was also detected in the supernatant and was inhibited by CsA (Fig. 5,bottom). The effects of the apoptotic inducer TNF-α on mitochondria localization were determined by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In untreated clonal striatal cells, cytochromec and pro-caspase-8 immunoreactive mitochondria were distributed relatively evenly throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.6, top panels, green label). Treatment with TNF-α for 6 h induced marked clustering, fusion, and peri-nuclear localization of mitochondria labeled for cytochrome c or pro-caspase-8. These changes appeared in cells with or without nuclear fragmentation, a feature of apoptosis. In some of the cells including those that were shrunken with fragmented nuclei, labeling for mitochondria with cytochromec or pro-caspase-8 was severely reduced or absent, and diffuse staining for cytochrome c (Fig. 6, left middle and lower panels), or pro-caspase-8 was evident in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6, right middle and lower panels). To evaluate mitochondrial release of pro-caspase-8 in intact cells under apoptotic conditions, clonal striatal cells were treated with TNF-α (10 or 20 ng/ml), for 6 h and then mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared. TNF-α caused a reduction in levels of pro-caspase-8 in mitochondria, whereas cytosolic levels of pro-caspase-8 levels were increased (Fig.7 A). Quantitative analysis"
https://openalex.org/W2026075013,"The lysosomal degradation of ceramide is catalyzed by acid ceramidase and requires sphingolipid activator proteins (SAP) as cofactors <i>in vivo</i>. The aim of this study was to investigate how ceramide is hydrolyzed by acid ceramidase at the water-membrane interface in the presence of sphingolipid activator proteins in a liposomal assay system. The degradation of membrane-bound ceramide was significantly increased both in the absence and presence of SAP-D when anionic lysosomal phospholipids such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, phosphatidylinositol, and dolichol phosphate were incorporated into substrate-bearing liposomes. Higher ceramide degradation rates were observed in vesicles with increased membrane curvature. Dilution assays indicated that acid ceramidase remained bound to the liposomal surface during catalysis. Not only SAP-D, but also SAP-C and SAP-A, were found to be stimulators of ceramide hydrolysis in the presence of anionic phospholipids. This finding was confirmed by cell culture studies, in which SAP-A, -C, and -D reduced the amount of ceramide storage observed in fibroblasts of a patient suffering from prosaposin deficiency. Strong protein-lipid interactions were observed for both SAP-D and acid ceramidase in surface plasmon resonance experiments. Maximum binding of SAP-D and acid ceramidase to lipid bilayers occurred at pH 4.0.

We have previously shown that the GLFG regions of Nup116p and Nup100p directly bind the karyopherin transport factor Kap95p during nuclear protein import. In this report, we have further investigated potential roles for the GLFG region in mRNA export. The subcellular localizations of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged mRNA transport factors were individually examined in yeast cells overexpressing the Nup116-GLFG region. The essential mRNA export factors Mex67-GFP, Mtr2-GFP, and Dbp5-GFP accumulated in the nucleus. In contrast, the localizations of Gle1-GFP and Gle2-GFP remained predominantly associated with the NPC, as in wild type cells. The localization of Kap95p was also not perturbed with GLFG overexpression. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments from yeast cell lysates resulted in the isolation of a Mex67p-Nup116p complex. Soluble binding assays with bacterially expressed recombinant proteins confirmed a direct interaction between Mex67p and the Nup116-GLFG or Nup100-GLFG regions. Mtr2p was not required for in vitro binding of Mex67p to the GLFG region. To map the Nup116-GLFG subregion(s) required for Kap95p and/or Mex67p association, yeast two-hybrid analysis was used. Of the 33 Nup116-GLFG repeats that compose the domain, a central subregion of nine GLFG repeats was sufficient for binding either Kap95p or Mex67p. Interestingly, the first 12 repeats from the full-length region only had a positive interaction with Mex67p, whereas the last 12 were only positive with Kap95p. Thus, the GLFG domain may have the capacity to bind both karyopherins and an mRNA export factor simultaneously. Taken together, our in vivo and in vitro results define an essential role for a direct Mex67p-GLFG interaction during mRNA export.

Ions, metabolites, and small proteins may diffuse through an ∼9-nm aqueous channel in the NPC. In contrast, the movement of large macromolecules, including proteins and RNA, is energy-dependent and facilitated (reviewed in Refs. 1Talcott B. Moore M.S.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The central channel of the proteinaceous NPC is formed by a symmetrical, 8-fold assembly of spoke-like structures sandwiched between nuclear and cytoplasmic rings. Distinct filamentous structures extend from these rings on both the nuclear and cytoplasmic faces, with the filaments on the nuclear side culminating in a basket-like structure. Overall, a vertebrate NPC measures ∼200 nm from the tips of the cytoplasmic filaments to the base of the nucleoplasmic basket (4Stoffler D. Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Yang Q. Rout M.P. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 223-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Unraveling the mechanism for active transport between the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic NPC faces will require an in-depth understanding of both the NPC itself and soluble transport factors. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae NPC is built by the oligomerization of over 30 different polypeptides collectively referred to as nucleoporins (4Stoffler D. Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J.

This includes three integral membrane proteins, a subset of proteins with predicted coiled-coil domains, several proteins with novel primary structure, and a family of 13 nucleoporins with phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domains. All FG repeat domains share the common feature of multiple FG dipeptide repeats with variable length spacers (8Rout M.P. Wente S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 357-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, there are at least two distinct subclasses: 1) glycine-leucine-phenylalanine-glycine (GLFG) repeat domains, which are separated by spacers that lack acidic residues and are enriched in serine, threonine, glutamine, and asparagine residues, and 2) phenylalanine-any amino acid-phenylalanine-glycine (FXFG) repeat domains, which have charged spacers. In vertebrates and yeast, different FG nucleoporins reside in each of the NPC substructures, and there is significant evidence for a direct involvement of FG nucleoporins in both nuclear import and export (4Stoffler D. Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J.

Recently, several reports have documented in vitrobiochemical interactions between shuttling transport factors and individual components of the NPC (reviewed in Ref. 9Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In particular, there has been considerable focus on the interactions between FG repeat nucleoporins and karyopherins (also known as importins/exportins). Karyopherins are a family of shuttling transport factors that recognize specific nuclear import or export signals in their respective cargo (reviewed in Refs. 2Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 3Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev.

All yeast FG nucleoporins have been shown to bind at least one karyopherin in vitro(reviewed in Ref. 9Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Current models for the mechanism of docking and translocation through the NPC are based on direct karyopherin-nucleoporin binding. Karyopherins also interact with the small GTPase Ran, which acts as a molecular switch regulating the association of karyopherins with their cargo and the NPC (2Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 12Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of different karyopherins (or karyopherin domains) complexed with either RanGTP or a FXFG nucleoporin were recently reported (13Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 14Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Gorlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). A comparison of the structure of importin-β when complexed with either RanGTP or an FXFG repeat region has suggested binding of RanGTP to importin-β may induce a conformational change in importin-β that occludes the FXFG repeat binding site. This would release importin-β from the nucleoporin. However, it is unclear if such a mechanism contributes to vectoral movement along the central axis of the NPC or to a terminal release step from the NPC. Several factors with specific roles in mRNA export have also been shown to physically or genetically interact with nucleoporins. For example, in S. cerevisiae, the RNA helicase Dbp5p directly associates with Nup159p (16Schmitt C. Von Kobbe C. Bachi A. Pante N. Rodrigues J.P. Boscheron C. Rigaut G. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4332-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The mRNA export factor Gle2p physically associates with Nup116p (17Ho A.K. Raczniak G.A. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 355-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Bailer S.M. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov A. Hellwig A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and gle2mutants are synthetically lethal with a nup100 null mutant (19Murphy R. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The essential factor Gle1p interacts with Dbp5p (20Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), andgle1 mutants are synthetically lethal with eitherrip1/nup42 or nup100 null mutants (19Murphy R. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Stutz F. Kantor J. Zhang D. McCarthy T. Neville M. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2857-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The essential mRNA export factor Mex67p forms a heterodimeric complex with Mtr2p, and Mtr2p mediates association with Nup85p (22Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. Pante N. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The vertebrate Mex67p homologue, TAP, directly associates with vertebrate Nup214p, Nup98p, and hCG1 (23Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodriques J.P. Pante N. Ribbeck K. Von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Görlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA (NY). 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 24Katahira J. Sträßer K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of these nucleoporins, except Nup85p, are FG family members. Taken together, it is intriguing that both karyopherins and mRNA export factors interact with FG nucleoporins. Although much progress has been made in defining interactions between soluble transport factors and nucleoporins, the exact molecular mechanisms for translocation through the NPC are still unknown. To reveal critical events that mediate NPC translocation, we have analyzed the interface between dynamic transport factors and two homologous components of the S. cerevisiae NPC, the GLFG nucleoporins Nup116p and Nup100p. Nup116p and Nup100p are localized on both sides of the NPC (6Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 25Ho A.K. Shen T. Ryan K.J. Kiseleva E. Aach Levy M. Allen T.D. Wente S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5736-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and their C-terminal regions interact with Nup82p (25Ho A.K. Shen T. Ryan K.J. Kiseleva E. Aach Levy M. Allen T.D. Wente S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5736-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nup82p plays a key role in the localization of Nup116p at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC. Our previous studies have documented anin vivo requirement for Nup116p and Nup100p in nuclear transport (19Murphy R. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Wente S.R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Iovine M.K. Watkins J.L.

The unique N-terminal region of Nup116p binds the mRNA export factor Gle2p (17Ho A.K. Raczniak G.A. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol.

Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1699-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This suggests an essential role for the GLFG region in mRNA export. However, a direct role for karyopherins in mRNA export has not been documented. We have found that the Nup116p and Nup100p GLFG regions interact in vivo and in vitro with both the karyopherin Kap95p (27Iovine M.K. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1699-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 28Iovine M.K. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the mRNA export factor Mex67p (this work). Furthermore, Kap95p and Mex67p bind to both common and distinct aspects of the Nup116-GLFG region. All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The sequence encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused in frame before the stop codons for the chromosomal MEX67, DBP5, GLE1, andMTR2 genes. This was achieved using the gene integration method of Baudin et al. (36Baudin A. Ozier K.O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Respective polymerase chain reaction products were generated with oligonucleotides and a template containing genes for GFP and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIS5 (pGFP-HIS5; gift of J. Aitchison). The resulting DNA fragments were introduced into SWY518 by standard transformation methods and colonies selected on media lacking histidine. Correct integration was confirmed by immunoblot and direct fluorescence microscopy. The resulting strains were back-crossed to a wild type yeast strain, and the GFP-tagged progeny was used in this study. For GFP tagging the genomic copy of GLE2, a similar strategy was used except the S. cerevisiae HIS3 gene served as the selectable marker, and the polymerase chain reaction fragment was transformed into the diploid SWY595. The resulting diploid was sporulated and dissected to obtain SWY1920.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeSourceSWY518MATaade2–1::ADE2 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 his3–11,15 can1–10051SWY595MATa/α ade2–1::ADE2/ade2–1::ADE2 ura3–1/ura3–1 leu2–3,112/leu2–3,112 trp1–1/trp1–1 his3–11,15/his3–11,15 can1–100/can1–10051SWY1920MATaGLE2-GFP:HIS3 ade2–1::ADE2 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 his3–11,15 can1–100This studySWY2131MATa MEX67-GFP:HIS5 ade2–1::ADE2 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 his3–11,15 can1–100This studySWY2154MATα MEX67-GFP:HIS5 ade2–1::ADE2 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 his3–11,15 can1–100This studySWY2253MATaGLE1-GFP:HIS5 ade2–1::ADE2 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 his3–11,15 can1–100This studySWY2257MATa MTR2-GFP:HIS5 ade2–1::ADE2 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 his3–11,15 can1–100This studySWY2261MATaDBP5-GFP:HIS5 ade2–1::ADE2 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 his3–11,15 can1–100This studyL40MATa his3Δ200 trp1–901 leu2–3,112 ade2 LYS2::(LexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(LexAop)8-lacZS.

Bound antibody was detected with a rhodamine donkey anti-mouse antibody (Chemicon; 1:400). For detection of Kap95p, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (28Iovine M.K. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) raised against Kap95p was used at a 1:20 dilution (16 h, 4 °C). Bound antibody was detected with a Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch; 1:200). Images were collected with a × 100 objective on an Olympus BX50 microscope using a Dage-MTI CCD-300-RC camera (Dage MTI, Michigan City, IN). Whole cell lysates of SWY518 (MEX67) and SWY2131 (MEX67-GFP) were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2% Triton X-100 by glass bead lysis. Immunoprecipitations were conducted as described previously (25Ho A.K. Shen T. Ryan K.J. Kiseleva E. Aach Levy M. Allen T.D. Wente S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5736-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, 1 μl of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (gift from M. Linder) was used per 100 μl of cell extract. Blots were probed with an anti-GFP antibody at a 1:1000 dilution (16 h, 4 °C), affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Nup116-GLFG antibody WU956 (39Bucci M. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2439-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) at a 1:2000 dilution (16 h, 4 °C), or affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody WU600 (27Iovine M.K. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1699-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) raised against the Nup116 C-terminal region at a 1:1000 dilution (16 h, 4 °C). Bound antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) diluted 1:7500 (1 h, 23 °C). After incubation with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-1-phosphate (Promega), the blots were developed for color visualization. For purification of the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins GST-Nup116-GLFG or GST-Nup100-GLFG, Escherichia coli strains containing pSW304 or pSW433, respectively, were grown in 1 liter of LB-rich media containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C until theA600 was between 0.9 and 1.0. Cultures were induced for 3.5 h with 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and cell pellets frozen at −70 °C. Thawed pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μm pepstatin A, 0.1 μm leupeptin, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 0.01% sodium azide. 50 mg of lysozyme was added, and the suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min before sonication (15 s pulses, 15 s rest for a total of 3 min). The suspension was clarified in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 9000 × g for 30 min, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. The clarified lysate was loaded onto 2.5 ml of packed Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmDTT, 1% Triton X-100. After washing the column with 15 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, the same buffer lacking Triton X-100 was used until theA280 of the flow-through was 0. Finally, the protein was eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 20 mmglutathione. The maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions with Mex67p (MBP-Mex67) and full-length Nup116p (MBP-Nup116) were purified as above except the thawed pellets were resuspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% aprotinin, 0.1 mg/ml Pefabloc. After sonication, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m, and the clarified lysate was loaded onto 4 ml of packed amylose resin (New England Biolabs) previously equilibrated in column buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mNaCl, pH 7.0, 0.25% Tween 20). The column was washed with 15 ml of column buffer, followed by column buffer without detergent until theA280 of the flow-through was 0. Finally, the protein was eluted in the latter buffer containing 10 mmmaltose. The expression of polyhistidine (His6)-tagged Kap95p was induced in bacteria as described above, and the protein was subsequently purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. Proteins were dialyzed into either 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol (GST-Nup116-GLFG) or 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 6.8, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% casamino acids (GST-Nup100-GLFG). Binding assays were conducted as described previously (40Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) except 2 μg of protein was added per 10 μl of packed Glutathione-Sepharose. Bound and unbound fractions were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5 or 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by Coomassie staining. pSW332 and the various pSW291 constructs (Table II) were cotransformed into the yeast strain L40 (Table I), and pSW1254 and the various pSW291 constructs (Table II) were cotransformed into the yeast strain PJ69-4A (Table I). Transformants were selected on SC-leu-trp and assayed for two-hybrid interaction by growth on SC-leu-trp-his (for L40) or SC-leu-trp-his-ade (for PJ69–4A). All plasmids were checked for specificity and ability to self-activate with pCH428 (pLexA-Orc2) (41Hardy C.F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1832-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), pGBD-C1 (42James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A.

Previous studies have shown that overexpression of the Nup116-GLFG region in yeast cells results in nucleolar fragmentation, accumulation of polyadenylated RNA within the nucleus, and cell lethality (27Iovine M.K. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1699-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The GLFG overexpression phenotype does not result in any detectable NPC or nuclear envelope structural perturbations, and the overexpressed Nup116-GLFG region localizes in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (27Iovine M.K. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1699-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We previously suggested this phenotype may be due to titration of an essential GLFG-interacting factor away from the NPC. Recently, several S. cerevisiaefactors have been identified that are specifically required for mRNA export and dispensable for the transport of proteins and other classes of RNA (44Cole C.N.

https://openalex.org/W2076091442,"We investigated the association of human origin recognition complex (ORC) proteins hOrc1p and hOrc2p with chromatin in HeLa cells. Independent procedures including limited nuclease digestion and differential salt extraction of isolated nuclei showed that a complex containing hOrc1p and hOrc2p occurs in a nuclease-resistant compartment of chromatin and can be eluted with moderate high salt concentrations. A second fraction of hOrc2p that dissociates in vitro at low salt conditions was found to occur in a chromatin compartment characterized by its high accessibility to micrococcal nuclease. Functional differences between these two sites become apparent in HeLa cells that synchronously enter the S phase after a release from a double-thymidine block. The hOrc1p/hOrc2p-containing complexes dissociate from their chromatin sites during S phase and reassociate at the end of mitosis. In contrast, the fraction of hOrc2p in nuclease-accessible, more open chromatin remains bound during all phases of the cell cycle. We propose that the hOrc1p/hOrc2p-containing complexes are components of the human origin recognition complex. Thus, the observed cell cycle-dependent release of the hOrc1p/hOrc2p-containing complexes is in line with previous studies with Xenopus andDrosophila systems, which indicated that a change in ORC stability occurs after prereplication complex formation.

Work with yeast mutants has been and continues to be instrumental in the identification and characterization of proteins involved in the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. An important step toward understanding the events at replication start sites was the discovery of a complex of six proteins, Orc1p-Orc6p, that specifically recognize the yeast origins of replication (1Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The origin recognition complex (ORC)1 appears to be stably bound to chromatin sites during all cell cycle phases in yeast (2Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H.

Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Yeast Cdc6p appears to function as an ATP-dependent loading factor for the six-membered Mcm group of initiation proteins (Mcm2p-Mcm7p) (9Perkins G. Diffley J.F. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Weinreich M. Liang C. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The transition from G1 to S phase is coordinated by the timely activation of protein kinases such as the Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase and S phase-promoting cyclin-dependent kinases (see reviews in Refs. 11Wuarin J. Nurse P. Cell. 1996; 85: 785-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

It is characterized by a dissociation of Cdc6p and the Cdc45p-mediated assembly of DNA replication factors such as the single strand-specific DNA-binding protein RPA and other proteins required for the establishment of replication forks (11Wuarin J. Nurse P. Cell. 1996; 85: 785-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Zou L. Stillman B.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3086-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Possibly, Mcm proteins execute their intrinsic DNA helicase activity (17You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) at or just prior to this stage and unwind the DNA sequences to which they are bound. A similar general scheme for the assembly of early initiation proteins has been derived from biochemical studies with the Xenopussystem. In Xenopus cell-free egg extracts,Xenopus Cdc6p (xCdc6p) can only bind to chromatin carrying Orc proteins, and binding of xCdc6p was shown to be essential for the subsequent loading of xMcm3p and other Mcm proteins (18Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19Rowles A. Chong J.P. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I.

However, the Xenopus ORCs undergo interesting transitions once the prereplication complex has been assembled. Interactions of xOrc proteins and xCdc6p with their chromatin binding sites become destabilized and sensitive to high salt concentrations (22Rowles A. Tada S. Blow J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to the activity of a cyclin A-dependent kinase (23Hua X.H. Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In fact, xOrc proteins appear to be no longer required after completion of prereplication complex formation (22Rowles A. Tada S. Blow J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hua X.H. Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Sun W. Hola M. Pedley K. Tada S. Blow J.J. Todorov I.T. Kearsey S.E. Brooks R.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 683-695PubMed Google Scholar), and xOrc protein cannot be detected on mitotic chromatin (18Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cell cycle-dependent variations in Orc proteins have also been detected studying Orc1p in developing Drosophilaembryos. Drosophila Orc1p can only be detected in actively proliferating cells as well as in cells arrested in the G1phase, but not in cells arrested after completion of DNA replication (25Royzman I. Austin R.J. Bosco G. Bell S.P. Orr-Weaver T.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Asano M. Wharton R.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2435-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, even though the overall mechanism of prereplication complex formation is probably conserved among eukaryotes, interesting differences appear to exist between yeast and metazoan ORCs as yeast ORCs remain stably bound to origins during all cell cycle phases whereas the interactions of Xenopus andDrosophila ORCs with their cognate chromatin sites seem to vary during the cell cycle. Recent evidence suggests that this conclusion may not be restricted to the early developmental stages ofXenopus and Drosophila systems but applies to cultured mammalian cells as well (27Natale D.A. Li C.J. Sun W.H. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2728-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has been shown that nuclei prepared from hamster cells just released from a mitotic nocodazole block can only be induced to replicate their genomes when incubated inXenopus egg extracts with sufficient quantities of xOrc1p. Exogenous xOrc1p initiates replication at sites in the hamster genome that are not normally used as replication origins. In contrast, hamster cell nuclei prepared at later times after release from the nocodazole block do not depend on exogenous xOrc1p, but have assembled their own functional ORCs with endogenous Orc1p and are able to activate genuine hamster cell origins (27Natale D.A. Li C.J. Sun W.H. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2728-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These important findings suggest that functional mammalian ORCs assemble each time a cell enters the G1 phase. However, we have previously shown that human Orc2p (hOrc2p) remains bound to chromatin during the entire HeLa cell cycle (28Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), an observation that appears to be in conflict with the possibility of a cell cycle-dependent assembly of new ORCs. To better understand this situation we now report on experiments that address this issue and describe hOrc1p dissociation from its chromatin binding sites during S phase together with a fraction of hOrc2p that is complexed to hOrc1p. Another and possibly larger fraction of hOrc2p appears not to be complexed with hOrc1p and occurs in a different chromatin compartment. It is this fraction of hOrc2p that remains bound to chromatin during the entire cell cycle. Human HeLa S3 cells were grown on plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block at the beginning of the S phase and released into thymidine-free medium (29Krek W. DeCaprio J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). S phase was determined by pulse-labeling with [3H]thymidine and mitosis by determining mitotic indices exactly as described before (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 28Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells were washed on plates with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in hypotonic buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.5). After 15 min on ice, the swollen cells were broken by Dounce homogenization and centrifuged to separate the cytosolic supernatant from the nuclear pellet. Nuclei were resuspended in buffer A with 0.5% Nonidet P40 and kept on ice for 15 min to lyse the nuclear envelope. Centrifugation separated the free nucleosolic proteins from the pelleted nuclei. The pellet was washed with buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.3 m sucrose, pH 7.5) plus NaCl in concentrations of 0.1–0.45 m (see below) to release structure-bound proteins. The isolation of S1,S2, and P chromatin fractions was based on the procedure described by Rose and Garrard (30Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared as described in “Cell Fractionation” and investigated by micrococcal nuclease digestions performed in buffer B supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 100 mm NaCl (final concentration) under the conditions described in the “Results.” Digested chromatin was used for immunoblotting (see below) or deproteinized (0.5% SDS, proteinase K: 200 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C) and investigated by agarose gel (0.8%) electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Chromatin was prepared under low ionic strength conditions first described by Hancock (31Hancock R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and detailed in (28Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). DNA concentrations were determined with Hoechst 33528 by fluorimetry (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco). Complete cDNA sequences encoding human proteins Orc1 and Orc2 have been described (32Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B. Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by B. Stillman, Cold Spring Harbor. The cDNAs were recloned in the expression vector pRSET (Invitrogen) and sequenced to check the cloning results and the integrity of the coding regions. His-tagged polypeptides were expressed in bacteria and purified as insoluble inclusion bodies. These were used as antigens to induce antisera in rabbits. Monospecific antibodies were prepared from the crude antisera by affinity-chromatography (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Handbook. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1988Google Scholar) using the antigen immobilized on a SulfoLink gel (Pierce). Affinity-purified antibodies against individual Mcm proteins have been described (28Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Antibodies were used for immunoprecipitations and for immunoblotting experiments essentially as originally described (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The membranes were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Affinity-purified monospecific antibodies against hOrc1p and hOrc2p were used to investigate unfractionated protein extracts prepared at 0.4 m NaCl from isolated HeLa cell nuclei (Fig.1 A, left). The hOrc1p-specific antibodies recognized in immunoblots a single polypeptide band with an apparent molecular weight of ∼100 kDa as expected for hOrc1p (32Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B. Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) whereas the hOrc2p-specific antibodies stained a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of ∼67 kDa, characteristic of hOrc2p (Fig. 1 B, right) (32Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B. Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In several experiments the Orc2 antibodies reacted with two closely spaced hOrc2p-related bands in immunoblots (see below). This has also been observed with independently prepared hOrc2p-specific antibodies (28Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and could indicate that isoforms of hOrc2p exist in human cells or that hOrc2p is post-translationally modified. As immunoprecipitations are important for the experiments to be reported below, we demonstrate in Fig. 1 B that the hOrc1p-specific antibodies efficiently precipitated hOrc1p just as the hOrc2p-specific antibodies precipitated hOrc2p from crude nuclear extracts. To estimate the amount of hOrc2p per cell we have immunoprecipitated hOrc2p from a known number of cells and compared the intensities of Coomassie Blue-stained bands with those of known amounts of recombinant hOrc2p (not shown). The results suggest about 104 molecules hOrc2p per cell in asynchronously proliferating HeLa cell cultures. This indicates that the amount of hOrc2p is at least an order of magnitude lower than the amount of hMcm3p in proliferating HeLa cell nuclei (35Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu D. Musahl C. Gohring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). hOrc1p could not be detected on the same gel by Coomassie Blue staining. As a first attempt to demonstrate a colocalization of hOrc1p and hOrc2p on chromatin, we treated isolated HeLa cell nuclei with micrococcal nuclease to separate different chromatin fractions as originally described by Rose and Garrard (30Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in their study on the nature of chromatin alterations during lymphocyte development. Briefly, nuclei were incubated with micrococcal nuclease in the presence of calcium ions, cooled on ice, and centrifuged to prepare the supernatant fraction (Fig.2, S1). This fraction has been described to consist of open genetically active chromatin that is deficient in histone H1 and enriched in high mobility group (HMG) proteins (30Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in an EDTA-containing buffer and again centrifuged to prepare the supernatant fraction with more compact chromatin that contains histone H1 (Ref. 30Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 2,S2). The remaining insoluble fraction includes the nuclear matrix, but also nuclease-resistant chromatin including actively transcribed gene sequences (Ref. 30Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 2, P). Their resistance against nucleases may be at least partially because of associated large protein complexes such as the RNA polymerase holoenzyme (30Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex which has previously been detected in fraction P chromatin (36Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We have investigated deproteinized aliquots from fractionsS1, S2, and P by agarose gel electrophoresis. Chromatin fragments in fraction S1 yielded the familiar ladder of mono-, di-, tri-, and oligonucleosomal DNA with a strong mononucleosomal band. This band was much less pronounced in the DNA extracted from fraction S2 as might be expected for more densely packed chromatin. The DNA extracted from the nuclease-resistant fraction P migrated as a continuous spectrum of fragments during gel electrophoresis (Fig.2 A). Immunoblotting showed that hOrc2p, but not hOrc1p, occurred in theS1 fraction of highly accessible chromatin (which also contained Mcm proteins; not shown, see Ref. 28Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar; Fig. 2 B). Neither hOrc1p nor hOrc2p could be detected in the more compact chromatin in fraction S2 (Fig. 2 B). In fact, all hOrc1p and the remaining hOrc2p were found in fraction P(Fig. 2 B), which includes nuclease-resistant chromatin and the nuclear matrix. Interestingly, the investigated Orc proteins partition to different chromatin regions. A considerable fraction of hOrc2p resides on open chromatin characterized by its accessibility to micrococcal nuclease, whereas the remaining hOrc2p together with all detectable hOrc1p is located at nuclear sites that are resistant against nuclease attack. However, the question of whether hOrc1p and hOrc2p do interact when bound to chromatin fraction P remains to be answered. Because both hOrc1p and hOrc2p occur in an insoluble fraction under conditions used in this experiment, immunoprecipitations are impossible to perform. We therefore addressed this point by performing cell fractionation experiments, because we anticipated that stable interactions between hOrc1p and hOrc2p will be at least partially conserved upon treatment of chromatin with moderately high salt concentrations. Briefly, HeLa cells were disrupted in a hypotonic buffer with 5 mm MgCl2 to preserve the integrity of the nuclear envelope (37Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cytosolic proteins (Fig.3, Cy) were separated from nuclei by low speed centrifugation. Subsequently, the nuclei were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged again to obtain a supernatant with nucleosolic proteins. (Fig. 3, Nu). The residual nuclear structure was successively eluted with increasing NaCl concentrations as indicated in Fig. 3. Both hOrc1p and hOrc2p could only be detected in the nuclei. Most hOrc2p dissociated at salt concentrations of 0.1–0.25 mNaCl. The 0.25 m NaCl-eluate also contained some hOrc1p. However, the majority of hOrc1p, together with the remaining hOrc2p, dissociated at 0.45 m NaCl, a salt concentration that was also required to mobilize chromatin-bound Mcm proteins (Fig.3). In this experiment, we used the distribution of Mcm proteins as an internal control because it is well established that in asynchronously proliferating HeLa cells, only approximately one-half of the Mcm proteins is bound to chromatin whereas the other half occurs in the nucleosol (Refs. 38Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 40Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Fig. 3, Nu and NaCleluates). In addition small amounts of Mcm proteins were detected in the cytosol (Fig. 3, Cy), which most likely originated from cells in mitosis (41Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In fact, no Mcm proteins were detected in the cytosol of cells arrested at the S/G1 boundary (not shown). Consistent with the results obtained by chromatin fractionation, elution of nuclei with NaCl indicates again that there are two subpopulations of hOrc2p. One that dissociates from chromatin under low salt conditions and a second fraction that is eluted together with hOrc1p requiring higher salt concentrations. Possible interactions between hOrc1p and hOrc2p were investigated by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4). From the 0.25 m NaCl extract, Orc1-specific antibodies precipitated not only the relatively small amounts of hOrc1p present in this extract but also some associated hOrc2p. Orc2-specific antibodies precipitated additional amounts of hOrc2p, which were obviously not associated with hOrc1p (Fig. 4 A, left panel). In contrast, both antibodies precipitated similar amounts of hOrc1p and hOrc2p from the 0.45 m NaCl eluate (Fig. 4 A, right panel) indicating that the interaction between the two proteins was stable enough to survive the various washing steps required by the immunoprecipitation protocol. However, in both salt extracts, Orc2-specific antibodies failed to coimmunoprecipitate a small fraction of hOrc1p suggesting that this fraction of hOrc1p is not complexed to hOrc2p. We wished to demonstrate that the interaction between hOrc1p and hOrc2p as observed in Fig. 4 A could be also detected in theP fraction of nuclease-treated chromatin (see Fig. 2). For that purpose, we extracted fraction P chromatin with 0.45m NaCl and analyzed the released protein by immunoprecipitation. Again Orc2-specific antibodies precipitated not only hOrc2p but also the hOrc1p present in this fraction (Fig.4 B). A conclusion from these experiments is that hOrc2p occurs in two chromatin compartments in human cells. One compartment is characterized by highly accessible chromatin and contains hOrc2p that dissociatesin vitro at 0.1–0.25 m NaCl. The second compartment is resistant to nuclease digestion. It contains hOrc1p/hOrc2p complexes, which are mobilized in buffers with 0.45m salt. The experiments described in the previous section were performed with asynchronously proliferating HeLa cells. We next performed experiments with cells that were first arrested by a double-thymidine block at the G1/S phase transition (29Krek W. DeCaprio J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and then released for a synchronous passage through S phase and mitosis. DNA synthesis and mitosis were monitored respectively by incorporation of [3H]thymidine and a determination of mitotic indices exactly as previously described (28Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). Cells were collected in 1.5-h intervals and processed for chromatin preparation according to Hancock (31Hancock R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Aliquots from samples containing equal amounts of DNA were investigated by Western blotting (Fig.5 B). The results show that large fractions of hOrc2p remained bound to chromatin during the cell cycle as reported (28Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the amounts of chromatin-bound hOrc1p decreased during S phase and early mitosis, but reappeared later in mitosis before the beginning of a new cell cycle (Fig. 5 B). Mcm3p served as a control and showed the well documented behavior of dissociation during S phase and reassociation at the end of mitosis (Fig. 5 B, Refs.38Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 40Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although the main portion of hOrc2p remains bound to chromatin, there is a slight decrease in chromatin-bound hOrc2p correlating with the release of hOrc1p from chromatin during S phase (Fig. 5 B). Taken together with the occurrence of hOrc2p in two chromatin compartments (see above) the question arises of whether the population of hOrc2p complexed to hOrc1p was released from chromatin during S phase. To address this point we applied the cell fractionation as well as the chromatin fractionation procedure to synchronously growing S phase cells (prepared at 6 h after release from a double thymidine block as in Fig. 5). First we performed cell fractionation experiments comparing cells prepared at 4 h after release from a nocodazole block with S phase cells prepared at 6 h after release from a double thymidine block. We have determined the cell cycle stages of the cell preparations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and found in agreement with others (42Herbig U. Marlar C.A. Fanning E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2631-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), that the cells prepared 4 h after nocodazole release were entirely in the G1 phase, whereas cells prepared at 6 h after release from a double thymidine block were predominantly in S phase (not shown). As shown in Fig.6 A, 0.1–0.25 mNaCl mobilized similar amounts of hOrc2p in G1 phase and in S phase nuclei. However, high salt released hOrc1p and hOrc2p from G1 phase nuclei but not from S phase nuclei showing that hOrc1p/hOrc2p-containing complexes are present on G1 phase chromatin, but not on S phase chromatin. Because hOrc1p could not be detected in the cytosolic or nucleosolic fractions of Fig.6 A, it must be concluded that hOrc1p was rapidly degraded after dissociation from chromatin. As a loading control, we eluted proteins with 2 m instead of 0.45 m NaCl to be able to detect the core histones in the same fraction as the hOrc1/hOrc2-complex. To confirm the above finding we also performed micrococcal nuclease digestion experiments comparing nuclei from asynchronously proliferating cells (as in Fig. 2) and from cells in S phase. We detected similar amounts of hOrc2p in chromatin fraction S1from asynchronized and S phase cells (Fig. 6 B, left panel). Again hOrc1p/hOrc2p-containing complexes were absent from chromatin fraction P of S phase cells which contained no detectable hOrc1p and only small amounts of hOrc2p (Fig. 6 B,right panel). The conclusions from the experiments shown in Figs. 5 and 6 are that not only hOrc1p is released from chromatin during S phase but also a subfraction of hOrc2p, located in the nuclease-resistant chromatin fraction P, which dissociates together with hOrc1p from chromatin during S phase. Only hOrc2p associated with nuclease-accessible chromatin remains bound during S phase. We have used monospecific antibodies to investigate the distribution of two components of the human origin recognition complex, hOrc1p and hOrc2p, in HeLa cells. We detected that hOrc1p and hOrc2p can only be detected on chromatin, but not as free proteins in the cytosol or in the nucleus. More importantly, most and probably all chromatin-bound hOrc1p appears to be closely associated with hOrc2p. In addition, a second fraction of hOrc2p exists that occurs independently of hOrc1p on chromatin. These conclusions were supported by two different experiments. First, differential micrococcal nuclease digestion revealed that a highly accessible chromatin fraction carries hOrc2p, but not hOrc1p, whereas a nuclease-resistant chromatin fraction contains both hOrc1p and hOrc2p; and, second, extraction of isolated chromatin with salt showed that 0.1–0.25 m NaCl sufficed to dissociate free hOrc2p from chromatin, but >0.45 m NaCl was necessary to release hOrc2p in association with hOrc1p. These results are consistent with immunoprecipitations of in vivo cross-linked chromatin (28Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,43Gohring F. Fackelmayer F.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showing that Orc1-specific antibodies precipitated nucleoprotein fragments carrying both cross-linked hOrc1p and hOrc2p whereas Orc2-specific antibodies precipitate additional nucleoprotein fragments with cross-linked hOrc2p only (not shown). Physical interaction between hOrc1p and hOrc2p was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in agreement with earlier reports describing that ectopically expressed hOrc1p is able to interact with hOrc2p in vivo (32Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B. Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, others have described that hOrc1p, extracted from normal proliferating human cells, behaves as a “single molecule entity” (44Tatsumi Y. Tsurimoto T. Shirahige K. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) implying that hOrc1p is not associated with other Orc proteins. We can presently not explain these differences, but note that the extraction buffer used here contains ATP, which may stabilize the interaction between Orc proteins (1Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The hOrc1p/hOrc2p-containing complexes, released under our conditions from chromatin at 0.45 m NaCl, were found to sediment through sucrose gradients at 7–8 S (not shown). This value is clearly higher than expected for a dimer composed of hOrc1p and hOrc2p only. It rather indicates that the complex contains additional components (45Thome K.C. Dhar S.K. Quintana D.G. Delmolino L. Shahsafaei A. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35233-35241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A possibility is that these components may be other human Orc proteins in analogy to the free heterohexameric ORCs detected in extracts fromXenopus eggs and Drosophila embryos (19Rowles A. Chong J.P. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 46Chesnokov I. Gossen M. Remus D. Botchan M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This possibility will be investigated once reliable antibodies against other human Orc proteins become available. HOrc1p/hOrc2p-containing complexes are located in chromatin regions that are resistant against nuclease digestion. Nuclease-resistant chromatin is frequently assumed to be a component of the nuclear matrix. However, the nuclear matrix is operationally defined as a structure that remains after extensive nuclease digestion and treatment with high salt (47Berezney, R., Mortillaro, M. J., Ma, H., Wei, X., and Samarabandu, J. (1995) Int. Rev. Cytol. 1–65.Google Scholar). Accordingly hOrc1p/hOrc2p-containing complexes may be associated with the nuclear matrix, but they cannot be integral components of the matrix, because they are released from the nuclease-resistant fraction by moderately high salt concentrations. They share this property with transcribing RNA polymerase (30Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (36Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), two large protein assemblies, which have also been found in nuclease-resistant chromatin. It has to be investigated whether large protein complexes may aggregate stretches of chromatin and thereby protect them against nuclease attack. hOrc2p is not only a partner of hOrc1p, but occurs also independently of hOrc1p on chromatin. An implication is that the amounts of hOrc2p in HeLa nuclei must be higher than the amounts of hOrc1p. However, it is presently not possible to express this difference in reliable numbers because Western blot analyses are not quantitative and are difficult to compare as neighboring or overlapping protein bands may affect the intensities of the immunostains. A rough estimate, based on immunostainable bands in salt-released chromatin proteins, suggests a 2–3-fold higher amount of hOrc2p than hOrc1p in HeLa cell chromatin. But these figures may need to be modified once the proteins are isolated as pure entities. What is the role of hOrc2p that occurs independently of hOrc1p in the nuclease-sensitive chromatin fraction? It is known that Orc proteins have tasks “beyond replication” (see review in Ref. 48Quintana D.G. Dutta A. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D805-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, Orc2p has been shown to be involved in the organization of heterochromatin in Drosophila (49Pak D.T. Pflumm M. Chesnokov I. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Marr J. Romanowski P. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 311-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 50Foss M. McNally F.J. Laurenson P. Rine J.

Rine J. Science. 1998; 279: 1733-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), just like yeast Orc proteins are known to have functions in transcriptional silencing and mitosis (49Pak D.T.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 45-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). If human hOrc2p performed similar functions, it would be expected to occur in more compact chromatin regions. This is clearly not the case, and further investigations on hOrc2p in extended chromatin are necessary. In either case, the fraction of hOrc2p in extended chromatin appears to have functions distinct from the fraction of hOr2p in complex with hOrc1p. We conclude this because uncomplexed hOrc2p remains stably bound to chromatin in contrast to hOrc1p/hOrc2p-containing complexes, which leave their chromatin sites when HeLa cells pass through S phase and reappear soon after mitosis with an entry into a new cycle. This was shown here by experiments with cells synchronized by a double thymidine block (Figs. 5 and 6), but we obtained consistent data studying HeLa cells after release from a nocodazole-induced mitotic block. Under these conditions, hOrc1p could be detected on chromatin at 3–5 h after removal of nocodazole (Fig. 6 A, left panel). Thus, the important conclusion is that hOrc1p/hOrc2p-containing complexes must undergo drastic structural changes during S phase, which eventually lead to their dissociation from chromatin and the loss of hOrc1p during S phase. Our data is in line with results obtained with other systems. As mentioned in the Introduction, xORC dramatically changes its structure after formation of the prereplication complex (22Rowles A. Tada S. Blow J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hua X.H. Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Sun W.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and experiments on the replication capacity of hamster cell nuclei inXenopus egg extracts gave clear evidence for a de novo assembly of functional hamster cell ORCs early in G1 phase (27Natale D.A. Li C.J. Sun W.H. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2728-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Presently, the fate of released hOrc1p in cycling HeLa cells remains unclear. We have no evidence for released hOrc1p in the cytosolic or nucleosolic fraction suggesting that released hOrc1p may be rapidly degraded. In this case, hOrc1p must be synthesized de novoat the beginning of each cell cycle. This would be consistent with the finding that the human gene encoding hOrc1p is activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner in contrast to the hOrc2p-encoding gene, which is constitutively active (55Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Leone G. Herendeen D.R. Kelly T.J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6977-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In fact, the fate of hOrc2p in the hOrc1p/hOrc2p-containing complex is uncertain. A possibility is that it enters the pool of the hOrc1p-independent hOrc2p fraction in extended chromatin. This is in clear contrast to the behavior of Mcm proteins, which also dissociate from chromatin in a replicationdependent manner, but accumulate as free proteins in the nucleosol and rebind to chromatin at the beginning of the following cell cycle. In summary, we have shown here that the hOrc1p/hOrc2p complex, components of the human replication initiation machine, do not remain on their chromatin binding sites during S phase and mitosis. This could be a powerful mechanism to prevent the rereplication of already replicated genome sections within a cell cycle. Our preliminary evidence suggests that hOrc1p is degraded during S phase and synthesized de novo when cells enter a new cell cycle. An important consideration for further research are the mechanisms by which these events are coordinated within a cell cycle. We thank Claudia Gruss and Frank O. Fackelmayer for discussions and critical reading."

FHC is an autosomal dominant disease, characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and sudden death. It is caused by missense mutations in various genes that encode for β-myosin heavy chain (13Geisterfer Lowrance A.A. Kass S. Tanigawa G. Vosberg H.P. McKenna W. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G.

Depending on the affected gene, and the site of the mutation, FHC has variable presentation with regard to its degree and severity and the extent of myocardial disarray. The clinical manifestations of FHC range from benign to severe heart failure and to sudden cardiac death. The best characterized clinical cases include patients with β-myosin heavy chain mutations who have a high level of cardiac hypertrophy and those with troponin T mutations who have less hypertrophy, but a higher incidence of sudden cardiac death in young adults. The first three identified mutations in the RLC (A13T, E22K, and P95A) were shown to be associated with a particular subtype of cardiac hypertrophy defined by mid-left ventricular obstruction (11Poetter K. Jiang H. Hassanzadeh S. Master S.R. Chang A. Dalakas M.C. Rayment I. Sellers J.R. Fananapazir L. Epstein N.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Two other RLC mutations (F18L and R58Q), identified by Flavigny et al. (12Flavigny J. Richard P. Isnard R. Carrier L. Charron P. Bonne G. Forissier J.F. Desnos M. Dubourg O. Komajda M. Schwartz K. Hainque B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), were associated with a typical form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which causes increased left ventricular wall thickness and abnormal electrocardiograph findings with no mid-cavity obliteration. The three-dimensional structure of the RLC demonstrates the close proximity of FHC mutations to either the phosphorylation site of RLC (Ser-15) or the Ca2+ binding site (amino acids 37–48). Because of this distinctive arrangement of the FHC mutations within the RLC, it was of interest to study their effect on the phosphorylation properties of human cardiac RLC (HCRLC) as well as their effect on Ca2+ binding. We have also investigated how these FHC mutations influence the secondary structure of the HCRLC as well as the combined effects of phosphorylation and Ca2+ binding on their structure. We demonstrate that both processes, phosphorylation and Ca2+ binding, are significantly altered by the FHC mutations and their effect depends upon the specific location of the missense mutation. The alterations in contractility that would result from these mutations are not known at present, and it is therefore not possible to know precisely how they might trigger the hypertrophic process. It is likely, however, that such a response would be part of a direct compensatory and/or adaptive mechanism of the heart to maintain normal cardiac function. Assessing the mechanism by which FHC mutations alter RLC function will lead to a better understanding of the physiological role of RLC in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. The cDNA for wild-type HCRLC was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers based on the published cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AF020768) and standard methods (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. >Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Barnes & Noble, New York1995: 8.0.1-8.5.9Google Scholar). The FHC RLC mutants: A13T, F18L, E22K, R58Q, and P95A, were generated using overlapping sequential polymerase chain reaction (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. >Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Barnes & Noble, New York1995: 8.0.1-8.5.9Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant cDNAs were constructed with anNcoI site at the N-terminal ATG and a BamHI site following the stop codon to facilitate ligation into theNcoI-BamHI cloning site of the pET-3d (Novagen) plasmid vector and transformation into DH5α cloning host bacteria for expression of the cDNAs of the wild-type HCRLC and the FHC mutants. The cDNAs of the proteins were transformed into BL21 expression host cells and protein expressed in large (16 liters) cultures. Expressed proteins were purified using a Q-Sepharose column followed by a DE-52 column, both equilibrated with 2 m urea, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.001% NaN3, pH 7.5. The proteins were eluted with a 1000-ml salt gradient of 0–300 mm KCl. The elution profiles from both the Q-Sepharose and the DE-52 columns for wild-type (WT) HCRLC and A13T occurred in the range of 160–200 mm KCl, for F18L, R58Q, and P95A between 210–250 mm KCl, and for E22K between 230 and 280 mmKCl. The final purity of the proteins was tested using 15% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were phosphorylated with Ca2+-calmodulin activated myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in a solution containing: 50 μm protein (in 20 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm PMSF, pH 7.5), 0.5 μm MLCK, 5.0 μm calmodulin, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 12 mm MgCl2and 5 mm ATP. A catalytically active truncated fragment of the rabbit skeletal muscle MLCK was used in this study (22Herring B.P. Stull J.T. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1724-1730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MLCK, missing the first 256 amino acids, was expressed in Sf9 cells infected by a recombinant virus (23Gao Z.H. Zhi G.

The phosphorylation reaction was carried out for 2 h at room temperature or overnight on ice. After phosphorylation the proteins were purified using a Q-Sepharose column (conditions as described above). The level of phosphorylation was measured using 8% urea-PAGE (24Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Flow dialysis was performed in a solution of 100 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0 (22 °C). All proteins were equilibrated in this buffer prior to the measurements. The flow dialysis experiments were performed according to Colowick et al. (25Colowick S.P. Womack F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 774-777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the upper chamber of the apparatus containing the protein and the labeled substrate (45Ca2+) was separated by a membrane from the lower chamber. The buffer was pumped through the lower chamber at a constant rate of 1.5 ml/30 s. The upper chamber was first equilibrated with 0.4 ml of buffer for 15 min, followed by the protein (0.4 ml) for 5 min. After adding 45Ca2+, an equilibrium was attained by flowing buffer through the lower chamber for 5 min. After steady state was reached, unlabeled substrate (Ca2+) was added at regular intervals and in varying concentrations. Fractions were collected every 30 s, and the effluent was sampled for measurement of radioactivity. The specific radioactivity of 45Ca2+ used in the experiment was 12–16 mCi/mg (from PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 2 μCi of 45Ca2+ per experiment gave sufficient radioactivity in the dialysate for accurate measurements. Data were presented using Scatchard analysis (26Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17801) Google Scholar, 27Potter J.D. Strang-Brown P. Walker P.L. Iida S.

Far-UV circular dichroism spectra (CD) were obtained using a 1-mm path quartz cell in a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were recorded at 195–250 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm at a speed of 50 nm/min and a resolution of 0.2 nm. Analysis and processing of data were done using the Jasco system software (Windows Standard Analysis, version 1.20). Ten scans were averaged, base lines subtracted, and no numerical smoothing applied. Mean residue ellipticity ([θ]MRE, in degrees·cm2/dmol) for the spectra were calculated (utilizing the same Jasco system software) using the following equation (28Greenfield N. Fasman G.D.

The optical activity of the buffer with or without Ca2+ was subtracted from relevant protein spectra. The α-helical content for each protein was calculated using the standard equation for [θ] at 222 nm (31Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). [θ]222=−30,300fH−2340Equation 3 f H is the fraction of α-helical content (f H × 100, expressed in %). The measurements were performed at 22 °C, in 10 mm phosphate buffer, 60 mm NaF, and 1 mm EGTA or 0.1 mmCaCl2 at pH 7.0. NaF was used to avoid the strong absorption of chloride ions in the far ultraviolet (32Stafford W.F. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The protein samples were equilibrated with respective Ca2+ buffers before the measurements. Spectra are presented as the mean residue ellipticity. To study the effects of FHC mutations on the phosphorylation, Ca2+ binding and the secondary structure of HCRLC, we have cloned and expressed the WT and five FHC mutants of HCRLC: A13T, F18L, E22K, R58Q, and P95A. Fig. 1 Apresents the amino acid sequence of human ventricular RLC and all the known specific missense mutations that have been associated with FHC. The Ca2+ binding (residues 37–48) and the phosphorylation sites (Ser-15) are also illustrated. Fig. 1 B demonstrates the three-dimensional representation of the HCRLC derived from the crystal structure of chicken skeletal myosin S1 (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of HCRLC containing the phosphorylation site and two of the FHC mutations, A13T and F18L, is not shown since this region of the RLC was unresolved in the reported crystal structure (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional representation of the HCRLC (Fig. 1 B) suggests that the mutations A13T, F18L, E22K, and P95A are located in close proximity to the phosphorylation site of RLC (Ser-15), whereas the E22K and R58Q mutations occur in the immediate extension of the helices flanking the Ca2+ binding loop. HCRLC-WT and the FHC mutants were tested for Ca2+ binding using the flow dialysis method. As shown in Fig. 2 and TableI, HCRLC-WT bound Ca2+ with relatively low affinity, K Ca = 6.67 ± 0.21 × 105m−1(average of n = 3 flow dialysis experiments ± S.D.). The Scatchard plots presented here are representative of one flow dialysis experiment, while the affinity constants demonstrated in Table I are the average of 2–4 flow dialysis experiments ± S.D.. Three of the FHC mutations: A13T, F18L, and P95A, decreased their Ca2+ binding affinity ∼3-fold compared with HCRLC-WT (Table I, n = 3, p < 0.003). However, two other FHC mutants, E22K and R58Q, dramatically changed the RLC's Ca2+ binding properties. The K Cavalue decreased by ∼17-fold for the E22K mutant (Fig. 2 and Table I,n = 3, p < 0.001), whereas the R58Q mutation completely impaired Ca2+ binding (Table I).Table IEffect of the FHC mutations and phosphorylation on the Ca2+binding to human cardiac RLCProteinK CaNonphosphorylatedPhosphorylatedHCRLC-WT6.67 ± 0.21 × 105 m−10.90 ± 0.06 × 105 m−1A13T2.06 ± 0.23 × 105 m−113.27 ± 0.24 × 105 m−1F18L2.38 ± 0.25 × 105 m−13.58 ± 0.88 × 105 m−1E22K0.39 ± 0.09 × 105 m−1No phosphorylationR58QNo binding3.04 ± 1.02 × 105 m−1P95A2.11 ± 0.77 × 105 m−1NDData are the average of n = 3 flow dialysis experiments ± S.D.

Phosphorylation of HCRLC-WT with Ca2+-calmodulin activated MLCK decreased its Ca2+ binding affinity by 7.4-fold (K Ca = 0.90 ± 0.06 × 105m−1, Fig.3 A and Table I,n = 3, p < 0.001). However, phosphorylation of the FHC mutants affected their Ca2+binding properties in various ways (Figs. 3 and4). The most dramatic effect was observed for the E22K mutant. This substitution prevented the E22K mutant from becoming phosphorylated. Even a 20-fold increase of the enzyme/substrate ratio and longer incubation time did not result in phosphorylated E22K (Fig. 4, lane 5). As shown in Fig. 4, the gel migration of the E22K mutant was slower than HCRLC-WT, F18L, and R58Q mutants, due to the Glu → Lys replacement that resulted in an additional positive charge of the E22K protein. The E22K mutation changes the isoelectric point of HCRLC from pI = 4.92 to pI = 5.10; therefore, the nonphosphorylated E22K migrates slower than the nonphosphorylated wild-type HCRLC. Accordingly, the phosphorylated forms of HCRLC-WT and its FHC mutants migrated faster than the nonphosphorylated ones due to the acidic phosphate group attached to Ser-15 of the phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 4). A large effect of phosphorylation was also observed for the A13T mutation. As shown in Fig. 1, this mutation is located next to Ser-15, the phosphorylation site of HCRLC. Phosphorylation of A13T resulted in a large increase (K Ca value increased from 2.06 ± 0.23 × 105m−1 to 1.33 ± 0.02 × 106m−1) in its Ca2+ binding affinity compared with nonphosphorylated A13T (Fig. 3 B and Table I, n = 3,p = 0.016). Interestingly, phosphorylated A13T demonstrated a 15-fold greater affinity for Ca2+ than phosphorylated HCRLC-WT, whereas nonphosphorylated A13T bound Ca2+ with a 3-fold lower affinity than nonphosphorylated-WT. No effect of phosphorylation on Ca2+binding to F18L was observed (Table I, n = 3). However, there was an interesting effect of phosphorylation on Ca2+binding to the R58Q mutant. This mutant did not bind Ca2+in the nonphosphorylated state but did bind Ca2+ when phosphorylated (K Ca = 3.04 ± 1.02 × 105m−1) (Table I).Figure 48% urea-PAGE of HCRLC-WT and its FHC mutants.

The CD spectra for nonmetal bound (apo) proteins are presented in Fig.5 A. The effect of the FHC mutation on the HCRLC-WT secondary structure was quantified from changes in the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. This wavelength has been shown to be sensitive to changes in the α-helical content of the protein (31Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 33Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3007-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Table II presents the calculated values (%) of the α-helical content in the apo- and the Ca2+-bound states as well as the effect of phosphorylation on HCRLC-WT and its FHC mutants. Data are the average of 2–4 experiments (n), each consisting of 10 scans. The variation in the α-helical content of the HCRLC-WT and its FHC mutants was below 2% for the individual experiments. As shown in Fig.5 A and Table II, the α-helical content of HCRLC-WT and its FHC mutants ranged from 18% to 29%, with the highest for A13T. Replacement of the alanine residue with threonine (A13T) increased the α-helical content of HCRLC from 18% (n = 4) to 29% (n = 2). This significant effect of the FHC mutation on the secondary structure of the HCRLC (p < 0.01) was quite surprising since alanine has a high potential to form α-helix. The second significant change was brought about by the E22K mutation, which resulted in an increase in the α-helical content of HCRLC from 18% to 24% (n = 2, p < 0.01). All other FHC mutations of HCRLC did not alter its α-helical content in the apo-state (Fig. 5 A and Table II).Table IIEffect of the FHC mutations, Ca2+ binding, and phosphorylation (+ P) on the α-helical content of human cardiac RLCProteinApo+ Ca2++ P+ P + Ca2+HCRLC-WT18%231818A13T29251918F18L22242221E22K2420No phosphorylationR58Q2022aNo Ca2+ binding as judged by flow dialysis.2028P95A1923NDNDThe α-helical content for each protein was calculated using the standard equation for [θ] at 222 nm (31Chen Y.H.

The variation in the α-helical content was below 2% between independent experiments. Fig. 5 B and Table II show the effect of Ca2+ binding on the far-UV CD spectrum of HCRLC-WT. Similar to other EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins, the binding of Ca2+ to HCRLC-WT increased its α-helical content from 18 to 23%. Mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm for HCRLC-WT (−7681) was similar to previous work by Huang et al. (30Huang W. Wilson G.J. Brown L.J. Lam H. Hambly B.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (−7060) and Wu and Yang (33Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3007-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (−7500) for rabbit skeletal muscle RLC. Using the equation utilized in this study to calculate the α-helical content, these values of the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm from Huang et al. (30Huang W. Wilson G.J. Brown L.J. Lam H. Hambly B.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Wu and Yang (33Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3007-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) would yield 15.6% and 17%, respectively compared with our 18% for HCRLC-WT (Table II). Similar to HCRLC-WT, the P95A mutant also had an increase in α-helical content upon Ca2+ binding (TableII). Interestingly, the binding of Ca2+ to the A13T mutant, which had the highest α-helical content among all FHC mutants in the apo-state, caused a decrease (not increase) in its α-helical content from 29% to 25% (Table II, n = 2, p< 0.05). However, the amount of α-helical content of the Ca2+-bound A13T was the same as for the other Ca2+-bound mutants. The binding of Ca2+ to the F18L mutant produced very little change in its α-helical content (Table II, n = 3, p > 0.1). The R58Q mutant did not bind Ca2+ in its nonphosphorylated form, and Ca2+ did not significantly affect its α-helical content. However, the phosphorylation restored its Ca2+ binding and the amount of α-helical content greatly increased on binding of Ca2+ to phosphorylated R58Q (28%, Table II,n = 2). Phosphorylation of HCRLC-WT did not change its α-helical content or the binding of Ca2+ to the phosphorylated form (Table II, n = 4). Only Ca2+ binding to nonphosphorylated HCRLC-WT had increased α-helical content (23%, Table II, Fig. 5 B). No change in α-helix was observed for the phosphorylated F18L and R58Q mutations in the apo-state. However, a dramatic effect of phosphorylation was observed for the A13T mutant, whose α-helical content was decreased from 29% to 19% (n = 2, p < 0.01, Table II, Fig. 5 C). The phosphorylated A13T mutant had the same α-helical content as HCRLC-WT in both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated states (Table II). Interestingly, the effect introduced by the FHC mutation (replacement of the alanine with threonine) was reversed by the phosphorylation of the mutant (decrease in α-helix from 29% to 19%). As mentioned above, the R58Q mutation had the same α-helical content before and after phosphorylation; however, Ca2+ binding only occurred with the phosphorylated form and this increased its α-helical content from 20% to 28% (n = 2, p < 0.01, Table II). This study investigates the effects of FHC mutations in myosin RLC on Ca2+ binding, phosphorylation, and secondary structural properties. Since the ventricular myosin RLC belongs to the superfamily of EF-hand Ca2+ binding proteins, it was of interest to investigate the effect of the FHC mutations on its Ca2+ binding properties. Unlike other EF-hands, RLC contains only one Ca2+ binding EF-hand domain, between amino acids 37 and 48. We have studied all known FHC RLC mutants with special attention to two mutations, E22K and R58Q, located in the immediate extension of the helices flanking the HCRLC Ca2+ binding site. Indeed, whereas A13T, F18L, and P95A mutants decreased the Ca2+affinity of RLC by 3-fold, the E22K and R58Q mutants had even greater reduction in Ca2+ affinity compared with HCRLC-WT. TheK Ca value for E22K was decreased by 17-fold, and the R58Q mutant did not bind Ca2+ at all. Interestingly, Ca2+ binding to the R58Q mutant was restored upon phosphorylation while the E22K mutant could not be phosphorylated. Even a 20-fold increase of the MLCK-calmodulin concentration did not result in phosphorylation of the E22K mutant (Fig. 4). The R58Q mutation that had Ca2+ binding completely eliminated, was quite surprising since other EF hand Ca2+-binding proteins, e.g. troponin C, calmodulin, contain the Gln residue (and not Arg) in the equivalent position in the helix C-terminal of the Ca2+ binding site. The arginine residue of HCRLC, however, is very conserved across species and a wide spectrum of other RLCs contains the Arg residue in this position (Fig. 6). It would be interesting to determine whether substitution of Arg to Gln in these RLCs would also result in the inactivation of their Ca2+binding site in the nonphosphorylated state. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the R58Q mutant at Ser-15 restored the Ca2+ binding site (Table I). The mechanism of this intriguing observation is not quite clear. Perhaps the extra negative charge from the phosphate group of the HCRLC N terminus changes the conformation of the Ca2+ binding site itself and/or the region flanking the Ca2+ binding loop, containing the R58Q residue. It is also possible that these two important regions of RLC, the Ca2+ binding and the phosphorylation sites, are communicating with each other in an allosteric manner. This was also observed for the E22K mutation with a greatly reduced Ca2+affinity that could prevent phosphorylation. It is worth mentioning that the glutamic acid that follows the phosphorylation site of RLC and precedes its Ca2+ binding site, is also conserved among species (Fig. 6). Moreover, the substitution of the positively charged Lys for the acidic Glu residue resulted in a significant increase in α-helical content of the E22K mutant compared with HCRLC-WT (TableII). All these changes induced by the E22K mutation are most likely affecting the interaction of the mutated light chain with the heavy chain of myosin. One could speculate that this mutation, which eliminates phosphorylation of the protein and reduces its affinity for Ca2+, alters working cross-bridges during contraction and may contribute to the development of hypertrophy in the human heart (34Levine R.J. Caulfield J.B. Norton P. Chantler P.D. Deziel M.R. Slayter H.S. Margossian S.S. Mol Cell Biochem. 1999; 195: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the three-dimensional representation of the HCRLC (Fig. 1 B) suggests that mutations A13T, F18L, E22K, and P95A are located in close proximity to the phosphorylation site of HCRLC. Thus, any alterations affecting the structure and/or sequence near this site would be expected to influence the phosphorylation properties of the HCRLC and/or the relationship between phosphorylation and Ca2+ binding. The first mutation located near the phosphorylation site (Ser-15), A13T, resulted in 3-fold decrease in theK Ca value, while phosphorylation of this mutant caused an additional 6-fold increase in Ca2+ affinity. TheK Ca value for phosphorylated A13T was 15 times larger than phosphorylated HCRLC-WT. Therefore, the consequences of the FHC mutation (A13T) were most profound in conditions where the protein became phosphorylated. Thus, these results clearly suggest a link between Ca2+ binding and phosphorylation, as we have reported previously (35Szczesna D. Zhao J. Guzman G. Zhi G. Stull J. Potter J.D. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: A175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unpredictably, substitution of the Ala to Thr residue resulted in a large increase in the α-helical content (TableII, Fig. 5 A). This was quite surprising since alanine is known to be predisposed to form α-helical structures. However, this residue (Ala-13) is located in the region of the RLC, which was not resolved in the crystal structure of chicken skeletal muscle myosin S1 (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar) and it is hard to predict the precise effect of the FHC mutation on the secondary structure of HCRLC. The α-helical content of the A13T mutant returned to a normal level (that of HCRLC-WT) upon phosphorylation. Therefore, phosphorylation of A13T attenuated whatever sterical constraints were introduced by this FHC mutation. This result suggests that phosphorylation of HCRLC during contraction could act as a backup mechanism attenuating the physiological consequences of the FHC mutation in the working heart. This was also true with the R58Q mutation whose Ca2+ binding properties were restored upon phosphorylation. Even in HCRLC-WT, phosphorylation reduced the Ca2+ dependent elevated α-helical content (Table II). Our results as well as others (36Frearson N. Solaro R.J. Perry S.V. Nature. 1976; 264: 801-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37Sayers S.T. Barany K. FEBS Lett. 1983; 154: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 38Moore R.L. Musch T.I.

Med. 1999; 77: 544-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) suggest that phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains of myosin could have an important physiological role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. Moreover, the relationship between phosphorylation and Ca2+binding to RLC plays a key role in the working heart (35Szczesna D. Zhao J. Guzman G. Zhi G. Stull J. Potter J.D. Biophys.

One could speculate that both of these processes may operate as adaptive and/or protective mechanisms to either attenuate the effect of the FHC mutations and/or improve performance of the working muscle. Alterations introduced by the FHC mutations most likely interfere with the interaction of the RLC with the heavy chain of myosin (40Eldin P. Cathiard A.M. Anoal M. Leger J. Mornet D. Leger J.J. Cornillon B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12558-12564Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and affect the function of myosin cross-bridges during force generation (41Szczesna D. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5246-5250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The region of the myosin heavy chain that contains the RLC has been postulated to undergo conformational changes that are important for working muscle (42Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B.

Trentham D.R. Kendrick-Jones J. Hopkins S.C. van der Heide U.A. Goldman Y.E. Sabido-David C. Dale R.E. Criddle S. Irving M. Nature. 1999; 400: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that, during active contraction, the RLC binding domain of the myosin head undergoes repetitive conformational changes (tilt and twist) and therefore may play an active role during force generation in muscle. Therefore, alterations introduced by the FHC mutations could interfere with the physiological function of the RLC and contribute to malfunctioning of the human heart. Patients with the FHC RLC mutations have developed a phenotype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, without sudden death (11Poetter K. Jiang H. Hassanzadeh S. Master S.R. Chang A. Dalakas M.C. Rayment I.

Our results suggest that phosphorylation and Ca2+ binding to HCRLC may simultaneously act to protect and attenuate the negative physiological consequences of the FHC mutations. Further work, in progress in our laboratory, is aimed at determining the physiological consequences of these mutations."

The specific essential functions of nsP3 remain unknown, but it is known to be phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. Here we have completed mapping of the individual phosphorylation sites on Semliki Forest virus nsP3 (482 amino acids) by point mutational analysis of threonine residues. This showed that threonines 344 and 345 represented the major threonine phosphorylation sites in nsP3. Experiments with deletion variants suggested that nsP3 itself had no kinase activity; instead, it was likely to be phosphorylated by multiple cellular kinases. Phosphorylation was not necessary for the peripheral membrane association of nsP3, which was mediated by the N-terminal region preceding the phosphorylation sites. Two deletion variants of nsP3 with either reduced or undetectable phosphorylation were studied in the context of virus infection. Cells infected with mutant viruses produced close to wild type levels of infectious virions; however, the rate of viral RNA synthesis was significantly reduced in the mutants. A virus totally defective in nsP3 phosphorylation and exhibiting a decreased rate of RNA synthesis also exhibited greatly reduced pathogenicity in mice. nsP3 is one of the four RNA replicase subunits encoded by alphaviruses.

Sindbis virus Semliki Forest virus nonstructural protein baby hamster kidney plaque-forming unit phosphate-buffered saline postinfection casein kinase II polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis amino acid(s) 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation have been recognized as major processes by which protein function is regulated. A wide range of proteins display phosphorylation state-dependent activity, including proteins involved in signal transduction, transcription, and the cell cycle. In the field of RNA virus replication, the phosphoprotein P of negative-strand RNA viruses with unsegmented genomes such as rhabdoviruses (order Mononegavirales) has a central function in regulating viral mRNA transcription and possibly RNA replication (1Hwang L.N. Englund N. Das T. Banerjee A.K. Pattnaik A.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5613-5620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The alphaviruses are a globally distributed group of enveloped positive-strand RNA animal viruses capable of causing fatal encephalitis; representative members include Sindbis virus (SIN)1 and Semliki Forest virus (SFV). The RNA synthesis of alphaviruses occurs in the cytoplasm, where the 5′ two-thirds of the genomic RNA (total length, ∼11.5 kilobases) is translated into a large polyprotein of ∼2500 amino acids (aa). This polyprotein, termed P1234, is autoproteolytically cleaved to yield the four subunits of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the nonstructural proteins nsP1–nsP4 (reviewed in Refs. 2Kääriäinen L. Takkinen K. Keränen S. Söderlund H. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1987; 7: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 3Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyprotein processing intermediates have distinct essential functions during the early phase of RNA replication, the synthesis of negative strands (4Lemm J.A. Rümenapf T. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Shirako Y. Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1874-1885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wang Y.-F. Sawicki S.G. Sawicki D.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6466-6475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Later in infection, the negative strands are used as stable templates for synthesis of progeny-positive strands, and for synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs coding for the structural proteins of the virus.nsP1 is an enzyme responsible for methylation and capping of viral mRNAs (7Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition, it mediates membrane association of the RNA replication complex (9Ahola T. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3164-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and its targeting onto the cytoplasmic surface of endosomes and lysosomes (10Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). nsP2 is an RNA helicase (11Gomez de Cedrón M. Ehsani N. Mikkola M.L. Garcı́a J.A. Kääriäinen L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), RNA triphosphatase (12Vasiljeva L. Merits A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17281-17287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and an autoprotease responsible for the cleavage of the nonstructural polyprotein (3Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). nsP4 is the catalytic subunit of this RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (13Barton D.J. Sawicki S.G. Sawicki D.L. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these three polypeptides has conserved amino acid sequence motifs, when compared with cellular and viral proteins of similar function: nsP4 with RNA-dependent polymerases, nsP2 with nucleic acid helicases and papain-like cysteine proteases, and nsP1 with methyltransferases (14Koonin E.V. Dolja V.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 375-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 15Ahola T. Laakkonen P. Vihinen H. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 392-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast, the functions of nsP3 are not well defined, although the protein is essential for RNA replication (16Hahn Y.S. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3142-3150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of temperature-sensitive and linker insertion mutants of SIN nsP3 have implicated it in negative-strand RNA synthesis, and possibly also in the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA (6Wang Y.-F. Sawicki S.G. Sawicki D.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6466-6475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17LaStarza M.W. Lemm J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5781-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of SFV nsP3 (482 aa) can be divided into three almost equal sections. The first third forms a small domain conserved in alphaviruses, rubella virus, hepatitis E virus, and coronaviruses (14Koonin E.V. Dolja V.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 375-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Recently, through genome sequencing, it has become apparent that this domain is widely, although not universally distributed in bacteria, archae, and eukaryotes. It usually exists on its own as a small open reading frame, but a more divergent version can be found attached to unusual histone variants, the macrohistones H2A (18Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For the moment, this unanticipated conservation imparts little insight, since none of the nsP3-related proteins have been functionally characterized. The middle third of nsP3 is only conserved between alphaviruses, whereas the last third (after Tyr324; Fig. 1) is hypervariable, showing no discernible conservation. Even the size of this C-terminal “tail” varies in different alphaviruses: SFV nsP3 has 158 aa and SIN nsP3 232 aa (3Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tail is rich in acidic residues, as well as in serine, threonine, and proline, and devoid of predicted secondary structure.nsP3 is the only alphavirus nonstructural protein modified by phosphorylation (19Peränen J. Takkinen K. Kalkkinen N. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Li G. LaStarza M.W. Hardy W.R. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. Virology. 1990; 179: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis of SFV nsP3 showed that serine and threonine residues are phosphorylated, approximately in 2:1 ratio, whereas no phosphotyrosine could be found (19Peränen J. Takkinen K. Kalkkinen N. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The major phosphorylation sites of SFV nsP3 were determined by mass spectrometric analysis in conjugation with on-target alkaline phosphatase digestion, as well as two-dimensional peptide mapping and Edman sequencing (21Vihinen H. Saarinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27775-27783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In SFV nsP3 the serines 320, 327, 332, and 335 and from 7 to 12 residues in peptide Gly338–Lys415 can be phosphorylated. SIN nsP3 is even more heavily phosphorylated on serine and threonine, leading to formation of several species of different electrophoretic mobility (20Li G. LaStarza M.W. Hardy W.R. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. Virology. 1990; 179: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Deletions in the nonconserved tail region of SIN nsP3 considerably reduce its phosphorylation, suggesting that the modification may primarily occur in this part of the protein (22LaStarza M.W. Grakoui A. Rice C.M. Virology. 1994; 202: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). nsP3 is capable of associating with cellular membranes when expressed alone (23Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1623-1627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here we have constructed truncated and point-mutated derivatives of SFV nsP3 and studied their phosphorylation. This enabled the introduction of phosphorylation-defective nsP3 variants to the SFV genome, to better understand the role of phosphorylation of nsP3 in the alphavirus life cycle. The resultant mutant viruses were characterized in cell culture with respect to growth and RNA synthesis. Finally, a virus encoding nonphosphorylated nsP3 was used in studies of neurovirulence in mice.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have completed the identification of the main phosphorylation sites of SFV nsP3 by showing that the major threonines phosphorylated are Thr344 and/or Thr345 (Fig.2). Several serine residues between amino acids 320 and 368 were also phosphorylated, possibly in a heterogeneous manner. Thus, all the identified phosphorylation sites were concentrated in a small, highly phosphorylated region (Fig. 1 B). Mutation of one or more serines/threonines affected the phosphorylation of other residues, since the effects of point mutations were not additive (Fig. 4). Specifically, mutation of either Thr344 and Thr345 or Ser320 reduced the overall phosphorylation level of nsP3 by 40–50%, but combination of these two mutations gave no additional reduction. The phosphorylated region was located in the beginning of the nonconserved C-terminal “tail” region of nsP3 (Fig. 1), extending slightly into the conserved domain, as Ser320 could be phosphorylated. However, this serine is not conserved among alphaviruses, and thus there appear to be no conserved phosphorylation sites shared by nsP3s from different alphaviruses. Nevertheless, the general feature of extensive phosphorylation of the tail seems to be shared with SIN nsP3 (22LaStarza M.W. Grakoui A. Rice C.M. Virology. 1994; 202: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Among alphaviruses, the nsP3 variable region differs in length and in composition (3Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). General similarities in the nonconserved regions of alphavirus nsP3s include the presence of proline-rich and acidic regions, which, however, show variation in length and distribution. In the SFV nsP3 nonconserved region, there are two acidic domains: aa 340–406 (15 Asp+Glu in 67 aa, 22%), and aa 453–473 (8 Asp+Glu in 21 aa, 38%) separated by a proline-rich stretch between aa 408–439 (11 prolines in 32 aa, 34%). Most of the phosphorylated sites of SFV nsP3 were in the first acidic region (Fig. 1 B), making it even more negatively charged. It remains to be determined whether phosphorylation is concentrated in a small subregion of nsP3 also in other alphaviruses. Both acidic and proline-rich domains have been suggested to be consensus motifs for transcriptional activation domains (30Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 31Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar).The C-terminal region of nsP3 (C-nsP3; Fig. 1 A) was capable of becoming phosphorylated when expressed alone, although at reduced level as compared with the full-length protein (Fig. 3). This reduced phosphorylation may reflect a different conformation leading to differential kinase recognition. Coexpression with the wild type nsP3 did not increase the phosphorylation of the C-terminal peptide, indicating that the N-terminal portion is unlikely to contribute any kinase activity itself. The N-terminal domain is related to a large protein family with unknown function, but unrelated to known kinases (18Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the reduced phosphorylation of C-nsP3 is offered by the fact that it was localized in the cytoplasm, whereas the wild type nsP3 was associated with vesicular structures. Thus, C-nsP3 might not be equally accessible to membrane-associated kinases, which may play a role in phosphorylation of the wild type nsP3 since membrane-associated nsP3 is more heavily phosphorylated than soluble nsP3 (19Peränen J. Takkinen K. Kalkkinen N. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of nsP3 was, however, not required for its peripheral membrane association.Casein kinase II (CK II) has been suggested to be the host enzyme phosphorylating SIN nsP3 (20Li G. LaStarza M.W. Hardy W.R. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. Virology. 1990; 179: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), based on an experiment in which nsP3 was immunoprecipitated from SIN-infected cells and phosphorylated in vitro by a kinase present in the precipitate. The properties of this kinase resembled those of CK II, as assessed by heparin inhibition, polyamine activation, and use of both ATP and GTP as substrate (20Li G. LaStarza M.W. Hardy W.R. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. Virology. 1990; 179: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the SIN nsP3 studied in this experiment was most likely already phosphorylated within the cells. This may have favored the binding of, and phosphorylation by CK II, which recognizes serines/threonines followed by acidic residues, including phosphorylated residues (32Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, CK II is one of the kinases involved in nsP3 phosphorylation, but there are likely to be others. In SFV nsP3, phosphorylation sites at Ser327 and Ser367 are the best potential sites for CKII (preferred recognition sequence (S/T)-X-X-(D/E)), but phosphorylation of other sites may become possible, if other sites are already phosphorylated by additional kinases (see sequence in Fig.1 B). Among SFV nsP3 phosphorylation sites, Ser320, Ser332, and Ser335 are potential protein kinase C sites (recognition sequence (S/T)-X-(R/K); Ref. 32Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SFV nsP3 Ser320 is a consensus site also for p34cdc2 kinase. Among negative-strand RNA viruses, the phosphoprotein P may also be a substrate for multiple kinases; examples include phosphorylation of canine distemper and measles virus P proteins by CK II and protein kinase C (33Das T.

Virology. 1996; 216: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Mutant viruses coding for truncated forms of SFV nsP3 replicated to high titers in BHK, Vero, and NIH cells (Fig. 7 A). nsP3 mutant Δ26 had 10% level of phosphorylation remaining as compared with wild type, whereas mutant Δ50 was not detectably phosphorylated. These results indicate that the mutated nsP3 proteins were able to carry out all their essential functions needed for RNA replication and for high rates of virus production. Therefore, these internal deletions in a region that was predicted to be devoid of secondary structure did not cause gross misfolding of the protein.When used to infect mice, the SFV nsP3Δ50 mutant virus was avirulent even with a dose of 107 pfu/mouse. The rate of viral RNA synthesis of this mutant was significantly lower than that of the wild type SFV resulting the decreased virulence in mice. However, it cannot be simply stated that the decreased RNA synthesis rate is caused solely by the lack of phosphorylation of nsP3, since deletion of amino acids around the phosphorylation sites may have made a contribution to this phenomenon. Recent study with an avirulent SFV mutant A7(74) (40Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljeström P. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2287-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has revealed the importance of nsP3 in the neuropathogenicity of SFV (28Tuittila M.T. Santagati M.G. Röyttä M. Määttä J.A. Hinkkanen A.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4579-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of nsP3, as well as the entire heterogenous C-terminal tail, which has been subject to rapid alteration during alphavirus evolution, may serve to fine-tune the replication of alphaviruses in different cell types. Further studies should reveal the role of the phosphorylated C-terminal region of nsP3 in specific interactions with components of the neuronal cells leading to neurovirulence of Semliki Forest virus. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation have been recognized as major processes by which protein function is regulated. A wide range of proteins display phosphorylation state-dependent activity, including proteins involved in signal transduction, transcription, and the cell cycle. In the field of RNA virus replication, the phosphoprotein P of negative-strand RNA viruses with unsegmented genomes such as rhabdoviruses (order Mononegavirales) has a central function in regulating viral mRNA transcription and possibly RNA replication (1Hwang L.N. Englund N. Das T. Banerjee A.K. Pattnaik A.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5613-5620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The alphaviruses are a globally distributed group of enveloped positive-strand RNA animal viruses capable of causing fatal encephalitis; representative members include Sindbis virus (SIN)1 and Semliki Forest virus (SFV). The RNA synthesis of alphaviruses occurs in the cytoplasm, where the 5′ two-thirds of the genomic RNA (total length, ∼11.5 kilobases) is translated into a large polyprotein of ∼2500 amino acids (aa). This polyprotein, termed P1234, is autoproteolytically cleaved to yield the four subunits of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the nonstructural proteins nsP1–nsP4 (reviewed in Refs. 2Kääriäinen L. Takkinen K. Keränen S. Söderlund H. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1987; 7: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 3Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyprotein processing intermediates have distinct essential functions during the early phase of RNA replication, the synthesis of negative strands (4Lemm J.A. Rümenapf T. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Shirako Y. Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1874-1885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wang Y.-F. Sawicki S.G. Sawicki D.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6466-6475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Later in infection, the negative strands are used as stable templates for synthesis of progeny-positive strands, and for synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs coding for the structural proteins of the virus. nsP1 is an enzyme responsible for methylation and capping of viral mRNAs (7Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition, it mediates membrane association of the RNA replication complex (9Ahola T. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3164-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and its targeting onto the cytoplasmic surface of endosomes and lysosomes (10Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). nsP2 is an RNA helicase (11Gomez de Cedrón M. Ehsani N. Mikkola M.L. Garcı́a J.A. Kääriäinen L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), RNA triphosphatase (12Vasiljeva L. Merits A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17281-17287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and an autoprotease responsible for the cleavage of the nonstructural polyprotein (3Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). nsP4 is the catalytic subunit of this RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (13Barton D.J. Sawicki S.G. Sawicki D.L. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these three polypeptides has conserved amino acid sequence motifs, when compared with cellular and viral proteins of similar function: nsP4 with RNA-dependent polymerases, nsP2 with nucleic acid helicases and papain-like cysteine proteases, and nsP1 with methyltransferases (14Koonin E.V. Dolja V.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 375-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 15Ahola T. Laakkonen P. Vihinen H. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 392-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the functions of nsP3 are not well defined, although the protein is essential for RNA replication (16Hahn Y.S. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3142-3150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of temperature-sensitive and linker insertion mutants of SIN nsP3 have implicated it in negative-strand RNA synthesis, and possibly also in the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA (6Wang Y.-F. Sawicki S.G. Sawicki D.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6466-6475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17LaStarza M.W. Lemm J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5781-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of SFV nsP3 (482 aa) can be divided into three almost equal sections. The first third forms a small domain conserved in alphaviruses, rubella virus, hepatitis E virus, and coronaviruses (14Koonin E.V. Dolja V.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 375-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Recently, through genome sequencing, it has become apparent that this domain is widely, although not universally distributed in bacteria, archae, and eukaryotes. It usually exists on its own as a small open reading frame, but a more divergent version can be found attached to unusual histone variants, the macrohistones H2A (18Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For the moment, this unanticipated conservation imparts little insight, since none of the nsP3-related proteins have been functionally characterized. The middle third of nsP3 is only conserved between alphaviruses, whereas the last third (after Tyr324; Fig. 1) is hypervariable, showing no discernible conservation. Even the size of this C-terminal “tail” varies in different alphaviruses: SFV nsP3 has 158 aa and SIN nsP3 232 aa (3Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tail is rich in acidic residues, as well as in serine, threonine, and proline, and devoid of predicted secondary structure. nsP3 is the only alphavirus nonstructural protein modified by phosphorylation (19Peränen J. Takkinen K. Kalkkinen N. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Li G. LaStarza M.W. Hardy W.R. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. Virology. 1990; 179: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis of SFV nsP3 showed that serine and threonine residues are phosphorylated, approximately in 2:1 ratio, whereas no phosphotyrosine could be found (19Peränen J. Takkinen K. Kalkkinen N. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The major phosphorylation sites of SFV nsP3 were determined by mass spectrometric analysis in conjugation with on-target alkaline phosphatase digestion, as well as two-dimensional peptide mapping and Edman sequencing (21Vihinen H. Saarinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27775-27783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In SFV nsP3 the serines 320, 327, 332, and 335 and from 7 to 12 residues in peptide Gly338–Lys415 can be phosphorylated. SIN nsP3 is even more heavily phosphorylated on serine and threonine, leading to formation of several species of different electrophoretic mobility (20Li G. LaStarza M.W. Hardy W.R. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. Virology. 1990; 179: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Deletions in the nonconserved tail region of SIN nsP3 considerably reduce its phosphorylation, suggesting that the modification may primarily occur in this part of the protein (22LaStarza M.W. Grakoui A. Rice C.M. Virology. 1994; 202: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). nsP3 is capable of associating with cellular membranes when expressed alone (23Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1623-1627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have constructed truncated and point-mutated derivatives of SFV nsP3 and studied their phosphorylation. This enabled the introduction of phosphorylation-defective nsP3 variants to the SFV genome, to better understand the role of phosphorylation of nsP3 in the alphavirus life cycle. The resultant mutant viruses were characterized in cell culture with respect to growth and RNA synthesis. Finally, a virus encoding nonphosphorylated nsP3 was used in studies of neurovirulence in mice. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have completed the identification of the main phosphorylation sites of SFV nsP3 by showing that the major threonines phosphorylated are Thr344 and/or Thr345 (Fig.2). Several serine residues between amino acids 320 and 368 were also phosphorylated, possibly in a heterogeneous manner. Thus, all the identified phosphorylation sites were concentrated in a small, highly phosphorylated region (Fig. 1 B). Mutation of one or more serines/threonines affected the phosphorylation of other residues, since the effects of point mutations were not additive (Fig. 4). Specifically, mutation of either Thr344 and Thr345 or Ser320 reduced the overall phosphorylation level of nsP3 by 40–50%, but combination of these two mutations gave no additional reduction. The phosphorylated region was located in the beginning of the nonconserved C-terminal “tail” region of nsP3 (Fig. 1), extending slightly into the conserved domain, as Ser320 could be phosphorylated. However, this serine is not conserved among alphaviruses, and thus there appear to be no conserved phosphorylation sites shared by nsP3s from different alphaviruses. Nevertheless, the general feature of extensive phosphorylation of the tail seems to be shared with SIN nsP3 (22LaStarza M.W. Grakoui A. Rice C.M. Virology. 1994; 202: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Among alphaviruses, the nsP3 variable region differs in length and in composition (3Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). General similarities in the nonconserved regions of alphavirus nsP3s include the presence of proline-rich and acidic regions, which, however, show variation in length and distribution. In the SFV nsP3 nonconserved region, there are two acidic domains: aa 340–406 (15 Asp+Glu in 67 aa, 22%), and aa 453–473 (8 Asp+Glu in 21 aa, 38%) separated by a proline-rich stretch between aa 408–439 (11 prolines in 32 aa, 34%). Most of the phosphorylated sites of SFV nsP3 were in the first acidic region (Fig. 1 B), making it even more negatively charged. It remains to be determined whether phosphorylation is concentrated in a small subregion of nsP3 also in other alphaviruses. Both acidic and proline-rich domains have been suggested to be consensus motifs for transcriptional activation domains (30Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 31Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar).The C-terminal region of nsP3 (C-nsP3; Fig. 1 A) was capable of becoming phosphorylated when expressed alone, although at reduced level as compared with the full-length protein (Fig. 3). This reduced phosphorylation may reflect a different conformation leading to differential kinase recognition. Coexpression with the wild type nsP3 did not increase the phosphorylation of the C-terminal peptide, indicating that the N-terminal portion is unlikely to contribute any kinase activity itself. The N-terminal domain is related to a large protein family with unknown function, but unrelated to known kinases (18Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the reduced phosphorylation of C-nsP3 is offered by the fact that it was localized in the cytoplasm, whereas the wild type nsP3 was associated with vesicular structures. Thus, C-nsP3 might not be equally accessible to membrane-associated kinases, which may play a role in phosphorylation of the wild type nsP3 since membrane-associated nsP3 is more heavily phosphorylated than soluble nsP3 (19Peränen J. Takkinen K. Kalkkinen N. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of nsP3 was, however, not required for its peripheral membrane association.Casein kinase II (CK II) has been suggested to be the host enzyme phosphorylating SIN nsP3 (20Li G. LaStarza M.W. Hardy W.R. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. Virology. 1990; 179: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), based on an experiment in which nsP3 was immunoprecipitated from SIN-infected cells and phosphorylated in vitro by a kinase present in the precipitate. The properties of this kinase resembled those of CK II, as assessed by heparin inhibition, polyamine activation, and use of both ATP and GTP as substrate (20Li G. LaStarza M.W. Hardy W.R. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. Virology. 1990; 179: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the SIN nsP3 studied in this experiment was most likely already phosphorylated within the cells. This may have favored the binding of, and phosphorylation by CK II, which recognizes serines/threonines followed by acidic residues, including phosphorylated residues (32Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, CK II is one of the kinases involved in nsP3 phosphorylation, but there are likely to be others. In SFV nsP3, phosphorylation sites at Ser327 and Ser367 are the best potential sites for CKII (preferred recognition sequence (S/T)-X-X-(D/E)), but phosphorylation of other sites may become possible, if other sites are already phosphorylated by additional kinases (see sequence in Fig.1 B). Among SFV nsP3 phosphorylation sites, Ser320, Ser332, and Ser335 are potential protein kinase C sites (recognition sequence (S/T)-X-(R/K); Ref. 32Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SFV nsP3 Ser320 is a consensus site also for p34cdc2 kinase. Among negative-strand RNA viruses, the phosphoprotein P may also be a substrate for multiple kinases; examples include phosphorylation of canine distemper and measles virus P proteins by CK II and protein kinase C (33Das T.

These results indicate that the mutated nsP3 proteins were able to carry out all their essential functions needed for RNA replication and for high rates of virus production. Therefore, these internal deletions in a region that was predicted to be devoid of secondary structure did not cause gross misfolding of the protein. When used to infect mice, the SFV nsP3Δ50 mutant virus was avirulent even with a dose of 107 pfu/mouse. The rate of viral RNA synthesis of this mutant was significantly lower than that of the wild type SFV resulting the decreased virulence in mice. However, it cannot be simply stated that the decreased RNA synthesis rate is caused solely by the lack of phosphorylation of nsP3, since deletion of amino acids around the phosphorylation sites may have made a contribution to this phenomenon. Recent study with an avirulent SFV mutant A7(74) (40Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljeström P. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2287-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has revealed the importance of nsP3 in the neuropathogenicity of SFV (28Tuittila M.T. Santagati M.G. Röyttä M. Määttä J.A.

Phosphorylation of nsP3, as well as the entire heterogenous C-terminal tail, which has been subject to rapid alteration during alphavirus evolution, may serve to fine-tune the replication of alphaviruses in different cell types. Further studies should reveal the role of the phosphorylated C-terminal region of nsP3 in specific interactions with components of the neuronal cells leading to neurovirulence of Semliki Forest virus.

https://openalex.org/W2329341179,"The development and progression of bladder cancer is associated with multiple alterations in the genome, including loss of chromosome 10. Recently, MMAC1/PTEN, a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase, has been mapped to chromosome 10q23. We previously demonstrated that MMAC1/PTEN has tumor suppressive properties in glioblastoma and prostate cancer. To investigate the efficacy of gene therapy with MMAC1/PTEN, we examined whether the exogenous introduction of MMAC1/PTEN via an adenoviral vector (Ad-MMAC) can inhibit tumor growth and reverse drug resistance to doxorubicin in human bladder cancer cells. Human bladder cancer cell lines UM-UC-3 and T24 were infected with Ad-MMAC to induce exogenous expression of MMAC1/PTEN. The cells were then analysed for cell growth and expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) and MMAC1/PTEN. UM-UC-6dox, a doxorubicin resistant subline, was infected with Ad-MMAC to evaluate its role in reversing drug resistance to doxorubicin. We found that MMAC1/PTEN suppressed tumor growth in UM-UC-3 and T24 cells with arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. We also showed that gene therapy with MMAC1/PTEN abrogated phosphorylated Akt/PKB expression in UM-UC-3, T24 and UMUC-6dox cells, and restored doxorubicin sensitivity in UM-UC-6dox. These data demonstrate that MMAC1/PTEN can induce growth suppression and increase sensitivity to doxorubicin in bladder cancer cells and suggest that the MMAC1/PTEN gene and its pathways can be therapeutic targets for bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2050458645,"Upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 and subsequent cell growth arrest or senescence is one mechanism by which normal cells are believed to respond to stress induced by the constitutively activated GTPase Ras. We hypothesize that in the absence of p21, the onset of Ras-dependent oncogenesis is accelerated. To test this hypothesis, we crossed MMTV/v-Ha-ras transgenic mice into a p21-deficient background. By 63 days of age, all 8 ras/p21−/− mice developed either malignant (mammary and/or salivary adenocarcinomas) or benign (Harderian hyperplasia) tumors. In contrast, by the same age, only one out of nine of the ras/p21+/+ mice developed a tumor. Furthermore, by 94 days of age, half of the ras/p21−/− mice, but none of the ras/p21+/+ mice, developed mammary tumors. p21-deficiency also accelerated the development of salivary (T50=66 days for ras/p21−/− vs T50=136 days for ras/p21+/+) and Harderian (T50=52 days for ras/p21−/− vs T50>221 days for ras/p21+/+) tumors. Furthermore, two out of the eight ras/p21−/− mice had metastatic lesions, one in its lungs, the other in its abdomen. None of the nine ras/p21+/+ mice had metastatic lesions. By 4 months of age, the mammary tumor multiplicity was 10-fold greater in ras/p21−/− (average 3.40 tumors/mouse) than in ras/p21+/+ (average 0.33 tumor/mouse) mice. However, once the tumors appeared, their growth rate, apoptosis level, and mitotic index were not affected by the loss of p21, suggesting that loss of p21 is critical in early but not late eventsof Ras oncogenesis. Altogether, the results show that tumor onset in MMTV/v-Ha-ras mice is p2l-dependent with loss of p2l associated with earlier tumor appearance and increased tumor multiplicity and aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2157829136,"G protein-gated inwardly rectifier K+ current in atrial myocytes (IK(ACh)) upon stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh) shows a fast desensitizing component (t 1/2 ∼ 5 s). After washout of ACh, IK(ACh) recovers from fast desensitization within < 30 s. A recent hypothesis suggests that fast desensitization is caused by depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtIns(4,5)P2), resulting from costimulation of phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled M3 receptors (M3AChR). The effects of stimulating two established PLC-coupled receptors, α-adrenergic and endothelin (ETA), on IK(ACh) were studied in rat atrial myocytes. Stimulation of these receptors caused activation of IK(ACh) and inhibition of the M2AChR-activated current. In myocytes loaded with GTPγS (guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate), causing stable activation of IK(ACh), inhibition via α-agonists and ET-1 was studied in isolation. Stimulation of either type of receptor under this condition, via Gq/11, caused a slow inhibition (t 1/2∼50 s) by about 70%. No comparable effect on GTPγS-activated IK(ACh) was induced by ACh, suggesting that PLC-coupled M3AChRs are not functionally expressed in rat myocytes, which was supported by the finding that M3AChR transcripts were not detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in identified atrial myocytes. Supplementing the pipette solution with PtIns(4,5)P2 significantly reduced inhibition of IK(ACh) but had no effect on fast desensitization. From these data it is concluded that stimulation of PLC-coupled receptors causes slow inhibition of IK(ACh) by depletion of PtIns(4,5)P2, whereas fast desensitization of IK(ACh) is not related to PtIns(4,5)P2depletion. As muscarinic stimulation by ACh does not exert inhibition of IK(ACh) comparable to stimulation of α1- and ETA receptors, expression of functional PLC-coupled muscarinic receptors in rat atrial myocytes is unlikely.

Jan Y.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 267-282Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 2Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar, 3Karschin A. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 215-220PubMed Google Scholar). Upon exposure of a myocyte to an appropriate receptor agonist, the current is activated within less than 1 s. Activation is followed by desensitization, i.e. a decay of current, made up of several components with different kinetics of onset and recovery (4Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 351-362Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Slow components seem to represent receptor desensitization, presumably mediated by phosphorylation via receptor kinase(s) and subsequent events such as receptor internalization and down-regulation (5Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 6Böhm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), but a fast component, developing with a time constant in the range of seconds, is localized downstream of the activating receptor. Several mechanisms have been proposed for fast desensitization. Shui et al. (7Shui Z. Boyett M.R. Zang W.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 77-93Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) suggested channel dephosphorylation as the underlying mechanism, whereas Hong et al. (8Hong S.G. Pleumsamran A. Kim D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H526-H537PubMed Google Scholar) reported the contribution of a nonidentified cytosolic protein. The major properties of fast desensitization, such as the rate of current decay, its membrane-delimited nature, and its dependence on receptor density, can be accounted for by a model relating fast desensitization, analogous to activation, to the nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis cycle of the G protein (9Chuang H., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11727-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). More recently, an attractive novel mechanism has been proposed (10Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that activation and fast desensitization of atrial IK(ACh)result from costimulation of two muscarinic receptors: the M2 subtype (M2AChR) which causes activation via Gi/o, whereas stimulation of the M3 subtype (M3AChR) via activation of Gq/11 stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent depletion of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PtIns(4,5)P2) in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Such a mechanism would be in line with the finding that PtIns(4,5)P2 is an important cofactor for activation of GIRK channels (11Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Horie M. Takano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15292-15297Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with one major property of acute desensitization, namely its heterologous nature. In atrial cells IK(ACh) can be activated not only by M2AChR but also, e.g. by A1 adenosine receptors (18Kurachi Y. Nakajima T. Sugimoto T. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 19Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and a sphingolipid receptor of the EDG family (20Bünemann M. Brandts B. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. Pott L.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5527-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that ACh rapidly desensitizes the response to Ado and vice versa; correspondingly, sphingosine 1-phosphate, presumably via a receptor of the EDG family (22Himmel H.M. Meyer Zu H.D. Graf E. Dobrev D. Kortner A. Schuler S. Jakobs K.H. Ravens U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), desensitizes the response to ACh and vice versa. In rat atrial myocytes overexpression of A1-receptors, a classic Gi/o-coupled species, not only increased density of Ado-induced IK(ACh) but also substantially enhanced fast desensitization of current activated via stimulation of this receptor (19Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the effect of stimulating two different intrinsic Gq/11-coupled receptors on IK(ACh) in atrial myocytes. The results support the notion that stimulation of the PLC pathway via depletion of PtIns(4,5)P2 causes inhibition of IK(ACh). However, this inhibition is slower than fast desensitization by a factor of 10. Moreover there is no evidence of significant expression of functional expression of a Gq/11-coupled muscarinic receptor, such as M3AchR, in rat atrial myocytes. Experiments were performed with local ethics committee approval. Wistar Kyoto rats of either sex (around 200 g) were anesthetized by intravenous injection of urethane (1 g/kg). The chest was opened, and the heart was removed and mounted on the cannula of a sterile Langendorff apparatus for coronary perfusion at constant flow. The method of enzymatic isolation of atrial myocytes has been described elsewhere (see Ref. 4Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 351-362Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The culture medium was fetal calf serum-free bicarbonate-buffered M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma) and 25 μg/ml kanamycin (Sigma). Cells were plated at a low density (several thousand cells/dish) on 36-mm culture dishes. Medium was changed 24 h after plating and then every 2nd day. Myocytes were used experimentally from day 0 until day 4 after isolation. No effects of time in culture were found for the key experiments. For the patch clamp measurements an extracellular solution of the following composition was used (in mm): 120 NaCl, 20 KCl, 2.0 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 10.0 Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4. The solution for filling the patch clamp pipettes for whole cell voltage clamp experiments contained (in mm) 110 potassium aspartate, 20 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 2.0 MgATP, 2.0 EGTA, 0.01 GTP or 0.5 GTPγS, 10.0 Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4. Standard chemicals for electrophysiological experiments were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). EGTA, Hepes, MgATP, adenosine, GTP, acetylcholine chloride, phenylephrine, methoxamine, and endotheline-1 were from Sigma; PtIns(4,5)P2,Pasteurella multocida toxin and U23187 were from Calbiochem. 4-Diphenylacetoxy-N-methypiperidine (4-DAMP) was from Tocris. Drugs were prepared as concentrated stock solutions either in distilled water or dimethyl sulfoxide. PtIns(4,5)P2 was dissolved in pipette solution at a nominal concentration of 500 μm. The solution was sonicated intermittently on ice for 30 min. Sonification was repeated each time before filling a new pipette. PtIns(4,5)P2 solutions were used for 1 day only. Membrane currents were measured using whole cell patch clamp. Pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass and were filled with the solution listed above (DC resistance 4–6 megohms). Currents were measured by means of a patch clamp amplifier (LM/EPC 7, Darmstadt, Germany). Signals were analog filtered (corner frequency of 1–3 kHz), digitally sampled at 5 kHz, and stored on a computer, equipped with a hardware/software package (ISO2 by MFK, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) for voltage control and data acquisition. Experiments were performed at ambient temperature (22–24 °C). Cells were voltage clamped at −90 mV, i.e. negative to EK (−50 mV), resulting in inward K+ currents. Current-voltage relations were determined by means of voltage ramps from −120 mV to +60 mV. Rapid superfusion of the cells for application and withdrawal of different solutions was performed by means of a custom made solenoid-operated flow system that permitted switching between up to six different solutions (t 1/2 ≤ 100 ms). Performance of this system was dependent on the positioning of the outlet tube in relation to the cell studied. This was routinely optimized by measuring the time course of the blocking action of Ba2+ on IK(ACh). As shown previously, activation kinetics of IK(ACh) was not limited by the rate of agonist application (19Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). RNA from cell samples was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA in 20 μl of RNase-free H2O (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was treated with 7.5 units of DNase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min at 37 °C. DNase was inactivated by adding 2.5 μl of 25 mm EDTA and heating at 65 °C for 10 min. The culture medium was replaced by rinsing the cells for 30 min with a solution containing (in mm): 120 NaCl, 20 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4. 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate was added. The solution was autoclaved before use. 10 myocytes were aspirated into glass capillaries with a ∼30-μm tip diameter using a water hydraulic micromanipulator attached to an inverted microscope. Alternatively, the cells were scratched from the dish, and a corresponding volume of the cell suspension was aspirated, which should contain also nonmyocyte cells. Capillaries were rinsed with hexamethyldisilazane (Sigma) and baked for 7 h at 240 °C before use. The content of the capillary (<0.5 μl) was expelled into a tube filled with 5 μl of lysis buffer containing: 0.8% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 substitute (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 10 mm dithiothreitol (both from Life Technologies, Inc.), and 8 units/μl RNAguard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In the experiments on selected myocytes 2.5 μl of RNase-free H2O (Qiagen) and 0.5 μl of oligo(dT)15 primer (500 μg/ml; Promega, Madison, WI) were added to the lysis solution and incubated at 42 °C for 10 min. 11 μl of RT mixture was added, containing 2.4 μl of RNase-free H2O, 4 μl of first strand buffer (5-fold), 2 μl of dithiothreitol (100 mm), 1 μl of SuperScript II RT (200 units/μl; all from Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1.6 μl of dNTP mixture (6.25 mmeach; Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). The RNA was transcribed for 1 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by heating to 95 °C for 10 min. The extracted RNA from suspended atrial cultures (see above) was transcribed by adding 10 μl of first strand buffer, 0.5 μl of SuperScript II RT, 5 μl of dithiothreitol, 1.6 μl of dNTP mixture, 1.6 μl of oligo(dT)15 primer, 0.5 μl of RNAguard, and 7.2 μl of RNase-free H2O (same reagents as above). The sample was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h before heat inactivation at 95 °C for 10 min. cDNA from the myocyte RT was amplified by dividing the content of the RT tube into two aliquots of 9.5 μl and adding 40.5 μl of PCR mixture to each tube. The PCR mixture contained 34 μl of distilled water (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.5 μl of TaqDNA polymerase (5,000 units/ml), 5 μl of PCR buffer (10-fold; both Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.5 μl of sense primer, 0.5 μl of antisense primer (both 100 pmol/μl; Life Technologies, Inc.), either for M3AChR and GAPDH or M2AChR and GAPDH. PCR from cDNA of atrial cell suspension RT was performed by mixing 1 μl of RT product, 16 μl of distilled water, 2 μl of PCR buffer, 0.4 μl of dNTP mixture, 0.2 μl of M3 primer (sense), 0.2 μl of M3 primer (antisense), and 0.2 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (same reagents as above). The sequences of primers were as follows: M2AChR, 5′-TGGCTTGGCTATTACCAGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′- ACGATGAACTGCCAGAAGAG-3′ (antisense); M3AChR, 5′-GTCGCTGTCACTTCTGGTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGCAGACTCTAACTGGATG-3′ (antisense); GAPDH, 5′-TCCGCCCCTTCCGCTGAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CACGGAAGGCCATGCCAGTGA-3′ (antisense). The primers amplify a 340-base pair fragment of GAPDH, a 468-base pair fragment of M2AChR, and a 378-base pair fragment of M3AChR. Samples were overlaid with mineral oil and incubated in a thermal cycler (PTC-150, MJ Research, Watertown, MA), first for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 50 cycles for 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, and a final extension at 72 °C at 10 min. 10 μl of RT-PCR products was subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV transillumination. As shown previously, atrial IK(ACh) in the presence of an agonist shows different components of desensitization, depending on multiple factors such as agonist concentration, receptor density, speed, and duration of agonist exposure (4Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 351-362Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ.

The slower components, occurring upon agonist exposure on a time scale of minutes to hours, are supposed to reflect receptor desensitization, analogous to other receptor-G protein-effector pathways (4Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 351-362Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol.

The fastest component, which occurs without a measurable delay upon exposure to ACh, represents a specific property of the pathway under study. The key properties of fast desensitization are defined in Fig.1. 1A shows a representative response of a native myocyte to a saturating concentration of ACh (10 μm) superfused for 50 s. After rapid activation of inward IK(ACh), the current decayed to a quasi steady-state level of 54% of the peak value. The decay could be approximated by a single exponential with a half-time of 5.28 ± 0.43 s (n = 30). A second slower phase of desensitization within the short period of time contributed to the total decay in current with less than 5% and thus could be ignored when exposure to ACh did not exceed 1 min or so. We have shown previously that this second component is likely to reflect desensitization of the M2AChR (4Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 351-362Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of fast desensitization of atrial IK(ACh) is its rapid reversibility. 30 s after starting washout of ACh-containing solution, a second challenge by the agonist resulted in a current of identical amplitude, i.e. rapid desensitization was reversed as soon as IK(ACh) had decayed to its basal level. Longer periods of exposure to ACh and/or substantially higher concentrations could result in a significant reduction of the second response, most likely because of receptor desensitization. A typical experiment, qualitatively representative of 20 myocytes studied using such a protocol, is illustrated in Fig. 1 C. The cell was challenged by a high concentration of ACh (100 μm) for about 2 min. A second exposure after an ACh-free period of 140 s resulted in a current of 68% of the initial peak amplitude (C, a); the fast desensitizing component was almost completely abolished. The half time of activation, which, at saturating agonist concentrations, is closely related to functional density of the receptor (4Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 351-362Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 549-554Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Bünemann M. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 81-92Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was increased from 120 to 210 ms (C, b). A slowing in activation rate, however, per se results in a diminution of the fast desensitizing component (19Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, comparing peak currents of two responses elicited in succession provides little reliable information on fast desensitization because receptor desensitization,i.e. a reduction in density of functional receptors, might contribute to reduction of the amplitude of the second response (10Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Another property defining fast desensitization, in contrast to receptor desensitization, is represented by its heterologous nature. Fig.1 B shows that activation of IK(ACh) by 10 μm Ado, a concentration that is saturating for this agonist, via stimulation of A1 receptors, induced a current of about 35% of the peak current that could be induced by ACh. As shown previously, sensitivity to Ado in this system is limited by low density of functional A1 receptors (19Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Superfusion of 10 μm ACh in the presence of Ado resulted in a peak inward current of only 70% of the current induced by 2 μm ACh alone. Thus, although the Ado-induced current did not show desensitization in terms of a visible kinetic component, the system was desensitized by exposure to Ado within few seconds. This subadditive behavior, first described by Kurachi et al. (27Kurachi Y. Nakajima T. Sugimoto T. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1987; 410: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), has been found for various combinations of receptor agonists, such as M2AChR/sphingolipid, or M2AChR/β-adrenergic (21Bünemann M. Liliom K. Brandts B. Pott L. Tseng J.-L. Desiderio G.M. Sun G. Miller D. Tigyi G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5527-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 28Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Brandts B. Meyer T. Pott L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These properties of fast desensitization are contradictory to the hypothesis that it is mediated by stimulation of a muscarinic M3 receptor, unless one would assume that stimulation of each receptor causing activation of IK(ACh) is paralleled by costimulation of a Gq/11-coupled subtype causing desensitization. On principle, information on how activation of PLC interferes with IK(ACh) can be obtained by stimulation of any type of putative PLC-linked receptor expressed in the system under study. In line with a previous publication (29Braun A.P. Fedida D. Giles W.R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 421: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors resulted in a small activation of IK(ACh) and, concomitantly, an inhibition of IK(ACh) activated by brief pulses of ACh. A representative example is illustrated in Fig.2. Whereas there was distinct inhibition in all experiments of this type, the activation could be very small or absent. Effects comparable to those observed upon α1-adrenergic stimulation were evoked by endothelin-1 (ET-1) (not shown, compare Fig. 3) in line with a previous publication (30Yamaguchi H. Sakamoto N. Watanabe Y. Saito T. Masuda Y. Nakaya H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1745-H1753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 3Inhibition of I K( ACh ) in GTPγS-loaded myocytes by Phe and ET-1.Pipette-filling solutions contained 500 μm GTPγS.Panel A, representative recording showing stable, irreversible activation of IK(ACh) by repetitive exposure of a myocyte to 2 μm ACh. Panels B andC, representative traces showing inhibition of IK(ACh) by 100 μm Phe and by 10 nm ET-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the inhibitory effect of the α1-adrenergic agonist or ET-1 in isolation and to obtain information on its kinetic properties, IK(ACh) was routinely activated by loading the cells with the hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogue GTPγS. To accelerate activation, the cells were repetitively exposed to ACh until a steady current level was reached. Fig. 3 A shows a control trace. Once activated, the current remained fairly constant for several minutes of recording. The sample traces in Fig. 3, B andC, illustrate that 100 μm phenylephrine (Phe) and 10 nm ET-1 both caused an inhibition of IK(ACh). A comparable effect was also found if 100 μm methoxamine was used as α-agonist (not shown).The summarized data in Fig. 4 Ademonstrate that both, α1-adrenergic stimulation as well as stimulation of ETA receptors caused inhibition of IK(ACh) in GTPγS-loaded myocytes to about the same degree and with identical time course. The mean half-times of inhibition were 53.4 ± 7.9 s (Phe, n = 10) and 57.3 ± 8.8 s (ET-1, n = 10), respectively. On average, the GTPγS-activated current in the absence of Phe or ET-1, respectively, decayed spontaneously by ∼20% within 3 min (Fig.4 A). The identical kinetics of inhibition by the two receptor agonists suggest that it is not determined by the receptor species but by downstream reactions of a common signaling pathway. Compared with fast desensitization (compare Fig. 1), inhibition of IK(ACh) by activation of α1-adrenergic or ETA receptors was slower by about 1 order of magnitude. The slow time course of inhibition is unlikely to reflect slower activation of the G protein coupling to these receptors when GTP is exchanged by GTPγS. At least for the M2AChR-Gi/o pathway, using activation of IK(ACh) as an assay, activation rates were identical few seconds after breaking the patch under the pipette,i.e. before equilibration of the cytosol with GTPγS, and about 30 s later, when the response to ACh was completely irreversible, as shown in Fig. 4 B,which is qualitatively representative of 10 experiments using such a protocol. The slow decay of GTPγS-activated IK(ACh) by about 20% within 3 min in the control group could reflect an inhibitory effect caused by costimulation of putative intrinsic Gq/11-coupled muscarinic receptors. However, exposure of a GTPγS-loaded cell to a high concentration of ACh (100 μm), following activation of IK(ACh) either by ACh at a low concentration (2 μm) or by adenosine via A1 receptors,i.e. without prior muscarinic stimulation, did not cause any inhibition, as shown in Fig. 5. After activation by adenosine and subsequent exposure to 100 μmACh, the decrease in current after 3 min was 16.2 ± 4.8% (n = 6), which was not significantly different from the decrease without exposure to ACh (18.1 ± 4.2%, n= 12). We propose that the slight “spontaneous” decay of IK(ACh) resulted from slow receptor-independent activation by GTPγS of the G protein involved in the inhibitory pathway. In contrast to a recent report (10Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), from the data presented so far there is no evidence that intrinsic M3AChRs are involved in regulating IK(ACh) in adult atrial myocytes. Whereas the M2AChR represents the classic cardiac ACh receptor, the issue of expression of other subtypes in cardiac myocytes is controversial. Identification of subtypes on pharmacological grounds only is problematic, as selectivity of the ligands presently available is limited (see Fig. 7). Moreover, positive data on global M3AChR expression in the heart, without identification of the cell type, are functionally meaningless. In rat ventricular myocytes no M3AChR transcripts were detected using single cell RT-PCR, which was confirmed by Southern blot analysis and immunocytochemistry, whereas these cells were positive for both M1AChR and M2AChR (31Sharma V.K.

Med. 1995; 332: 1753-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A new idea for treating cocaine overdose is to accelerate metabolic clearance by administering an appropriate hydrolase. Plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)1 can hydrolyze cocaine to ecgonine methyl ester and reportedly accounts for all the blood-borne cocaine hydrolysis activity in humans (3Stewart D.J. Inaba T.

Pretreatment with human BChE provides rats with substantial protection against cocaine-induced cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, and locomotor hyperactivity (6Mattes C. Bradley R. Slaughter E. Browne S. Life Sci. 1996; 58: L257-L261Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Exogenous BChE is also able to rescue rats given an overdose of cocaine (7Mattes C.E. Lynch T.J. Singh A. Bradley R.M. Kellaris P.A. Brady R.O. Dretchen K.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 145: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the kcat of BChE for (−)-cocaine is only 3.9 min−1,versus 33,900 min−1 for the optimal substrate, butyrylthiocholine. We estimate that timely detoxication of a cocaine overdose, with serum levels up to 20 mg/l (8Wetli C.V. Am. J. Forensic Med. Pathol. 1987; 8: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), would require at least 100 mg of enzyme. An A328Y mutant of BChE developed by the trial and error approach (9Xie W. Altamirano C.V. Bartels C.F. Speirs R.J. Cashman J.R. Lockridge O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) showed 4–5-fold improvement in (−)-cocaine hydrolysis, but it is still not satisfactory for treatment of cocaine overdose. Because human BChE hydrolyzes synthetic (+)-cocaine (see Fig. 1) about 2,000-fold faster than the natural (−)-cocaine (see Fig. 1) (9Xie W. Altamirano C.V. Bartels C.F. Speirs R.J. Cashman J.R. Lockridge O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), elucidation of the structural factors responsible for the different catalytic rates may offer a rational strategy for engineering BChE mutants that can hydrolyze (−)-cocaine rapidly enough to treat cocaine overdose.

Nevertheless, the literature provides no explanation of how cocaine forms its Michaelis-Menten complex with BChE or why BChE hydrolyzes the unnatural stereoisomer much faster than the natural cocaine although their Km values are similar (9Xie W. Altamirano C.V. Bartels C.F. Speirs R.J. Cashman J.R. Lockridge O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Gatley S.J. Biochem.

Addressing these questions with a computational approach should reduce the need to construct and evaluate many mutant enzymes in a random search for an effective cocaine hydrolase. We chose to predict the Michaelis-Menten complex of BChE with (+)- and (−)-cocaine via docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. We reasoned that the overall hydrolysis rate constants (k3) for both natural and unnatural cocaine molecules are relatively low as compared with that for the good substrate, butyrylcholine. It was therefore plausible to assume that the binding affinities of the cocaine molecules would approximately reflect theirKm values. An advantage of this strategy was that predictions of the Michaelis-Menten complexes avoided computationally intensive ab initio calculations to address bond formation, as would have been required in predicting transition state enzyme-substrate complexes. In addition, Michaelis-Menten complexes offer crucial information regarding the initial stage of substrate binding that would not be available from the transition state complexes. From this information, we could compare calculated intermolecular interaction energies and Km values. A correlation between experimental and calculated values would provide insights into the catalytic mechanisms for hydrolysis of cocaine isomers by BChE. The Michaelis-Menten complexes would also provide a basis for predicting transition state complexes via ab initio and potential of mean force calculations (19Tobias D.J. Brooks C.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1988; 89: 5115-5127Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Pang Y.P. Miller J.L. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1717-1725Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which in turn should help identify active site residues that hinder formation of the transition state (−)-cocaine-BChE complex. Here, we report the following: 1) the predicted Michaelis-Menten complexes of BChE liganded with (−)- and (+)-cocaine stereoisomers, respectively, 2) correlation of the calculated intermolecular interaction energies of such complexes with experimentally determined Km values, and 3) pH dependence studies in support of the predicted complexes and the structural factors responsible for different hydrolysis rates of cocaine stereoisomers. The natural and unnatural cocaine structures in the protonated state (see Fig. 1) were built by employing the PREP, LINK, EDIT, PARM, and SANDER modules of the AMBER 5.0 program (21Pearlman D.A.

The RESP charges of these molecules were generated by calculating electrostatic potentials using the GAUSSIAN 98 program (23Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Gill P.M.W. Hohnson B.G.

Bayly C. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 16: 1357-1377Crossref Scopus (845) Google Scholar). All such charges are available in the supporting information. The BChE structure was modified from a theoretical 3D structure of human BChE, derived by homology modeling on the basis of the x-ray structure of Torpedo acetylcholinesterase and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis studies (10Harel M. Sussman J.L. Krejci E. Bon S. Chanal P. Massoulie J. Silman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10827-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The modification procedure included: 1) protonation or deprotonation of the Arg, Lys, Asp, Glu, His, and Cys residues; 2) addition of counter ions to neutralize the charged residues; and 3) an energy minimization of the resulting structure. To determine the protonation state, all Arg, Lys, Asp, Glu, His, and Cys residues were visually inspected. Asp and Glu were treated as deprotonated unless they were located in a hydrophobic environment. One Na+ cation was placed in the vicinity of a deprotonated, anionic residue if this residue was more than 8 Å away from a cationic residue. Arg and Lys were treated as protonated unless they were surrounded by hydrophobic residues. One Cl−anion was introduced next to the protonated, cationic residue if this residue was more than 8 Å away from an anionic residue. His was treated as protonated if it was less than 8 Å away from an acidic residue, whereas the His438 residue, which was next to an acidic residue but constituted the catalytic triad, was treated as neutral. In the structure of the neutral His, one proton was attached to the δ nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring if the resulting tautomer formed more hydrogen bonds in the protein; otherwise the proton was attached to the ε nitrogen atom. Cys was treated as deprotonated when it formed a disulfide bond. The location of every counter-ion was determined by an energy minimization, with a positional constraint applied to all atoms of the system except for the counter-ion. Such energy minimizations were performed with a nonbonded cutoff of 8 Å and a dielectric constant of 1.0. Specifically, in the BChE structure, Cys65, Cys92, Cys252, Cys263, Cys400, and Cys519 were deprotonated; His77 and His423 were protonated; His126, His214, His207, and His438 were assigned as HID (Nδ-H) tautomer, whereas His372 was assigned as HIE (Nε-H); all the Glu and Asp residues were deprotonated except that Glu441 was treated as neutral; and all the Arg and Lys residues were deprotonated. Arg40, Arg135, Arg138, Arg219, Arg465, Arg470, Arg509, Arg515, Lys9, Lys12, Lys44, Lys51, Lys60, Lys105, Lys131, Lys180, Lys190, Lys248, Lys313, Lys314, Lys458, Lys494, Asp2, Asp70, Asp87, Asp91, Asp268, Asp295, Asp301, Asp324, Asp375, Asp391, Asp454, Glu80, Glu276, Glu308, Glu363, and Glu404 were each neutralized by a nearby counter-ion (Na+ or Cl−), respectively. In the MD simulation, to neutralize the substrate-bound BChE structure, one Na+ ion was added at the center of the mouth of the catalytic gorge of BChE, and its final location was determined by energy minimization. In the docking studies, the two Na+ions added to neutralize Glu197 and Glu325 were removed because they interfered with access of cationic substrate to the active site. Conformational searches were performed for (+)- and (−)-cocaine molecules employing the CONSER program (devised by Y.-P. Pang). This program first generated conformations by specifying all discrete possibilities at 60° of arc increment in a range of 0 to 360 for five rotatable torsions of cocaine specified in Fig. 1. It then optimized such conformers with the RESP charges and the Cornell et al.(22Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W.

These duplicates include those caused by C2 symmetry of the phenyl ring. In the cluster analysis, two conformers were judged different if at least one of the defined torsions differed by more than 30° of arc. The chiralities of the molecules were preserved during energy minimizations by applying constraints on the chiral atoms and their attached atoms. All docking studies were performed by using the EUDOC program (25Pang Y.P. Kozikowski A.P. J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des. 1994; 8: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Perola E. Xu K.

A box is defined within the binding pocket to confine the translation of a ligand. The energy used to judge the preferred orientation and position of the ligand is termed intermolecular interaction energy and is defined as the potential energy of the complex relative to the potential energies of the ligand and receptor in their free states. The potential energies are calculated with the additive, all atom force field by Cornellet al. (22Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T.

The most energetically stable Michaelis-Menten complex of (−)-cocaine-BChE generated by the aforementioned docking study was used as the initial structure for the MD simulation. The complex structure was simulated in a TIP3P (32Jorgensen W.L. Chandreskhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1982; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (28658) Google Scholar) water box with a periodic boundary condition at constant temperature (298 K) and pressure (1 atm) for 1.0 ns (NCUBE = 20, QH = 0.4170, DISO = 2.20, DISH = 2.00, CUTX = CUTY = CUTZ = 8.2, NTB = 2, TEMPO = 298, PRESO = 1, TAUTP = 0.2, TAUTS = 0.2, TAUP = 0.2, NPSCAL = 0, and NTP = 1). The solvated complex consisting of 50,941 atoms was first energy-minimized for 500 steps to remove close van der Waals contacts in the system. The minimized system was then slowly heated to 298 K (10 K/ps; NTX = 1) and equilibrated for 100 ps before a 1.0-ns simulation. The time-average structure of 1000 instantaneous structures of the complex at 1-ps intervals was generated by using the CARNAL module of the AMBER 5.0 program. Hydrolysis of the two cocaine stereoisomers by BChE was measured over a range of substrate concentrations between 0.3 × Km and 3 ×Km. Enzymatic reaction of BChE with (−)-cocaine was measured by using a radiometric method developed in the Brimijoin group to achieve adequate sensitivity. Details of assay performance and validation will be published separately. Briefly, [3H](−)-cocaine (222,000 dpm) diluted with varying amounts of unlabeled (−)-cocaine was mixed with BChE in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to a final volume of 100 μl. To get maximal signal, the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml of 0.05 m HCl, and the product [3H]benzoic acid was extracted with 4 ml of toluene for quantitation by scintillation counting. Reaction with (+)-cocaine at 25 °C was simply monitored by UV spectrophotometry (17Gatley S.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), because modest amounts of BChE caused readily measured hydrolysis. Vmax andKm values were calculated by direct nonlinear fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Sigma Plot for Macintosh (Jandel Scientific). To calculate the catalytic rate constant,kcat, Vmax was divided by the concentration of active sites, previously determined by titration with echothiophate or diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Vmax andKm were measured as a function of pH over the range of 5.5 to 8.5 in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH values were determined before and after reaction to ensure that conditions were stable). Hydrolysis of (−)-cocaine was measured by the radiometric method described above, whereas that of (+)-cocaine was measured by UV spectrophotometry at 240 nm. Spontaneous hydrolysis rates in the absence of BChE (general base catalysis) were subtracted from the observed rates. Data were fitted to Equations 1 and 2. kcat app =kcat 1+H+Ka(Eq. 1) kcal /Kmapp =kca /Km1+H+2Ka(Eq. 2) These equations assume that only the enzyme-substrate complex with the catalytic His438 in its neutral state can proceed to hydrolysis. In Equation 1, Ka is the equilibrium constant for protons binding to the enzyme-substrate complex. In Equation 2, Ka is the equilibrium constant for protons binding to the free enzyme. Direct estimates of these parameters, along with associated standard errors, were calculated by the curve-fitting routine of Sigma Plot. Altogether, 15 different conformations of (−)-cocaine (derived from a conformational search) were docked to the active site of BChE by utilizing the EUDOC program. The docking results suggested that the ammonium nitrogen atom of (−)-cocaine interacts with Trp82 via cation-pi interaction in the most energetically stable complex (Fig. 2). The distance between the ammonium nitrogen atom and the midpoint of the indole ring of Trp82 was 4.4 Å. The ammonium nitrogen atom of (−)-cocaine also favorably interacted with the anionic residue Glu197, in addition to the electrostatic interactions with other anionic residues of the enzyme. The distance between the ammonium nitrogen atom and the side chain carbonyl carbon atom of Glu197 was 4.3 Å. The phenyl ring of (−)-cocaine engaged in pi-pi interactions with Tyr332 and Phe329(Fig. 2). The distances of the midpoint of the phenyl ring of (−)-cocaine to those of Tyr332 and Phe329 were 5.0 and 5.8 Å, respectively. The intermolecular interaction energy of this complex was −54.1 kcal/mol, with a van der Waals contribution of −35.4 kcal/mol and an electrostatic contribution of −18.7 kcal/mol (TableI). The carbonyl carbon atom of the benzoic ester is 5.9 Å away from the oxygen atom of the catalytic Ser198, indicating that the benzoic ester group must rotate toward Ser198 for hydrolysis. This rotation may involve pivoting about the ammonium nitrogen atom that engaged in cation-pi interaction with Trp82.Table IKinetic constants and relative intermolecular interaction energies of human BChE for (−)- and (+)-cocaine, respectivelyEnzymeKmkcatEEvdwEeleμmmin−1kcal/molkcal/molkcal/mol(−)-Cocaine9.0 ± 0.33.9 ± 0.8−54.1 ± 0.5−35.4 ± 0.5−18.7 ± 0.5(+)-Cocaine8.5 ± 0.56423 ± 24−56.7 ± 0.5−30.0 ± 0.5−26.7 ± 0.5E, total interaction energy; Evdw, interaction energy contributed by van der Waals interactions;Eele, interaction energy contributed by electrostatic interactions.

Km andkcat values were derived from UV spectrophotometric observations of reactions run in pH 7.0 sodium phosphate buffer, at 25 °C for (+)-cocaine and 37 °C for (−)-cocaine. Using the EUDOC program, the active site of BChE was also docked with 15 different conformations of (+)-cocaine derived from a conformational search. The results for the most energetically stable complex with this unnatural cocaine isomer predicted a cation-pi interaction between the ammonium nitrogen atom of (+)-cocaine and Trp82 (Fig. 2). The distance between the ammonium nitrogen atom and the midpoint of the indole ring of Trp82 was 5.1 Å. The ammonium nitrogen atom of (+)-cocaine also favorably interacts with Glu197, in addition to the electrostatic interactions with other anionic residues in the catalytic gorge. The distance between the ammonium nitrogen atom and the side chain carbonyl carbon atoms of Glu197 was 4.4 Å. In addition, the phenyl ring of (+)-cocaine weakly interacted with Tyr332 and Phe329 (Fig. 2). Thus in many respects the Michaelis-Menten complexes of the two cocaine isomers appear similar. However, the distances of the midpoint of the phenyl ring of (+)-cocaine to those of Tyr332 and Phe329 were 6.9 and 7.7 Å, respectively. The distances of the midpoint of the phenyl ring of (−)-cocaine to those of Tyr332 and Phe329 were 5.0 and 5.8 Å, respectively. Thus, these two aromatic residues of BChE have weaker interactions with (+)-cocaine than with (−)-cocaine. The intermolecular interaction energy of the (+)-cocaine-BChE complex was about 2.0 kcal/mol higher than that of the complex with (−)-cocaine: −56.7 kcal/mol, with a van der Waals contribution of −30 kcal/mol and an electrostatic contribution of −26.7 kcal/mol (Table I). The carbonyl carbon atom of the benzoic ester is 6.6 Å away from the oxygen atom of the catalytic Ser198, indicating that the benzoic ester group must rotate toward Ser198 for hydrolysis. This rotation may involve pivoting about the ammonium nitrogen atom engaged in the cation-pi interaction with Trp82. Separate 1.0-ns (1.0 fs time step) MD simulations of the (−)- and (+)-cocaine-BChE complexes were performed for the following reasons. First, although the 3D structure of BChE used in this study had been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis studies (10Harel M. Sussman J.L. Krejci E. Bon S. Chanal P. Massoulie J. Silman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10827-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), it had not been tested with MD simulation in water. That kind of simulation was deemed desirable to test self-consistency of the model. In a correct model, there would be no large root mean square deviation between the initial static and time-average structures (a tendency of unfolding) during the MD simulation. A 1.0-ns MD simulation is certainly not long enough to observe folding or unfolding of a protein. However, it is long enough to observe regional backbone conformational changes involving a partial unfolding of a 3D structure that was incorrectly folded by homology modeling. In other words, a “sustained” 1.0-ns MD simulation does not necessarily validate a model, but a failed simulation calls for a trial of alternatives (10Harel M. Sussman J.L. Krejci E. Bon S. Chanal P. Massoulie J. Silman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10827-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 11Millard C.B. Broomfield C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Model. 1998; 15: 318-327Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A second reason for MD simulation is that no alternative conformations of BChE were used in the docking studies to account for the molecular flexibility of BChE. MD simulations of the cocaine-bound BChE complexes can help to convert the most energetically stable conformation of BChE in the substrate-free state to the most energetically stable conformation of BChE in the substrate-bound state. In the present case, comparing all non-hydrogen, protein backbone atoms in the initial (−)-cocaine-BChE complex and the corresponding time-average of 1,000 instantaneous structures saved at 1.0-ps intervals during the 1.0-ns MD simulation, we found a root mean square deviation of 1.4 Å (2,104 matched atoms) (Fig.3). The corresponding root mean square deviation for the (+)-cocaine-BChE complex was 1.5 Å (2,104 matched atoms) (Fig. 3). The only regions that show significant differences between the MD structure and the homology structure are L1 (Ile69–Gly78), L2 (Ala277–Thr284), L3 (Ile356–Ser362), and L4 (Tyr373–Arg381) on the protein surface (Fig.3). These results suggest that the theoretical 3D model of BChE used in the docking studies was reliable. The time-averaged structure of the (−)-cocaine-BChE complex derived from the 1.0-ns MD simulation was consistent with the initial structure derived from the docking study. The only difference between the two structures was that the tilted T-shaped pi-pi interaction between the phenyl ring of (−)-cocaine and Tyr332 in the EUDOC-generated structure was changed to an off-center pi-pi interaction in the time-averaged structure (Fig.4). This conformational change was promoted by"

We determined the effect of low magnesium on in vitro PTH release and on the signals triggered by activation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Analogous to the in vivosituation, PTH release from dispersed parathyroid cells was suppressed under low magnesium. In parallel, the two major signaling pathways responsible for CaSR-triggered block of PTH secretion, the generation of inositol phosphates, and the inhibition of cAMP were enhanced. Desensitization or pertussis toxin-mediated inhibition of CaSR-stimulated signaling suppressed the effect of low magnesium, further confirming that magnesium acts within the axis CaSR-G-protein. However, the magnesium binding site responsible for inhibition of PTH secretion is not identical with the extracellular ion binding site of the CaSR, because the magnesium deficiency-dependent signal enhancement was not altered on CaSR receptor mutants with increased or decreased affinity for calcium and magnesium. By contrast, when the magnesium affinity of the Gα subunit was decreased, CaSR activation was no longer affected by magnesium. Thus, the paradoxical block of PTH release under magnesium deficiency seems to be mediated through a novel mechanism involving an increase in the activity of Gα subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins.

CaSR mutants with increased affinity/potency for the agonist calcium and in part enhanced constitutive activity led to permanent inhibition of PTH secretion (7Pearce S.H.S. Williamson C. Kifor O.

Therefore, patients with activated CaSR mutants suffer from hypoparathyroidism. A similar phenotype of blunted PTH secretion is seen in patients with severe magnesium deficiency (8Anast C.S.

This finding is unexpected since the effects of high magnesium on parathyroid hormone secretion are similar to those of calcium, and therefore, low magnesium should be expected to result in increased PTH secretion. And indeed, in contrast to patients, rats respond to severe hypomagnesemia with increased secretion of PTH (11Anast C.S. Forte L.F.

Am. J. Med. 1984; 76: 151-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, causality between blunted PTH secretion and magnesium deficiency is not established, although the magnesium paradox has been known for more than 20 years (8Anast C.S. Mohs J.M. Kaplan S.L.

In search for the mechanism we investigated the relationship between magnesium deficiency, PTH secretion, and CaSR-mediated signaling. We present evidence that increased activity of Gα subunits leads to enhanced signaling mediated by constitutive activation of the human CaSR. Enhanced CaSR-mediated signaling may thus constitute the link between severe hypomagnesemia and blunted PTH secretion.

For mutagenesis of Gαi we used the Escherichia coli expression vector pQE60 containing the Gαi1-cDNA with an internal nucleotide sequence after amino acid 121 encoding a hexahistidine tag. The codon coding for arginine 209 of Gαi1 was exchanged to cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis (16AbdAlla S. Zaki E. Lother H. Quitterer U. J. Biol.

For mutagenesis of the human CaSR, an additional restriction site for XhoI was introduced (silent mutation of leucine 276). The mutated cDNAs were sequenced entirely to confirm the identity of the mutants. The Gαs and Gαi1proteins (wild-type and R209C) were expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) and purified by Ni2+-agarose according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Purified proteins were desalted and concentrated by centrifugation through a Centricon concentrator with an exclusion limit of 30,000 Da (Amicon). After the addition of 20% (v/v) glycerol, the purified proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in aliquots at −80 °C at a protein concentration of 2–10 μg/μl. Gαo from bovine brain was prepared as described (17Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gαq was expressed in Sf9 cells together with Gβ1γ2 using recombinant baculoviruses. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were harvested, and membranes of baculovirus-infected cells were prepared as described (16AbdAlla S. Zaki E. Lother H. Quitterer U. J. Biol.

Membranes were directly assayed for [35S]GTPγS binding in comparison to control membranes expressing Gβ1γ2 alone, since Gαq was not stable during further purification. Membranes of HEK-293 cells transfected with the cDNA encoding the human CaSR were prepared at 4 °C by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described (18AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The membrane pellet was treated with 5 m urea, washed, and stored at a protein concentration of 0.1–0.5 μg/μl at −80 °C . Basal and receptor-stimulated binding of [35S]GTPγS to Gαi, Gαs, Gαo, and Gαq was determined as described (18AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U.

Briefly, membranes of HEK-293 cells (control or CaSR-transfected, 5–10 μg of protein/assay in 50 μl) were reconstituted with the indicated Gα subunits (40 nm) and bovine brain Gβγ (100 nm) for 30 min on ice in reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 160 nm GDP, and MgCl2 as indicated). Similar results were obtained with MgSO4. For determination of basal guanine nucleotide binding to Gα, membranes and Gβγ were omitted. The experiment was started by the addition of [35S]GTPγS (60 nm; 2 × 106 cpm/50 μl). The reaction tubes were placed at 25 °C, and at different time points, samples (50 μl) were withdrawn and passed over nitrocellulose filters followed by three washes with ice-cold washing buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4), and filter-bound radioactivity was determined. Inositol phosphate levels of dispersed parathyroid or of HEK-293 cells were determined as described (19Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Before the experiment, cells were washed with buffer (138 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm Na+-HEPES, pH 7.4) containing the indicated concentration of MgCl2 and stored in the same buffer for 15 min to equilibrate the cells with the Mg2+ concentration tested. Then 10 mm LiCl was added. After 20 min at 37 °C, cellular inositol phosphates were extracted and determined. Cellular cAMP levels were determined in dispersed parathyroid cells or in HEK-293 cells 48 h after transfection. Before the experiment the cells were washed with buffer (138 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm Na+-HEPES, pH 7.4) containing the indicated concentration of MgCl2. Cells were allowed to equilibrate with the indicated Mg2+ concentration for 15 min. Then buffer with the specified Mg2+ concentration and supplemented with 0.2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine was added, and the experiment was started by the addition of forskolin (10 μm), isoproterenol (100 nm), or buffer as a control. After 20 min at 37 °C, cellular cAMP was extracted and determined by radioimmunoassay (Immunotech). Human adenomatous or primary hyperplastic parathyroid glands removed during surgery from patients with hyperparathyroidism were immediately placed in ice-cold RPMI-medium. Dispersed parathyroid cells from parathyroid tissue were prepared by digestion with collagenase and DNase similarly as described (20Brown E.M. Hurwitz S. Aurbach G.D.

For determination of PTH release, dispersed parathyroid cells (1 × 105) were equilibrated for 1 h in incubation buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm Na+-Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with CaCl2 and MgCl2 as indicated. After washing, PTH release was performed for 10 min at 37 °C in the specified buffer. The concentration of immunoreactive PTH in the incubation medium was measured by immunoradioactive assay determining intact human parathyroid hormone (Intact PTH, Nichols Institute Diagnostics). Inositol phosphate and cAMP levels were determined in dispersed parathyroid cells similarly as described above. For determination of changes in [Mg2+]i, HEK-293 cells in incubation buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Na+-Hepes, pH 7.4) were loaded with 5 μm mag-fura-2/AM dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide with 0.02% pluronic acid for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Cells were washed three times with warmed incubation buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to ensure complete deesterification. Cells were finally washed once with fresh incubation buffer supplemented with CaCl2 and MgCl2 as indicated. Fluorescence was recorded with a PerkinElmer fluorescence photometer (LS50B) at an emission wavelength of 520 nm and an excitation wavelength alternating between 340 and 380 nm. [Mg2+]i was determined from the ratio between 340 and 380 nm as described previously (22Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. J. Biol.

To analyze whether this in vivo paradox is related to the release of PTH from parathyroid cells, we determined the effect of low magnesium on PTH secretionin vitro on dispersed parathyroid cells. As a control for calcium-dependent stimulus-secretion coupling of the parathyroid tissue from patients with hyperparathyroidism, stimulation of the CaSR by calcium was measured. Calcium as a CaSR agonist blocked the release of PTH with an EC50 of 1.5 ± 0.2 mm (n = 4) when the Mg2+concentration was 1 mm (Fig.1 A). This EC50value is in close correlation with the set-point values reported previously for human adenomas or primary hyperplasias (23Brown E.M. Wilson R.E. Thatcher J.G. Marynick S.P. Am. J. Med. 1981; 71: 565-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Wallfelt C. Gylfe E. Larsson R. Ljunghall S. Rastad J. Akerström G. J. Endocrinol. 1988; 116: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Severe magnesium deficiency was simulated by decreasing the extracellular Mg2+ to 0.1 mm. When Mg2+ was decreased, PTH secretion was blocked independently of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 1 A). These findings resemble the in vivo situation in patients; magnesium deficiency blocks PTH release, leading to concomitant hypocalcemia (8Anast C.S. Mohs J.M. Kaplan S.L. Burns T.W. Science. 1972; 210: 606-608Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 9Duran M.J. Borst G.C. Osburne R.C. Eil C. Am. J.

Med. 1978; 88: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and calcium replenishment cannot overcome this inhibition of PTH secretion (9Duran M.J. Borst G.C. Osburne R.C. Eil C. Am. J. Med. 1984; 76: 151-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The IC50 value of magnesium for the inhibition of PTH release was 0.25 ± 0.04 mm, and inhibition of PTH release is not seen before the Mg2+concentration falls below 0.5 mm (Fig. 1 B). This finding correlates again with in vivo data demonstrating that the magnesium levels in patients that induce PTH secretion block are generally very low, with concentrations varying between 0.4 and 0.1 mm (8Anast C.S. Mohs J.M. Kaplan S.L. Burns T.W. Science. 1972; 210: 606-608Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 9Duran M.J. Borst G.C. Osburne R.C. Eil C. Am. J. Med. 1984; 76: 151-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Mennes P. Rosenbaum R. Martin K. Slatopolsky E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1978; 88: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PTH secretion is inhibited by higher concentrations (>1 mm) of Ca2+ and Mg2+, which are agonists of the CaSR. Two different signaling pathways are activated by the CaSR, generation of inositol phosphates and inhibition of cAMP. Under magnesium deficiency, both signaling pathways were enhanced in dispersed parathyroid cells (Fig. 1, C andD). Generation of cAMP was inhibited to about 80–85% that of the maximum inhibition observed after stimulation with the CaSR agonist calcium (Fig. 1 C and not shown), and basal inositol phosphates were increased to 30–35% that of the maximum stimulation by magnesium or calcium (Fig. 1 D). The IC50values of the magnesium deficiency-dependent signal enhancement were similar as for the PTH secretion, i.e.0.19 ± 0.03 mm for the cAMP pathway and 0.2 ± 0.02 mm for the inositol phosphate production (Fig. 1,C and D). These findings demonstrate that magnesium deficiency affects similar signaling pathways as those activated by the CaSR. Is the CaSR necessary for mediating the effect of magnesium deficiency on PTH release? To address this question, we desensitized the CaSR on parathyroid cells by prolonged calcium stimulation. Desensitization of the CaSR was visible by a substantially decreased response to the agonist magnesium (6 mm) and calcium (2 mm), i.e. after desensitization, magnesium and calcium inhibited PTH release by only ≈10% (Fig. 2, lower panel) compared with a ≈60% inhibition of PTH release in nondesensitized control cells (Fig. 2, upper panel). Interestingly, the effect of magnesium deficiency on PTH release was suppressed similar to the response to the CaSR agonists (Fig. 2, lower panel). This finding strongly suggests that active cell surface-localized CaSRs are a prerequisite for the effect of magnesium deficiency on PTH release. Since the previous experiments suggested that the site of magnesium action lies within the axis CaSR-G-protein-effector, we further analyzed the mechanism of the magnesium paradox in a transfected cell system. Direct effects of magnesium on the signaling of the CaSR were analyzed compared with control cells without this receptor. Basal inositol phosphate levels of HEK-293 cells expressing the CaSR increased up to 2.8-fold when the Mg2+ concentration in the buffer was decreased from 1 to 0.1 mm, whereas mock-transfected cells without CaSR expression did not show any significant increase in basal inositol phosphate levels under these conditions (Fig.3 A). The IC50value of magnesium was 0.18 ± 0.02 mm. The CaSR was responsible for the increase in basal inositol phosphate levels under magnesium deficiency, since basal inositol phosphate levels increased with increasing CaSR expression levels (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the effect of magnesium deficiency on basal activation of recombinantly expressed human CaSR paralleled the effects of magnesium deficiency on parathyroid cell signaling. CaSR-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity was determined. In HEK-293 cells, forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was inhibited by the CaSR. Maximal inhibition was obtained with 5 mmCa2+ in buffer with 0.5 mm or 0.1 mm Mg2+ (not shown). Low magnesium alone resulted in partial inhibition (Fig. 3 C). The CaSR-mediated inhibition of cAMP levels at 0.1 mm Mg2+ was 64 ± 8% that of the maximum inhibition by 5 mmCa2+ (not shown). The IC50 value of magnesium was 0.25 ± 0.05 mm (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, the forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels of mock-transfected control cells were barely affected by a decrease in magnesium (Fig. 3 C). Together these findings demonstrate that the Gαi- and Gαq-mediated pathways triggered by constitutive activity of the CaSR were affected by magnesium deficiency in HEK-293 cells similarly as in dispersed parathyroid cells (cf. Fig.1). Magnesium is an agonist of the CaSR. Therefore we asked whether the extracellular magnesium binding site(s) of the CaSR is (are) involved in mediating the signal enhancement under magnesium deficiency. Different CaSR receptor mutants were expressed (Fig. 4 A). Similar expression levels of the different CaSR mutants were verified in immunoblot (Fig.4 A). Although CaSRR185Q has a nearly 10-fold decreased potency for calcium (data not shown and Ref. 15Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and magnesium (Fig. 4 B, panel II, and not shown), the IC50 value of magnesium in inhibiting basal receptor activation was similar between cells expressing mutated CaSRR185Q and the wild-type CaSR (Fig. 4 B,panel I). This finding strongly suggests that the extracellular ion binding site of the CaSR for calcium and magnesium is not involved in mediating the signal enhancement under low magnesium. CaSR mutants with altered basal activity were analyzed. Basal activity of CaSRF128Lwas increased 1.6-fold compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig.4 B, panel IV). The maximum signal enhancement observed under magnesium deficiency (0.1 mm) in CaSRF128L-expressing cells was also increased 1.5–1.8-fold compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4 B, panel III), whereas the IC50 value of magnesium in inhibiting basal CaSRF128L activation was similar between the wild-type CaSR and the mutated CaSRF128L (Fig.4 B, panel III). As a control, the EC50 value for the activation of CaSRF128L by magnesium was 3.5 ± 0.2 mm (Fig. 4, panel B, panel IV). Thus, signaling mediated by the basal activity of the wild-type CaSR and of CaSRF128L is enhanced under magnesium deficiency with similar IC50 values, but the absolute extent of this enhancement is different and depends on the basal activity of the respective CaSR. To further analyze whether basal CaSR activity determines the absolute extent of the signal enhancement by low magnesium, we coexpressed wild-type CaSR together with mutant CaSRR795W, resulting in receptor heterodimers with altered functional properties (18AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 25Bai M. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2834-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar),e.g. decreased basal activity. CaSRR795Wdisplays defective G-protein-coupling. Coexpression of CaSRR795W with wild-type CaSR decreased the affinity/potency for calcium (not shown) or magnesium about 2-fold (Fig. 4 B, panel IV). In parallel, the signal generated by the basal activity of CaSR-CaSRR795Wheterodimers was suppressed to 20–25% that of the signal of the wild-type receptor at 0.5 mm and at 0.1 mmMg2+ (Fig. 4 B, panel III). By contrast, the IC50 value of the magnesium decrease-dependent signal enhancement was not altered. Thus, a decrease in the basal activity of the CaSR is accompanied by a decrease in the absolute extent of the signal enhancement under magnesium deficiency but no change in the IC50 value of magnesium. Together these findings confirm that magnesium deficiency enhances signaling mediated by the basal activity of the CaSR. Is the basal activity of the CaSR related to the magnesium paradox of blunted PTH secretion in vivo? Since the paradox of blunted PTH secretion under severe magnesium deficiency has been observed in patients but not in rats (11Anast C.S. Forte L.F. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Inaba M. Okuno S. Imanishi Y. Nishizawa Y. Morii H. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1992; 15: 135-142PubMed Google Scholar), we compared the basal activity of the rat and the human CaSR. With 0.5 mm Mg2+, the increase in basal inositol phosphate levels of rat CaSR-expressing cells was only 15–20% that of the increase of cells expressing the human CaSR (Fig. 4 B,panels V and VI). Interestingly, a decrease in the extracellular magnesium also led to an enhancement of the signaling mediated by basal rat CaSR activity, with an IC50 value for magnesium similar to that of the human CaSR (Fig. 4 B,panel V). However, the absolute extent of the signal enhancement of the rat CaSR at 0.1 mm Mg2+ was again only 15–20% that of the human CaSR (Fig. 4 B,panel V). Equally effective levels of the human and the rat CaSR were expressed in these experiments, as determined by maximum stimulation with 10 mm Mg2+ (Fig.4 B, panel VI) and by similar concentration response relationships with EC50 values of 2.8 ± 0.3 and 5.6 ± 1 mm for calcium (not shown) and magnesium (Fig. 4 B), respectively. Together these experiments demonstrate that differences in PTH secretion under magnesium deficiency reported for patients and rats correlate with differences in the basal activity of the respective CaSRs and with differences in the absolute extent of the signal enhancement under magnesium deficiency. The findings that the IC50 values of magnesium for the signal enhancement were similar between the human and the rat CaSR and between different CaSR mutants with different basal activity or with different affinity for extracellular magnesium binding suggest a common magnesium binding site different from the extracellular ion binding site of the CaSR. Since the extracellular magnesium binding site of the CaSR did not seem to be involved in the magnesium paradox, we asked whether magnesium acted on the intracellular side of the CaSR, at the CaSR- G-protein interface. To address this question, CaSR-mediated activation of G-proteins was determined by the receptor-stimulated enhancement of [35S]GTPγS binding to recombinant Gαi-protein. A decrease of the Mg2+concentration from 1 to 0.1 mm or 0.01 mmincreased the rate of CaSR-mediated binding of [35S]GTPγS nearly 2-fold (TableI and Fig.5 A). The IC50value for the magnesium-dependent inhibition of CaSR-stimulated GTPγS binding was 0.18 ± 0.04 mm(Table I). Thus, magnesium suppresses the CaSR-mediated G-protein activation and the CaSR-stimulated activation of Gαq- and Gαi-coupled pathways with similar concentration-response relationships. These findings also demonstrate that magnesium acts within the axis receptor-G-protein.Table IIC50 [Mg2+] and t 12of the CaSR-stimulated binding of [35S]GTPγS to wild-type Gαi and to Gα iR209Creconstituted with membranes from CaSR-expressing HEK-293 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.”GαiIC50[Mg2+]t 12(1 mmMg2+)t 12(0.01 mmMg2+)mmminminWild type0.18 ± 0.049.1 ± 0.54.9 ± 0.4R209C>24.8 ± 0.34.5 ± 0.4±S.E.; n = 6. Open table in a new tab ±S.E.; n = 6. Is the magnesium binding site responsible for this inhibition of basal CaSR activation localized on the CaSR or on Gα? Since the IC50 value of magnesium for the inhibition of basal CaSR activation was not affected by CaSR mutants with increased or decreased affinity for extracellular magnesium or calcium (cf. Fig. 4), we focused on the magnesium binding site of the Gα subunit (26Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 27Coleman D.E. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14376-14385Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although magnesium effects on the activation of Gα subunits have not been detected on Gαi/o isolated from bovine brain (28Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 762-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the fact that magnesium suppresses the guanine nucleotide exchange of small GTP-binding proteins (29Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) suggests the possibility of a similar mechanism for Gα subunits. And indeed, on wild-type Gαi, magnesium inhibited basal guanine nucleotide exchange, with an IC50 of 0.18 mm (TableII). By contrast, basal guanine nucleotide exchange of a Gαi mutant, Gα iR209Cwith impaired magnesium binding (30Slepak V.Z. Quick M.W. Aragay A.M. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

However, the metabolic changes that serve as initiating conditions for cytokine withdrawal-induced death are not fully understood. Mitochondria play an essential role in many types of apoptotic death (2Johnson D.E. Front.

Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar). In some studies, cytochrome c release preceded the loss of ΔΨm (7Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4273) Google Scholar), whereas other studies reported the reverse, cytochrome c release following mitochondrial swelling, outer membrane rupture, and loss of ΔΨm (8Zamzami N.

Mitochondrial swelling is related to formation of the permeability transition (PT) pore, a complex that contains the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) (9Zamzami N.

The Bcl-2 family of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins are modulaters of these processes (11Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). However, mitochondrial swelling, loss of ΔΨm and induction of the PT pore were all reversible events in osteosarcoma cells (13Minamikawa T. Williams D.A. Bowser D.N. Nagley P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Likewise in neuronal apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane depolarization was not fatal (14Krohn A.J. Wahlbrink T. Prehn J.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7394-7404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) nor was it a factor in the death of HL-60 cells induced by actinomycin-D, etoposide, or staurosporine (15Finucane D.M. Waterhouse N.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The progression to cell death, therefore, depends on the integration of mitochondrial processes that cannot be readily dissected. Mitochondria produce energy in the form of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, a process coupled to electron transport. Enzymes of the electron transport chain catalyze the transfer of electrons from NADH to 02. The energy released through electron transport drives protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane, generating an electrochemical gradient. This distribution of protons produces both a pH gradient (with alkaline pH in the matrix and neutral pH in the cytosol) and a voltage gradient across the inner membrane or ΔΨm, the result of a net outflow of positive ions (with negative charges inside and positive charges outside; Ref. 16Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). The electrochemical proton gradient across the membrane of a respiring mitochondrion generates a potential of 200 mV, of which 60 mV results from the pH gradient (of about one pH unit; Ref. 16Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). The energy of this powerful electrochemical gradient drives the catalytic activity of the F0F1-ATPase, a member of the F class of ATP-powered proton pumps. Transport of protons back into the mitochondrial matrix through the F0 component of the F0F1-ATPase drives the conversion of ADP to ATP, which is then exported to the cytosol in exchange for ADP by ANT. In reverse, the F0F1-ATPase can use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pump protons out of the matrix through the inner membrane, increasing the ΔΨm. F0F1-ATPase can therefore synthesize or consume ATP, depending on the membrane polarization and the concentrations of ADP and ATP in a thermodynamic balance (16Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). In addition, a small inhibitory protein, IF1, which modulates the ATPase activity and proton conductance (17Guerrieri F. Scarfo R. Zanotti F. Che Y.W. Papa S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18Harris D.A. Das A.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), is thought to confer additional regulation. IF1 is pH-sensitive, increasing its inhibitory activity by binding the F0F1-ATPase in an acidic environment (19Papa S. Zanotti F. Cocco T. Perrucci C. Candita C. Minuto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,20Rouslin W. Broge C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15224-15229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we examine aspects of mitochondrial bioenergetics within the first few hours following withdrawal of IL-3 from a dependent cell line. We identify a novel pathway in which intracellular alkalinization induces mitochondrial hyperpolarization and total cellular ATP loss, which represent significant metabolic stresses to the cell and set the stage for later events in apoptotic cell death.

Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Because accumulation of the JC-1 dye is reversible, cells were maintained in a stable concentration of the dye throughout the time of measurement. After 20-min incubation at 37 °C, cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Dead cells were excluded by forward and side scatter gating. Data were accumulated by analyzing an average population of 20,000 cells. JC-1 aggregates were detectable in the propidium iodide channel (red fluorescence, emission at 590 nm), and JC-1 monomers were detectable in the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel (green fluorescence, emission at 527 nm) (26Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). To measure changes in intracellular pH, cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) deprived of cytokine for various times were treated with 1 μm 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxy ethyl)-5-(and 6)-carboxy fluorescein (BCECF)-acetomethyl ester (Molecular Probes) as previously described (21Khaled A.R.

Schutz B. Poisson L. Nabet P. J. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and assayed by flow cytometry. Dead cells were excluded by forward and side scatter gating. A pH calibration curve was generated by preloading cells with 1 μm BCECF-acetomethyl ester followed by incubation for 30 min in a high K-Hepes buffer (see below) at different pH values from 6.8 to 8.0 in the presence of the permeabilizing agent nigericin (10 μm). ADP import was assayed as previously described (23Vander H.M. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 159-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were mechanically lysed and mitochondria were isolated in isotonic buffer (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH adjusted to 6.5, 7.2, and 8.1) (21Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were incubated for 10 min with 2.5 μCi of [3H]ADP (Sigma) in the ADP import buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm KC1, 5 mm succinate, 3 mmKH2PO4, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 μm rotenone, pH adjusted to 6.5, 7.2, and 8.1) under different pH conditions. To inhibit ADP import and measure background incorporation of radioactive counts, 50 μm carboxyatractyloside (CAT) was included in parallel control samples. Reactions were stopped by addition of ADP import buffer with 50 μm CAT. Mitochondria were washed twice, and results were quantitated in a Wallac model 1409 liquid scintillation counter. ATP concentrations in cell suspensions (1 × 107cells/ml) deprived of cytokine for various times or adjusted for pH were determined by the Luciferase-Luciferin method, supplied in the ATP assay kit (Calbiochem), following the manufacturer's protocol. ADP levels in mitochondrial protein lysates (5 × 107 cells) were measured by converting ADP to ATP with 4 mm phospho(enol)pyruvate (Sigma) and 5 units of pyruvate kinase (Sigma) (23Vander H.M. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 159-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Total mitochondrial ATP levels were then assayed as described. Total cellular NADH levels were determined by shifts in blue fluorescence as measured by flow cytometry (28Thorell B. Cytometry. 1983; 4: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), because the reduced form fluoresces, whereas the oxidized form does not. Cellular autofluorescence attributable to reduced pyridine nucleotide content was measured using a UV (350 nm) laser with emissions measured at 450 nm (29Bender J.G. Van, E.pps D.E. Steinkamp J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Caspase 3 activity was measured with a commercially available kit (Calbiochem) using PhiPhiLuxG1D2, a peptide substrate for caspase 3, which when cleaved emits green fluorescence (excitation, 505 nm; emission, 530 nm). Results were assayed by flow cytometry following the manufacturer's guidelines. To alter cytosolic pH in living, viable cells, FL5.12A cells were permeabilized to adjust intracellular pH to that of the extracellular buffers. Nigericin (1 μm) was used to permeabilize cells in a high K-Hepes buffer (25 mm Hepes, 145 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose) at pH 7.0, 7.5, or 8.0 for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then analyzed for mitochondrial inner membrane potential changes with JC-1. Where described under “Results,” cells were also pretreated with 5 μg/ml oligomycin for 1 h before adjusting intracellular pH. Cell lysis was performed in isotonic buffer (pH 7.2), and the mitochondrial-enriched pellets were isolated as previously described for the ADP import assay (21Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). For detection of Bax and cytochrome c oxidase protein by Western blot, cell equivalent samples (10 μl containing ∼20 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to 0.2 μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). Blots were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for the amino-terminal of Bax (N20, Santa Cruz) or with a mouse polyclonal antibody specific for cytochrome c oxidase (Research Diagnostics), followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) and then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Respiring mitochondria generate a proton gradient across the inner membrane, producing a pH gradient and a membrane potential or ΔΨm. The ΔΨm represents most of the energy of the proton gradient, and using the fluorescent carbocyanine dye JC-1 (25Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 30Cossarizza A. Baccarani-Contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), others have measured this potential. Lipophilic cations such as JC-1 accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix driven by the electrochemical gradient following the Nernst equation. The higher the ΔΨm (the more polarized the mitochondrial membrane), the more JC-1 dye is taken up into the matrix. In the cytosol, the monomeric form of the dye fluoresces green (emissions read at 527 nm), whereas highly concentrated within mitochondrial matrix, JC-1 forms aggregates that fluoresce red (emissions read at 590 nm) (32Smiley S.T. Reers M. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Lin M. Chen A. Smith T.W. Steele G.D.J. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3671-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). To quantitate the red fluorescence of cells that had taken up JC-1, we employed flow microfluorimetry throughout this study. Initially using fluorescent microscopy, we verified that this red fluorescence emanated from mitochondria (not shown). Thus, in a neutral pH solution, FL5.12A cells contained a few dots of red fluorescence against a diffuse greenish orange fluorescence; others have correlated this pattern to a ΔΨm of 140–160 mV (26Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In an alkaline pH solution, we observed a dramatic increase in punctate red fluorescence (with no green fluorescence) reported to indicate a ΔΨm of greater than 190mV (26Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Similar studies concluded that green fluorescing mitochondria were equivalent to a ΔΨm of less than 100 mV (26Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Thus, a higher intensity of red fluorescence would indicate a higher ΔΨm (hyperpolarization), whereas loss of red and increased green fluorescence would indicate a reduced ΔΨ (depolarization). Using the pro-B cell line FL5.12A, which is dependent on IL-3 for survival, we examined early events following cytokine withdrawal. Deprivation of IL-3 resulted in death by 48 h with no cells surviving beyond 72 h. Fig.1 A, a two-dimensional display of JC-1 red fluorescence (y axis, 590 nm) versusgreen fluorescence (x axis, 527 nm), illustrates the quantitative changes in ΔΨm that occur following IL-3 withdrawal. At 0 h, in the presence of IL-3, cells display a base-line level of red fluorescence that would represent normal mitochondrial membrane polarization. However, by 3 h after IL-3 withdrawal, when cells remained >90% viable, a rise in ΔΨm was observed. This was indicated by an increase in the number of cells in the upper two quadrants, totaling 18.8% at time 0, versus 62.8% at 3 h (Fig. 1 A). This peak of hyperpolarization was transient, in that 5 h after IL-3 withdrawal, the ΔΨm had decreased (36.2% in theupper two quadrants) and further declined at later time points. Note that there were no fluctuations in green fluorescence at the 0- and 3-h time points. This is indicated by the sum of cells in the two right quadrants, 19.8% at 0 hversus 20.8% at 3 h, showing that cellular uptake of the JC-1 dye did not change during this period. The uncoupling agent CCCP was included as a depolarization control to confirm the capacity of the JC-1 dye to measure ΔΨmchanges and shows that depolarized cells appear in the lower right quadrant in this display (Fig. 1 A). Following IL-3 withdrawal, depolarized cells (lower right quadrant) increased to 31.2% at 20 h and 61.5% at 40 h. The number of depolarized cells approximated the number of dead cells at these time points (30–40% at 20 h and 60–70% at 40 h). IL-3 withdrawal, therefore, resulted first in an early, transient increase in ΔΨm (hyperpolarization) peaking at 3 h, followed later by depolarization that began at 20 h. The early hyperpolarization phase has not been described previously and was examined further in this study. To verify that JC-1 accurately measured changes in ΔΨm, we evaluated other fluorescent dyes. Shown in TableI is a representative experiment in which the dyes DiOC6, Rhodamine 123, and JC-1 equally demonstrate their capacity for measuring changes in ΔΨm following IL-3 withdrawal. Numbers in Table I represent the peak fluorescence intensity at the optimal emission wavelength for each dye. All three dyes detected the increase in ΔΨm peaking 2–3 h after IL-3 withdrawal; therefore, the rise in ΔΨm was not an artifact of an individual dye. Because JC-1 allows dual emission detection for both the cytosolic monomeric form of the dye and the aggregated mitochondrial form of the dye, we favored it for subsequent analysis.Table IComparison of dyes used for the detection of changes in the mitochondrial membrane potentialIL-3 withdrawalMean peak fluorescenceJC-1 dye (590 nm)DiOC6 dye (525 nm)Rhodamine 123 dye (525 nm)h013.14.561.15128.24.711.35231.24.892.00334.35.882.70 Open table in a new tab To determine whether alterations in ΔΨm were a general consequence of cytokine withdrawal, we evaluated changes in ΔΨm in an IL-7-dependent thymocyte cell line, D1. Shown in Fig. 1 B, D1 cells exhibited a pattern similar to that seen in the FL5.12A cells. Hyperpolarization of ΔΨm, observed as an increase in the red fluorescing cell population, was a transient and early event occurring 4–5 h after IL-7 withdrawal (Fig. 1 B). In addition, mouse pro-T cells (CD3−CD4−CD8−) responsive to IL-7 also showed increased ΔΨm following cytokine withdrawal. 2A. R. Khaled and S. K. Durum, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, the rise in ΔΨm we describe is not a phenomenon unique to the IL-3-dependent FL5.12A cell line. We recently reported that following IL-3 or IL-7 withdrawal, intracellular alkalinization triggered the translocation of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, to mitochondria (21Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To address a potential role for Bax in the observed hyperpolarization, FL5.12A cells were treated with Bax antisense oligodeoxynucleotides before IL-3 withdrawal; no inhibitory effect was seen on mitochondrial hyperpolarization occurring 2–3 h post-withdrawal. The same Bax antisense oligodeoxynucleotides promoted survival following cytokine withdrawal (not shown). Bax was evaluated further by isolating pro-T cells (CD3−CD4−CD8−) from Bax−/− mice and testing for changes in ΔΨm following IL-7 withdrawal. Pro-T cells lacking Bax did indeed hyperpolarize the mitochondria.2 Therefore, we conclude that translocation of Bax to the mitochondria is not required for the rise in ΔΨm induced by cytokine withdrawal. We next addressed whether other apoptosis regulators, caspases, Bcl-2, or Bcl-XL, could inhibit mitochondrial hyperpolarization during cytokine withdrawal. Shown in Fig.2 A (in histograms displaying the intensity of red fluorescence) ZVAD-FMK, a caspase inhibitor, did not prevent the increase in ΔΨm, although it effectively blocked the later activation (24 h) of caspase 3 (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, caspases do not participate at this early stage in the mitochondrial hyperpolarization process but are initially activated 20–24 h post-IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 2 C). Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL also did not interfere with theΔΨ rise following IL-3 withdrawal (Fig.2 B). Hence, these anti-apoptotic proteins repress late apoptotic events, such as mitochondrial depolarization (data not shown) and caspase 3 activity (Fig. 2 C), but not the transient increase in ΔΨm. The early increase in ΔΨmfollowing cytokine (IL-3 or IL-7) withdrawal has not been reported previously; therefore, its time course was analyzed further using the FL5.12A cell line. In Fig.3 A, mitochondrial hyperpolarization (indicated by increased intensity of red fluorescence) peaked 2–3 h after IL-3 withdrawal. To relate JC-1 fluorescence to the actual mitochondrial membrane potential, other studies using JC-1 (26Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) reported a base-line range of 140–160 mV, which, if extrapolated linearly, would indicate that the hyperpolarization we observe is greater than 190 mV. We next evaluated whether increased ΔΨm reflected a change in the plasma membrane polarization. However, DiBac4, a fluorescent probe used to measure plasma membrane potential, did not detect changes following cytokine withdrawal greater than those observed by simply adding fresh medium (not shown). Therefore, the rise in ΔΨm following cytokine withdrawal does not correlate with an increase in the polarization of the plasma membrane. Previously, we had examined the D1 and FL5.12A cells for other early intracellular events induced by IL-7 or IL-3 withdrawal and detected a rise in cytosolic pH (21Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), using the pH indicator BCECF (33Weinlich M. Theiss C. Lin C.T. Kinne R.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 57-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, this rise in intracellular pH measured in the FL5.12A cells followed a parallel time course to that of the increase in ΔΨm seen in Fig. 3 A. We also reported a similar time course of alkalinization following IL-7 withdrawal from D1 cells, with a peak pH rise occurring 4–6 h post-withdrawal (21Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), paralleling the rise in ΔΨm (Fig. 1 B). Because these two early, transient events, the increase in ΔΨm and intracellular alkalinization, occurred together following IL-3 or IL-7 withdrawal, we tested whether alkaline pH induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Using nigericin (a K+/H+ ionophore) and a high K+buffer (145 mm KCl) to equilibrate intracellular pH to that of the extracellular buffer, we adjusted the intracellular pH of FL5.12A cells to 7.0, 7.5, or 8.0. This method effectively fixes pH (as confirmed by measurement of intracellular pH; data not shown) in the presence or absence of IL-3. It should be noted that nigericin dissipates the pH gradient of membranes and can cause a slight hyperpolarization in response to the flux of K+ ions. However, in our manipulation of pH with nigericin, this effect is negligible as is demonstrated in further control experiments. As shown in Fig. 4 A (upper panels), elevating intracellular pH to 7.5 or 8.0 induced a rise in ΔΨm comparable with that seen during IL-3 withdrawal. No further increase in ΔΨm occurred beyond pH 8, possibly because of the effect of nigericin on plasma membrane permeability, which at higher doses limits the concentration of cytosolic JC-1 monomers (data not"

We report a mutant AR, with residues 628–646 in the hinge region deleted, which exhibited transactivation activity that was more than double that of the wild type (WT) AR. Although no androgen-dependent AF2 activity could be observed for the WT ARLBD fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, the mutant ARLBD(Δ628–646) was 30–40 times more active than the WT ARLBD. In the presence of the p160 coactivator TIF2, AR(Δ628–646) was significantly more active than similarly treated WT AR. Deletion of residues 628–646 also enhanced TIF2-ARLBD activity 8-fold, an effect not present when the LBD-interacting LXXLL motifs of TIF2 were mutated, suggesting that the negative modulatory activity of residues 628–646 were exerted via coactivator pathways.

In the absence of hormone, nuclear receptors are maintained in a repressed state by association with heat shock proteins and/or corepressors (1McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr.

Deletion of the AR TAD results in an LBD fragment that can bind ligand and androgen response elements (ARE) but is relatively inactive in reporter gene assays in human cells. In contrast, the AR TAD fragment alone has a hormone-independent AF1 that is almost equal to the ligand-activated full-length AR. The very existence of an AF2 in the AR has been questioned, and it has been proposed that AR transactivation function is dependent on the strong AF1 activity of the TAD, consequent to ligand-activated interactions between the TAD and the LBD (5Bevan C.L.

A. 1998; 95: 5998-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), it is puzzling as to why the prominent AF2 activity present in other steroid receptors cannot be elicited in the ARLBD. Although the LBD and the DBD of the AR have been characterized in some detail (29Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. el-Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the hinge region in between these major domains, defined by residues 628–669, is less well understood (Fig.1). Although this region is poorly conserved among steroid receptors, several lines of evidence indicate that key functional elements may reside in this AR domain. For example, 7 of 10 reported amino acid substitutions affecting residues 619–672 in the AR hinge region are associated with the androgen-dependent tumor, prostate cancer (30Gottlieb B. Lehvaslaiho H. Beitel L.K. Lumbroso R. Pinsky L. Trifiro M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a sequence located between amino acids 628 and 657 within the hinge region contains a short stretch of basic amino acids that resemble the nuclear targeting signals of the glucocorticoid receptor and the SV-40 large T antigen (31Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been described to form part of a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) (32Zhou Z.X. Sar M. Simental J.A. Lane M.V. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 1269: 13115-13123Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In addition, transactivation activity of the ARLBD in yeast, but not in mammalian cells, appears to be modulated when the hinge region is attached (33Moilanen A. Rouleau N. Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and coexpression of Ubc9, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that interacts with the hinge region, can enhance AR transactivation activity (34Poukka H.

In this study we explored the effects of deleting key residues in the hinge region and observed that the ligand-activated and coactivator-augmented transcriptional activity of the deletion mutant was unexpectedly higher than the WT. Experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism whereby the deleted residues exert an inhibitory effect on ARLBD function. The full-length AR deletion mutant, AR(Δ628–646), was created by site-directed mutagenesis using two internal primers: Sense (dF), 5′-gaagcagggatgactctgggcagcaccaccagccccact-3′ and the antisense (dR), 5′-cagtggggctggtggtgctgcccagagtcatccctgcttc-3′. The external primers were sense (DNA-B), 5′-gacttcaccgcacctgatgtg-3′ and antisense (QE3), 5′-cctggagttgacattggtgaa-3′. Initially, two primary PCRs were performed using the AR expression plasmid pSV-ARas the template. Primers DNA-B and dR were used to generate fragment 1, and primers dF and QE3 for fragment 2. These overlapping primary amplification products were then denatured and allowed to anneal together to produce a heteroduplex product with overlapping ends. The recessed ends of the heteroduplexes were extended with Pfu DNA polymerase to produce a fragment that is the sum of the two overlapping products. A subsequent reamplification was performed for 30 cycles using primers DNA-B and QE3 to generate the cDNA fragment with a deletion of AR codons 628–646 (Δ628–646). The secondary PCR product was double-digested with HindIII andXhoI and ligated into pSV-AR, with the equivalent fragment excised, to generate AR (Δ628–646).The pGAL4DBD-ARLBD chimeric vector comprised theAR hinge and LBD regions (codons 628–919) fused in-frame to the GAL4DBD residues 1–147 (23Feng W.

The PCR product, including the stop codon in exon 8 was digested with HindIII and ligated in-frame into the SmaI/HindIII site of pm containing the Gal4DNA-binding domain. The plasmid pSV-AR (N727K,M886V), containing the double mutations M886V and N727K, was created by placing theXhoI-EcoRI segment containing the N727K mutation (17Ghadessy F.J. Lim J. Abdullah A.A.

All constructs were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of enzymatic manipulations. HeLa cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium and COS cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1.5–1.8 × 104 cells were seeded into each well of 24-well plates 20 h prior to transfections. For Western blotting, COS-7 cells were seeded on P60 Petri dishes 29 h before transfection. All transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (38Wang Q. Ghadessy F.J. Trounson A. Kretser D. McLachlan R. Ng S.C. Yong E.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and appropriate amounts of empty parent vector were added to the replicates, if indicated, to normalize the amount of total DNA in each well to prevent general squelching. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (17Ghadessy F.J. Lim J. Abdullah A.A. Panet-Raymond V. Choo C.K. Lumbroso R. Tut T.G. Gottlieb B. Pinsky L. Trifiro M.A. Yong E.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1517-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed, and 10 μg of protein from the cell lysate was resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes, and AR protein was detected using the rabbit polyclonal antibody, NH27, which recognizes amino acids 360–564 of the AR (gift of Dr. A. Mizokami, Kitakyushu, Japan). COS-7 cells were seeded on 15-mm diameter coverslips on 12-well pates and transfected with LipofectAMINE. Five hours after transfection, the cells received fresh medium with 10% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum and were cultured for an additional 20 h in the presence or absence of increasing doses of DHT. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer saline and permeabilized with 1% Brij. AR protein was detected with the antibody NH27 (1:50 dilution). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used for visualization of the receptor protein under a confocal laser scanning biological microscope (Olympus Fluoview IX70, Tokyo, Japan). To test the consequences of deleting amino acids 628–646 from full-length AR, WT AR or mutant AR(Δ628–646) was expressed in the HeLa cells and transactivation activity measured with a multimeric ARE promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2). WT AR activity at 0.001 nm DHT was 2-fold higher than replicates not exposed to hormone and reached a maximum of 1600-fold increase in activity at 10 nm (Fig. 2 A). Further increases in androgen dose did not raise AR activity above this maximum, indicating that saturating doses of hormone had been reached. However, the transactivation response of mutant AR was biphasic and differed from WT. Low doses of androgen (0.001–0.01 nm) did not increase mutant AR activity significantly, resulting in WT AR activity 10- to 44-fold higher than mutant AR. Surprisingly, this pattern was reversed for doses of androgen of 0.1 nm. The AR mutant, despite having its hinge region and the associated NLS deleted, exhibited AR activity that was more than double that of the WT AR for doses of DHT and mibolerone between 0.1 and 1000 nm(Fig. 2). These differences in transactivation function were not due to changes in protein expression, because both WT AR and deletion mutants were present in approximately equal amounts in the cells, as indicated by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 C). To measure activation function of the ARLBD, a chimeric construct, comprising the GAL4DBD fused in-frame to theARLBD, was coexpressed with the GAL4-TATA-Lucreporter gene (Fig. 3). WT ARLBD chimeric protein did not demonstrate significant transactivation activity with, or without androgen, consistent with previous studies indicating that very little transactivation function resides in the AR LBD (5Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 15He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, deletion of residues 628–646 from the ARLBD increased androgen-dependent transactivation activity markedly. The ARLBD(Δ628–646) fragment was about 30–40 times more active than the intact WT LBD. Whereas no androgen-dependent increase in AF2 activity was observed for the WT ARLBD, dose-dependent augmentation of ARLBD(Δ628–646) AF2 activity was observed for doses of DHT and mibolerone from 0.01 to 1000 nm. This suggests that amino acids 628–646 may serve to inhibit the transactivation potential of AF2 of the ARLBD. A short stretch of basic amino acids located within amino acids 628–646 of the hinge region forms part of a bipartite NLS, the other portion located 10 residues upstream in the DBD (Fig. 1) (31Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether nuclear localization of the AR is affected by the hinge deletion, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was performed (Fig.4). In the absence of androgen, transfected AR was located in both cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 4,top panels). With low doses of DHT (0.01 nm), WT AR was observed increasingly in the nucleus. At doses of DHT >1 nm, WT AR protein was localized mainly in the nucleus, and at 100 nm the WT AR signal was observed almost exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 4, bottom panels). The deletion mutant surprisingly behaved in a similar manner, with most of the AR being located in the nucleus in the presence of androgen doses >1 nm, except that the nuclear signals were marginally less intense. Thus deletion of the hinge portion of the bipartite NLS in the mutant AR did not prevent its localization to the nucleus, suggesting that the intact portion located in the DBD was sufficient for this purpose (32Zhou Z.X. Sar M. Simental J.A. Lane M.V. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 1269: 13115-13123Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The effects of coactivator on mutant AR were next investigated, because AF2 is dependent on their efficient recruitment to the ARLBD. Of the three steroid coactivators identified to date, TIF2 interacts the strongest with AR (39Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, TIF2 augmented full-length WT AR activity by over 100% (Fig. 5). Remarkably, the AR(Δ628–646) mutant, was observed to display even greater TIF2-augmented activity, being 70% higher than similarly treated WT AR. Thus the synergistic activity of TIF2 on full-length AR function was present when the hinge region was deleted. To further define this effect, a chimeric construct consisting of the GAL4DBD linked in-frame to ARLBD was coexpressed with TIF2, and transactivation activity was measured with a GAL4 reporter gene (Fig.6 A). In the absence of TIF2, no AF2 function of the WT LBD was observed, whereas deletion of the 628–646 region resulted in significant ARLBD AF2 activity. The presence of TIF2 augmented the AF2 function of the WT LBD by more than 80-fold. Strikingly, the activity of LBD(Δ628–646) fusion protein with TIF2 was 8-fold higher than that of the corresponding TIF2-stimulated WT LBD fragment, and 40-fold higher than that observed with mutant LBD alone. In contrast, a TIF2 mutant, with three LXXLL nuclear-receptor-interacting motifs mutated, was not able to synergize with either WT LBD or LBD(Δ628–646) transactivation function, indicating that residues 628–646 exert their repressive actions via LXXLL motifs of steroid receptor coactivators. To further delineate the sites of action of TIF2, LBD mutants incorporating two substitutions, N727K and M886V, were constructed. The N727K,M886V mutations have previously been demonstrated to have partially defective interactions with TIF2 (17Ghadessy F.J. Lim J. Abdullah A.A. Panet-Raymond V. Choo C.K. Lumbroso R. Tut T.G.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), resulting in minimal androgen insensitivity and male infertility. The WT ARLBD chimeric protein did not have any activity in the absence of hormone, but displayed strong androgen-dependent activity in the presence of TIF2 (Fig. 6 B). As expected, the LBD(N727K,M886V) fusion protein was partially defective in the presence of TIF2, having only half the activity of the WT. Nevertheless, deletion of residues 628–646 resulted in TIF2-dependent augmentation of mutant AR activity, such that triply mutated LBD(Δ628–646,N727K,M886V) was more than 3-fold stronger than the doubly mutated LBD(N727K,M886V) fragment. Thus mutations in AR residues 727 and 886,"

Tau promotes the assembly and stabilization of microtubules. The potential for tau to bind to microtubules is down-regulated after local phosphorylation. When we investigated the effects of PKN activation on tau phosphorylation, we found that PKN triggers disruption of the microtubule array bothin vitro and in vivo and predominantly phosphorylates tau in microtubule binding domains (MBDs). PKN has a catalytic domain highly homologous to protein kinase C (PKC), a kinase that phosphorylates Ser-313 (= Ser-324, the number used in this study) in MBDs. Thus, we identified the phosphorylation sites of PKN and PKC subtypes (PKC-α, -βI, -βII, -γ, -δ, -ε, -ζ, and -λ) in MBDs. PKN phosphorylates Ser-258, Ser-320, and Ser-352, although all PKC subtypes phosphorylate Ser-258, Ser-293, Ser-324, and Ser-352. There is a PKN-specific phosphorylation site, Ser-320, in MBDs. HIA3, a novel phosphorylation-dependent antibody recognizing phosphorylated tau at Ser-320, showed immunoreactivity in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing tau and the active form of PKN, but not in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing tau and the inactive form of PKN. The immunoreactivity for phosphorylated tau at Ser-320 increased in the presence of a phosphatase inhibitor, FK506 treatment, which means that calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) may be involved in dephosphorylating tau at Ser-320 site. We also noted that PKN reduces the phosphorylation recognized by the phosphorylation-dependent antibodies AT8, AT180, and AT270in vivo.

Thus PKN serves as a regulator of microtubules by specific phosphorylation of tau, which leads to disruption of tubulin assembly. microtubule-associated protein microtubule binding domain protein kinase C neurofibrillary tangle flanking region paired helical filament Chinese hamster ovary glutathione S-transferase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis amino acids Dynamics and rearrangement of microtubule networks are modulated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs)1 (1Pryer N.K.

Sequence analysis of the 1080-base pair open reading frame shows 48% amino acid identity with the cyclic AMP-dependent kinase from Euglena gracilis. Northern analysis indicated a 1.28- kilobase pair transcript at relatively constant concentrations during growth and encystation. gPKA is autophosphorylated, although amino acid residues corresponding to Thr-197 and Ser-338 of human protein kinase A (PKA) that are important for autophosphorylation are absent. Kinetic analysis of the recombinant PKA showed that ATP and magnesium are preferred over GTP and manganese. Kinase activity of the native PKA has also been detected in crude extracts using kemptide as a substrate. A myristoylated PKA inhibitor, amide 14-22, inhibited excystation with an IC50 of 3 μm, suggesting an important role of gPKA during differentiation from the dormant cyst form into the active trophozoite. gPKA localizes independently of cell density to the eight flagellar basal bodies between the two nuclei together with centrin, a basal body/centrosome-specific protein. However, localization of gPKA to marginal plates along the intracellular portions of the anterior and caudal pairs of flagella was evident only at low cell density and higher endogenous cAMP concentrations or after refeeding with fresh medium.

Naumovitz D. Ortega Y. Sterling C.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 67-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, neither its basic biology nor the pathophysiology of infection is well understood. To date, no giardial toxin or conventional virulence factor has been identified by biological (2Smith P.D. Gillin F.D. Spira W.M. Nash T.E. Gastroenterology. 1982; 83: 797-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or genomic studies (3Adam R.D. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 475-484Google Scholar). Therefore, it is critical to understand how the parasite survives in the external environment and infects and colonizes a new host. G. lambliahas two life cycle stages that are each remarkably well adapted to survival in very different and inhospitable environments. The dormant, quadrinucleate cyst persists for months in fresh cold water (4Bingham A.K. Jarroll E.L. Meyer E.A. Radulescu S. Exp. Parasitol. 1979; 47: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Infection is initiated by ingestion of cysts (5Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 706-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of cysts to gastric acid during passage through the host stomach triggers the rapid and dramatic differentiation known as excystation. After entry into the small intestine and stimulation by specific factors (6Rice E.W. Schaefer III, F.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1981; 14: 709-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the parasite emerges and divides into two equivalent binucleate trophozoites that attach to and colonize the human small intestine. The cyst wall must remain intact during passage through the stomach acid; however, once the cyst enters the small intestine, the wall must open rapidly to enable the parasite to emerge and attach to host enterocytes. In the small intestine, giardial trophozoites are exposed to complex and everchanging concentrations of hydrogen ions and nutrients, as well as bile acids and digestive enzymes (7Davenport H.W. Physiology of the digestive tract. Year Book Medical Publishers, Chicago1977Google Scholar). As enterocytes migrate to the tip of the villus, where they are sloughed off into the lumen, attached trophozoites must be able to sense and respond rapidly to environmental signals to remain in the small intestine. Since excystation entails such rapid responses to environmental stimuli, we hypothesized that protein kinase-mediated signaling might be very important. Thus, cell-signaling pathways may be crucial to both giardial colonization in the small intestine and to the cellular activation of excystation. Although many protein kinase gene fragments have been identified by large scale genomic sequencing (Ref. 8Smith M.W. Aley S.B. Sogin M.L. Gillin F.D. Evans G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar; see also the web site for theGiardia Genome Project Database (Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA)), there is little understanding of their potential roles in giardial survival and growth in the small intestine or in regulation of differentiation. In many eukaryotic cells, cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways play a critical role in regulating cell growth, metabolism, and differentiation (10McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Tramontano D. Moses A.C. Ingbar S.H. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A (PKA,1 EC 2.7.1.37), the defining enzyme of the cyclic AMP-dependent signaling pathway alters protein activity by phosphorylation at serine/threonine residues within the motif RRX(S/T) (12Walsh D.A. Perkins J.P. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3763-3765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKA is one of the simplest protein kinases known because of its dissociative mechanism of activation (13Francis S. Corbin J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). PKA holoenzyme, a catalytically inactive form, is a tetrameric complex containing two identical catalytic (C) subunits bound to a homodimer of two regulatory (R) subunits (14Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP binding to the R subunit results in dissociation of the holoenzyme with release of active C subunit. The activated C subunit of PKA can phosphorylate a number of intracellular proteins, including enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, ion channels, and transcription factors (15Habener J.F. DeGroot L.J. Endocrinology. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1995: 77-92Google Scholar). How the specific physiological effects of cAMP can be mediated by a broad spectrum protein kinase such as PKA is now being elucidated (16Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar,17Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In a number of diverse cell types, PKA is localized in proximity to substrates by A kinase anchoring protein(s) that bind to both the R subunit and to a specific cell structure, often cytoskeletal (18Edwards A.S. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Targeting PKA to the proximity of phosphate acceptor protein molecules associated with specific cell structures can also achieve rapid responses to cAMP (16Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Genes encoding three different C subunits and four different R subunits of PKA have been identified in humans (20Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Frontiers Biosci. 1997; 2: D331-D342Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, various combinations of R and C subunits display differences in tissue distribution (21Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15360-15363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Advani S.R. Schwarz M. Showers M.O. Maurer R.A. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J.

Chem. 1986; 261: 16288-16291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may determine their functional specificity. The unique distribution and subcellular localization of PKA isoforms in higher eukaryotes may represent a functional interaction with nearby structures. In lower eukaryotes, three isoforms of PKA C subunit have been identified from Drosophila melanogaster (24Kalderon D. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1539-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and from Saccharomyces cerevisiae(25Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). However, only one gene encoding PKA C subunit has been reported from Caenorhabditis elegans, Dictyostelium discoidium, Leishmania major, andTrypanosoma cruzi (26Plowman G.D. Sudarsanam S. Binghnam J. Whyte D. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13603-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 27Burki E. Anjard C. Scholder J.C. Reymond C.D.

Dictyostelium PKA plays a key role during differentiation and morphogenesis (30Lasko P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Similarly, PKA plays critical roles in differentiation ofLeishmania and Trypanosoma (28Simian-Tov M.M. Aly R. Shapira M. Jaffe C.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Vassella E. Reuner B. Yutzy B. Boshart M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2661-2671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast,Saccharomyces PKA appears to mediate cellular responses to various extracellular stimuli, including nutrients and heat shock (31Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Scott J.D. Hurwitz M.M. Krebs E.G. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of a giardial homologue of a PKA C subunit. Thus far, only a single isoform of gPKA C subunit has been identified in large scale sequencing efforts with ∼3-fold coverage of the genome (32Mc Arthur A.G. Morrison H.G. Nixon J.E.J. Passamaneck N.Q.E. Kim U. Reich C.I. Holder M.E. Hinkle G. Crocker M.K. Farr R. Olsen G.E. Aley S.B. Adam R. Gillin F.D. Sogin M.L. FEMS Microbial Lett. 2000; 189: 271-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that, although the biochemical properties of the recombinant gPKA are largely similar to those of the mammalian enzyme, gPKA has some noteworthy structural differences. We found that cellular distribution of PKA was correlated with cell density and endogenous cAMP levels. At all cell densities, PKA localized to the eight flagellar basal bodies, which correspond to the centrosomes of higher eukaryotic cell (33Moujou M. Paintrand M. Vigues B. Bornens M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, at low cell inocula and higher endogenous cAMP concentrations, PKA also localized to marginal plates along the intracellular portions of the anterior and caudal flagella. To our knowledge, this is the first indication of a role for cell signaling in giardial flagellar-associated structures. In addition, a PKA inhibitor greatly decreased giardial excystation. Thus, PKA may play a key role in regulating trophic behavior of the motile form, as well as cellular activation during excystation. Unless specified, all materials were obtained from Sigma, Fisher, and Life Technologies, Inc. G. lamblia (WB clone C6, ATCC no. 50803) were maintained in TYI-S-33 medium with 10% bovine serum and bile (34Keister D.B. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1983; 77: 487-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Encystation and excystation were induced essentially as described by Meng et al. (35Meng T.C. Hetsko M.L. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, encystation was induced by growing trophozoites for one culture cycle in TYI-S-33 medium without bile (pre-encystation). Bile-deficient medium was poured off along with unattached trophozoites and replaced with encystation medium containing 0.25 mg/ml porcine bile and 10 mm lactic acid, pH 7.8, and incubated at 37 °C for the time specified. Total encysting cultures were harvested at different time points by chilling and centrifugation and subsequently used for RNA and protein extraction. Cysts were harvested at 66 h by washing and incubating in cold double-distilled water to lyse any trophozoites or incomplete cysts (35Meng T.C. Hetsko M.L. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Excystation was induced by a two-step method that models cyst passage from the cold hypotonic freshwater external environment into the warm, acidic stomach, pH 4.0, 20 min, 37 °C (stage 1). Stage 2 models cyst passage from the stomach into the small intestine with exposure to slightly alkaline pH (8.0) and protease (1 mg/ml bovine trypsin type II) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cysts were pelleted at 8300 × g and resuspended in growth medium for 60 min at 37 °C. Emerged motile trophozoites were enumerated using a hemocytometer. The percentage of excystation was calculated as the sum of the motile trophozoites and partially emerged trophozoites divided by the initial number of viable cysts. Myristoylated PKA inhibitor (amide 14-22, Calbiochem Novobiochem, San Diego, CA) was dissolved in water and diluted into water (pre-excystation) or excystation solutions. Inhibitor peptide was initially screened with the inhibitor present during 1 h before incubation at 4 °C and added again during stage 1 and 2 of excystation, since cysts were pelleted between stages. However, inhibitor was not included in the emergence step in growth medium because of possible effects on trophozoites. 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was estimated by interpolation from concentration-inhibition curves. Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion (35Meng T.C. Hetsko M.L. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the stage(s) at which each inhibitor was effective, cysts were pre-incubated with inhibitor (at a higher than IC50 concentration, 10 μm) prior to stage 1 in water for 1 h at 4 °C, or during stage 1 or stage 2 of excystation. The mean inhibition was normalized to solvent controls for each experiment. All experiments were repeated at least twice. Data shown are mean (± S.D.) for at least two independent experiments. Thep values were calculated by paired two-tailed Student'st test with the normalized comparison value set at 100% for control excystation (35Meng T.C. Hetsko M.L. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 250-base pair DNA fragment of PKA catalytic subunit was obtained by PCR amplification ofGiardia genomic DNA using degenerate primers (upper primer, 5′-TAC(T)A(C)GXGAC(T)C(T)TXAAA(G)C(T)C-3′; lower primer, 5′-CCXAA(G)XG(C)A(C)(T)CCACCAA(G)TC-3′, whereX is all four nucleotides). Primers were designed on the basis of the consensus sequence in the catalytic subdomains VIB and IX of the PKA catalytic subunit. Designed degeneracy allowed every possible codon for the consensus amino acid residues to maximize the probability of amplification. The amplified PKA fragment was purified, sequenced, and used to screen a Giardia cDNA library. A G. lamblia WB clone C6 cDNA library was made in λZAPII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using a kit (ZAP-cDNAR synthesis kit, Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The library was screened for the full-length clone of PKA using 32P-labeled PKA probes as described previously (36Chakrabarti R. McCraken Jr J.B. Chakrabarti D. Souba W.W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 153: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Five positive plaques were obtained by screening ∼6 × 105 plaque-forming units. Positive plaques containing inserts were plaque-purified and inserts cloned into pBluescript plasmids by in vivo excision using ExAssist helper phage (Stratagene). Inserts were confirmed by restriction digestion and cross-hybridization. A capillary electrophoresis-based automated DNA sequencer (ABI Prism, 310 Genetic analyzer; ABI, Foster City, CA) was used to sequence positive clones from the cDNA library. A PCR-based reaction kit (ABI PrismTM dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction), ABI prism 310 capillaries (61 cm × 50 μm, inner diameter) and POP-6 for long-read sequencing were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Raw output was analyzed using ABI Prism sequence analysis software. The entire sequence identity was compared with the NCBI data base using PSI-BLAST. Multiple sequence alignment was done using MegAlign program from DNASTAR (Madison, WI) software. Tertiary structure was determined using SWISS-MODEL and Swiss-Pdb Viewer, an internet-based tool for automated comparative protein modeling (37Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA fromGiardia was isolated using standard protocol as described by Maniatis et al. (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Total RNA was extracted using an RNA isolation kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's specification. 32P-Labeled gPKA cDNA probes were used for hybridization as described previously (36Chakrabarti R. McCraken Jr J.B. Chakrabarti D. Souba W.W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 153: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For Northern blots, a strand-specific probe was synthesized and used as a probe for gPKA. Briefly, 25–50 ng of the template DNA was labeled using 100 pmol of antisense primer, [32P]dCTP, dNTP, and Klenow (exo−) (Stratagene). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a NucTrap push column (Stratagene). The gPKA ORF was cloned into a T7 polymerase-driven expression vector pET30Ek/LIC (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two primers (upper primer, 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGGAAGATATTCAAGTA-3′; and lower primer, 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTCTATTTAAATCCCAC-3′) were designed to amplify the PKA ORF (1.08 kb) and part of the vector sequence. The PCR product was treated with T4 DNA polymerase and dATP only to use the exonuclease activity of the polymerase to generate vector compatible overhangs. Pre-digested vector and insert were annealed and used to transform BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells. Induction of gPKA overexpression in BL21 (DE3) was performed at 25 °C with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Expressed gPKA as a 47-kDa His tag and S tag fusion protein was purified through His-Bind columns (Novagen) and used as antigen for generation of polyclonal antibodies through a commercial vendor (CoCalico, Reamftown, PA). The His tag and S tag sequences added 6 kDa of molecular mass to the fusion protein. Trophozoites and encysting cells were harvested, and total proteins (50 μg) were used for the immunodetection of gPKA using the polyclonal antibody made against recombinant protein. A chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) was used to detect positive signals recognized by anti-gPKA antibody using anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunodepletion was done in a two-step process. Crude trophozoite extracts (500 μg) in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5 and 5 mm MgCl2 were diluted in TAN buffer (10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm n-ethylmalemide, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Ten μg of rabbit IgG was added to the extract and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C to remove nonspecific binding of proteins to gPKA IgG. Next, 150 μl of Protein A-agarose beads (50% slurry) was added and incubated overnight at 4 ° C to remove rabbit IgG. Protein A beads were separated next by centrifuging at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 50 μg of gPKA antibody for 6 h at 4 °C followed by 200 μl of Protein A beads for 18 h at 4 °C. Protein A beads were separated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used for the kinase assay. Trophozoites were grown to confluence, harvested at 700 × g, and washed three times with PBS. They were lysed in a medium containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgCl2 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) using a French press (750 p.s.i.). The lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g, and the supernatant was passed through a syringe filter (0.45 μm). The filtrate was used for the kinase assay using kemptide (Calbiochem-Novobiochem Corp) as a substrate. Fifty μg of crude extract or purified recombinant gPKA (5 μg) was used in a reaction mix containing 100 mm Tris, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm kemptide, and 0.5 nm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mix was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and spotted (40 μl) on phosphocellulose filter discs. Filters were washed four times for 5 min each with 1% phosphoric acid and bound radioactivity counted in a liquid scintillation counter (LKB). Kinase assays using recombinant gPKA were conducted in the presence or absence of the myristoylated PKA inhibitor 14-22 amide and a PKA-specific hexamer inhibitor (RGYALG) (Bachem) at different concentrations. Assays using crude extract were performed in the presence or absence of 4 μm cAMP (Calbiochem). The catalytic parameters were measured under standard assay condition, and the data were graphically fit to the Lineweaver-Burk form of the Michaelis-Menten equation (40Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (7890) Google Scholar). G. lambliatrophozoites were inoculated in growth medium at 350–2000 cells/ml in 12-well tissue culture plates and allowed to grow and attach to 18-mm glass coverslips for 65–70 h in an AnaeroPack jar (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc., Japan) at 37 °C. Coverslips containing attached trophozoites were directly fixed in 100% chilled MeOH (−20 °C) for 10 min at −20 °C and further permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Permeablized trophozoites were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% goat serum, 1% glycerol, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% fish gelatin, and 0.04% sodium azide in PBS), and incubated with rabbit anti-gPKA polyclonal antibodies (1/2500 in blocking buffer) and/or mouse monoclonal anti-centrin antibodies (clone 20H5, 1/500 in blocking buffer) (41Meng T-C. Aley S.B. Svard S.G. Smith M.W. Huang B. Kim J. Gillin F.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for 1 h. At the end of incubation, cells were washed for 5 min (four times) with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit ALEXA 488 and/or anti-mouse ALEXA 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) each diluted in blocking buffer 1/800) for 1 h. Next, cells were washed for 5 min (four times) with PBS, post-fixed for 7 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) in PBS, rinsed with PBS, and mounted on glass slides in Prolong (Molecular Probes). Localization of gPKA and centrin was observed on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with argon-krypton (455/488) and helium-neon (543/633) lasers and appropriate filter sets. To measure endogenous cAMP levels in various stages of G. lamblia growth, a competitive cAMP enzyme immunoassay (Biotrack Cellular Communications Assays, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was employed. G. lamblia were cultured as described for immunolocalization. Using the nonacetylated protocol 3 method of the Biotrack enzyme immunoassay, parasites were lysed in a 500-μl volume of lysis reagent and the amount of cAMP was determined by the manufacturer's protocol. The enzyme immunoassay was repeated five times with parasites from independent cultures, and cAMP measurements were done in duplicate for each sample. Mean differences in the amount of cAMP levels between different cell densities were compared using a paired Student's t test, and pvalues ≤ 0.05 were considered significantly different. Upon screening aGiardia cDNA library with a 250-base pair probe derived from conserved PKA sequences, a 1.28-kb fragment containing an ORF of 1.08 kb (360 amino acids) corresponding to a Giardiahomologue of PKA catalytic subunit was cloned (Fig.1). An unusually long 189-base pair 3′-untranslated region was present in the cloned fragment (accession no. AF181097). The translated amino acid sequence of the ORF showed 48% identity withE. gracilis, 45% identity with C. elegans, 43% identity with human, and 41% identity with yeast cyclic AMP-dependent PKA catalytic subunit with probability scores between 3e-77 and 2e-69 as obtained from PSI-BLAST homology search of the NCBI data base. Since the serine-threonine kinase family exhibits a significant degree of conservation of the kinase domains, the gPKA ORF also showed limited homology with a number of other serine threonine kinases, such as cGMP-dependent protein kinases. However, probability scores (starting at 2e-57 for human KGPA) were significantly lower, and gPKA does not have a cyclic GMP-binding domain. The identification of the ORF as a PKA homologue was strengthened by the presence of most of the key functional motifs, as predicted by comparison with the crystal structure of bovine PKA C subunits (PKAc) (42Smith C.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusuda Akamine P. Taylor S.S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 313-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence analysis of gPKA shows the presence of all 11 subdomains of the kinase domain of PKAc (Fig. 1). Because of its early evolutionary position (43Sogin M.L. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), giardial genes are frequently highly divergent (8Smith M.W. Aley S.B. Sogin M.L. Gillin F.D. Evans G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Despite the lower degree of identity, gPKA exhibits the important consensus motifs, which include the glycine-rich consensus motif GXGXXGXV (Gly-24 to Val-31 using the amino acid numbers of the giardial sequence) in subdomain I, the APE (Ala-190 to Glu-192) motif in subdomain VIII and the catalytic loop YRDLKXXN (Tyr-138 to Asn-145) in subdomain IV. The glycine loop is involved in interactions with ATP β-phosphate oxygens and the pseudosubstrate peptides such as the PKA inhibitor peptide (PKI). The APE motif helps to stabilize the large C-terminal lobe of PKAc. Highly conserved amino acid residues such as Lys-46 in subdomain II, which is responsible for ATP-binding; Glu-65 in subdomain III, which interacts with Lys-46; and Arg-264 in subdomain IX are also present. Among the consensus residues for interaction with the R subunit of PKA or PKI, only His-61 in subdomain III, Arg-107 (not conserved in PKAcγ), and Arg-108 in subdomain V are present but Trp-196, Thr-197, Leu-198, and Lys-213 (in vertebrates) in subdomain VIII are not. The consensus residue Thr-197 (in vertebrates) that is responsible for autophosphorylation in other species is replaced by a serine residue, which can also be phosphorylated in gPKA (Ser-181). In subdomain VII, the Phe residue in DFG sequence is also substituted by another hydrophobic residue Leu in gPKA. This triplet helps to orient γ phosphate for transfer to the substrate by chelating the Mg2+ ion, which bridges the β and γ phosphates of the ATP. The invariant Arg-280 (Arg-264 in gPKA) responsible for stabilizing the large lobe of PKAc is also present. Analyses of Southern blots and large scale genomic sequence (32Mc Arthur A.G. Morrison H.G.

https://openalex.org/W2088170512,"The transcription factor AP-1 (activator protein-1) is required for transformation by many oncogenes, which function upstream of it in the growth factor-ras signal transduction pathway. Previously, we proposed that one role of AP-1 in transformation is to regulate the expression of a multigenic invasion programme. As a test of this proposal we sought to identify AP-1 regulated genes based upon their differential expression in 208F rat fibroblasts transformed by FBR-v-fos (FBR), and to determine if they functioned in the invasion programme. Subtracted cDNA libraries specific for up- or down-regulated genes in FBRs compared to 208Fs were constructed and analysed. Northern analysis revealed that the cDNAs in both libraries represented differentially expressed genes. Nucleic acid sequence analysis of randomly selected cDNA clones from each library coupled with searches of nucleic acid and amino acid sequence databases determined that many of the cDNAs represented proteins that function in various aspects of the invasion process. Functional analysis of one the down-regulated genes, TSC-36/follistatin-related protein (TSC-36/Frp), which has not previously been associated with invasion, demonstrated that its expression in FBRs inhibited in vitro invasion. These results support the proposal that AP-1 in transformed cells regulates a multigenic invasion programme."

The 5′-phosphate of the flipped out cytosine is in contact with the conserved Thr-250 from the target recognition domain. We have produced 12 mutants of Thr-250 and examined their methylation potential in vivo. Six active mutants were subjected to detailed biochemical and structural studies.

DNA methyltransferases (MTases)1 which transfer a methyl group from the cofactorS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) onto a defined residue in a specific sequence of DNA are attractive model systems for enzymes that integrate molecular recognition and catalytic activity. MTases fall into three classes based on the type of methylation produced: N 6-methyladenine,N 4-methylcytosine, and 5-methylcytosine. The DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferases (C5-MTases) are unique in that they are found both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In higher organisms, DNA methylation is the focus of renewed interest due to its documented roles in the control of a number of cellular processes including transcription, genomic imprinting, embryonic development, and chromatin organization (for reviews, see Refs. 1Vertino P.M. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific, Singapore1999: 341-372Crossref Google Scholar, 2Colot V. Rossignol J.L. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 3Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). MTases are obligatory enzyme components of restriction-modification systems found in most bacterial organisms (4Dryden D.T.F. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific, Singapore1999: 283-340Crossref Google Scholar) and have recently been shown to play a role in bacterial virulence (5Heithoff D.M. Sinsheimer R.L. Low D.A. Mahan M.J. Science. 1999; 284: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Another distinctive feature of prokaryotic C5-MTases is their common two-domain architecture. A consecutive set of six strongly conserved and four less conserved sequence motifs (I-X) are found in bacterial as well as eukaryotic enzymes (6Posfai J. Bhagwat A.S. Posfai G. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 7Kumar S. Cheng X. Klimasauskas S. Mi S. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Nine of them are located in the larger domain and participate in cofactor binding and catalytic methylation of the target base. A large so-called “variable” region between motifs VIII and IX folds to make the bulk of the smaller domain (8Cheng X. Kumar S. Klimasauskas S. Roberts R.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and serves to define the sequence specificity of C5-MTases (9Trautner T.A. Balganesh T.S. Pawlek B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6649-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Klimasauskas S. Nelson J.L. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6183-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This apparent separation of the recognition and catalytic functions into distinct domains offers obvious evolutionary advantages for creating wide diversity of specificities. On the other hand, spatial separation of the two functions demands structural flexibility of the reaction components during the catalytic cycle. Indeed, the x-ray structure of the bacterial C5-MTase HhaI (11Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) in complex with DNA revealed that sequence-specific binding is accompanied by rotation of the target nucleotide out of the DNA helix and into the catalytic pocket in the large domain. Subsequent x-ray analyses of other DNA-modification and DNA-repair enzymes confirmed that this novel distortion of DNA, termed base-flipping, is a fundamental mode of DNA-protein interaction in situations when ordinary or damaged bases need to be covalently modified or removed (12Vassylyev D.G. Morikawa K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 181-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Many efforts have been devoted to elucidating the mechanism of base-flipping in a variety of systems. M.HhaI, which recognizes the sequence GCGC and methylates the inner cytosine (boldface), serves as a base-flipping paradigm for this class of enzymes (14Holz B. Klimašauskas S. Serva S. Weinhold E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of Gln-237 located in the target recognition domain of M.HhaI showed that this residue is important for stabilizing the reaction complex upon flipping of the target base out of the DNA helix (15Mi S. Alonso D. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 19F NMR studies in solution revealed base-flipping intermediates in which the target base is found neither in its original stacked position in the DNA helix, nor in its final destination in the catalytic pocket of the enzyme (16Klimašauskas S. Szyperski T. Serva S. Wüthrich K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but is rather exposed on the exterior of the molecule (17Serva S. Weinhold E. Roberts R.J. Klimašauskas S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3473-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was demonstrated that a variety of bases or even an abasic deoxyribose sugar alone at the target position can be rotated out of the DNA by M.HhaI (14Holz B. Klimašauskas S. Serva S. Weinhold E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 18Klimašauskas S. Roberts R.J.

Biol. 1998; 5: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These findings offered a clear separation of two mechanistic events, base-flipping and subsequent base-binding (catching) in the catalytic pocket, implying that the initial flipping motion must be actively promoted by the enzyme. However, the details of how exactly this active flipping process is achieved remain obscure. In addition to the 10 conserved motifs found in C5-MTases, a conserved T(L,V,I) dipeptide can be identified near the C terminus of the variable region (7Kumar S. Cheng X. Klimasauskas S. Mi S. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 21Lauster R. Trautner T.A. Noyer-Weidner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). X-ray studies of the HhaI (11Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) andHaeIII (22Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) MTases in complex with DNA indicate that this conservation is also preserved at the level of tertiary structure. The side chain atoms of the conserved threonine residue superimpose very well in the two structures and pack against the 5′-phosphodiester group of the extrahelical 2′-deoxycytidine (Fig. 1, A andB). Interestingly, although the neighboring amino acid residues are not conserved in the two MTases, the backbone atoms superimpose well in a stretch of 14 residues (amino acids 240–253 in M.HhaI) (22Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). This segment of the target recognition domain runs parallel with the target DNA strand and apparently serves as a scaffold for conformational processing of the bound substrate (23Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 639-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These facts together suggest that the conserved threonine residue may play a significant role in the base flipping mechanism. To assess the functional importance of this structural conservation we have replaced Thr-250 in M.HhaI by other amino acid residues. The effects of individual replacements on in vivomethylation activity, catalytic parameters, DNA-binding, and base-flipping were studied using a protection assay, fluorescence spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, and steady-state kinetics. Restriction endonucleases, DNA modification enzymes and kits were obtained from MBI Fermentas. The following degenerate duplex oligodeoxyribonucleotides (obtained from MBI Fermentas) were used for cassette mutagenesis of the 250 codon: 5′-CCGGGGCATTGCAATTGNC-3′ and 3′- CCGTAACGTTAACNGAATT-5′; 5′-CCGGGGCATTGCAATTANC-3′ and 3′-CCGTAACGTTAATNGAATT-5′; 5′-CCGGGGCATTGCAATTTNC-3′ and 3′- CCGTAACGTTAAANGAATT-5′; 5′-CCGGGGCATTGCAATTCNC-3′ and 3′-CCGTAACGTTAAGNGAATT-5′. The four double-stranded linkers (codon-250 in bold) were ligated into the largeCfr9I-BspTI fragment of pHH52. 2pHH52 is a derivative of pHSHW-5 (11Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) containing silent mutations in the TRD region resulting in unique Cfr9I and BspTI sites (S. K. and G. V., unpublished results). The transformants of the ER1727 strain were plated on selective agar, and individual clones were analyzed by DNA sequencing of the regions concerned (10Klimasauskas S. Nelson J.L. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6183-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thirteen out of 15 possible variants of codon 250 were identified: GTC (Val), GCC (Ala), GAC (Asp), GGC (Gly), ATC (Ile), AAC (Asn), AGC and TCC (Ser), CCC (Pro), CAC (His), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), and TGC (Cys). No mutations were found in other regions of the genes. Analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (10Klimasauskas S. Nelson J.L. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6183-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Controlled expression of the mutant proteins was achieved by adjusting the concentration of IPTG (0 or 0.4 mm) in the growth medium. Plasmids isolated from induced and uninduced cells were challenged with an excess of R.Hin6I (MBI Fermentas), an isoschizomer of R.HhaI (24Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 306-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Mutant proteins and wild-type M.HhaI were expressed in Escherichia coli strain ER1727 and extracted as described previously (16Klimašauskas S. Szyperski T. Serva S. Wüthrich K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All proteins appeared as sole bands (>95%) in Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels (not shown). Protein concentrations were estimated using a Coomassie G-250 assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Exact concentrations were determined by active site titration with a 37-mer fluorescent duplex oligonucleotide (see bellow) or32P-labeled hemimethylated 37-mer duplex in the presence of AdoHcy (not shown) and the values amounted to ∼60% of those obtained in the Coomassie measurements. In subsequent preparations of all variants, Coomassie readings corrected by the factor of 0.6 were used for all mutants with reproducible results. Methylation reactions were carried out in Methylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (25Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) in the presence of 333 nm[methyl-3H]AdoMet (15 or 70 Ci/mmol) and poly(dG-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at double-strand recognition site concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 200 nm. KmAdoMet measurements were performed with 120 nm poly(dG-dC) and varying the [methyl- 3H]AdoMet concentration from 5 nm to 25.6 μm. After 10 min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were supplemented with at least 100-fold excess of non-radioactive AdoMet and AdoHcy mixture (100:1). Duplicate samples were spotted onto 2.5-cm DE-81 filters (Whatman), washed 4 times with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer for 10 min, 2 times with H2O, and 2 times with ethanol and dried. The 3H radioactivity on the filters was measured in 4 ml of CytoScint™ (Fisher Biotech) using a Beckman LS 1801 liquid scintillation spectrometer. Data were analyzed by non-linear regression fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the computer program Grafit, version 3.01 (26Leatherbarrow R.J. Graphit, Version 3.0. Erithacus Sortware Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar), or by global fitting of the entire data set of initial velocities to a Bi-Bi kinetic mechanism using Dynafit (27Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). The following 37-mer deoxyribonucleotides were obtained from MWG-Biotech AG (HPSF grade) or from MBI Fermentas (gel-purified): 5′-GACTGGTACAGTATCAGG(2AP)GCTGACCCACAACATCCG (GPGC); 5′-GACTGGTACAGTATCAGGAGCTGACCCACAACATCCG (GAGC); 5′-TCGGATGTTGTGGGTCAG(5MC)GCCTGATACTGTACCAGT (GMGC). The M.HhaI recognition site is underlined and nucleotides at the target base position are boldface. DNA duplexes were produced by annealing appropriate 37-mer strands (abbreviations are shown in brackets) as described previously (14Holz B. Klimašauskas S. Serva S. Weinhold E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity measurements were performed at 25 °C on an SLM-Aminco AB2 spectrofluorimeter at excitation wavelength (λEx) of 320 nm and emission wavelength (λEm) of 381 nm as described previously (14Holz B. Klimašauskas S. Serva S. Weinhold E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Titration of 100 nm 37-mer GPGC/GMGC duplex was performed by incremental addition of 4 μm M.HhaI in Reaction buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Emission and excitation spectra were recorded at 22 °C on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LC50-B luminescence spectrometer equipped with a Xe lamp and a 4-mm rectangular quartz cell with a mixer. Emission spectra were recorded at λEx = 320 nm with excitation and emission band widths of 10 and 2.5 nm, respectively; excitation spectra were recorded at λEm = 370 nm with excitation and emission bandwidths of 5 and 10 nm, respectively. 200 nm GPGC/GMGC in Reaction buffer was titrated by incremental addition of 25 μm M.HhaI until saturation of fluorescence level was achieved. Three scans were averaged for each spectrum. Control spectra were collected under identical conditions except that GAGC/GMGC duplex was used instead of the fluorescent DNA. Corrected emission and excitation spectra of 2AP were obtained by subtracting the control spectra to eliminate Raman scatter peaks (observed at 328 and 360 nm, respectively) and contributions from the protein and other components. The magnitude of spectral corrections was in the range of 10–35%. Acrylamide fluorescence quenching titrations were performed at 22 °C with the PerkinElmer Life Sciences LC50-B luminescence spectrometer. Emission intensities were recorded at excitation wavelength 320 nm, bandwidth 2.5 nm, and emission wavelength 370 nm, bandwidth 10 nm, sampling time >2 min. Acrylamide solution was added incrementally into 200 nm GPGC/GMGC and 350 nm MTase in Reaction buffer. Relative intensitiesF0/F corrected for background fluorescence were fitted to the general Stern-Volmer equationF0/F = 1 +KSV [acrylamide] (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Stopped-flow experiments were performed on a Hi-Tech Scientific SF 61MX apparatus (single mixing mode) equipped with a Xe-Hg UV lamp. The excitation wavelength was 312 nm (2 mm slit); emission light was passed through a 369-nm cut-on filter. The 37-mer DNA duplex (75 nm) was rapidly mixed with 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, and 960 nm M.HhaI or its mutant in Reaction buffer (see above). 500 logarithmically spaced data points were collected for each progress curve in the time window from 1.3 to 250 ms at signal averaging constant of ≤100 μs. Multiple time courses (4–6 runs) were averaged and analyzed by fitting to double exponential equations using KinetAsyst2, version 2.0 (Hi-Tech) (29Cousins J. KinetAsyst, Version 2.0. Hi-Tech Scientific Ltd., Salisbury, United Kingdom1997Google Scholar), or Grafit, version 3.01 (26Leatherbarrow R.J. Graphit, Version 3.0. Erithacus Sortware Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar) software packages. Multicurve fitting was performed with Dynafit (27Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). A combined data set from WT, T250D, and T250G mutants (100 data points × 5 progress curves × 3 variants) was fitted to the 2-step binding mechanism (Scheme 1). The fluorescence intensity factor ratioF[MTase-DNAF2]/F[MTase-DNAF1] was arbitrary selected (1.5, 1.7, 2, or 3) and used as a fixed global parameter. The four rate constants and progress curve offsets (background fluorescence intensity) were allowed to refine. The structure of the T250G mutant of M.HhaI in a ternary complex with AdoHcy and a short DNA duplex was determined by x-ray crystallography (Protein Data Bank entry code 1FJX). A 13-mer palindromic oligonucleotide (5′-TGATAGCGCTATC-3′) was annealed to form a 12-base pair symmetric duplex with 5′ single thymine overhangs. Crystals were grown by mixing the T250G·DNA·AdoHcy complex with an equal volume of 2.7m ammonium sulfate, 20% (w/v) glucose, 50 mmsodium citrate at pH 5.6, and equilibrating the mixture against 1 ml of the latter solution at 16 °C. The 1FJX crystals formed in the same space group R32 as the previously reported ternary complex structures with cell dimensions of a = b = 98.46 Å, c = 323.22 Å. One complex was present per asymmetric unit. X-ray diffraction intensities were measured from a single frozen crystal at 95 K and a wavelength of 1.1 Å on a ADSC Q4 CCD at the beamline X26C of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. The crystal was transferred to a cryobuffer (15% (w/v) glycerol, 2.7 m ammonium sulfate, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.5) prior to freezing. Data acquisition yielded 24,152 unique reflections out of 67,597 total observations (R-merge = ∑‖I-<I>‖/∑I = 0.056, <I/ς(I)> = 13.2, where <I> is the measured intensity averaged from multiple observations of symmetry related reflections and ς(I) is the root mean square deviation from the mean). The structure was solved by the difference Fourier method using the previously solved 3MHT ternary structure (WT M.HhaI with AdoHcy and DNA identical in sequence to the one used here) as the initial model (30O'Gara M. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 597-606Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The model was refined against diffraction data measured from 20 to 2.26 Å using X-PLOR (31Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). After several rounds of least square refinement, manual model building, and placement of well ordered solvent molecules (interpreted as water) by examination of difference electron density, the crystallographic R-free andR-factor (=∑‖Fo −Fc‖/∑ ‖Fo‖, whereFo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively) were reduced to 28.3% for 1,896 (approximately 8% of total unique reflections) and 20.7% for 22,169 unique reflections, respectively. To assess the conservation level of the TL dipeptide in mono-specific C5-MTases, sequences of bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes were aligned at the C-terminal sections of their variable regions (Fig. 1 C). In most cases, a certain version of the Thr(aliphatic = Leu, Val, Ile, Met, Pro, Ala) motif could be identified by visual scanning within 12–40 residues upstream the conserved motif IX. The aliphatic part is dominated by Leu, Ile, and Val, however, a few occurrences of Met, Pro, and Ala were identified. 3A clear exception appears to be M.EaeI in which His aligns in the second position. The actual His codon in the gene sequence (AF039582) is CAC which differs only by a single position (underlined) from CTC, the codon for Leu that is observed in M.EcoHK31Iβ (X82231), a highly homologous MTase of identical specificity (24Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 306-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Analysis of the aligned sequences revealed a broader consensus motif: (YFW)X(RK)X5P(STCA)P′TL′ (TASV)X5–16H(PYFWL), where X stands for non-conserved positions. This consensus sequence then served as a guide for aligning sequences that do not allow an ambiguous selection based on dipeptide analysis alone. In certain cases, pairwise similarities between several sequences were used in the construction of the alignment. The results of this analysis indicate that, depending on a similarity level, the conserved dipeptide TL can be identified in 67–71 out of 79 bacterial sequences analyzed (85–90%). The other sequences presumably contain Cys, Ser, or Ala at the Thr positions. Eukaryotic C5-MTases seems to have a more even distribution of the 4 amino acids at the first position (Fig. 1 C), although the number of sequences currently available is too small for meaningful quantitative evaluation. An interesting regularity is observed for both pairs of so-called hemi-methylases (M.Bpu10I and M.HgaI), enzymes that occur in the same cell and methylate complementary strands of the same non-palindromic target site (24Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 306-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All four enzymes match the broad consensus. However, one MTase in each pair contains a normal doublet (TI), whereas a scrambled version (AI or AR) appears at the equivalent position of the accompanying enzyme (Fig. 1 C). Twelve Thr-250 of M.HhaI mutants were constructed by cassette mutagenesis of the hhaIM gene through built-in unique restriction endonuclease sites. Their in vivo methylation efficiencies of the GCGC sites was assessed by challenging plasmid DNA isolated from the corresponding clones with a methylation sensitive restriction endonuclease, R.Hin6I. Table I summarizes the methylation activities of the mutant MTasesin vivo. Most substitutions at residue 250 lead to protection levels comparable to that of WT enzyme. Some versions, however, exhibited a significantly reduced activity (T250P,T250H), whereas two mutants (T250R and T250Y) showed a very low modification level even in cells overexpressing the proteins. Since the spectrum of mutations examined in this activity study represented all structural types of amino acids (small, large, aliphatic, aromatic, polar, charged etc.), we can generalize that large structural perturbations in this position interfere with the catalytic function of the enzyme.Table IIn vivo methylation of GCGC sites by Thr-250 mutants of M.HhaI as determined by cleavage of parental plasmid DNA with the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease R.Hin6IMTaseProtection of GCGC sites in vivo 4-a+, Full protection; +/−, partial protection; +/—, weak protection; –, complete fragmentation.

Plasmids were isolated from IPTG-induced (+IPTG) or uninduced (no IPTG) cells, respectively. Open table in a new tab Based on the methylation efficiencies in vivo, several mutants were selected for further analysis. We purified six of them (T250C, T250D, T250G, T250H, T250N, and T250S) to homogeneity using a procedure that involves a selective salt back-extraction of M.HhaI from cell debris (16Klimašauskas S. Szyperski T. Serva S. Wüthrich K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Kumar S. Cheng X. Pflugrath J.W. Roberts R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Attempts to isolate some hydrophobic variants (T250A, T250P, T250Y, and T250V) by this method proved unsuccessful due to low solubility of these proteins at a variety of salt conditions examined. Previous steady-state kinetic study of the HhaI MTase (25Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that the enzyme operates by an ordered Bi Bi mechanism in which DNA binds before AdoMet. Our multiple-turnover kinetic analysis of the M.HhaI mutants was performed under very similar reaction conditions as used by Wu and Santi (25Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation reactions were performed with poly(dG-dC) and [methyl-3H]AdoMet as substrates at 37 °C. Initial velocity measurements were performed in the linear phase of product formation (substrate consumption was maintained below 10 and 3% for DNA and AdoMet, respectively). Concentration of DNA and cofactor were varied to obtain Km values for each substrate (Fig. 2). The kinetic parameters observed for the WT enzyme were in excellent agreement with the results reported previously (25Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in TableII, the multiple turnoverkcat values of the mutants are very similar and cluster within a factor of 2 around that of the WT enzyme. The KmDNA values obtained are quite uniform too and follow in general the KDvalues (1–5 nm) for binary MTase-DNA interaction measured in gel mobility shift experiments; the largest (40-fold) increase in KmDNA is observed for the T250D mutant, consistent with the lack of the corresponding binary complex in the gel analysis (not shown). Overall, the catalytic efficiencieskcat/ KmDNAof T250H and T250D are down by a factor of 40 and 50, respectively, whereas the other mutants are almost as efficient as the native enzyme.Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters of Thr-250 mutants of M.HhaI with poly(dG-dC) and [methyl-3 H]AdoMet as substratesMTasekcatKmDNAKmAdoMetkcat/KmDNAkc"

The role of PS proteins in Alzheimer's disease is of interest because of the strong causal relationship to the disease (reviewed in Ref. 1Cruts M. Van Broeckhoeven C. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) through which FAD PS leads to Alzheimer's pathogenesis is not clearly defined, although recent advances have been made regarding PS structure and function. PS are polytopic membrane proteins to which a variety of functions have been linked including protein processing and transport, as well as for intracellular signaling in cell fate determination, survival, apoptosis, and response to stress (reviewed in Refs. 2Mattson M.P.

Both PS1 and β-catenin have been identified as components of a high molecular weight membrane complex present in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (8Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Mishimura M.

Furthermore, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), the serine/threonine kinase that regulates β-catenin levels, has also been shown to associate with PS1 (11Takashima A. Murayama M. Murayama O. Kohno T. Honda T. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N. Mercken M. Yanaguchi H. Sugihara S. Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9637-9641Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The regulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin levels is pivotal to the Wnt signal transduction pathway. Wnt signaling regulates cell fate determination during development and cell proliferation in adult tissues (reviewed in Ref. 12Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt signal, no signal transduction occurs due to the rapid degradation of β-catenin. β-Catenin is targeted for ubiquitination and proteosome degradation following phosphorylation by GSK-3β. The activity of the β-catenin complex is regulated by other proteins present, such as Axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), which facilitate the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β. The ability of Axin and APC to facilitate β-catenin phosphorylation is mediated by phosphorylation of both proteins by GSK-3β. Upon stimulation of the Wnt receptor, GSK-3β is inhibited, resulting in an increase in the cytosolic level of β-catenin rendering the protein available for transport to the nucleus where it activates Wnt target genes. PS1 also participates in the regulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin levels, although the nature of this modulation is unclear. Many insights regarding the role of PS1 in β-catenin regulation have come from comparisons of normal PS1 with those bearing FAD mutations. However, conflicting results have prevented firm conclusions. FAD PS1 appears to increase β-catenin degradation (13Zhang Z. Hartmann H. Do V.M. Abramowski D. Sturchler-Pierrat C. Staufenbiel M.

Med. 1999; 5: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This loss of β-catenin signal in a neuronal background has been linked to increased susceptibility to apoptosis (13Zhang Z.

FAD PS1 was also shown to compromise the ability of β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus, a state that could potentiate apoptosis (16Nishimura M. Levesque G. Zhang D.M. Ruel L. Chen F. Milman P.

Similar to Axin or APC, phosphorylation of PS1 by GSK-3β may serve to regulate β-catenin phosphorylation, thereby regulating β-catenin/Tcf gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we have characterized the role of each GSK-3β phosphorylation consensus motif in PS1/β-catenin association and identified one to be critical. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown in DMEM-21 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1%l-glutamine, and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Cells were maintained in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Transfection was carried out by subconfluent seeding of 293HEK cells into six-well tissue culture plates and transfecting DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. A cDNA encoding PS1 was amplified by standard polymerase chain reaction techniques and subcloned into a C-terminal Myc-His6-tagged mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−) (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis of the serine and threonine residues found in PS1, which conform to the aforementioned (S/T)XXXS consensus phosphorylation site were generated by using a two-primer pair method protocol outlined by the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic primer pairs were as follows: 5′-TATAATGCAGAAAGCAGAGAAAGGGAG-3′ and 3′-ATATTACGTCTTTCGTCTCTTTCCCTC-5′ for site T320R; 5′-GAAAGGGAGGCACAAGACACTGTTG-3′ and 3′-CTTTCCCTCCGTGTTCTGTGACAAC-5′ for site S324A; 5′-TATAATGCAGAAAGCAGAGAAAGGGAGGCACAAGACACTGTTG and 3′-ATATTACGTCTTTCGTCTCTTTCCCTCCGTGTTCTGTGACAAC for both sites T320R,S324A; 5′-CTAGGGCCTCATCGCGCTACACCTGAG-3′ and 3′-GATCCCGGAGTAGCGCGATGTGGACTC-5′ for site S353A; 5′-CTACACCTGAGGCACGAGCTGCTGTCC-3′ and 3′-GATGTGGACTCCGTGCTCGACGACAGG-5′ for site S357A; 5′-CTAGGGCCTCATCGCGCTACACCTGAGGCACGAGCTGCTGTCC-3′ and 3′-GATCCCGGAGTAGCGCGATGTGGACTCCGTGCTCGACGACAGG-5′ for both site S353A,S357A; 5′-GGTTGGTAAAGCCGCAGCAACAGCC-3′ and 3′-CCAACCATTTCGGCGTCGTTGTCGG-5′ for site S397A; 5′-GCAACAGCCAGAGGAGACTGGAAC-3′ and 3′-CGTTGTCGGTCTCCTCTGACCTTG-5′ for site S401R; 5′-CCAACCATTTCGGCGTCGTTGTCGGTCTCCTCTGACCTTG-3′ and 3′-GGTTGGTAAAGCCGCAGCAACAGCCAGAGGAGACTGGAAC-5′ for both site S397A,S401R. The fidelity of polymerase chain reaction replication and introduction of each corresponding PS1 mutation (underlined) was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. For reporter gene assays, 293HEK cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of Tcf-luciferase reporter gene plasmid, TOPFLASH, (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and the indicated amount of each expression construct. The total concentration of transfected DNA was kept constant by supplementation with empty vector. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, and the reporter activity was determined with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Assessment of the PS1 consensus phosphorylation motif was carried out in vitroaccording to the method described by Dong et al. (17Dong L.Q. Zhang R. Langlais P. He H. Clark M. Zhu L. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1822-8117Google Scholar) with only minor changes. Briefly, synthetic peptide (30–50 μm) containing either the Ser353, Ser357 motif (NH2-GPHRSTPESRAAV-COOH) or an altered motif to substitute the serine residues for alanine (NH2-GPHRATPEARAAV-COOH) (S353A,S357A), was incubated with 5 units of kinase, 10 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 111 TBq/mmol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 60 min at 37 °C. Incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate was determined by adsorption of the peptide to P81 membranes and scintillation counting. Synthetic PS1 peptides used for in vitro kinase studies were obtained from American Peptide Co. GSK-3β (rabbit), produced by recombinant methods, was purchased from Sigma or New England Biolabs. Other kinases were acquired as follows: casein kinase II from Sigma, protein kinase C from Promega, p38β from Upstate Biotechnology, and p38α produced at Scios Inc. Control reactions using cognate substrates for each kinase were performed in an identical fashion. In vivo phosphorylation was carried out using 293HEK cells transiently transfected with wild type or GSK-3β mutant PS1 DNA. Twenty-seven hours post-transfection, cell monolayers were washed, incubated for 1 h in phosphate-free medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, washed, and radiolabeled for 4 h with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysates were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, 10 mmKCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) prepared without EDTA. Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with nickel beads (Qiagen), washed first in complete lysis buffer and then in lysis buffer without 500 mm NaCl. Protein bound to the beads was eluted with lysis buffer lacking 500 mm NaCl and supplemented with 100 mm imidazole. The elute was adjusted to 2 mm EDTA, and PS1 was immunoprecipitated with a tetra-His monoclonal antibody followed by electrophoresis of the precipitate on a 12% NuPage Tris/glycine gel (Novex) as described below. The gel was dried and exposed for 48 h using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Sample dephosphorylation was carried out using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) by adding 300 units of enzyme during the final hour of the immunoprecipitation step. Human 293HEK cells (3 × 105) were transiently transfected with 0.01 mg of a green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid (pGFP) plus the indicated concentration of test plasmid in six-well tissue culture dishes. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were induced to undergo apoptosis. Cells were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and were visualized by microscopy. Approximately 300 green fluorescent protein-positive cells were assessed from each transfection (n = 3) from three randomly selected fields, and the mean of these was used to calculate percentage of apoptosis. Viable or apoptotic cells were distinguished based on morphological alterations typical of adherent cells undergoing apoptosis including becoming rounded, condensed, membrane-blebbing, and detached from the culture dish. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs. Cells were harvested 24–48 h post-transfection. For coimmunoprecipitation, cells in 100-mm plates were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed on ice for 15 min and then spun at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatants were collected. Lysates were precleared with 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of tetra-His monoclonal antibody (Qiagen). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times in lysis buffer and resolved on either 4–12% or 10% NuPage Bis-Tris gels (Novex). For Western blots, lysates were prepared in an identical manner. The PS1 monoclonal antibody directed to the C-terminal “loop” domain (3.6.1) was obtained by immunizing mice with a synthetic peptide spanning PS1 residues 309–331. The rat anti-human PS1 N-terminal antibody was purchased from Chemicon. Comparison of PS1 CTFs from His-tagged and untagged constructs was made by transfecting 293HEK cells with each construct for 24 h as described above, after which lysates were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies directed to PS1 NTF or CTF. The same samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-His antibody, and then the precipitates were probed by Western blot with the PS1 C-terminal antibody 3.6.1. The BCA method (Pierce) was used to normalize each sample such that equivalent amount of protein was applied to the gel. After gel separation, proteins were transferred to membranes and blotted with antibody. β-Catenin and GSK-3β monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The monoclonal antibody specific for activated GSK-3β Y279/Y216 was purchased from BIOSOURCE International. HEK293 cell cultures in 100-mm plates were washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Cells were washed once with ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl), resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm cytochalasin B, and protease inhibitors (CompleteTM; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. Cells were Dounce homogenized, and the nuclei (and membranes) were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm. The supernatant was collected and further spun at 100,000 ×g for 45 min to provide the cytosolic fraction. The pelleted fraction was washed twice in hypotonic buffer, vortexed, lysed by vigorous vortexing in cell lysis buffer, and spun at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatant was collected to provide the nuclear fraction. Protein concentrations in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were determined using the BCA reaction. Cultures of 293HEK cells stably expressing the APP Swedish (APPswe) mutation were transiently transfected with wild type PS1, FAD-PS1, or PS1 site-directed mutants with 2 μg of DNA per well of a six-well plate. Each cDNA was transfected in triplicate, and after 8 h, the medium was replaced by 1 ml of DMEM-21 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1%l-glutamine, and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Supernatants were collected 24 h post-transfection. The supernatants were clarified of cell debris and assayed for Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 by sandwich ELISA. Monoclonal antibodies developed by Scios used in the ELISA assays included: 1101.1, raised to residues 12–22 of the Aβ sequence; a C-terminal Aβ40-specific antibody, 1702.1; and a C-terminal Aβ42-specific antibody. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either mock cDNA, wild type PS1, FAD-PS1, or PS1 site-directed mutants with 2 μg of DNA per well of a six-well plate as previously described. Twenty-four-hour post-transfection cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and growth medium was replaced with methionine- and cysteine-free medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1% l-glutamine, and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. At this time, 100 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine was added and incubated for a further 20 min. Medium was then removed, and cells were washed and replaced with complete growth medium and chased for 0, 1.5, and 3 h. Cells were rinsed two times with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors on ice for 15 min. The cell lysates were spun at 14,000 rpm and immunoprecipitated with anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody, as described above. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 4–12% NuPage Bis-Tris gel (Novex) and analyzed by a PhosphorImager. PS1 and PS2 encode structurally similar proteins that share a high degree of homology. Each contain six or eight transmembrane domains with both N- and C-terminal hydrophilic regions and a large hydrophilic loop domain. From sequence alignment studies, it has been previously shown that the hydrophilic loop domain has the greatest sequence divergence, suggesting that the loop domain may mediate PS1 and PS2 functional differences. Alignment of the hydrophilic loop domain of PS1 from several species revealed that the loop domain contained a highly conserved sequence containing three potential GSK-3β consensus phosphorylation sites, two of which are conserved in all examined species (Fig.1 A). The sequence (S/T)XXXS is known to be a consensus sequence for a GSK-3β phosphorylation site. In the hydrophilic loop region of PS1, residues 263–407, there are three possible phosphorylation sites:TERES 324,STPES 357 andSATAS 401. Of the three sites, onlySTPES 357 andSATAS 401 are conserved across all examined species. Fig. 1 B shows an alignment of PS1 and PS2 hydrophilic loop domains and demonstrates that neither of the GSK-3β consensus phosphorylation sites are present in PS2. In addition to β-catenin, both APC and Axin are also GSK-3β substrates, and their ability to bind β-catenin in vitrois enhanced by phosphorylation. The sites necessary for GSK-3β phosphorylation have been identified, and mutating these sites leads to a disruption in the association between β-catenin and APC or Axin. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of Axin, APC, β-catenin, and PS1 reveals a conserved consensus motif (Fig. 1 C). Since this motif is conserved in PS1 and not PS2, it seems likely that these identified GSK-3β consensus phosphorylation sites mediate a specific PS1 function(s). Specifically, we sought to address whether the GSK-3β motifs present on PS1 are used to mediate PS1 binding to β-catenin. The general location of each GSK-3β consensus phosphorylation motif on the PS1 hydrophilic loop domain is schematically shown in Fig. 1 D. Each of the three consensus GSK-3β phosphorylation motifs present on PS1 was mutated. Within each GSK-3β motif, the critical serine and threonine codons of all three (S/T)XXXS consensus sites were either individually or both mutated. Table I summarizes the 14 different PS1 mutants we generated, the specific residues mutated, and the nomenclature used to reference each mutant. Prior to analyzing the effect of mutating the PS1 GSK-3β motifs relative to β-catenin binding and function, we first assessed their influence on two other PS1 functions: endoproteolysis and Aβ production.Table ISummary of GSK-3β phosphorylation site-specific mutant constructsConstruct nameInteracts with β-catenina+, interaction; −, no interaction; ND, not determined.pcDNA3.1 PS-1 WT+pcDNA3.1 PS-1 E280G+pcDNA3.1 PS-1 M146V+PS1 WT S353A−PS1 WT S357A−PS1 WT S353A,S357A−PS1 WT S397ANDPS1 WT S401RNDPS1 WT S397A;S401R+PS1 WT T320RNDPS1 WT S324ANDPS1 WT T320R,S324A+PS1 WT S353A,S357A,S397A,S401R−PS1 WT S353A,S357A,T320R,S324A−PS1 WT S397A,S401R,T320R,S324A+PS1 WT S353A,S357A,S397A,S401R,T320R,S324A−PS-1 E280G,S353A,S357ANDa +, interaction; −, no interaction; ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab PS1 is synthesized as a 46-kDa polypeptide that undergoes endoproteolytic processing to generate an ∼26-kDa N-terminal fragment and ∼20-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF), which are the predominantin vivo detected PS1 species (18Thinakaran G.

Epitope mapping and radiosequence analysis have shown that PS1 endoproteolysis occurs within the hydrophilic loop domain (21Podlinsny M.B. Citron M. Amarante P. Sherrington R. Xia W. Zhang J. Dichl T. Levesque G. Fraser P. Haass C. Koo E.H. Seubert P. St. George-Hyslop P. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 3: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether the consensus site mutations altered PS1 endoproteolysis, reflecting a requirement for GSK-3β phosphorylation. To confirm expression and to evaluate effects on the endoproteolytic processing of PS1, subconfluent 293HEK cell cultures were transiently transfected with wild type or mutant PS1, each tagged with a His epitope to distinguish exogenous from endogenous PS1. Western blot analysis of cell lysates with anti-His monoclonal antibody demonstrated the presence of PS1 holoprotein migrating at ∼46 kDa, as well as increased amounts of the ∼20-kDa CTF, compared with mock transfected cell lysates (Fig. 2 A,upper panel). These results demonstrate that the mutation of any or all of the GSK-3β phosphorylation consensus sites on the PS1 loop domain does not affect the regulated endoproteolytic processing of PS1. Western blot analysis of 293HEK cells transiently expressing tagged or untagged PS1 using PS1 N- and C-terminal specific antibodies and immunoprecipitation with an anti-His-antibody followed by Western blot with PS1 C-terminal specific antibody documented the authenticity of the tagged PS1-CTF (Fig. 2 A), reflecting endoproteolysis and replacement of endogenous PS1-CTF, although endoproteolysis was somewhat inefficient compared with untagged exogenous PS1 (Fig. 2 A, lower panels). We next determined whether the GSK-3β phosphorylation sites on PS1 altered the production of Aβ. PS1 has been shown to influence γ-secretase function. This has been best demonstrated in cells harboring PS1 targeted gene disruption where the levels of Aβ are greatly reduced (22De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in PS1 associated with FAD have been shown to elevate Aβ42 levels and many have been mapped to the loop domain (1Cruts M. Van Broeckhoeven C. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, we were curious if the mutations introduced in PS1 at the GSK-3β motifs would also result in increased levels of Aβ42. To measure Aβ production, 293HEK cell cultures stably expressing βAPP carrying the Swedish mutation (APPswe) were transiently transfected with wild type, FAD PS1 (E280G), or “GSK-3β ” mutant PS1. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, ELISA quantification revealed an increase in Aβ42 in conditioned medium collected from cells expressing PS1-FAD E280G mutant (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, Aβ42 production was not significantly changed in cells transfected with either wild type or with PS1 mutated at the conserved GSK-3β motifs (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that mutation of the GSK-3β consensus phosphorylation sites does not influence the production of Aβ42. It has previously been shown that the association between β-catenin and APC or Axin can be disrupted by mutating their GSK-3β consensus phosphorylation sites (12Peifer M. Polakis P.

The pathway-specific transcriptional activator AlcR mediates the induction of ethanol catabolism in the presence of a coinducing compound. Ethanol catabolism is further subject to negative control mediated by the general carbon catabolite repressor CreA. Here we show that, in contrast to alcA and alcR, thealdA gene is not directly subject to CreA repression. A single cis-acting element mediates AlcR activation ofaldA. Furthermore, we show that the induction of thealc gene system is linked to in situ aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. In aldA loss-of-function mutants, the alc genes are induced under normally noninducing conditions. This pseudo-constitutive expression correlates with the nature of the mutations, suggesting that this feature is caused by an intracellular accumulation of a coinducing compound. Conversely, constitutive overexpression of aldA results in suppression of induction in the presence of ethanol. This shows unambiguously that acetaldehyde is the sole physiological inducer of ethanol catabolism.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 369-380Google Scholar). Alcohol is oxidized via acetaldehyde into acetate, which enters mainstream metabolism in its activated form, acetyl-CoA. The two enzymes responsible for acetate formation, i.e. alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADHI)1 (EC1.1.1.1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) (EC 1.2.1.5), are encoded by the unlinked alcA and aldA genes, respectively. Ethanol catabolism is inducible by a variety of compounds and is driven by the irreversible conversion of acetaldehyde into acetate.Induction of ethanol catabolism further requires the action of a pathway-specific DNA-binding activator protein, AlcR, regulating both structural genes at the level of transcription (3Pateman J.A.

The encodingalcR gene, closely linked to alcA, concomitantly activates its own transcription. This autoactivation enables the adaptation toward ethanol conversion upon induction. Moreover, thealcR activation cascade mechanism facilitates a powerful induction; alcA and aldA are among the most highly transcribed, inducible fungal genes known to date (1Felenbok B. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Prog. Ind. Microbiol. 1994; 29: 141-179PubMed Google Scholar, 8Felenbok B. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 17: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Upon addition of more preferable carbon sources, induced ethanol catabolism ceases. This phenomenon, known as carbon catabolite repression, is likewise mediated at the level of transcription via a DNA-binding protein, CreA (2Felenbok B. Kelly J.M. Brambl R. Marzluf G. The Mycota III: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 369-380Google Scholar, 9Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Unlike induction, this negative control circuit is polytrophic since many catabolic systems are subject to carbon catabolite repression by means of the CreA repressor. CreA has been shown to act directly on both the structural alcAgene and the regulatory alcR gene, ensuring a rapid and complete shut down of ethanol conversion under repressive conditions (7Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol.

In the presence of both d-glucose and the gratuitous inducer 2-butanone (ethylmethyl ketone, EMK), the catabolic repression is so strong that it completely overrules the induction of all three principal genes for ethanol utilization. However, the two antagonizing control circuits allow a fine-tuning of the expression ofalcR and alcA within a culture subjected to less extreme growth conditions (11Fillinger S. Panozzo C. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the regulation of the ethanol catabolic pathway in A. nidulansis shown in Fig. 1.To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we have investigated the requirements in cis for AlcR-mediated activation and CreA-mediated repression in the structural alcA gene (12Panozzo C.

In both genes thein vivo functional cis-acting elements were identified. Multiple AlcR targets in alcA were shown to act synergistically upon transcriptional activation, which could explain the extraordinary strength of the alcA promoter upon induction, whereas alcR only contains a single activation target. Furthermore, repression and induction were shown to be mutually exclusive at the molecular level due to a competition between the two DNA-binding proteins, as their respective cis-acting elements in both the alcA and alcR promoters reside in close proximity. In addition, we have provided evidence for the coexistence of a distinct mode of action by which CreA establishes transcriptional repression of the alcR gene.In this communication, we analyze the means by which the two regulatory circuits impose their control on the transcriptional induction of the structural aldA gene. aldA has been previously cloned and characterized at the nucleotide level (4Lockington R.A.

Our current study reveals that at the molecular level, the regulation ofaldA transcription differs substantially from that of the two other principal genes of ethanol catabolism.The control of aldA expression could be important, considering the second prerequisite for induction, a coinducing compound. It is generally accepted that ALDH can only catalyze acetaldehyde oxidation, i.e. it is unable to reduce acetate (16Duncan R.J.S. Tripton K.F. Eur. J.

The presumed key role of ALDH in multiple catabolic pathways suggests that the expression of the encoding aldA gene is likely to be subject to tight control. Both ethanol and acetaldehyde have been proposed as physiological coinducers of the alcgene system (3Pateman J.A. Doy C.R. Olsen J.E. Norris U. Creaser E.H. Hynes M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1983; 217: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Sealy-Lewis H.M. Lockington R.A. Curr. Genet. 1984; 8: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence of the identity of the physiological inducer has not been obtained to date. To address the role of the coinducer in the induction process, we have investigated how the expression of ALDH affects the induction of the alcgene system. This approach has led to the clear identification of the physiological inducer with regard to ethanol catabolism. Furthermore, we provide evidence here indicating that a subtle control ofaldA and alcA gene expression is important for the onset and maintenance of an optimal catabolic flow from ethanol.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we have investigated the requirement of the pathway-specific AlcR transactivator and a coinducing compound for the transcriptional induction of the A. nidulans aldA gene (the structural gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase). We have established that all elements required in cis for proper aldAexpression reside within 220 bp upstream of the start of translation of the aldA gene. We have identified within that promoter the sole functional target mediating the activation of transcription by AlcR. Like all other AlcR activation targets identified in vivo so far (6Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Mathieu M. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it consists of two adjacent AlcR consensus sites. The target in aldA is organized as an inverted repeat of consensus sites, both with an A at the ambiguous first position (44Nikolaev I. Cochet M.-F. Lenouvel F. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by using a transformant strain carrying a derepressed functional alcR gene, we have shown now that aldA itself is not subject to repression by means of the general carbon catabolite repressor CreA. UnlikealcA, the other structural gene required for ethanol utilization, CreA-mediated repression of the regulatory alcRgene completely accounts for aldA transcriptional repression. The sole putative CreA consensus sequence within thealdA promoter, although tentatively eclipsing the single functional AlcR target, is not sufficient to subject aldAdirectly to carbon catabolite repression. Most physiologically relevant CreA targets characterized in A. nidulans to date consist of two adjacent CreA consensus sites (10Mathieu M. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Panozzo C. Cornillot E. Felenbok B. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1999; 32: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).We have now elucidated the means by which the two antagonizing control circuits, pathway-specific induction and general carbon catabolite repression, impose regulation on the three principal genes of ethanol catabolism (see Fig. 3). In both alcR and aldA, activation is mediated via a single AlcR inverted-repeat target, whereas in alcA three functional targets are present. The targets in alcA have been shown to act in synergy (12Panozzo C. Capuano V. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and this could well account for the strength of the alcApromoter upon induction of the alc gene system. However, thealdA promoter should be considered at least as powerful as that of alcA, despite the fact that it contains only one activation target. The direct involvement of the CreA repressor in the expression of alcA and alcR could explain this. Previously, evidence was presented that suggests that the repressor and activator compete for binding on the same promoter region in both these genes under all growth conditions (11Fillinger S. Panozzo C. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Carbon catabolite repression is a phenomenon that depends on the carbon source catabolic flow. In other words, carbon catabolite repression is never totally absent. As a result, disruption of functional CreA targets in both thealcR and alcA genes does not only lead to a derepression in the presence of d-glucose but also results in overexpression under induced conditions (7Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Mathieu M. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Panozzo C. Cornillot E. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6367-6372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Induction ofaldA transcription is regulated in a more straightforward manner since the genuine aldA promoter is only subject to AlcR-mediated activation. The expression of aldA thus reflects the true force of the AlcR activation cascade mechanism mediated via a single cis-acting element.Additionally, the differences in promoter strength could depend on the composition and the context in which the various functional AlcR targets reside. Previous studies have shown that the core context, spacing between the two half-sites of a target as well as orientation of the half-sites, influence AlcR binding in vitro (32Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 44Nikolaev I. Cochet M.-F. Lenouvel F. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that one basic residue (Arg-6) in AlcR, outside the AlcR zinc binuclear cluster, is involved not only in DNA binding but also in transcriptional regulation. The rationale for the reduced transcription of aldA lies in the lack of binding of AlcR to the inverted repeat target when this basic residue is mutated (44Nikolaev I. Cochet M.-F. Lenouvel F. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Another possible important consideration is the distance between the activation target and the site where the transcription machinery assembles, whereby the aldA promoter may be more accessible to the general transcription machinery. Indeed, it has been shown recently that nucleosome rearrangement can occur in A. nidulans in response to an induction signal (47Muro-Pastor M.I. González R. Strauss J. Narendja F. Scazzocchio C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1584-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Finally, considering the involvement of ALDH in multiple catabolic pathways, the existence of a second, yet unidentified transactivator foraldA should not be excluded.The second major finding reported in this paper is that acetaldehyde is the physiological inducer of ethanol utilization in A. nidulans. Our experiments with the aldA mutants indicate that when acetaldehyde (formed from regular cellular metabolism under noninducing growth conditions) is not sufficiently converted into acetate, the alc gene system is induced (cf. Fig. 7 A). In the aldA mutants the expression level of alcR and aldA mRNAs in noninduced growth conditions reflects the stringency of thealdA mutation, i.e. the expected accumulation of acetaldehyde. Consistent with this, we recently showed that acetaldehyde can evoke induction when added externally to pregrown cultures. 4M. Flipphi, and B. Felenbok, unpublished data. Ethanol utilization represents an example of a degradation pathway induced by a catabolic intermediate and not by the growth substrate itself.Acetaldehyde is considered to be highly toxic (48Jones R.P. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1989; 11: 130-153Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 49Crebelli R. Conti G. Conti L. Carere A. Mutat. Res. 1989; 215: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our results pose a challenging new question; how can the cell resolve the inducing and the toxic properties of this intermediate? As noted earlier,aldA67 mutants can still grow on carbon sources like lactose despite the apparent lack of ALDH activity. Therefore, the acetaldehyde accumulated in this mutant might be detoxified by other means. One possibility would be by reduction to ethanol, catalyzed by thealcA-encoded ADHI that is expressed pseudo-constitutively inaldA mutants. Acetaldehyde has been shown to be an excellent substrate for ADHI in vitro; reduction by ADHI is considerably faster than oxidation by ALDH (50Creaser E.H. Porter R.L. Britt K.A. Pateman J.A. Doy C.H. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One has to note however that other mechanisms of detoxification may be operational, such as the presence of another ALDH activity that would not be sufficient by itself to support growth on ethanol. In the presence of ethanol as the sole carbon source, limiting amounts of coinducer would trigger the formation of more acetaldehyde since the ADHI reaction equilibrium is fully shifted toward oxidation of ethanol. One of the most prominent features of modest pseudo-constitutive expression inaldA15 is the presence of a considerable alcAtranscript level. A preferential induction of alcA in the early stages of the induction process could enable enough accumulation of acetaldehyde to permit an optimal catabolic flow from ethanol. With the increase in intracellular acetaldehyde, the activation system can adapt the expression profile of the responsive genes until a steady state acetaldehyde concentration (below the toxic level) is reached. The presence of three synergistically acting AlcR targets in thealcA promoter together with differences in affinity among the functional AlcR targets in alcA, alcR andaldA could contribute to a preferential alcAinduction in response to limiting amounts of acetaldehyde. In support of this, we have previously obtained evidence indicating that the proximal AlcR targets in the alcA promoter are predominant in transcriptional activation (12Panozzo C. Capuano V. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that mutants, carrying a functional alcR gene but which is not subject to autoactivation (due to the disruption of the AlcR functional target), are perfectly able to grow on ethanol as the sole carbon source (10Mathieu M. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) even though the induction of the alc-responsive genes is far weaker than that in the wild type. This puts the autoregulation of the transactivator-encoding alcR gene into another perspective. The adaptation in response to increasing coinducer levels apparently does not require induced alcR expression but is facilitated by its endogenous regulation.Another important question arising from the finding of acetaldehyde as the coinducer concerns the onset of induction. Induction requires acetaldehyde whose production requires ADHI. But expression of ADHI requires induction of alcA by AlcR via acetaldehyde. To enable initial induction of alcA, a constitutive basal level expression of the alcR gene is required, and indeed,alcR basal transcription is substantial and is clearly observed in alcR loss-of-function mutants (7Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Mathieu M. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Fillinger S. Panozzo C. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Nikolaev I. Lenouvel F. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9795-9802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the onset of the induction process, the level of acetaldehyde should further increase beyond the conversion capacity of the constitutively present ALDH. Changes in acetaldehyde concentration are important in determining the onset and maintenance of the induction process. Clear evidence is provided by transformants expressingaldA from the strong constitutive gpdA promoter (Fig. 8). Prominent expression of aldA in the early phases of induction, as is the case in such transformants, slows down the build-up of intracellular acetaldehyde. As a consequence, the induction process is suppressed due to a failure to induce alcAsufficiently. This implies that the apparent in situ level of ALDH plays an important role in the transduction of the coinducer signal to the transcriptional activator AlcR.A subtle control of both aldA and alcA gene expression, in response to differential intracellular concentrations of acetaldehyde, could therefore be essential for the onset and maintenance of an optimal catabolic flow from ethanol. The fungal model organism, Aspergillus nidulans, is able to grow on ethanol as the sole source of carbon (1Felenbok B. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Prog. Ind. Microbiol. 1994; 29: 141-179PubMed Google Scholar, 2Felenbok B. Kelly J.M. Brambl R. Marzluf G. The Mycota III: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 369-380Google Scholar). Alcohol is oxidized via acetaldehyde into acetate, which enters mainstream metabolism in its activated form, acetyl-CoA. The two enzymes responsible for acetate formation, i.e. alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADHI)1 (EC1.1.1.1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) (EC 1.2.1.5), are encoded by the unlinked alcA and aldA genes, respectively. Ethanol catabolism is inducible by a variety of compounds and is driven by the irreversible conversion of acetaldehyde into acetate. Induction of ethanol catabolism further requires the action of a pathway-specific DNA-binding activator protein, AlcR, regulating both structural genes at the level of transcription (3Pateman J.A.

The encodingalcR gene, closely linked to alcA, concomitantly activates its own transcription. This autoactivation enables the adaptation toward ethanol conversion upon induction. Moreover, thealcR activation cascade mechanism facilitates a powerful induction; alcA and aldA are among the most highly transcribed, inducible fungal genes known to date (1Felenbok B. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Prog. Ind. Microbiol. 1994; 29: 141-179PubMed Google Scholar, 8Felenbok B. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 17: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Upon addition of more preferable carbon sources, induced ethanol catabolism ceases. This phenomenon, known as carbon catabolite repression, is likewise mediated at the level of transcription via a DNA-binding protein, CreA (2Felenbok B. Kelly J.M. Brambl R. Marzluf G. The Mycota III: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 369-380Google Scholar, 9Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Unlike induction, this negative control circuit is polytrophic since many catabolic systems are subject to carbon catabolite repression by means of the CreA repressor. CreA has been shown to act directly on both the structural alcAgene and the regulatory alcR gene, ensuring a rapid and complete shut down of ethanol conversion under repressive conditions (7Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol.

In the presence of both d-glucose and the gratuitous inducer 2-butanone (ethylmethyl ketone, EMK), the catabolic repression is so strong that it completely overrules the induction of all three principal genes for ethanol utilization. However, the two antagonizing control circuits allow a fine-tuning of the expression ofalcR and alcA within a culture subjected to less extreme growth conditions (11Fillinger S. Panozzo C. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the regulation of the ethanol catabolic pathway in A. nidulansis shown in Fig. 1. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we have investigated the requirements in cis for AlcR-mediated activation and CreA-mediated repression in the structural alcA gene (12Panozzo C. Capuano V. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,13Panozzo C. Cornillot E. Felenbok B. J. Biol.

In both genes thein vivo functional cis-acting elements were identified. Multiple AlcR targets in alcA were shown to act synergistically upon transcriptional activation, which could explain the extraordinary strength of the alcA promoter upon induction, whereas alcR only contains a single activation target. Furthermore, repression and induction were shown to be mutually exclusive at the molecular level due to a competition between the two DNA-binding proteins, as their respective cis-acting elements in both the alcA and alcR promoters reside in close proximity. In addition, we have provided evidence for the coexistence of a distinct mode of action by which CreA establishes transcriptional repression of the alcR gene. In this communication, we analyze the means by which the two regulatory circuits impose their control on the transcriptional induction of the structural aldA gene. aldA has been pre"

The proline-rich tyrosine kinase (PYK2; also known as cell adhesion kinase β, related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase, or calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase)1 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are members of a distinct family of non receptor protein-tyrosine kinases that are regulated by a variety of extracellular stimuli (10Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 11Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Although FAK is widely distributed, PYK2 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and in hematopoietic lineage cells. The alternative spliced isoform PYK2-H is specifically expressed in T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and natural killer cells (12Gismondi A. Jacobelli J. Mainiero F. Paolini R. Piccoli M. Frati L.

Similar to FAK, PYK2 lacks SH2 and SH3 domains but possesses several functional domains, including two proline-rich regions in its C terminus and several phosphorylated tyrosine residues, through which specific protein-protein interactions can occur. PYK2 was shown to play an important role in the integration of signals initiated by a diverse group of extracellular stimuli, including integrin binding, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and certain stress stimuli (11Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation are stimulated by neuronal stimuli and stress signals, leading to modulation of a potassium channel and activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway (16Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). In addition, stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 and complex formation between PYK2 and Src via the SH2 domain, leading to activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway (10Avraham H.

PYK2 was also suggested to participate in the transfer of signals from the cell surface to the cytoskeleton, because it is tyrosine phosphorylated and activated by adhesion-initiated signaling in osteoclasts, monocytes, platelets, and B lymphocytes (14Li X.

Med. 1997; 185: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PYK2 was also shown to interact with and phosphorylate the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin (19Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14341-14348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Salgia R. Avraham S. Pisick E. Li J.L. Raja S. Greenfield E.A. Sattler M. Avraham H. Griffin J.D. J.

In osteoclasts, PYK2 tyrosine kinase has been suggested to mediate integrin-initiated Src-dependent signaling, following adhesion (5Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P. Nakamura I. Rodan G.A. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PYK2 localizes to podosomes and the sealing zone, the primary adhesion structures in osteoclasts during resorption (17Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Src deficiency is associated with osteopetrosis in mice, because of loss of osteoclast function (21Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). Recently, targeted disruption of β3 integrin in mice was shown to cause progressive osteosclerosis without an apparent reduction in the number of osteoclasts on bone (22McHugh K.P. Hodivala-Dilke K. Zheng M.H. Namba N. Lam J. Novack D. Feng X. Ross F.P. Hynes R.O. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, interfering with αvβ3 functionin vitro, using the disintegrin echistatin, results in loss of osteoclast migration and formation of the sealing zone (3Nakamura I. Pilkington M.F. Lakkakorpi P.T. Lipfert L. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3985-3993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, inhibition of bone resorption in vivo by echistatin was not accompanied by a reduction in the number of osteoclasts on the bone surface (23Masarachia P. Yamamoto M. Leu C.T. Rodan G. Duong L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because PYK2 is a down stream mediator of the αvβ3-and Src-dependent signaling pathway in osteoclasts, we therefore tested whether PYK2 plays a rate-limiting role in osteoclast activity. In this study, we inhibited PYK2 expression using adenoviral vectors expressing PYK2 antisense. We demonstrate that reduction in PYK2 protein level results in inhibition of osteoclast formationin vitro, primarily because of reduced osteoclast adhesion and spreading. Moreover, expression of PYK2 antisense inhibits formation of the sealing zone in osteoclasts and blocks their bone resorption activity. These findings suggest that PYK2 plays an essential role in the adhesion-dependent cytoskeletal organization that leads to osteoclast polarization and activity. Anti-PYK2 polyclonal antibodies were previously described (17Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Antibodies to phosphotyrosine (monoclonal antibody 4G10) and anti-c-Src were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-paxillin was from Transduction Labs (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal antibody to adenoviral penton protein (clone 1431) was from Accurate Chemicals. Polyclonal antibodies raised against human β3 integrins were a gift from Dr. B. Bednar (Merck). fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson Labs. (West Grove, PA). All horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and protein G-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Murine osteoclast-like multinucleated cells (OCLs) were prepared on collagen gels as reported (24Nakamura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the osteoblastic MB1.8 cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells/cm2 on culture dishes precoated with 5 ml of 0.2% collagen gel matrix (Nitta Gelatin Co., Osaka, Japan). After 24 h, bone marrow cells isolated from tibia of 6–8-week old Balb/c mice were added (2.5 × 104cells/cm2) to the monolayer of MB1.8 cells. The co-culture was maintained in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 nm1,25(OH)2D3. OCLs were formed within 7 days and released from the dishes by treatment with 5 ml of 0.2% collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Co.) and collected by centrifugation at 250 ×g for 5 min. Alternatively, OCLs and mononuclear prefusion osteoclasts (pOCs) were prepared as described previously (25Wesolowski G. Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nagy R.M. Tezuka K. Tanaka H. Rodan G.A. Rodan S.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), except that at 6 days in culture, pOCs were detached using 10 mmEDTA solution, after removing MB1.8 cells with collagenase-dispase, followed by washing three times with α-minimum essential medium. pOCs, 95% pure as determined by TRAP staining, were used for cell adhesion assays. The recombinant, replication-deficient adenovirus vectors were constructed using pΔE1sp1 plasmid consisting of the human cytomegalovirus promoter and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation site as previously described (26Bett A.J. Haddara W. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8802-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Adenovirus (Ad) expressing the Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase gene (Ad-β-galactosidase) was used to optimize infection conditions. The pΔEl-PYK2/wt recombinant plasmid was constructed using the full-length murine PYK2 cDNA, which was cloned from a mouse spleen λ-ZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the specific PYK2 probe (17Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We also produce a recombinant adenovirus (Ad-PYK2/AS) carrying an antisense sequence of PYK2 consisting of 300 base pairs of the reverse 5′-coding region of the murine PYK2 cDNA. Recombinant viruses were produced in the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line, purified, and titrated according to standard methods (27Hitt M.M. Addison C.L. Graham F.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: 137-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The co-cultures of MB1.8 cells and murine bone marrow cells were infected with recombinant virus at different multiplicities of infection (MOI): 1000, 100, 10, 0.1, and 0.01. Viral stock was diluted with α-minimum essential medium and added directly to the co-cultures. Adenovirus was normally added to cultures at day 3, for 24 h, followed by a change of medium. To determine the efficiency of infection, cells were infected with Ad-β-galactosidase for 24 h. At day 7, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline. The co-cultures were either stained with X-gal histochemical staining or with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), a marker enzyme for osteoclasts (28Tanaka S. Takahashi T. Takayanagi H. Miyazaki T. Oda H. Nakamura K. Hirai H. Kurokawa T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1714-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The number of X-gal-positive cells and TRAP-positive cells was counted in triplicate cultures. Efficiency of adenoviral infected osteoclasts was expressed as the ratio of X-gal-positive to total TRAP-positive cells. Infected pOCs or OCLs were harvested from the infected co-cultures at day 5 or 7, respectively. pOCs were used for biochemical analyses, cell adhesion, and spreading on vitronectin. OCLs were used in immunostaining and pit formation. Polystyrene dishes (35 mm, Becton Dickinson) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml human vitronectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Uninfected pOCs or cells infected with Ad-PYK2/wt or Ad-PYK2/AS were isolated as described above. For biochemical analyses, cells were either kept in suspension (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) or allowed to attach to vitronectin-coated plates for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were solubilized in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and prepared for immunoprecipitation. To quantify the planar area of cell spreading, cells were allowed to adhere and spread on vitronectin for 1 h. After fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, the periphery of each cell was outlined, and the total planar area was calculated using an image analyzing system (Empire Imaging System, Milford, NJ). Because it is difficult to determine osteoclast apoptosis in the co-culture system in the presence of serum, growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins derived from MB1.8 cells, pOCs (25,000 cells/well) were therefore isolated from uninfected co-cultures or cultures infected with Ad-PYK2/wt or Ad-PYK2/AS for 4 days. Purified pOCs were then plated on vitronectin-coated glass coverslips for 1 h in the absence of serum. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with Oregon green-labeled phalloidin and Hoechst 33342 stain (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Apoptotic pOCs were assessed by cells showing nuclear condensation and fragmentation. Results are expressed as the percentages of apoptotic cells over total counted pOCs (n = 100), viewed with a 20× objective and a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. Cell extracts were prepared with modified RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PYK2, pp60c-Src, p130Cas, or paxillin. Immunoprecipitation was carried out for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. Blots were first immunoblotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 and then with the respective immunoprecipitating antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG. Blots were developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Image densitometry (model GS-700; Bio-Rad) was used to estimate the phosphotyrosine contents and the protein levels of each protein, from which the specific activity of tyrosine phosphorylated protein was calculated. Relative specific activity of phosphorylated protein was normally determined from triplicate experiments. Pit-forming activity of OCLs was determined as described (3Nakamura I. Pilkington M.F. Lakkakorpi P.T. Lipfert L. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3985-3993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (1,000 cells/slice) of the OCLs were placed on dentine slices in 96-well culture plates. After 20 h, dentine slices were either stained with Mayer's hematoxylin for resorption pits. Pit area was measured by image analysis. The results were expressed as the means ± S.D. (n = 5) of resorbed area per whole dentine surface area. Immunofluorescent labeling of actin rings in OCLs was performed essentially as previously described (17Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). OCLs were plated on serum-coated glass coverslips or on bone slices for 20 h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then double-stained for TRAP and F-actin (3Nakamura I. Pilkington M.F. Lakkakorpi P.T. Lipfert L. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3985-3993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PYK2 was visualized using the affinity purified anti-PYK2 antibodies, followed by tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Actin was stained with Oregon green 514 phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Paxillin was stained with monoclonal antibody 349 and visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse IgG. The αvβ3 integrins were immunostained using polyclonal antibodies as described previously (3Nakamura I. Pilkington M.F. Lakkakorpi P.T. Lipfert L. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3985-3993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Immunofluorescence-labeled cells were photographed through an 100× objective using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope or with a Leica TCS SP Spectral confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with Argon-crypton laser (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmBH). The co-cultures of murine osteoblastic MB1.8 cells and bone marrow cells were first infected with Ad-β-galactosidase virus at MOI of 10 for every 24 h from day 1 to day 5 in culture. At day 7, parallel co-cultures were stained with either X-gal or TRAP stains. Frequency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in OCLs was quantitated as the ratio of β-gal(+) cells to TRAP(+) cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, 75–80% of the total TRAP(+) cells were infected with Ad-β-gal when virus was added to co-cultures at either day 3 or day 4. We also noted that the fraction of β-gal expressing multinucleated OCLs with three or more nuclei, was the same as in the TRAP(+) cells, suggesting that adenoviral gene transfer does not affect osteoclast fusion. A dose-response relationship between viral dose (MOI) and the fraction of infected OCLs was also observed (Fig. 1 B) when Ad-β-gal was added at day 3 and quantitated for β-gal(+) and TRAP(+) cells at day 7. Although the co-cultures contain a confluent layer of osteoblastic MB1.8 cells, β-gal was expressed preferentially in OCLs and pOCs, as shown in Fig.1 C. To analyze the effect of Ad-PYK2/AS on PYK2 expression in OCLs, we infected the co-cultures with adenoviral vectors (MOI = 10) expressing either full-length PYK2 (Ad-PYK2/wt) or PYK2 antisense (Ad-PYK2/AS) at day 3 or 4 of the co-cultures. OCLs were then purified at day 7, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Approximately equal amounts of protein were isolated from untreated and infected OCLs, as illustrated by Western blotting with anti-β3 integrin antibodies (Fig.2, lower panel). This suggested that adenoviral infection did not significantly affect osteoclast differentiation using markers such as β3integrin expression (Fig. 2) or TRAP activity (Figs. 1 C and3 A). PYK2 protein expression in OCLs treated with Ad-PYK2/wt at day 3 of the co-culture was increased about 2-fold, as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, there was a significant reduction (50–70%) in PYK2 protein levels, in OCLs treated with Ad-PYK2/AS, relative to normal controls. We have never observed complete inhibition of PYK2 expression in osteoclasts exposed to antisense treatment, possibly because cells with very low PYK2 levels might detach or apoptose. This is supported by the marked reduction in the number of TRAP(+) cells in co-cultures treated with Ad-PYK2/AS at MOI = 100 (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Infection of the co-culture system with adenovirus expressing PYK2 antisense inhibits osteoclastogenesis.Numbers and Area of TRAP(+) cells were quantitated from co-cultures infected with increased concentrations of either Ad-PYK2/wt (A) or with Ad-PYK2/AS (B). Each condition was run in quadruplicate samples, and the results are expressed as the means ± S.D. C, morphological analyses of co-cultures infected with Ad-PYK2/wt and Ad-PYK2/AS . Note that area of TRAP(+) cells was more sensitive to the increase in expression of PYK2 antisense than the number of these cells. Bars, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the effect of Ad-PYK2/AS on the formation of osteoclast-like cells in vitro, we infected the co-culture system at day 3 with increasing concentrations of adenoviral vectors (wt and AS) and quantitated both the number of TRAP(+) cells and the area of TRAP(+) cells in these cultures at day 7. As shown in Fig. 3 A, infection with Ad-PYK2/wt had no effect on the formation of multinucleated TRAP(+) cells, even at high virus concentrations (MOI = 1000). In contrast, infection with Ad-PYK2/AS resulted in significant inhibition of osteoclast formation with an EC50 of 50 MOI (Fig. 3 B). More importantly, Ad-PYK2/AS appeared to be more potent in reducing the area of TRAP(+) cells with an EC50 of around 2–5 MOI. This suggested that the primary effect of PYK2 antisense might be inhibition of OCL spreading and possibly of OCL migration prior to fusion. As shown in Fig. 3 C, Ad-PYK2/wt infected OCLs appeared as multinucleated TRAP(+) cells (Fig. 3 C, panel b), not different from OCLs in normal control cultures (Fig. 3 C,panel a). However, OCLs treated with Ad-PYK2/AS were small and retracted and were densely stained for TRAP activity. To further confirm the role of PYK2 in the regulation of osteoclast spreading, we studied pOCs isolated from co-cultures, which were either untreated or infected with Ad-PYK2/wt or with Ad-PYK2/AS. As shown in Fig. 2, adenoviral gene transfer did not alter the expression of the β3 integrin. We plated the pOCs on vitronectin-coated dishes under serum-free conditions and determined the increase in cellular planar area with time. Planar area of either untreated or pOCs infected with Ad-PYK2/wt increased ∼4-fold within 60 min (Fig.4 A). However, pOCs infected with Ad-PYK2/AS failed to spread on vitronectin (Fig. 4, Aand B). On the other hand, several TRAP(−) cells occasionally found in this pOC preparation normally spread on VN (Fig.4 B, panel c, arrowhead). We observed a small increase in the rate of cell spreading in pOCs infected with Ad-PYK2/wt (Fig. 4 A), consistent with the 2-fold increase in PYK2 protein expression in OCLs infected with Ad-PYK2/wt (Fig. 2). These cells seem very well spread by comparison with the normal controls (Fig. 4 B, panels a andb). Because Ad-PYK2/AS inhibited osteoclast spreading and subsequently reduced the number of TRAP(+)-OCLs in the co-culture system (Fig. 3), we examined the effect of Ad-PYK2/AS on purified pOCs plated on vitronectin-coated dishes for 60 min under serum-free conditions. Because it is difficult to assess adhesion-dependent osteoclast apoptosis in the co-culture systems where osteoclastogenesis were influenced by serum and growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix proteins derived from the osteoblastic/stromal MB1.8 cells, we therefore examine apoptotic events in pOCs isolated from co-cultures uninfected and infected for 4 days prior to optimal fusion (25Wesolowski G. Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nagy R.M. Tezuka K. Tanaka H. Rodan G.A. Rodan S.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Typical preparations of pOCs contain mainly mononuclear cells (∼80%) and cells with two to four nuclei (Fig. 4 C). Uninfected pOCs and pOCs infected with Ad-PYK2/wt appeared as spread cells with organized podosomal adhesion contacts and with flattened nuclei (Fig. 4 C, panels a–d). On the other hand, pOCs infected with Ad-PYK2/AS were associated with reduced adhesion and cell rounding and compacted nuclei (Fig. 4 C, panels e and f). Because of thick rounding cell shape, pOCs expressing PYK2 antisense often appeared to have overlapping nuclei at one plane of focus. However, we did not detect significant increase in number of apoptotic cells associated with chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in pOCs infected with Ad-PYK2/AS. We indeed found that during the initial phase of cell adhesion, the percentage of apoptotic pOCs are 4.8% in uninfected pOCs, 5.7% in cells infected with Ad-PYK2/wt, and 6.2% in pOCs infected with Ad-PYK2/AS. We have previously shown that PYK2 and p130Cas form a stable complex independent of c-Src (29Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Nagy R.M. Parsons J.T. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Biol.

However, in Src(−/−) OCLs, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of PYK2 and p130Cas were greatly reduced (29Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Nagy R.M. Parsons J.T. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Biol.

Serpins play an important role in the control of proteinases involved in blood coagulation, complement activation, and inflammation and are distinguished functionally from other types of protein inhibitors by their ability to form SDS stable complexes with target proteinases. Crystal structures have shown that members of the family share a highly conserved tertiary fold consisting of three large β-sheets surrounded by nine α-helices. This scaffold presents the reactive loop as a pseudosubstrate that binds to and inhibits the target proteinase (3Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.-P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The target proteinases of PAI-1 are urokinase-type plasminogen activator and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) (4Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and as such it is an important modulator of events of extracellular proteolysis in fibrinolysis and in the turnover of extracellular matrix (5van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 263-276Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). One of the most striking features of serpins is their ability to undergo a dramatic conformational rearrangement with the N-terminal portion of the reactive loop inserting into β-sheet A (6Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar).

Serpins are also able to link their reactive loop to a β-sheet of another molecule to form loop-sheet polymers, one form of which (18Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G.

This conformational change has not been described in PAI-1, which more readily adopts the inert latent configuration. However, the recent crystal structure of recombinant active PAI-1 revealed PAI-1 as a polymer in which the reactive loop anneals as strand 7A of β-sheet A (34Sharp A.M. Stein P.E. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Berkenpas M.B. Ginsburg D. Lawrence D.A. Read R.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to other models of serpin polymers in which the loop anneals with either the A- or C-sheet of another molecule (Fig. 1). We have examined the behavior of PAI-1 under a variety of conditions and show here that both the native and latent species can form polymers at low pH. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were obtained from BDH Chemicals Ltd. Subtilisin Carlsberg, and riboflavin were purchased from Sigma, and phenyl-Sepharose (low substituted), CM-Sepharose FF, and Superdex S200 resins were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human tPA was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Active glycosylated PAI-1 (from HT1080 cells) was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Andreasen (Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark), or prepared by refolding latent glycosylated PAI-1 (from Alpha Laboratories, Hants, UK) as described previously (35Sui G.-C. Wiman B. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The PAI-1 expression plasmid pET11c-PAI-1 was a kind gift from Prof. Xianxiu Xu (Nanjing University) and the peptide Ac-TVASSSTA (encoding P14-P7 for PAI-1) was synthesized by MWG-Biotech UK Ltd. The construction of pET11c-PAI-1 and expression of recombinant PAI-1 have been described previously (36Zhou A. Pei Y. Wu H. Dong X. Xu X. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar). The stable PAI-1 mutant (N150H, K154T, GQ19L, and M354I) (37Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The purification protocol was a modification of published methods. Briefly the cell lysate was applied to a CM-Sepharose column (2.5 × 40 cm), and then, after washing to base line with buffer A (20 mm NaOAc, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 5.6), the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of buffer A containing 0.2–1.0 m NaCl. PAI-1 eluted at 0.6m NaCl, and PAI-1 containing fractions were pooled and mixed with13volume of buffer B (3 m(NH4)2SO4, 20 mm NaOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 5.6). The solution was then loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.6 × 10 cm) that had been equilibrated with buffer C (1 m(NH4)2SO4, 20 mm NaOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 5.6), and the protein was eluted with a 400 ml gradient of 1.0–0 m(NH4)2SO4 in 20 mmNaOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 5.6. Native and latent PAI-1 were collected separately, concentrated to 1 mg/ml in 5 mmNaOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 5.6, and stored at −70 °C. The purity of PAI-1 in each peak was characterized by SDS-PAGE. Native PAI-1 (200 μg/ml) was incubated with subtilisin (4 μg/ml) at a final ratio of 100:1 (w/w) in 5 mm NaOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 5.6, at room temperature for 45 min, and then the reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm. A 13volume of buffer C was added and reactive loop cleaved PAI-1 was separated from the native and latent form on the phenyl-Sepharose column as described above. The cleaved form of PAI-1 was characterized by SDS-PAGE, mass spectroscopy, and N-terminal sequencing. This system was first described by Jovin in 1973 (38Jovin T.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 209: 477-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and modified to assess the conformers of PAI-1. The separating gel contained 12% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.4% (w/v) bisacrylamide and 260 mm acetic acid adjusted to pH 4 with KOH. The stacking gel contained 2.5% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.625% (w/v) bisacrylamide, and 90 mm acetic acid adjusted to pH 5.0 with KOH. The pH of both were varied to assess conformations of PAI-1. A mixture of riboflavin and TEMED (with final concentrations of 5 mg/liter and 1.25 ml/liter, respectively) was used to initiate polymerization of the acrylamide. The electrode buffer contained 40 mm β-alanine adjusted to pH 4 with acetic acid, and methyl green was used as the tracking dye. The proteins migrated toward the negative electrode. All the gel electrophoresis was performed at room temperature unless otherwise stated. 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels were cast with a double lumen tube and a peristaltic pump to give a linear gradient from 0 to 8 murea using the low pH nondenaturing PAGE buffer system. The gels were rotated through 90°, the stacking gel was poured, and the gels were run using the same electrode buffer as above. The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue or by silver staining. Fluorescence measurements were made using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B spectrofluorimeter as detailed previously (39Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of PAI-1 was measured using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and detecting photons with a wavelength of 340 nm emitted at 90° to the excitation beam. Wherever possible the slits controlling the intensity of the excitation light source were kept at the minimum machine-permissible limit of 2.5 nm. Emission slit widths were varied between 2.5 and 15 nm depending on the experimental conditions to give the optimal emission signal. The experiments were performed in a 0.5-ml cuvette with a path length of 1 cm on the excitation axis and 0.2 cm on the emission axis. Light scattering experiments were performed under the same conditions but at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 405 nm. CD experiments were undertaken in a 0.5 mm path length quartz cell using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. Samples of PAI-1 were prepared in 0.1 mNaOAc for pH values between 4 and 5.5, 0.1 m sodium phosphate for pH values between 6 and 8, and 100 mm Tris for pH 8.9. The protein was examined at 0.28 mg/ml with 25 mm NaCl from pH 4 to 8.9. All buffers were filtered, and samples were centrifuged before the experiment. Changes in secondary structure of PAI-1 with temperature were measured by monitoring the CD signal at 222 nm or 216 nm between 25 and 95 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C/min. The second derivative of the resulting data was then used to calculate the inflection point of the transition and hence theTm (39Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Measurement of the far UV CD spectra of native and polymerized PAI-1 at pH 4 was complicated by the high absorbance of the buffer (0.1 m NaOAc). This was reduced by dialyzing PAI-1 against water at 4 °C and then diluting into 5 mm NaOAc, pH 4 (0.48 mg/ml). The spectra were recorded at 20 °C in 5 mm NaOAc, pH 4, and averaged for 20 runs to give the profile for the native protein. PAI-1 was then incubated at 37 °C for a further 2 h before recording the spectrum of the polymerized protein. Purified PAI-1 or PAI-1 electrotransferred to Problot (40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Upton C. McFadden G. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 516-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was N-terminally sequenced by the Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge. The subtilisin cleavage of PAI-1 was also analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Cleaved PAI-1 was exchanged with distilled water by Microcon Ultrafiltration. Sinapinic acid was used as the matrix. The Kratos Kompact matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization IV (Kratos Analytical Ltd., Manchester, UK) was operated in positive ion linear mode with an acceleration voltage of +20 kV. The results were the averages of over 100 shots. Glycosylated recombinant PAI-1 spontaneously converts to the latent conformation with a half-life of 3 h under physiological conditions (4Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this may be increased to 100 h if it is stored at high salt concentration, low pH, and room temperature (41Björquist P. Ehnebom J. Inghardt T. Hansson L. Lindberg M. Linschoten M. Strömqvist M. Deinum J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our purification protocol of PAI-1 was a modification of existing methods (42Sancho E. Tonge D.W. Hockney R.C. Booth N.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 43Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and all the steps were carried out at room temperature. Following expression of PAI-1 and cell lysis, the supernatant was directly loaded onto a CM-Sepharose column and eluted with a NaCl gradient that gave ∼90% pure PAI-1 with a small fraction of latent protein (data not shown). The eluted PAI-1 was then salted to 1 m (NH4)2SO4 and further purified by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, which resulted in complete separation of active PAI-1 from its latent conformation (Fig.2 a). The active peak (hereafter referred to as the native component) was confirmed to be PAI-1 by N-terminal sequencing (1VHHPP), and typically 1 g of wet Escherichia coli cell pellet yielded 5 mg of active and 0.2 mg of latent PAI-1. Native, but not latent, PAI-1 was able to form SDS stable complexes with tPA (Fig. 2 b) and could be cleaved at the P1-P1′ bond of the reactive loop by subtilisin (Fig. 2 c). Reactive loop cleaved PAI-1 was separated from native and latent protein by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography as the cleaved protein eluted before the other conformations (Fig. 2 a); cleaved PAI-1 eluted at 0.6 m(NH4)2SO4, native PAI-1 at 0.4m, and the latent species eluted at 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4. The purity of all the PAI-1 species was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and the cleavage sites of subtilisin were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The primary cleavage site was at P1-P1′ (Arg346-Met347), which gives an N-terminal sequence of 1VHHPP and 347MAPEE, with secondary sites at P1-P2 (Ala345-Arg346) and P3-P4 (Val343-Ser344) (Fig. 2 d). Native PAI-1 was easily distinguished from the reactive loop cleaved protein by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 c) but migrated with the same electrophoretic mobility as latent PAI-1. Native PAI-1 migrated as a smear or remained in the sample well on a pH 7.8 nondenaturing gel. Because native PAI-1 is more stable at low pH, it was characterized on a pH 4 nondenaturing discontinuous buffer system (acid-PAGE). This differentiated between native, cleaved, and latent PAI-1 (Fig.3 a), and to our surprise both native and latent PAI-1 formed discrete high molecular mass ladders (Fig. 3 a, lanes 1 and 2) characterized in other serpins as loop-sheet polymers (16Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.-S.W. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5282-5288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 33Patston P.A. Hauert J. Michaud M. Schapira M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Varying the pH confirmed that both native and latent PAI-1 formed polymers when assessed on gels between pH 3.5 and 5, but these were most marked at lower pH values. Reactive loop cleaved PAI-1 did not form polymers even after assessment on gels at pH 3.5. The resistance of the reactive loop cleaved PAI-1 to pH-induced polymerization may result from either inaccessibility of the reactive loop to act as a donor for polymerization or from the filling of the β-sheet A binding site by the cleaved reactive loop. These alternatives were assessed using PAI-1 that had been stabilized by incubation with an exogenous peptide corresponding to P14-P7 that binds to β-sheet A but leaves the reactive loop in its external exposed position (44Kvassman J.-O. Lawrence D.A. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27942-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 45Xue Y. Björquist P. Inghardt T. Linschoten M. Musil D. Sjölin L. Deinum J. Structure. 1998; 6: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The binary complex was formed by incubating PAI-1 with 100-fold molar excess of P14-P7 reactive loop peptide at 37 °C in 10 mm NaOAc, 50 mm NaCl, pH 5.6, for 24 h. Formation of the complex was confirmed by a loss of inhibitory activity with PAI-1 becoming a substrate for tPA. The peptide-PAI-1 complex failed to form polymers on an acid-PAGE with either the pattern seen with native PAI-1 or with latent PAI-1. Structurally the significant difference between the peptide-complexed and native PAI-1 is that of a six-strandedversus a five-stranded A-sheet, and the significant difference between latent PAI-1 and both the peptide-complexed and cleaved form PAI-1 is the presence of a vacant strand 1C position in the latent form. Thus, the results suggest that the polymerization of native PAI-1 requires a five-stranded A-sheet compatible with s7A linkage observed in the crystal structure (34Sharp A.M. Stein P.E. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Berkenpas M.B. Ginsburg D. Lawrence D.A. Read R.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and that the different polymerization observed with latent PAI-1 may require a vacated s1C position, as in the C-sheet model (Fig. 1). Support for these conclusions of separate mechanisms of loop linkage is provided by the absence of either of the patterns of polymerization in reactive loop cleaved PAI-1, which has both a six-stranded A-sheet and an intact s1C. To determine the kinetics of polymerization, native PAI-1 was incubated at pH 4 prior to separation on an acid-PAGE. Native PAI-1 completely polymerized after incubation at pH 4 and 37 °C for 3 h (Fig.3 b). The rate of polymerization of PAI-1 at pH 4 was assessed using light scattering at 0.1 mg/ml and 37 °C (Fig.3 c). The data were fitted to a single exponential that gave a rate of polymerization (k1) of 3.03 SD ± 0.49 × 10−5 s−1 (n = 4). This rate corresponded well to the rate of polymer formation when assessed by acid-PAGE (Fig. 3 b). The polymerization of PAI-1 was further examined using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Incubation at 0.1 mg/ml, pH 4, and 37 °C resulted in a reduction in the fluorescence signal (Fig. 3 c). This was fitted to a double exponential decay to generate an initial fast rate (k1) and then a slow rate (k2). The slow rate (2.93 ± 0.19 × 10−5 s−1; n = 4) was comparable with the rate obtained from the light scattering and from the acid-PAGE. The fast rate of polymerization was independent of protein concentration (1.24 ± 0.09 × 10−3s−1) over a range of concentrations of PAI-1 from 0.025 to 0.4 mg/ml. In contrast the slow rate increased with protein concentration (Fig. 3 d), indicating a bimolecular process in keeping with polymer formation. The lack of concentration dependence of the fast rate implies that it is unimolecular process in keeping with a pH-induced conformational transition that preceeds polymerization. These data show striking similarities with the polymerization of another serine proteinase inhibitor α1-antitrypsin (39Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This too has a fast unimolecular step that represents a conformational transition followed by a slow bimolecular process that correlates with the generation of polymers. Native and latent PAI-1 polymers were analyzed by gel filtration on a Superdex S200 column in 20 mm NaOAc, pH 4, or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA at room temperature. PAI-1 was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min at pH 4 and centrifuged to remove aggregates before loading onto the column. In both cases only a monomeric peak was apparent (data not shown). Thus, both polymers of native and latent PAI-1 were dissociable. These data are similar to the results obtained for the dimer of antithrombin which was crystallographically shown to be due to reactive loop-C-sheet linkage (15Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). This similarly dissociates to monomeric protein on gel filtration (46Wardell M.R. Abrahams J.-P. Bruce D. Skinner R. Leslie A.G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 47Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Carrell R.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 3388-3396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity of the pH 4 treated native PAI-1 could not be assessed against tPA directly because tPA loses its enzymatic activity at this pH. However, after polymerization at pH 3.5–5 for 30 min, native PAI-1 was shown to regain almost full inhibitory activity against tPA when the pH was raised above 5. Conversely, no inhibitory activity was detected after treating latent PAI-1 at low pH for 2 h at 37 °C and then raising the protein to a neutral pH. Thus, in the latent PAI-1 polymers, the reactive loop must remain at least partially inserted into β-sheet A. The demonstration that conformations of PAI-1 could be distinguished on low pH nondenaturing gels prompted their examination by transverse urea gradient gels with low pH buffers. Active and cleaved PAI-1 exhibited similar profiles to the corresponding species of α1-antitrypsin or antithrombin (16Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.-S.W. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5282-5288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 48Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) but with an unfolding transition at ∼3 m urea for the native species and resistance to unfolding in 8 murea for reactive loop cleaved PAI-1 (Fig.4, a and b). Latent PAI-1 had an unfolding transition on transverse urea gradient gels at ∼6 m urea (Fig. 4 c), which is unlike the latent conformations of α1-antitrypsin, antithrombin, and α1-antichymotrypsin, which are resistant to unfolding in 8 m urea (14Chang W.-S.W. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3695-3701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.-S.W. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The binary complex of PAI-1 with the P14-P7 reactive loop peptide also starts to unfold at ∼7m urea (Fig. 4 d), which again is different from those of α1-antitrypsin and antithrombin. These data demonstrate that incorporation of the reactive loop into the A-sheet of latent PAI-1 is not as stable as in other serpins and are consistent with the well recognized finding that latent PAI-1 can be reactivated by treatment with denaturants (4Lawrence D."
https://openalex.org/W2148800819,"DNA-cytosine-5-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is the enzyme believed to be responsible for maintaining the epigenetic information encoded by DNA methylation patterns. The target recognition domain of DNMT1, the domain responsible for recognizing hemimethylated CGs, is unknown. However, based on homology with bacterial cytosine DNA methyltransferases it has been postulated that the entire catalytic domain, including the target recognition domain, is localized to 500 amino acids at the C terminus of the protein. The N-terminal domain has been postulated to have a regulatory role, and it has been suggested that the mammalian DNMT1 is a fusion of a prokaryotic methyltransferase and a mammalian DNA-binding protein. Using a combination of in vitro translation of different DNMT1 deletion mutant peptides and a solid-state hemimethylated substrate, we show that the target recognition domain of DNMT1 resides in the N terminus (amino acids 122–417) in proximity to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding site. Hemimethylated CGs were not recognized specifically by the postulated catalytic domain. We have previously shown that the hemimethylated substrates utilized here act as DNMT1 antagonists and inhibit DNA replication. Our results now indicate that the DNMT1-PCNA interaction can be disrupted by substrate binding to the DNMT1 N terminus. These results point toward new directions in our understanding of the structure-function of DNMT1. DNA-cytosine-5-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is the enzyme believed to be responsible for maintaining the epigenetic information encoded by DNA methylation patterns.

DNA methyltransferase(s) polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis human embryonic kidney amino acid proliferating cell nuclear antigen N terminus Vertebrate genomes are modified by methylation of ∼60–80% of the cytosines residing at the CG dinucleotide sequence (1Razin A. Szyf M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 782: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The distribution of methylated cytosines is not random, resulting in gene- and tissue-specific patterns of methylation (2Yisraeli J. Szyf M. Razin A. Cedar H. Riggs A.D. Methylation: Biochemistry and Biological Significance. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1984: 353-378Google Scholar). A large body of evidence supports the hypothesis that both methylation patterns and activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)1 play critical roles in development and in controlling genome functions such as differential gene expression, chromosome imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation (3Siegfried Z. Cedar H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R305-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P.

It has also been suggested that DNMT1 is a downstream effector of many oncogenic pathways and a potential target for anticancer therapy (6Szyf M. Pharmacol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10105-10112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of DNMT1 leads to an inhibition of DNA replication (12Knox J.D. Araujo F.D. Bigey P. Slack A.D. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17986-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that DNMT1 is able to form a complex with Rb, E2F, and HDAC1 and repress E2F-responsive expression (13Robertson K.D. Ait-Si-Ali S. Yokochi T. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 14Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that DNMT1 can establish a transcriptional repressive complex with HDAC2 and DMAP1 at replication foci (15Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). These data suggest that DNMT1 has multiple functions in the cell. However, because the DNMT1 target recognition domain is unknown it is not possible to determine how these multiple functions and protein-protein interactions relate to its target specificity. If DNA methylation patterns contain significant information, there must be a mechanism that ensures its proper inheritance in cell lineages. Razin and Riggs (16Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar) have proposed that patterns of methylation are inherited, because DNMT1 is more proficient in methylating hemimethylated DNA than nonmethylated DNA. This hypothesis has been verified by a number of experiments (17Gruenbaum Y. Cedar H. Razin A. Nature. 1982; 295: 620-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 18Stein R. Gruenbaum Y. Pollack Y. Razin A. Cedar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Another level of specificity is the ability of DNMT1 to recognize CG sequences almost exclusively (19Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7308-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Yoder J.A. Soman N.S. Verdine G.L. Bestor T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Thus, DNMT1 exhibits both substrate and sequence specificity. The mammalian DNMT1 is a protein postulated to be composed, based on its similarity to other cytosine DNA methyltransferases, of at least three structural components (21Bestor T. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 22Bestor T.H. Gene. 1988; 74: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 24Kumar S. Cheng X. Klimasauskas S. Mi S. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 25Ramchandani S. Bigey P. Szyf M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Margot J.B.

These domains are as follows: a catalytic domain at the C terminus, an N-terminal domain that is responsible for localization of the protein to the nucleus and replication foci, and another poorly characterized central domain. It is unclear as yet which segment is responsible for determining its specificity for hemimethylated CG sequences. Previous reports have shown that when the N-terminal domain is cleaved by proteolysis, the enzyme loses its ability to discriminate between hemimethylated and unmethylated DNA (23Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the N-terminal domain performs a regulatory role by inhibiting the de novomethylation activity of the C-terminal domain (23Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that a mouse prokaryotic methyltransferase hybrid, DNMT1-HhaI, containing the intact N terminus of DNMT1 and most of the coding sequence of HhaI, has a 2.5-fold preference for hemimethylated DNA, whereas HhaI by itself has preference for unmethylated DNA (27Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2103-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that the N terminus is responsible for binding specificity to hemimethylated DNA. DNA binding activity has been shown to reside within the N-terminal domain, but this binding activity does not show sequence specificity, and it has been suggested that it determines the distance traversed between replication and methylation (28Chuang L.S. Ng H.H. Chia J.N. Li B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To dissect the role that DNMT1 plays in different biological functions using structure-function analysis, one has to determine which domain of the DNMT1 is responsible for target recognition. Identifying the target recognition domain of the enzyme is also critical for developing direct inhibitors of this enzyme as potential anticancer agents. To map the target recognition domain, we utilized a solid-state hemimethylated DNMT1 substrate to test the binding affinities of in vitro-translated DNMT1 deletion mutant peptides. This method enabled us to determine which segment of DNMT1 per se is responsible for target recognition. It has been previously demonstrated that these modified hairpin oligonucleotide substrates are able to form a stable complex with DNMT1 and inhibit its activity (29Bigey P. Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Theberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of DNMT1 with these modified hairpin oligonucleotides results in both inhibition of DNA replication (12Knox J.D. Araujo F.D. Bigey P. Slack A.D. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17986-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and transcriptional up-regulation of the tumor supressor p21 (30Milutinovic S. Knox J.D. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6353-6359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which inhibition of DNA replication occurs remains unclear. In this manuscript, we show that the target recognition domain of DNMT1 does not reside in the previously defined catalytic domain but rather in the N-terminal region of DNMT1, between amino acids 122 and 417. This result demonstrates the fundamental disparity between mammalian and bacterial DNA methyltransferases and the inadequacy of amino acid sequence-sequence similarities per se in predicting the functional role of protein domains. The identification of the target recognition domain in the N terminus points toward new directions in our understanding of the structure-function relationship of mammalian DNA methyltransferases. DNMT1 cDNA deletion mutants were generated by RT-PCR (31Kawasaki E.W. Wang A.M. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton, New York1989: 89-97Crossref Google Scholar) from 1 μg of total RNA prepared from the human small cell lung carcinoma cell line H446 (ATCC number HTB-171) using the following set of primers: 5′ccccatcggtttccgcgcgaaaa 3′ (sense) and 5′gcatctgccattcccactct 3′ (antisense) for codons 1 to 125; 5′gcaaacagaaataaagaatc 3′ (sense) and 5′gtgatggtggtttgcctggt 3′ (antisense) for codons 122 to 170; 5′ggcaagggaaaagggaaggg 3′ (sense) and 5′gtccttagcagcttcctcct 3′ (antisense) for codons 1113 to 1616; 5′ttatccgaggagggctacct 3′ (sense) and 5′cccttccctttgtttccagggc 3′ (antisense) for codons 122 to 1112; 5′ttatccgaggagggctacct 3′ (sense) and 5′cgccggcgcttaaaggcgtt 3′ (antisense) for codons 122 to 652. Amplification conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 0.5 min, 60 °C for 0.5 min, and 68 °C for 5 min for 30 cycles using Promega Taq polymerase. The PCR products were cloned in a pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen), and the sequence of the cDNAs was verified by the dideoxy-chain termination method (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar) using a T7 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and alignment to the published human Dnmt1 sequence (33Yen R.W. Vertino P.M. Nelkin B.D., Yu, J.J. el-Deiry W. Cumaraswamy A. Lennon G.G. Trask B.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31092-31097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To generate construct M, we cleaved the pCR3.1 bearing codons 1113–1616 withEcoRI, and the fragment was blunted and ligated to a pCR3.1 vector bearing codons 122 to 1212, which was cleaved at the 3′EcoRV site. Construct FTR bears the RT-PCR product encoding codons 122–652 inserted in the EcoRI site of pCR3.1. Constructs 5′-FTR and 3′-FTR were generated by digestion of construct FTR with BstEII and NotI. The resulting fragments were blunted and ligated separately into pCR3.1. Construct N-FTR bears an RT-PCR product encoding codons 122 to 1112 inserted in theEcoRI site of pCR3.1. To generate construct N-CAT, the blunted fragment bearing codons 1113–1616 was inserted into theEcoRV site of a pCR3.1 bearing codons 122–652. To generate construct CAT, we inserted the 1113–1616 coding fragment into theEcoRV site of a pCR3.1 bearing codons 122 to 168. To generate construct DNMT1, we cleaved construct M with XbaI and ligated it into a pCR3.1 vector bearing codons 1–122, which was cleaved at an internal XbaI site. To generate construct PS (the cysteine at the catalytic dipeptide proline-cysteine is replaced with a serine), the catalytic domain fragment encoding codons 1113 to 1616 was subcloned in the EcoRI site of the pAlter (Promega) site-directed mutagenesis vector. Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using a primer containing a single mismatch in the codon encoding the cysteine in the catalytic dipeptide, 5′AAGCCCTGGGAGGGCGGCC 3′ (the underlined G is mismatched). The mutation was verified by sequencing, and the mutated catalytic domain was cleaved with EcoRI, blunted, and inserted into the EcoRV site of a pCR3.1 vector bearing codons 122–1112. Construct DNMT1 corresponds to the DNA-cytosine-5-methyltransferase initiated at the upstream ATG site, and construct M corresponds to the one initiated at the downstream ATG site. The insertion of the catalytic domain into the EcoRV site of pCR3.1 leaves a linker between the GK repeat and the ATG sequence (SRILQIIRLG). To ascertain that this linker does not impair the activity of the catalytic domain, it was inserted in the same position in the full-length DNMT1 constructs M and DNMT1 with no observed effect on DNMT1 binding or enzymatic activities (data not shown). The peptides encoded by the constructs described above were transcribed and translated by coupled transcription-translation using the Promega TNT reticulocyte lysate kit (according to manufacturer's protocol) using 2 μg of each construct and 40 μCi of [35-S]methionine (l,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per 50 μl of reaction volume. All phosphorothioate hairpin oligonucleotides used for the binding study (see Fig. 2 for sequences) were synthesized at Hybridon Inc. using standard phosphoramadite chemistry as previously described (10Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von Hofe E. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Strepavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin) were purchased from Dynal. The 5′ biotinylated phosphorothioate hemimethylated hairpin oligonucleotides (B1 and B2; see Fig. 2) (3 μm) were incubated with 5 mg of beads in a buffer containing l0 mm Tris-HCl, EDTA (pH 7.4), and 1m NaCl for 10 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed and resuspended in 500 μ1 of the same buffer. The final concentration of the oligonucleotide bound to the beads was 150 pmol per mg. To assay binding to the hairpin-bound beads, 3 μl of in vitro-translated polypeptides were preincubated in a 30-μl reaction mixture including nonspecific or specific competitor oligonucleotides (l00 μm), l0 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and sodium vanadate, 1 mg/ml), and 40 mm NaCl. For the experiments in which CAT and FTR peptides were concurrently present (see Fig. 5), 3 μl of each of thein vitro-translated peptides was utilized where the plus sign (+) is indicated, and 6 μl and 9 μl were used where indicated by a triangle. After 30 min of pre incubation with competitor oligonucleotide, the mixture was applied to 500 μg of hairpin-bound beads (mix 1/1 of oligonucleotides B1- and B2-coated beads) for 5 min. The beads and supernatant were separated by a magnet, and the beads were washed twice with 50 μ1 of l0 mmTris-HCl, EDTA (pH 7.4) buffer followed by one wash in a 1m NaC1-containing buffer. The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of l0 mm Tris-HCl, EDTA (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS solution and boiled for 5 min. The supernatant (fraction S, corresponding to unbound proteins) and boiled fraction (fraction B, corresponding to bound proteins) were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and exposed to autoradiography. The autoradiograms were scanned, the amount of proteins in each fraction was quantified, and the percentage of protein stably bound to the beads was calculated as boiled/(boiled + supernatant) × 100.Figure 5Differential interaction of the catalytic and N terminus regions of the DNMT1 with the hemimethylated substrate when present concurrently. A, FTR and CAT peptides werein vitro-transcribed and -translated, and different ratios of both peptides were incubated at room temperature with avidin-coated magnetic beads bound to biotinylated hemimethylated hairpins (Bl and B2) in the absence of any competitors, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The hairpin-bound (B) and unbound (S) fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE and exposed to autoradiography. B, a similar experiment was performed but with the addition of nonspecific competitor (Sc) where indicated. The bound and unbound fractions were separated as above. Thearrows indicate the expected positions of FTR and CAT peptides. The plus sign (+) indicates presence of the indicated peptide, the minus sign (−) indicates absence of the indicated peptide, and the triangle indicates increasing concentrations of the indicated peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HEK 293 cells, a human adenovirus type 5 transformed human embryonal kidney cell line (35Graham F.L.

Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar) (ATCC number CRL 1573), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. For transient transfection experiments, HEK 293 cells were plated 18 h prior to transfection at a density of 7 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish. The cells were transfected with 5 μg of Xpress-FTR plasmid using the calcium phosphate protocol (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection, and the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Nuclear extracts were isolated as described previously (37Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitation assay, 400 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 10 μl of the agarose-conjugated PCNA antibody (PC10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. For the competition experiments the reactions were preincubated with 100 nm final concentration of competitor oligonucleotides (Sc and H1) for 1 h before addition of the PCNA antibody. After the overnight incubation, the beads were spun and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The immune complexes were resolved by a 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transferring to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocking the nonspecific binding with 5% milk, Xpress-FTR protein was detected using mouse anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) at a 1:5000 dilution, followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a 1:20000 dilution, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear extracts were isolated as previously described (37Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and binding was performed utilizing 500 μg of hairpin-bound beads (mix 1/1 of oligonucleotides B1- and B2-coated beads) for 5 min. The beads and supernatant were separated by a magnet, and the beads were washed twice with 50 μ1 of l0 mm Tris-HCl, EDTA (pH 7.4) buffer followed by one wash in a 1 m NaC1-containing buffer. The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of l0 mm Tris-HCl, EDTA (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS solution and boiled for 5 min. The supernatant (fraction S, corresponding to unbound proteins) and boiled fraction (fraction B, corresponding to bound proteins) were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel, and Western blot analysis was performed as above. To map the DNMT1 target recognition domain, DNMT1 deletion mutant peptides were created using a coupledin vitro transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte system (Fig. 1, A andB). The constructs were designed as follows: DNMT1 bears the entire coding sequence of the enzyme starting at the upstream ATG initiation site (34Yoder J.A. Yen R.W.C. Vertino P.M. Bestor T.H. Baylin S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31092-31097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), construct M bears the coding sequence of the DNMT1 starting at the downstream ATG initiation site (33Yen R.W. Vertino P.M. Nelkin B.D., Yu, J.J. el-Deiry W. Cumaraswamy A. Lennon G.G. Trask B.J. Celano P. Baylin S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2287-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), construct PS bears a single base mutation converting the previously proposed catalytic site proline-cysteine dipeptide to proline-serine (24Kumar S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), construct N-FTR bears the N-terminal fork-targeting region and the central domain region contained within amino acids 122–1112, construct N-CAT bears the N-terminal and catalytic domains with a deletion of the central domain from amino acid 652 to 1113, construct CAT encodes the entire catalytic domain as proposed by homology to bacterial cytosine methyltransferases plus the N-terminal portion responsible for nuclear localization (21Bestor T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), construct FTR bears the N-terminal region between amino acids 122 and 652, construct 5′-FTR is a deletion of FTR containing the region between amino acids 122 and 417, and construct 3′-FTR contains the region between amino acids 417 and 731 (Fig.1 A). We utilized a luciferase construct as a control (Fig.1 A). Following coupled in vitrotranscription/translation in the presence of [35-S]methionine, the peptides were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 1 B). All the peptides migrated according to their expected sizes. Hemimethylated and nonmethylated CG-containing phosphorothioate hairpin oligonucleotides were designed as probes and competitors for our binding assays (Fig.2). Because oligonucleotides B1 and B2 are biotinylated at the 5′ arm of the hairpin, they can be conjugated to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and used as solid-state probes for peptide binding experiments. The remaining oligonucleotides (Sc, H1, and N1) were utilized as competitors. The 5′ arm of the hairpins containing methylated cytosines behaves as the methylation-guiding parental strand and the 3′ arm behaves as the methyl-acceptor nascent strand of replicating DNA. The hairpin substrates we utilized contained an inosine (I) instead of the methyl acceptor, cytosine. These substrates have been previously shown to form a high affinity complex with DNMTl that could be dissociated only by boiling (29Bigey P. Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Theberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Results from these experiments have also indicated that the inosine (I) group substitution, as well as synthesis of the backbone with a phosphorothioate modification, results in increased hairpin binding affinity to DNMT1 (29Bigey P. Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Theberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, the CG sites present in the hairpins are separated by 4 bases to avoid tandem CGs, which have been demonstrated to be poor substrates for DNA methyltransferases (29Bigey P. Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Theberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that DNMT1 forms a low affinity complex with both hemimethylated and nonmethylated DNA (19Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7308-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the initial binding of DNMT1 with DNA does not discriminate between hemimethylated and nonmethylated DNA (19Flynn J. Glickman J.F. Reich N.O.

In our binding assays (see Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5), the ability of a polypeptide to form a stable complex with the magnetic bead-conjugated substrate is measured by comparing the abundance of [35-S]-labeled polypeptide in the supernatant fraction (indicated as S in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) versus the abundance in the fraction eluted by boiling the hairpin-bound beads (indicated as B in Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). As observed (Fig. 3 A), in the absence of any competitor, peptide M is present exclusively in the bound fraction (B), whereas a luciferase peptide, used as a negative control, is unable to form a complex with the hemimethylated solid-state substrate and is therefore present exclusively in the supernatant fraction (S).Figure 4Binding specificity of various DNMT1 deletion mutant peptides to the hemimethylated substrate.

Following 30 min of preincubation at room temperature, avidin-coated magnetic beads bound to biotinylated hemimethylated hairpins (Bl and B2) were added to the mix as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The hairpin-bound (B) and unbound (S) fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE and exposed to autoradiography.

https://openalex.org/W2322060655,"Replicative senescence may be an important tumor suppressive mechanism for human cells. We investigated the mechanism of cell cycle arrest at senescence in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) that have undergone a period of ‘self-selection’, and as a consequence exhibit diminished p16INK4A levels. As HMECs approached senescence, the proportion of cells with a 2N DNA content increased and that in S phase decreased progressively. Cyclin D1-cdk4, cyclin E-cdk2 and cyclin A-cdk2 activities were not abruptly inhibited, but rather diminished steadily with increasing population age. In contrast to observations in fibroblast, p21Cip1 was not increased at senescence in HMECs. There was no increase in p27Kip1 levels nor in KIP association with targets cdks. While p15INK4B and its binding to both cdk4 and cdk6 increased with increasing passage, some cyclin D1-bound cdk4 and cdk6 persisted in senescent cells, whose inhibition could not be attributed to p15INK4B. The inhibition of cyclin E-cdk2 in senescent HMECs was accompanied by increased inhibitory phosphorylation of cdk2, in association with a progressive loss of Cdc25A. Recombinant Cdc25A strongly reactivated cyclin E-cdk2 from senescent HMECs suggesting that reduction of Cdc25A contributes to cyclin E-cdk2 inhibition and G1 arrest at senescence. Although ectopic expression of Cdc25A failed to extend the lifespan of HMECs, the exogenous Cdc25A appeared to lack activity in these cells, since it neither shortened the G1-to-S phase interval nor activated cyclin E-cdk2. In contrast, in the breast cancer-derived MCF-7 line, Cdc25A overexpression increased both cyclin E-cdk2 activity and the S phase fraction. Thus, mechanisms leading to HMEC immortalization may involve not only the re-induction of Cdc25A expression, but also activation of this phosphatase."

In Caenorhabditis elegans, a complex of three PDZ proteins, LIN-2/7/10, mediates basolateral targeting of a receptor tyrosine kinase. Homologs of these LIN proteins have also been identified in higher organisms, and here we analyze the MALS/Veli (mammalianLIN-7/vertebrate homolog of LIN-7) proteins in brain.

At synapses neurotransmitter receptors must align at the postsynaptic density (PSD)1 opposed to the presynaptic active zone. Although mechanisms for protein trafficking to synapses and other specializations in neurons remain poorly understood, recent work identifies a general role for proteins containing PDZ (postsynaptic density-95, discs large,zonula occludens) domains in synaptic targeting (1Hsueh Y.P.

Cell. 1998; 93: 495-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). PDZ motifs are modular 80-amino acid domains that mediate protein-protein interactions in a variety of cellular contexts. PDZ domains contain a conserved peptide-binding grove that associates with the extreme C terminus of interacting protein ligands or with appropriate internal binding motifs (4Doyle D.A. Lee A.

Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In addition to binding to certain receptors, PDZ-containing complexes also recruit cytosolic signaling enzymes to appropriate plasma membrane domains (1Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. Prog.

Genetic studies of invertebrates have shown that PDZ proteins often play essential roles in regulating cellular signaling pathways. Mutations of Drosophila discs large, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase related to PSD-95, cause overgrowth of imaginal discs and abnormalities of larval neuromuscular junction (6Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 7Budnik V. Koh Y.H. Guan B. Hartmann B. Hough C. Woods D. Gorczyca M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 627-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). InCaenorhabditis elegans, mutations of a set of three PDZ proteins, LIN-2, LIN-7, and LIN-10, disrupt differentiation of vulval precursor cells and yield a vulvaless phenotype (8Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A series of elegant biochemical and cell biological studies showed that LIN-2/7/10 form a stable complex in which LIN-2 directly binds to both LIN-7 and LIN-10 (8Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These interactions do not involve the PDZ domains, which remain free to interact with other cellular proteins (9Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Specifically, the PDZ domain from LIN-7 binds the extreme C terminus of LET-23 and mediates basolateral localization of this receptor. The LIN-2/7/10 complex also occurs prominently in neurons. Disruption of lin-10 in C. elegans prevents proper postsynaptic sorting of the GLR-1 glutamate receptor (10Rongo C. Whitfield C.W. Rodal A. Kim S.K. Kaplan J.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 751-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In mammals, close homologs of LIN-2 (CASK), LIN-7 (MALS/Veli), and LIN-10 (Mint/X11) have all been identified, and the LIN-2/7/10 complex occurs at highest levels in brain (9Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 11Borg J.-P. Lõpez-Figueroa M.O. de Taddèo-Borg M. Kroon D.E. Turner R.S. Watson S.J.

However, specific roles for the LIN-2/7/10 complex in brain remain uncertain. Some studies have suggested that this complex regulates presynaptic functions (9Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), whereas others have implicated postsynaptic roles (12Jo K. Derin R. Li M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies show CASK is ubiquitous in brain and occurs at both pre- and postsynaptic sites (13Cohen A.R. Woods D.F.

Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Mint has also been found in numerous neuronal populations in brain. The cellular localizations for MALS in brain remain unknown. Here, we have developed antisera to the family of MALS/Veli (mammalian LIN-7/vertebrate homolog of LIN-7) homologs. Immunohistochemical staining of brain shows a heterogeneous distribution for these proteins, such that each MALS shows discrete localization in specific neuronal populations and both dendritic and axonal sites are labeled. In general, cells are endowed with only one MALS protein; however, certain neurons express multiple MALS isoforms. Targeted disruption of MALS-1 and MALS-2 does not yield a detectable phenotype, and synaptic function in hippocampus is apparently intact in the double knockouts. Disruption of MALS-1/2 proteins results in selective up-regulation of MALS-3. This differential localization and dynamic induction of MALS suggest that protein expression is an important point for regulation of this family of synaptic PDZ proteins. To isolate mouse MALS-1 cDNA, the N-terminal 250 bp was PCR-amplified from first-strand mouse brain cDNA using primers based on the human MALS-1 sequence (12Jo K. Derin R. Li M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mouse cDNA probe was used to isolate a bacterial artificial chromosome clone from a 129Sv/J mouse genomic library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). The position of a 119-bp protein coding exon (second exon; +83–201 bp from the initiation ATG codon) was determined by DNA sequencing. The targeting vector was constructed using the pPNT replacement vector. A 1-kb intronic region downstream from the targeted exon was PCR-amplified, digested with XhoI and NotI, and subcloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of pPNT. Similarly, a 6-kb genomic region upstream to the exon was PCR-amplified, digested withKpnI and NheI, and inserted into theKpnI/XbaI sites of the pPNT vector. PCR primers used were TTACTCGAGGATCCGGACGCCGAGAATGTAACAACTG and TAAGCGGCCGCCCAGCCTTTGATTAACTTACAGGTTG for the 1-kb region and GAGTTAGGTACCCAACTCTTCCTTATCAGCTCTTTTCC and CACTTAGCTAGCGAACACAACCTCCCTAATTAATCTC for the 6-kb region. In the targeting vector (MALS-1 LH6SH1), the second exon and 2.2 kb of flanking sequence were replaced with a neo-cassette. The HSV-tk gene was included to allow for negative selection of nonrecombinants. The targeting vector was linearized with NotI and ligated to aNotI-compatible cap oligonucleotide to seal the ends of the linear fragment (15Nehls M. Kyewski B. Messerle M. Waldschütz R. Schüddekopf K. Smith A.J. Boehm T. Science. 1996; 272: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This capped targeting construct was electroporated into JM-1 ES cells, and clones resistant to G418 and gancyclovir were analyzed by PCR using primers located in the neo-cassette and outside of the 1-kb intronic region: GCTAAAGCGCATGCTCCAGACTG and GGTGACTTGCCATAAAACTAGC. PCR-positive clones were further analyzed by Southern blotting both with probes containing genomic sequences outside of the targeting vector and with a neo probe. Three properly targeted clones were obtained from 282 analyzed. Targeted cells were injected into blastocysts from C57BL/6J mice and transferred into pseudopregnant CD1 female mice. Male chimeras were mated with Black Swiss (Taconic, Germantown, NY) or C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) females for transmission of the mutated allele through the germ line. Heterozygous mice were intercrossed to generate MALS-1 null mice. The genotypes from these and subsequent matings were determined by Southern blotting or PCR using allele specific primers as follows: GTCTGGAATACTTAGTGCACTTAG and CTGTACAAAACTCACTCTGAAGC for normal allele; CTATGACTGGGCACAACAGAC and CGTCAAGAAGGCGATAGAAGG for targeted allele. The null phenotype was confirmed by Western blotting of brain homogenates with antibodies to MALS-1. Isolation and characterization of the MALS-2 bacterial artificial chromosome clone and construction of the MALS-2 targeting vector followed the protocol for MALS-1. The six exons encoding MALS-2 occur within a 2.3-kb genomic region. This 2.3-kb region was replaced by the neomycin cassette of pPNT vector. A 1-kb genomic region upstream (EcoRI/BamHI) and a 6-kb genomic region downstream (XhoI/NotI) were subcloned into theEcoRI/BamHI and XhoI/NotI sites of pPNT, respectively. PCR primers used are GAGTTAGAATTCAAACAGGCAGCACTCCATGTTATTGG and GAGTTAGGATCCGGTACCGTGGTGCATGAGGCCCTGCCCACAC for the 1-kb region and GAGTTACTCTCTACACCCTCACAGGTCC and GAGTTAGCGGCCGCAGCGCCAAGCCAGAACCACACC for the 6-kb region. TheNotI-linearized and cap-ligated targeting vector (MALS-2 SH1LH6) was electroporated into JM-1 ES cells. Two homologously recombined clones were obtained from 157 analyzed by PCR screening. PCR primers used are CAAGCAGTCCACACAGTCACC and GTTCCACATACACTTCATTCTCAG. Male chimeras were mated with C57BL/6J females. Heterozygous mice were intercrossed to generate MALS-2 null mice. PCR primers used for genotyping are: ATGGCTGCACTGGTGGAGCCG and ACCTCGCGGATGGCGGAGCAG for normal allele and GCTAAAGCGCATGCTCCAGACTG and CGGGCTAGTCTCTGGGACAC for targeted allele. Female MALS-1−/− mice (F3 generation on Black Swiss background) and male MALS-2 chimeric mice were mated, and MALS-1/2 double heterozygous mice were selected by Southern blotting. Intercrossing the double heterozygous mice made MALS-1/2 double null mice. For genotyping the MALS-1 targeted locus, new PCR primers were used: GCTAAAGCGCATGCTCCAGACTG and AAGATGTGGTTCCAAGCTTAAC. The other PCR primers used for genotyping are the same as those used for MALS-1 or -2 single null mice. Polyclonal antisera to all of the MALS proteins were raised by injecting rabbits with peptides coupled to keyhole, limpet, hemoryanin. The sequences of the peptides used are as follows: MALS-1, CQQTQQNHMS; MALS-2, CQHHSYTSLERSG; MALS-3, CSRFEKMRSAKRRQQT. The pan-MALS antibody, which recognizes all three MALS isoforms, was generated against a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and MALS-2 as described (12Jo K. Derin R. Li M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, tissue homogenates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (70 μg/lane) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Primary antibodies were diluted (0.5 μg/ml) in blocking solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS and incubated with membranes overnight at 4 °C. Immunolabeled bands were visualized using enhanced chemilluminescence. Adult mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer. The brain was removed and immersed in the same fixative for 2 h at 4 °C and then cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Free-floating sections (40 μm) were cut on a sliding microtome. Sections were blocked for 3 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% normal goat serum and then incubated in the same buffer containing diluted antiserum (0.1–0.3 μg/ml) for 2 days at 4 °C. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with an avidin/biotin/peroxidase system (ABC Elite; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma). In situ hybridization used35S-labeled RNA probes as described (16Sassoon D. Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 384-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because of high homology in the coding regions of MALS-1/2/3, isoform specific cRNA probes were made from 3′ noncoding regions. Amplification of a 3′ fragment of MALS-1 from mouse cDNA used PCR primers based on human MALS-1 (12Jo K. Derin R. Li M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): CACATGTCATAGGCGCTCGAAG + CTTCTTACACTGTTTCAGTTTG. This fragment was subcloned in pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI andXhoI, and the insert (314 bp) subcloned into pBluscript. Specific 3′ regions of MALS-2 and MALS-3 cDNA were amplified with PCR primers containing BamHI or XhoI, and subcloned into pBluescript vector. The MALS-2 primers used were: ATCATCGGATCCACCACAGCTACACGTCCT and ATCATCCTCGAGAGGGTTAAAGATCTTTAAATAAGG. The MALS-3 primers used were ATCATCGGATCCGACCTAATCATTTAAAAACTTTGTG and ATCATCCTCGAGCAGAACTGTCCTCACCAACTC. Adult mice were anesthetized with halothane and decapitated before removing the brain and dissecting out the hippocampus. Transverse slices (300 μm) were cut using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S) at 4 °C in a high sucrose solution containing 87 mm NaCl, 25 mmNaHCO3, 75 mm sucrose, 25 mmglucose, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mmNaHPO4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 7 mm MgCl2 (equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2). Slices were then incubated at 35 °C for 30 min, cooled to room temperature for 30 min, and then transferred to artificial cerebral spinal fluid containing 119 mm NaCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.3 mmMgSO4, 1 mm NaHPO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2 (equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2) and held for 30 min before commencing experiments. Before transfer to the recording chamber mounted on an upright Olympus BX50 WI microscope, a cut was made between CA3 and CA1 in each slice. For field experiments a bipolar tungsten stimulating electrode was placed on the surface of CA1 stratum radiatum toward the CA3 end, and a monopolar glass recording electrode containing NaCl (1 m) was inserted into CA1 stratum radiatum at a distance of ∼500 μm from the stimulating electrode. Stimulus duration was 0.1 ms, and stimuli were delivered at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. Fiber volley amplitude was measured at the peak, and EPSPs were measured by making a best fit line through the initial section (20–60% of the peak amplitude) of the rising phase. For fiber volley/EPSP comparison, data were separated into four 0.1 mV fiber volley size bins. For whole cell experiments the stimulating electrode was placed in the same fashion, and recordings were made from visually identified CA1 pyramidal cells using patch electrodes with tip resistances of 2–6 MΩ filled with a solution containing 117.5 mm cesium gluconate, 5 mmCsCl, 10 mm tetraethyl ammonium-Cl, 5 mmQX314-Cl, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm acetoxymethyl ester of 5,5′-dimethyl-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ehtane-N,N,N′,N′,-tetraacetic acid, 4 mm MgATP, 0.3 mm NaGTP adjusted to 280 mOsm, pH 7.4. Stimulation was performed as above, and access and input resistances were monitored continuously by applying a test voltage step of −4 mV immediately before each stimulation. Magnitudes of AMPA EPSCs were measured from average traces of 30 EPSCs in each cell. The average of 30 EPSCs in the presence of D-amino-5-phosphoenovalerate (100 μm) was subtracted from the AMPA EPSC to give the NMDA EPSC in each cell. Data were filtered at 5 KHz and stored directly to disc using the Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics) and analyzed on line. Responses were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. All measurements are given as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was tested using Student'st test. To map the localization of MALS proteins throughout the brain, we developed a specific antiserum to each protein. Because MALS-1,2,3 share >80% sequence identity, antigens for peptide antibodies were carefully designed to avoid cross-reaction. We first characterized the antisera by Western blotting. Homogenates from mouse brain or COS cells transfected with each of the MALS cDNAs were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and following transfer, blots were probed with affinity-purified antibodies to each of the MALS proteins. Previous studies have shown that MALS-1 migrates at 29 kDa and that MALS-2,3 migrate at 26 kDa (9Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 12Jo K. Derin R. Li M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4189-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, each of the MALS antibodies recognizes a band of the expected mobility in brain homogenates. We assessed specificity of the antisera by Western blotting of COS cells transfected with each MALS cDNA. MALS-1,2 are not present in untransfected COS cells but are detected in lanes from COS cells transfected with MALS-1 and MALS-2, respectively. On the other hand, MALS-3 occurs at low levels in COS cells, although the band is more intense in MALS-3 transfected cells. Thus, the MALS antisera are all isoform-specific. Immunohistochemical staining and in situhybridization of sagittal brain sections shows a heterogeneous cellular distribution for each MALS protein and mRNA (Fig.2). MALS-1 protein occurs at highest levels in cerebellum and olfactory bulb and is also expressed in superior colliculus, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, substantia nigra, and hypothalamus (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, MALS-2 expression is weak in cerebellum and olfactory bulb but is enriched in cerebral cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and susbtantia nigra (Fig.2 A). MALS-3 shows the most restricted expression in brain and occurs at highest levels in the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and superior colliculus and dentate gyrus of hippocampus (Fig.2 A). In situ hybridization for MALS-1,2,3 generally correlates to that seen by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2 B). That is, highest levels for MALS-1 mRNA are found in cerebellar granule cells, cerebral cortex, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. MALS-1 mRNA occurs at highest levels in neurons of the inferior olive, which also stain positive for MALS-1 protein (data not shown). MALS-2 hybridization is low in cerebellum but is readily detected in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, pontine nucleus, and inferior olive. MAL-3 mRNA is detected only very weakly throughout the brain but found above background levels in hippocampal dentate gyrus. In a few brain regions there are discrepancies between localization signals detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. For example, MALS-2 is enriched in the thalamus by immunohistochemistry but not by in situ hybridization. Also MALS-2 is positive in the pontine nucleus by in situ hybridization but faint by immunohistochemistry. These differences are likely attributable to subcellular sorting of MALS proteins to axons or dendrites. Higher power micrographs were used to reveal the cellular distribution of the MALS proteins in specific neuronal populations. Throughout the brain, MALS are found predominantly in neurons and occur differentially in neuronal cell bodies and neuropil. In substantia nigra pars compacta (Fig. 3 A) and ventral thalamus (Fig. 3 E), MALS-1 staining is prominent in neuronal cell bodies. By contrast, MALS-1 is distributed diffusely in the neuropil of cerebral cortex, superior colliculus, and corpus striatum (Fig. 3,B–D). MALS-2 expression is prominent in cell bodies of substantia nigra pars compacta but is also enriched in the neuropil of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (Fig. 3 F). In cerebral cortex, MALS-2 intensely labels interneurons (Fig. 3, G andH), which are devoid of MALS-1 or MALS-3. MALS-2 also strongly stains neurons of the pontine tegmental nucleus (Fig.3 I). MALS-3 staining occurs diffusely in neuropil of specific brain regions including the superior colliculus (Fig.3 J), the reticular thalamic nucleus, and the olfactory bulb (Fig. 2, K and L). In hippocampus and cerebellum, MALS proteins are expressed in differential complementary neuronal populations. As shown in Fig.8 A, MALS-1 occurs diffusely in the dendritic fields of hippocampal dentate granule cells. By contrast, MALS-2 is absent from the dentate gyrus of hippocampus. Instead, MALS-2 is abundant in the neuropil of the CA1 region (see Fig. 8 C). Also, as found in cerebral cortex, MALS-2 is strikingly concentrated in cell bodies and processes of interneurons. MALS-3 expression in hippocampus is weak but generally resembles that of MALS-1 in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (see Fig. 8 E). In cerebellum, MALS-1 is enriched in the cerebellar granule cell layer and is clearly concentrated in the glomeruli. MALS-1 also occurs diffusely in the molecular layer of cerebellum (see Fig.9 A). MALS-2 expression in cerebellum resembles that of MALS-1 but is much weaker. Peroxidase staining for MALS-2 shown in Fig.9 C was intentionally prolonged to bring out the very light labeling. MALS-3 in cerebellum is restricted to the molecular layer (see Fig. 9 E). Because MALS-1,2 are brain-specific and occur in a variety of neuronal populations, we targeted disruption of these genes to help define roles for MALS proteins in neuronal function. For MALS-1 we targeted the second exon, which encodes 39 amino acids (83–201 bp) and is flanked on either side by introns of >10 kb. The MALS-2 gene comprises 6 exons that span 2.3 kb of genomic DNA, so we deleted the entire coding region. Proper targeting of both genes was successful as determined by Southern blotting and PCR analysis (Figs. 4 and5). For both genes, heterozygous mice were interbred, and both MALS-1 and MALS-2 knockout mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequencies.

Homogenates from whole brain of wild type, MALS-1+/−, and MALS-1−/− were probed with a pan-MALS antibody that reacts with all three isoforms. As shown in Fig.4 D, MALS-1 staining is selectively lost in the MALS-1 knockout. Similarly, immunoblotting extracts from wild type, MALS-2+/−, and MALS-2−/− with isoform specific antibodies shows the expected loss of MALS-2 in the knockouts (Fig. 5 D). To generate double knockouts (DKO), the MALS-1 and MALS-2 mutants were interbred (Fig. 6). F1 progeny, which are heterozygous for each gene, were intercrossed, and 99 pups were analyzed. These F2 pups were born in the predicted Mendelian ratios and included six DKOs (Fig. 6 D). As expected, Western blotting of total brain homogenates showed that MALS-1 and MALS-2 are absent from the DKOs. MALS-1/2 DKOs are viable, fertile, and cannot be distinguished from their littermates. We carried out a series of electrophysiological experiments to examine for possible alterations in excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in the MALS-1/2 double knockout mouse. The first set of experiments examined the input-output function of the excitatory synapses using extracellular field potential recording. This was done by varying the stimulus strength and recording the size of the presynaptic fiber volley (input) and comparing it to the size (measured as an initial slope) of the postsynaptic response (fEPSP) (output). A difference in this relationship would indicate a change in the synaptic strength, either because of a change in transmitter release or a change in the responsiveness of the postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs). As shown in Fig.7 A, the relationship between the fiber volley (input) and the fEPSP slope (output) does not differ between wild type and DKO. We next addressed whether the DKO might have altered contributions of AMPARs and NMDARs to excitatory synaptic transmission. To examine simultaneously the AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated components of the EPSC, we performed whole cell recordings and held the cell at +40 mV. The reason for recording at positive membrane potentials is that the Mg block of the NMDAR is removed and the I-V relationship of both the AMPAR and NMDAR components of the EPSC are essentially linear. Responses to activation of both the AMPAR and NMDAR component were recorded first, and then the NMDAR selective antagonist APV was added to completely block the NMDAR component. The AMPAR component was thereby measured directly, and the NMDAR component was obtained by subtracting the AMPAR component from the initial dual component. Fig. 7 B shows sample records from a wild type cell (left column), a DKO cell (right column), and a summary graph of results from a number of cells. As shown in the graph, no obvious difference between wild type and DKO is detected. A final set of experiments compared the magnitude of NMDAR-dependent long term potentiation in wild type versus DKO. After obtaining a 10-min base line, a 100 Hz tetanus (1 s repeated three times at an interval of 20 s) was delivered. A large potentiation immediately followed the tetanus that decayed to a stable potentiation of about 50%. No significant difference in the magnitude of the long term potentiation was found between the wild type and DKO. The a"

To study whether p73 was associated with breast carcinogenesis, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), allele expression and transcript levels were assessed in 59 BC, including 39 BC presenting no inflammatory symptoms (NBC) and 20 inflammatory BC (IBC). IBC is a rare but aggressive form of cancer with a very poor prognosis. Normal breast epithelium (BE) and lymphocytes from patients were used as controls. StyI polymorphism generating GC and/or AT alleles was used to select 22 heterozygous patients. p73 LOH was significantly higher in IBC than in NBC [five of eight cases (62%) versus two of 14 cases (14%); Fisher's exact test, P=0.05]. p73 was biallelically expressed in all BE. In contrast, 12 of 16 (75%) BC were monoallelically expressed, showing that allele silencing was significantly associated with breast carcinogenesis (P=0.012), AT being the preferential silent allele (10 out of 12 tumours). p73 mRNA levels in NBC and IBC were two- and threefold lower than in BE, respectively, suggesting that decreased expression could be related to tumour aggressiveness. In conclusion, LOH, allele silencing and decreased expression of the p73 gene may play a role in breast carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2062647997,"The ubiquitous calpain isoforms (μ- and m-calpain) are Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases that require surprisingly high Ca2+concentrations for activation in vitro (∼50 and ∼300 μm, respectively). The molecular basis of such a high requirement for Ca2+ in vitro is not known. In this study, we substantially reduced the concentration of Ca2+ required for the activation of m-calpain in vitro through the specific disruption of interdomain interactions by structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis. Several interdomain electrostatic interactions involving lysine residues in domain II and acidic residues in the C2-like domain III were disrupted, and the effects of these mutations on activity and Ca2+sensitivity were analyzed. The mutation to serine of Glu-504, a residue that is conserved in both μ- and m-calpain and interacts most notably with Lys-234, reduced the in vitro Ca2+requirement for activity by almost 50%. The mutation of Lys-234 to serine or glutamic acid resulted in a similar reduction. These are the first reported cases in which point mutations have been able to reduce the Ca2+ requirement of calpain. The structures of the mutants in the absence of Ca2+ were shown by x-ray crystallography to be unchanged from the wild type, demonstrating that the increase in Ca2+ sensitivity was not attributable to conformational change prior to activation. The conservation of sequence between μ-calpain, m-calpain, and calpain 3 in this region suggests that the results can be extended to all of these isoforms. Whereas the primary Ca2+ binding is assumed to occur at EF-hands in domains IV and VI, these results show that domain II–domain III salt bridges are important in the process of the Ca2+-induced activation of calpain and that they influence the overall Ca2+ requirement of the enzyme.

The two ubiquitous calpains, μ- and m-calpain, are cytosolic thiol proteases entirely dependent on Ca2+ for their activity. These two calpains consist of a large or catalytic subunit (80 kDa) (from the genes capn1 and capn2, respectively) and a common small or regulatory subunit (28 kDa) (fromcapn4). The μ- and m-isoforms differ also in the concentration of Ca2+ required for half-maximal activationin vitro. Both enzymes require a Ca2+concentration (∼50 and ∼300 μm for μ- and m-calpain, respectively) that is significantly higher than that available in vivo (<1 μm). Autolysis causes a drop in Ca2+ requirement, but calpain activation in vivo must involve additional factors, such as membrane-binding and activator proteins. Although the physiological roles of these calpains remain unclear, there is much evidence suggesting that they contribute to many cellular processes, including signal transduction, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal reorganization (1Sorimachi H.

Their physiological importance is exemplified by the recent demonstration that transgenic mice lacking the classical calpain isoforms die during embryonic development (6Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Excessive proteolysis by these enzymes in response to altered Ca2+ homeostasis has been observed in several neuropathological states, including Alzheimer's disease (7Wang K.K. Yuen P.W. Adv.

With regard to other forms of calpain, defects in calpain-3 lead to the development of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2A (9Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V. Fougerousse F. Chiannilkulchai N. Bourg N.

Hodgkin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Sokol S.B. Kuwabara P.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 901-906PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of rat (13Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and human (14Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M.

The small subunit contains domain V, which is glycine- and proline-rich and was either not present (13Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) or not detectable (14Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G.

A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) in the x-ray structure, and domain VI, which contains several EF-hands and is structurally very similar to domain IV. Importantly, the structure revealed that the protease active site is not assembled in the absence of Ca2+, a feature not previously observed in any other cysteine protease. The protease domains (domains I and II) are held apart in the Ca2+-free conformation by interactions within the molecule, which prevent the catalytic triad residues (Cys-105 in domain I and His-262 and Asn-286 in domain II) from assuming the correct conformation to hydrolyze substrates. Activation by Ca2+ must somehow relieve these constraints, permitting domains I and II to move toward each other and form a competent active site. A Ca2+-bound structure of calpain might answer several questions concerning the Ca2+-induced activation mechanism, but this structure has not yet been determined because of significant technical difficulties. Based on the primary sequence alone, it was for a long time assumed that the EF-hand-containing domains IV and VI were the major determinants of the Ca2+ requirement of calpain. Recent studies have shown that Ca2+ binding at EF-hand 3 makes the largest contribution to calpain activation, EF-hand 2 may make some contribution, and the other EF-hands apparently have no direct role in Ca2+ regulation (15Dutt P. Arthur J.S. Grochulski P. Cygler M. Elce J.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 15: 37-43Crossref Google Scholar). Additionally, it has recently been demonstrated that TRA-3 has Ca2+-dependent protease activity although it lacks the EF-hand domain (12Sokol S.B. Kuwabara P.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 901-906PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that the observed Ca2+ requirement of the whole enzyme is not determined solely by the EF-hands and is greatly affected by interactions elsewhere in the molecule. The x-ray structures revealed two interesting features in domain III that may be very important in this regard (Fig. 1 A). First, domain III was found to be structurally similar to the Ca2+-dependent C2 domains, which are known to promote the phospholipid binding of C2-containing proteins (16Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 17Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the following two considerations: 1) calpains are thought to translocate to the cell membrane when activated by Ca2+ and 2) the Ca2+ requirement of calpain is greatly reduced in the presence of phospholipids, which appears to be a part of the in vivo activation mechanism of calpain. Second, at the interface between domains II and III, there is a set of electrostatic interactions involving a remarkably acidic loop composed of Glu-392–Asp-400 and Glu-504 in domain III and clustered lysine residues Lys-226, Lys-230, and Lys-234 in domain II (Fig.1 B). All these residues are highly conserved within the known m-calpain sequences. We hypothesize therefore that this salt bridge region exerts a conformational constraint on the movement of domain II and therefore on the assembly of the active site, which will tend to elevate the Ca2+ requirement of the enzyme. By disrupting these salt bridges, the mutations described here were designed to investigate the effects on the Ca2+ requirement of calpain. Our experiments would further address the question of whether these electrostatic interactions directly contribute to maintaining the inactive conformation of calpain. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on single-stranded DNA derived from pET-24-m-80k-CHis6, using the following antisense primers: 5′-P-cttctggatgatcgagaagagattgggaggagg-3′ (K226S), 5′-P-gagaacctttctcgagagccgactggatgatcttg-3′ (K230S), 5′-P-gagaacctttctcgagagcctcctggatgatcttg-3′ (K230E), 5′-P-aagcagagaacctgactcgagagccttctggatg-3′ (K234S), 5′-P-agcagagaaccttcctcgagagccttctggat-3′ (K234E), and 5′-P-agtcagccttcttgctcgagaagactcgg-3′ (E504S). In all cases, the nucleotide sequence around the mutated site was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression and purification of wild-type rat m-calpain and mutant enzymes were performed as previously described (18Elce J.S Hegadorn C. Gauthier S. Vince J.W. Davies P.L. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Coexpression of the constructs pET-24-m-80k-CHis6 (encoding the m-calpain 80-kDa subunit with a C-terminal histidine tag) and pACpET-21k (encoding the C-terminal 184 residues of the regulatory subunit, referred to as domain VI or the 21-kDa subunit) in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) gives rise to an active heterodimer. Enzymes were purified through several columns and finally concentrated by centrifugation using a BioMax 30-kDa molecular mass exclusion device to ∼10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 10 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 200 μm EDTA. Small aliquots of the enzyme samples (typically 50 μl) were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. For the measurement of the Ca2+ dependence of calpain activity, a modification of the standard casein assay was used. The duplicate assays contained 4 mg/ml casein, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, in a final volume of 100 μl. Net final CaCl2concentrations ranged from 0 μm to 5.0 mm. The reaction was initiated with 4 μl of enzyme sample (see below), and the mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min before the reaction was terminated by the addition of 70 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The resultant mixture was placed on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the absorbance values of the supernatants were recorded at 280 nm. Immediately prior to the Ca2+ titration, the enzyme aliquots were freshly thawed from −70 °C and diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, to a final enzyme concentration of 0.2 mg/ml (wild type, E504S, K226S, K230S, K234S) or 2 mg/ml (K230E, K234E). The Ca2+concentration required for half-maximal activity with casein as substrate is given as [Ca2+]0.5. This value was calculated by fitting the normalized activity data to the Hill equation y =x n/(k n + x n) where y is the fraction of maximum activity,k = [Ca2+]0.5, nis the Hill constant, and x is [Ca2+]. Crystals of the m-calpain mutant enzymes were grown in conditions very similar to those for wild-type m-calpain (19Hosfield C.M. Ye Q. Arthur J.S. Hegadorn C. Croall D.E. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1484-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). X-ray data from the K230E mutant were collected at 1.54 Å at an in-house facility that consists of an MAR Research imaging plate and a Rigaku RU-200 x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. Data for the E504S mutant were collected at beamline A-1 at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, using monochromatic radiation at 0.925 Å and a Quantum-4 CCD camera from Area Detector Systems Corporation (San Diego, CA). All crystals were frozen in liquid propane, and data sets were collected at 100 K. Raw x-ray data were processed using the HKL program suite (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38445) Google Scholar). Both mutants and wild-type m-calpain crystallized isomorphously in space group P21. Cell dimensions for the K230E mutant were a = 51.62 Å,b = 156.13 Å, c = 64.00 Å, β = 95.21° whereas the dimensions for the E504S mutants werea = 51.82 Å, b = 157.80 Å,c = 64.49 Å, β = 95.18°. Because the mutant crystals were virtually isomorphous to the wild-type protein, we were able to incorporate the coordinates of wild-type m-calpain (PDB code1DF0) directly for the initial refinement of the mutant enzymes. All refinement was carried out using the CNS package (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar) with 10% of the reflections excluded from the refinement for the calculation ofR free. The initial R factor for the K230E mutant was 0.366, which dropped to 0.260 (R free = 0.321) after refinement at 2.8 Å. The initial R factor for the E504S mutant was 0.372, which was reduced to 0.258 (R free = 0.302) after refinement at 2.4 Å. The final models and the calculated ‖2Fobs − F calc‖ electron density maps were analyzed using the XFIT program (22McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). Recombinantly expressed wild-type m-calpain and the mutant enzymes were purified on four successive chromatographic columns to ∼90–99% purity based on Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel, depending on the mutant (Fig.2). Enzymes were assayed for their ability to hydrolyze casein at varying concentrations of Ca2+. The calculated [Ca2+]0.5 served as the basis for the comparison of the Ca2+ requirement of wild-type and mutant enzymes in this study. In the conditions employed here, the [Ca2+]0.5 for wild-type m-calpain was 242 ± 6 μm (Fig. 3), which is in general agreement with previous reports (1Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 2Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Suzuki K.

Introducing the mutation E504S in domain III had the most dramatic effect, reducing the [Ca2+]0.5 to 129 ± 1 μm, corresponding to a 47% reduction in the Ca2+ requirement compared with wild-type m-calpain. The effects of mutating each of the three lysine residues (Lys-226, Lys-230, and Lys-234) individually to serine had varying results. Mutating Lys-226 or Lys-230 had minor effects on the Ca2+sensitivity of the enzyme (Fig. 3, TableI), whereas the mutation of Lys-234 reduced the [Ca2+]0.5 to 183 ± 1 μm (a 24% reduction in the Ca2+requirement). Further, the mutation of Lys-234 to glutamic acid resulted in a reduction in the [Ca2+]0.5 to 159 ± 3 μm, corresponding to a 34% decrease. Interestingly, the K230E and K234E mutations decreased the specific activity of the enzyme to ∼16% compared with the wild type, whereas the K230S and K234S mutations had no significant effect on specific activity.Table IEffects of mutations on the Ca2+ requirement and specific activity of m-calpainForm of m-calpain[Ca2+]0.5Approximate specific activityμm% wild typeWild type242 ± 6100E504S129 ± 190K226S226 ± 288K230S261 ± 198K234S183 ± 181K230E256 ± 116K234E159 ± 315 Open table in a new tab To ascertain whether mutations had caused unexpected structural changes that might influence the Ca2+ sensitivity, we attempted structure determination of these mutants by x-ray crystallography. We were successful in crystallizing K226S, K230E, K234S, and E504S mutants in the absence of Ca2+ in conditions very similar to those for wild-type rat m-calpain (19Hosfield C.M. Ye Q. Arthur J.S. Hegadorn C. Croall D.E. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1484-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To date, we have solved the structures of the K230E and E504S mutants, from which larger crystals suitable for diffraction were obtained. The refined structures of these mutants are virtually indistinguishable from wild-type calpain (root mean square deviation of 0.47 and 0.49 Å on α-carbon atoms for the E504S mutant and the K230E mutant, respectively), even in the vicinity of the mutations. Because these two structures were almost identical to the wild type, we did not proceed with the mutants that only gave rise to weakly diffracting crystals and assumed that they would have minimal, if any, conformational changes as well. The mechanism of calpain activation by Ca2+ is a fundamental biochemical question that has remained poorly understood. A particularly interesting feature of these enzymes is that theirin vitro requirements for Ca2+ are orders of magnitude higher than typical Ca2+ concentrations found in the cell. This characteristic is not shared by similar members of the EF-hand family, such as calmodulin, which have in vitroCa2+ requirements within the physiological range. Efforts to convert calpain EF-hand sequences to more canonical forms have been unsuccessful in reducing the Ca2+ requirement (15Dutt P. Arthur J.S. Grochulski P. Cygler M. Elce J.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 15: 37-43Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting that other structural features contribute to calpain's requirement for Ca2+. The x-ray structure of Ca2+-free rat m-calpain revealed several features that appear to maintain the inactive conformation of the enzyme. Of particular interest is a loop of nine acidic residues (Glu-392–Asp-400) in domain III, together with Glu-504, which make several electrostatic contacts with three lysine residues (Lys-226, Lys-230, Lys-234) on one α-helix in domain II. The structure of human m-calpain showed an additional interaction between Glu-504 and Lys-354. It should be noted particularly that Glu-504 would have the strongest contact with Lys-234. Structures are not yet available for μ-calpain and calpain 3, but these residues are almost all conserved in both μ-calpain and calpain 3, so these domain II-domain III interactions are likely to be present in all three calpains. It therefore seemed attractive to propose that this set of salt bridges might affect the ability of domain II to approach domain I in the process of assembling the active site, leading to the activation of calpain. The K234S and E504S mutations both significantly reduced the Ca2+ requirement without affecting the specific activity of the enzyme. The reduction caused by the E504S mutation was greater than that caused by the K234S mutation. This suggests that Glu-504 makes multiple electrostatic contacts and probably reflects the fact that the E504S mutation abolishes the salt links to Lys-234 and Lys-354. The K234S mutation abolishes only one of these salt links. The crystal structure of E504S is virtually identical to that of the wild-type enzyme in the inactive state, demonstrating that the reduction in the Ca2+ requirement observed in E504S is not a result of the disruption of the inactive conformation but must involve the facilitation of domain movement during Ca2+activation. Another interesting result was observed with the K234E mutation, which reduced the Ca2+ requirement of the enzyme even further than the K234S mutation. This mutation also reduced the specific activity of the enzyme, illustrating the sensitivity of this region to changes in the electrostatic potential. This mutant was expected to exert a repulsive interaction with Glu-504. Surprisingly, the results of this work showed that the electrostatic interactions of Lys-226 and Lys-230 with the acidic Glu-392–Asp-400 loop do not appear to be critical to the activation of calpain by Ca2+ because the K226S and K230S mutations did not affect either the Ca2+ requirement of the enzyme or its specific activity. The K230E mutation, which is expected to introduce a strong repulsion between this position and the acidic loop, did not affect the Ca2+ requirement of the enzyme. It did, however, greatly reduce the specific activity of the enzyme, for reasons that we cannot presently explain. The crystal structure of K230E in the absence of Ca2+ was identical to that of wild-type m-calpain, showing that the mutation did not affect the domain II-domain III geometry in the resting state of the enzyme. Because it has not so far been possible to crystallize calpain in the presence of Ca2+, the effects of these mutations on the activated state of the enzyme cannot be directly observed. Of the many mutations that have been made in m-calpain, the Lys-234 and Glu-504 mutations described here are the only examples so far described that result in a lowering of the Ca2+ requirement. The question therefore arises of how a loss of salt linkages around Glu-504 can have a major effect whereas alteration at Lys-226 and Lys-230 has very little effect. The residue Glu-504 is at one end of the “transducer arm” or linker peptide that connects domain IV to domain III, and this arm is assumed to communicate Ca2+-induced conformation changes in domain IV to the rest of the molecule. The evidence therefore suggests that the loss of the salt bridges at Glu-504 makes the movement of domain II toward domain I “easier,” i.e. permits it to occur at a lower Ca2+ concentration. As can be seen in Fig. 1, Glu-504 is “strategically” located at the top right end of the salt bridge series. The movement of domain II in the assembly of the active site, according to our modeling studies guided by the many well established thiol protease structures, would be based on a pivotal point in the Glu-504 region. Therefore, given that the Glu-504 and Lys-234 mutations weaken the interaction of domain II with domain III, we would suggest that domain II does in fact move apart from domain III during the activation process. Whether domain III undergoes additional conformational changes remains unknown in the absence of a Ca2+-bound structure. Illustrating the importance of this interaction in the calpain family, the corresponding mutation in μ-calpain, E515S, also lowers the Ca2+ requirement (data not shown). Recalling the resemblance of domain III to C2 domains, it should also be noted that Glu-504 and the Glu-392–Asp-400 loop are in positions very similar to the loops in C2 domains that participate in Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding. The Ca2+ requirement of calpain is greatly reduced in the presence of some phospholipids in vitro, and this is assumed to reflect membrane binding in vivo. We speculate therefore that Ca2+ and phospholipid binding to this region of calpain could disrupt these critical salt links, thereby releasing some constraints on the movement of domain II and lowering the Ca2+ requirement of the enzyme. Coordination of Ca2+ in the acidic loop by the side chains of the acidic residues could break most or even all of the electrostatic interactions with the basic residues in domain II. With the exception of pivotal Glu-504, perhaps breaking one or two such salt links by point mutation may not be enough to completely relieve the conformational constraints to permit the movement of domain II. Given that a Ca2+-bound structure may not be available in the foreseeable future, experiments of the type employed here will be required to more fully understand the mechanism of calpain activation by Ca2+. In this work, we have for the first time generated calpain mutants that are responsive to significantly lower concentrations of Ca2+ for activation. Further, we have identified a specific structural feature remote from the EF-hand domains that affects the Ca2+ sensitivity and activation of calpains. In light of the sequence conservation displayed in this region, it is clear that these key interdomain interactions are important factors contributing to the overall Ca2+requirement of the calpains."

In mitochondria of this mutant, the oleic acid content exceeded 70% of the total fatty acids, and the lipid/protein ratio was greatly enhanced. As a consequence, local microviscosity, probed by anthroyloxy fatty acid derivatives, was increased by 30%, whereas the lipid lateral diffusion, assayed using 1-pyrenedodecanoic acid, was approximately 4 times increased. Functional parameters such as oxygen consumption rate under phosphorylating and nonphosphorylating conditions and proton permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane were significantly reduced in fad2 mitochondrial membranes, while the thermal dependence of the respiration was enhanced. Moreover, metabolic control analysis of the respiration clearly showed an enhancement of the control exerted by the membrane proton leaks. Our data suggest that the loss of ω-6-oleate desaturase activity in Arabidopsiscells induced an enhancement of both microviscosity and lipid/protein ratio of mitochondrial membranes, which in turn were responsible for the change in lateral mobility of lipids and for bioenergetic parameter modifications.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 2Murata N. Los D.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, the exact relationships between chemical, physical, and biological properties of these membranes are far from being elucidated (2Murata N. Los D.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 3Sommerville C. Browse J. Science. 1991; 252: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 4Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). It is well established that the composition in fatty acids of plant membrane phospholipids is temperature-dependent, fatty acids being more unsaturated in chilling-resistant than in sensitive plants (2Murata N. Los D.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 3Sommerville C. Browse J. Science. 1991; 252: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 4Ohlrogge J.

Furthermore, it has been shown that the unsaturation degree of fatty acids influences the physical state of the membrane, microviscosity being higher in membranes containing a low level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (6Cavazzoni M. Svobodova J. De Santis A. Fato R. Lenaz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 7Tricerri M.A. Garda H.A. Brenner R.R. Chem. Phys.

In mitochondrial membranes, the oxidative phosphorylation is likely to be affected by changes in fatty acid unsaturation of the inner membrane phospholipids. Indeed, catalytic properties of carriers and redox components of the respiratory chain (1Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 9De Santis A. Landi P. Genchi G. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the proton-selective leaks (10Goubern M. Yazbeck J. Chapey M.F. Diolez P. Moreau F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Fontaine E.M. Moussa M. Devin A. Garcia J. Ghisolfi J. Rigoulet M. Leverve X.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) are sensitive to the unsaturation index. However, contradictory results have been reported. In plant systems, a decrease of unsaturation of mitochondrial membranes triggered by hypoxia had no significant effect on the activation energy of respiration (12Bligny R. Rebeille F. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9166-9170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian mitochondria, the electron transport in respiratory chain did not absolutely behave as a lipid diffusion-limited process (13Lenaz G. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 104: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similarly, the role of lipids and unsaturated fatty acids in proton permeability of mitochondrial membranes is still debated, because the mechanism of proton leak is not really known (14Brookes P.S. Rolfe D.S.F. Brand M.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Brookes P.S. Hulbert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To get further insight in the relationships between fatty acid composition and dynamic and functional properties of plant mitochondrial membranes, we used an approach based on genetic modifications of membrane lipid composition. Experiments were carried out with the fad2 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which belongs to a family of monogenic mutants deficient in fatty acid desaturase activities (16Lemieux B. Miquel M. Sommerville C. Browse J. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1990; 80: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Plants, contrary to animals, de novo synthesize their fatty acids and desaturate them by two independent pathways (3Sommerville C. Browse J. Science. 1991; 252: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 4Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). The prokaryotic pathway, located in plastidial membranes, is responsible for the desaturation of fatty acids found in this compartment. The eukaryotic pathway is associated to endoplasmic reticulum and is responsible for the desaturation of fatty acids present in extraplastidial membranes. As a consequence of the existence of these two pathways,Arabidopsis mutants affected in desaturase activities associated to one pathway are viable. In peculiar, the fad2mutant, deficient in oleate desaturase associated to endoplasmic reticulum, grows well except if plants are exposed at low temperature (5Miquel M.F. Browse J.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Miquel M. James D. Dooner H. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6208-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Such a mutant is a good model to analyze the importance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)1 in extraplastidial membrane functions. In addition, compared with animal mitochondria, plant mitochondrial membranes exhibit a simple fatty acid composition where only three unsaturated fatty acid species are found: one monounsaturated, oleic acid (18:1), and two PUFA, linoleic (18:2) and linolenic (18:3) acids. Composition of mitochondrial membranes isolated from cell culture of the fad2 mutant was analyzed, and the dynamic properties of membrane lipids were investigated by measuring lipid microviscosity and lateral diffusion. Oxidative phosphorylation parameters, such as oxidation rates and activation energy of electron transport, were analyzed. The flux-force relationships were established, and the metabolic control analysis of the oxidative phosphorylation process was carried out to estimate the impact of fad2 mutation on proton leaks. Cell suspension culture of wild typeA. thaliana L. (Heynh) ecotype Columbia was provided by Dr. M. Axelos (CNRS, Toulouse). Cell suspension culture of thefad2–2 genotype was established in the laboratory. The culture medium (Gamborg B5) was bought from Duchefa, France. Every fifth day, 25-ml aliquots of cell suspension were transferred into 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of fresh medium. Cells were grown under continuous light (100 μmol m−2s−1) at 22 °C, with rotating agitation (140 rpm). Mitochondria were isolated from 6-day-old suspension cultures according to Davy de Virville et al. (18Davy de Virville J. Alin M.F. Aaron Y. Rémy R. Guillot-Salomon T. Cantrel C. Plant. Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 36: 347-356Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Purified mitochondria were immediately used for functional measurements or kept at −20 °C for further analysis. Based on galactolipid content (used as a marker of plastidial membranes), the purity of the mitochondrial fraction was higher than 95%. The outer membrane integrity of fresh mitochondria was higher than 90%, as deduced from cytochromec oxidase activity measurements (19Davy de Virville J. Aaron I. Alin M.F. Moreau F. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 32: 159-166Google Scholar). To prepare submitochondrial particles, intact mitochondria (1.5 mg of protein/ml) in 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Mops (pH 7.2) medium were sonicated six times for 10 s in an MSE sonicator. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the membrane pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of the same medium and used for protein and lipid phosphorus determinations. Lipids were extracted and separated on silica gel plates (Merck) by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography as previously described (20Guillot-Salomon T. Farineau F. Cantrel C. Oursel A. Tuquet C. Physiol. Planta. 1987; 69: 113-122Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fatty acids were analyzed after transmethylation (18Davy de Virville J. Alin M.F. Aaron Y. Rémy R. Guillot-Salomon T. Cantrel C. Plant. Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 36: 347-356Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using methylheptadecanoate (C17) as internal standard. Large unilamellar liposomes of total mitochondrial lipids were prepared by extrusion (Liposofast, Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Canada) in 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Mops (pH 7.2) medium. Oxygen consumption was measured between 5 and 35 °C using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (19Davy de Virville J. Aaron I. Alin M.F. Moreau F. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 32: 159-166Google Scholar). Air-saturated electrode medium contained 0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 g/liter fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Mitochondria (0.1–0.4 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with 200 μm ATP and 100 μm propyl gallate to inhibit the alternative oxidase. Oxidation was triggered by the addition of succinate (10 mm) and then of ADP (from 25 to 100 μm). The membrane potential was measured continuously and simultaneously with oxygen consumption using a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+)-sensitive electrode in the presence of 2 μm TPP+ (21Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The values of membrane potential were calculated using the equation of Kamoet al. (21Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), without corrections for cation binding and assuming a mitochondrial volume of 1 μl/mg of protein. Since in plant mitochondria the protonmotive force (Δp) is totally expressed as membrane potential (ΔΨ) (22Diolez P. Moreau F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 56-63Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Kesseler A. Diolez P. Brinkmann K. Brand M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and assuming both an entirely delocalized protonmotive force (22Diolez P. Moreau F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 56-63Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and no slip reactions of the proton pumps (i.e. a constant H+/O stoichiometry of 6 for succinate oxidation (24Brand M.D. Chien L.F. Diolez P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)), the proton conductance (CmH+), expressed in nmol of H+·min−1·mg−1(protein)·mV−1, was estimated under nonphosphorylating conditions by a ratio between 6 times the value of the oxidation rate (J o expressed in nmol of atomic oxygen·min−1·mg−1protein) and membrane potential. The flux control coefficients exerted by each of the three subsystems involved in oxidative phosphorylation (namely, the respiratory chain (c), the proton leaks (l), and the block of phosphorylation (p)) over the overall proton flux through the respiratory chain were determined according to the top down approach of metabolic control analysis (25Hafner R.P. Brown G.C. Brand M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) using the protonmotive force (assimilated to membrane potential) as common intermediate. The flux control coefficients exerted by each block were deduced from oxidation rate measurements (J o) from which proton flux for each subsystem (J c, J l, andJ p) were derived using the relationJ H+ = J o·H+/O and from the determination of the overall elasticity coefficient, ɛΔpJo=(dJo/dΔp)×(Δp/Jo)Equation 1 of the three subsystems, utilizing the equations of Hafneret al. (25Hafner R.P. Brown G.C. Brand M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the nonphosphorylating state, control coefficients were given by the relations, CcJo=ɛΔpl/ɛΔpl−ɛΔpcEquation 2 and ClJo=ɛΔpc/ɛΔpc−ɛΔplEquation 3 for the respiratory chain and the proton leaks, respectively. In the phosphorylating state, control coefficients were given by the equations, CcJc=ɛΔpp×Jp+ɛΔpl×Jl/ɛΔpp×Jp+ɛΔpl×Jl−ɛΔpc×JcEquation 4 and ClJc=Jl×1−CcJc/JcandCpJc=Jp×1−CcJc/JcEquation 5 for the control exerted by the respiratory chain, the proton leaks, and the block of phosphorylation. Experimentally, all determinations were carried out according to Kesseler et al.(23Kesseler A. Diolez P. Brinkmann K. Brand M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The elasticity coefficient of the respiratory chain to Δp (εΔpc) was determined by measuring succinate oxidation at several Δp values obtained in the presence of various amounts of hexokinase with ATP and glucose (500 μm each) in excess. The elasticity of proton leaks to Δp(εΔpl) was determined in the nonphosphorylating state by progressively inhibiting succinate oxidation with increasing amounts of malonate (0–5 mm). The elasticity of combined Δp consumers (namely block of phosphorylation and proton leaks) was determined in the presence of 1 mm ADP (maximal phosphorylating state) by progressively inhibiting succinate oxidation with malonate. The elasticity coefficient of the phosphorylation subsystem (εΔpc) was determined by an appropriated replot against Δp (23Kesseler A. Diolez P. Brinkmann K. Brand M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The lateral diffusion of 1-pyrenedodecanoic acid (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), an excimer-forming probe, was determined at different temperatures (from 5 to 35 °C) in purified mitochondrial membranes or in liposomes according to Galla and Luisetti (26Galla H.J. Luisetti J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 596: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Aliquots of membranes (100 nmol of phospholipids) were suspended in 1.2 ml of 20 mm Mops, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl (pH 7.2) medium. Successive additions of the probe were made to give a molar ratio (probe/lipids) varying from 0.001 to 0.13. Microviscosity was assayed by measuring fluorescence depolarization of 2-, 3-, 6-, 7-, 9-, or 12-(9-anthroyloxy) stearic acid or 16-(9-anthroyloxy) palmitic acid (Molecular Probes) embedded in mitochondrial membrane or liposomes. The probe/phospholipid molar ratio was 0.02. The samples were incubated in the presence of probe at 20 °C for 20 min, and the measurements were carried out between 5 and 35 °C. Measurements were performed on an LS-5 Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorimeter equipped with a thermostated device. Cytochrome concentration was determined by differential absorption spectrophotometry (reduced state minus oxidized state) at room temperature, using an Aminco DW 2A spectrophotometer. The specific absorption coefficients of cytochromesa + a 3 (602–630 nm), cytochromesb (560–575 nm), and cytochrome c (550–540 nm) were 16, 20, and 19 mm−1·cm−1, respectively. Lipid phosphorus content was assayed according to Rouser et al. (27Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined according to Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough H.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a drastic reduction in the amounts of PUFA, linoleic acid (18:2), and linolenic acid (18:3) was observed in fad2 mitochondria. In addition, the amounts of palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0) were also greatly lowered. As a consequence, the amount of oleic acid (18:1) was considerably enhanced (∼10 times), since it represented about 75% of total fatty acids. Consequently, the PUFA/monounsaturated acid ratio was extremely reduced (about 40 times), and the double bond index dropped from 3.04 to 2.18. By contrast, lipid class analysis showed that the distribution of the phospholipids present in mitochondrial membranes (i.e. phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG)) was only slightly modified infad2 mitochondria (Fig. 1 B); the phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine ratio decreased from 1.5 to 1.1, and the amount of phosphatidylinositol was slightly reduced. Fatty acid composition of individual lipids showed that each class of lipid was differently affected by the fad2 mutation (TableI). The main phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, possessed an extremely high amount of 18:1 (≥75%) and low amounts of PUFA as well as of saturated fatty acids. DPG, which was the more unsaturated phospholipid in wild type mitochondria, was altered in a comparable way; the level of 18:1 increased to 70% and the amount of 18:2 dropped to less than 2%, but the level of 18:3 fatty acid still accounted for ∼20%. In phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol, changes induced by the mutation were characterized by a quasiabsence of PUFA, by a decrease in the level of 18:0, and by an expected enhancement in 18:1 content. As a consequence, the double bond index of each phospholipid class was severely reduced in membranes from the mutant. Beside these drastic changes, fad2 mitochondria exhibited a significant increase of the lipid/protein ratio (TableII), which was about 40% higher than in the wild type, both in total mitochondria and submitochondrial particles. This suggested that membrane proteins represented the same fraction of total mitochondrial protein (about 30%). Consequently, thefad2 mutation induced a significant decrease of the mitochondrial membrane protein density. To further analyze this effect, the cytochrome concentrations were determined by differential absorption spectrophotometry. The total amounts of cytochromes expressed per mg of protein were barely significantly different between both genotypes (Table III). As a consequence, the lipid/cytochrome ratio was enhanced in thefad2 mutant, indicating a specific reduction in redox complex density that was consistent with the reduction in overall protein density of these membranes.Table IFatty acid composition of the various phospholipid classes found in mitochondrial membranes from wild type (WT) and fad2 genotypes of A. thalianaFatty acidPCPEDPGPIPGWTfad2WTfad2WTfad2WTfad2WTfad216:020.37.419.99.37.05.258.852.264.367.618:012.00.45.52.22.72.016.08.716.610.918:112.484.59.473.75.870.34.233.76.018.818:228.90.439.92.336.81.511.93.57.82.718:326.47.325.312.547.721.09.11.95.3NDDBI3.02.13.32.38.95.41.10.90.80.5Data correspond to the mean of values obtained in two independent preparations.

PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; DPG, diphosphatidylglycerol; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol. SMP were obtained after sonication of intact mitochondria as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lipid content was assayed on a lipid extract. Data correspond to the mean ± S.D. of five different experiments. Cytochrome content was determined from absorption of the α-bands of each cytochrome using the molar extinction coefficients given under “Materials and Methods.” The technique applied for these determinations was differential absorption spectroscopy between the reduced state (by dithionite) and the oxidized state of cytochromes. Values are the mean of values obtained in two independent preparations ± the interval between the two experimental values. Lipid/cytochrome ratios were calculated using values of lipid/protein ratios given in Table II and lipid content expressed in mol of phosphate. This lower protein density could be a direct consequence of the peculiar lipid composition of the fad2 membrane. Alternatively, it could represent an adaptative tendency of the plant, which could be considered as tropical (from its lipid unsaturation) to a moderate temperature. To test these hypothesis, we isolated mitochondria from cells grown for 12 days at 12 °C. Contrary to what was found at 22 °C, where lipid/protein ratios were different by 40%, the two ratios found at 12 °C fell in the range 0.40–0.45. 2O. Caiveau, D. Fortune, C. Cantrel, A. Zachowski, and F. Moreau, manuscript in preparation. This shows that the reduction in this ratio was higher in fad2 membranes than in wild type ones, suggesting that the lipid/protein ratio was not solely controlled by the polyunsaturated fatty acid content. Effects offad2 mutation on the dynamic properties of membrane lipids were determined by measuring local microviscosity and lipid lateral diffusion in mitochondrial membranes and liposomes prepared from mitochondrial lipids. Microviscosity at different depths along the acyl chains was studied measuring fluorescence anisotropy of anthroyloxy-labeled fatty acids at 20 °C. In membranes fromfad2 mitochondria (Fig.2 A), the microviscosity was higher at all of the positions, and the mobility gradient along the chain was different. The “plateau” region extended down to the 9th carbon in the mutant (instead of the 6th in the wild type), and then the motion became easier toward the center of the bilayer but with a different profile. It is interesting to note that anisotropy values did not vary significantly with the temperature in the range of 5–35 °C. Different results were found with liposomes prepared from the whole mitochondrial lipids (Fig. 2 B). Compared with native membranes, the liposomes from both genotypes exhibited a higher microviscosity at the 3rd carbon level, and then, down to the 12th carbon, the microviscosity was not different in liposomal or mitochondrial membranes. At the 16th carbon level, the microviscosity values in liposomes were lower than in native membranes. Moreover, the difference was more pronounced in liposomes prepared with lipids from wild type mitochondria. Nevertheless, in absolute value,fad2 liposomes were more rigid than wild type liposomes. The lateral diffusion of lipids within the bilayer was probed using a pyrene-labeled fatty acid at different temperatures between 5 and 35 °C. The lipid diffusion coefficient was always higher infad2 (from 1.4–5.5 μm2s−1) than in wild type (0.5–1.2 μm2 s−1) membranes (Fig.3 A). The activation energy of lipid diffusion was 33 ± 3 kJ mol−1 and 18 ± 4 kJ mol−1 for fad2 and wild type mitochondrial membranes, respectively (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the thermal dependence of lateral diffusion infad2 mitochondria was higher. By contrast, lateral diffusion rates in fad2 (from 2.5 to 6.7 μm2s−1) or wild type (from 1.6 to 4.6 μm2 s−1) liposomes were much less different, and the thermal dependence of the motion was the same in both genotypes (about 37 ± 5 kJ mol−1). Interestingly, the activation energies found in membranes and liposomes were very close for the mutant line, whereas in wild type, these values differed by a factor of 2. To characterize the consequence of thefad2 mutation on functional properties ofArabidopsis mitochondria, various parameters of oxidative phosphorylation such as oxidation rates, respiratory control, and ADP/atomic oxygen ratio were determined. Under either nonphosphorylating (state 4) or phosphorylating (state 3) conditions, the oxidation rates (expressed per mg of protein) measured at 20 °C were significantly lower (by about 20%) in fad2mitochondria. However, if expressed versus cytochrome content, no significant differences could be found between the two systems (not shown). The yield of oxidative phosphorylation probed by ADP/atomic oxygen ratio (1.4 ± 0.2) and respiratory control (1.8 ± 0.2) were identical between both genotypes (average of four independent determinations). Temperature differently affected the oxidation rates in the two genotypes (Fig.4). Between 5 and 30 °C, oxidation rates (in nmol of O2·min−1·mg of protein−1) varied from 20 to 155 in wild type and from 15 to 155 in fad2 mitochondria in state 4 (Fig. 4 A) and from 50 to 200 in wild type and from 30 to 170 in fad2mitochondria in state 3 (Fig. 4 B) (error on any value was less than 10%). For both genotypes and in states 3 or 4, Arrhenius plots were linear at least up to 25 °C (Fig. 4). This clearly indicated that, although fad2 membranes were deprived from polyunsaturated chains, no discontinuity occurred at low temperature (i.e. below 15 °C). Moreover, this showed that the activation energy was significantly higher in fad2mitochondria under both energetic states: 66 ± 3 kJ·mol−1 instead of 57 ± 1 kJ·mol−1 in state 4 and 53 ± 2 kJ·mol−1 instead of 42 ± 2 kJ·mol−1 in state 3"
https://openalex.org/W2332898132,"There have been few studies on the specific signaling pathways involved in the transformation of epithelial cells by oncogenic protein tyrosine kinases. Here we investigate the requirement of MAP (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3- (PI3K) kinases in the transformation of rat intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells by oncogenic forms of insulin receptor (gag-IR), insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (gag-IGFR), and v-Src. MAPK is not significantly activated in cells transformed by gag-IR and gag-IGFR but is activated in v-Src transformed cells. Treatment with PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, at concentrations where MAPK activity was reduced below the basal level showed that MAPK is partially required for the monolayer growth of parental and transformed RIE cells. However, MAPK is not essential for the focus forming ability of the three oncogene-transformed cells. It is also not necessary for the colony forming ability of gag-IR- and gag-IGFR-, but is partially required for v-Src-transformed cells. PI3K is significantly activated in all three oncogene transformed RIE cells. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, potently inhibited monolayer growth of all three oncogene-transformed cells. However, at concentrations of LY294002 where activated forms of Akt, a downstream component of the PI3K pathway, were undetectable, colony and focus forming abilities of the v-Src-RIE cells were only slightly affected whereas those of gag-IR/IGFR-RIE cells were greatly inhibited. These results were confirmed using a different pharmacological inhibitor, wortmannin, and a dominant negative form of PI3K, Ap85. Similarly, rapamycin, known to inhibit p70S6 kinase, a downstream component of the PI3K-Akt pathway, also inhibited gag-IR/IGFR-induced, but not v-Src-induced, focus and colony formation. We conclude that the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways are differentially required for transformation of RIE cells by oncogenic IR and IGFR versus Src and the pattern of requirements is different from that of fibroblast transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2334761118,"The AUF1 (hnRNPD) and HuR (ELAV-like) proteins, potential trans-acting factors for regulated mRNA decay, bind in vitro to A+U-rich elements (AREs) found in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of many labile transcripts. In an effort to determine whether these trans-acting factors are likely to play a role in embryogenesis, we have analysed their expression during mouse development both at the mRNA and protein levels. We show that AUF1 and HuR are expressed at all the developmental stages analysed from day 8.5 of embryonic development to adulthood. Expression levels are dynamic, varying between tissues and developmental stages. However, a strong positive correlation between AUF1 and HuR protein levels was observed in all examined tissues. Finally, we compared AUF1 and HuR expression with accumulation of one common target mRNA, c-myc. The similar spatio-temporal distribution of these proteins and of c-myc mRNA is in agreement with a potential concerted role in ARE-mediated control of mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W2335498674,"We examined the influence of adenovirus-mediated wild-type p16INK4a (Ad/p16) expression on the radiation sensitivity of NSCLC cell lines, all of which lacked constitutive p16INK4a but each of which varied in p53 status: A549 (-p16INK4a/ +pRb/wt-p53), H322 (-p16INK4a/ +pRb/mt-p53), and H1299 (-p16INK4a/ +pRb/deleted-p53). The in vitro clonogenic survival results indicate that Ad/p16 enhanced the radiosensitivity of A549 but not H322 or H1299. Further analysis indicated that the apoptosis induced by combination therapy using Ad/p16 plus irradiation was dependent on the endogenous p53 status of the cancer cells. We performed Western blotting to analyse the p53 protein expression of A549 cells treated with either Ad/p16 or Ad/Luc. Endogenous p53 protein levels were higher in A549 cells transfected with Ad/p16 than in those transfected with Ad/Luc. Furthermore, when wt-p53 protein expression was restored in H1299 using Ad/ p53, Ad/p16 stabilized p53 protein expression and radiosensitized the cells. These results suggest that Ad/ p16-induced stabilization of p53 protein may play an important role in Ad/p16 mediated radiosensitization by enhancing or restoring apoptosis properties. Thus, Ad/ p16 plus radiation in combination may be a useful gene therapy strategy for tumors that have wt-p53 but nonfunctional p16INK4a."

Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 173-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Such periodically expressed genes frequently encode proteins that either directly control cell cycle progression or function in periodically occurring metabolic processes, such as nucleotide and DNA biosynthesis. A major regulator of the cell cycle-dependent expression of these genes is the transcription factor E2F (2Brehm A. Miska E. Reid J. Bannister A. Kouzarides T. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80 Suppl. 1: 38-41PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lavia P. Jansen-Durr P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 4Muller H. Helin K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M1-M12PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptionally inactive complexes of E2F with pocket proteins of the Retinoblastoma protein (prb) family assemble in Go/early G1, but during cell cycle progression these complexes dissociate, and the release of transcriptionally active “free E2F” leads to the activation of E2F-responsive genes. It has become clear, however, that E2F can also act either as an active repressor, which, at least in part, appears to be due to the retinoblastoma protein-mediated recruitment of histone deacetylases. The first example of a gene that is repressed by E2F is the mouseB-myb gene (5Lam E.W. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), but a number of other genes repressed via E2F sites in their promoters have been identified, for exampleE2F-1 (6Hsiao K.-M.

The murine cell line NIH3T3 (kindly provided by R.

Cells were plated on 35-mm (diameter) tissue culture plates at a density producing 60–80% confluence at the time of the transfection and transfected using the cationic lipid DOTAP as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For synchronization in G0, cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 3 days. Stimulation was carried out for the indicated times with 10% fetal calf serum. Luciferase activity was determined as published elsewhere (38Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 51Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2105-2107PubMed Google Scholar). The murine genomic λ-Fix phage library 129 FVJ (Stratagene) was screened with a 69-base pair oligonucleotide (probe 1, 5′-TCTAGCTAGCCTTTGCCCGCCCCGCCACGATGGAGGTACCCCTGCAGAAGTCTGCGCCGGGTTCAGCTC-3′) annealing to the 5′-end of the murine cdc25B cDNA (52Kakizuka A.

Three phage clones were isolated, and the DNA was amplified and further mapped in the 3′ direction with probe 2 (5′-GGTCATTCAAAATGAGCAGTTACCATAAAACGCTTCCGATCCTTACCAGTGAGGCTTGCTGGAACACACTCCGGTGCTG-3′) and probe 3 (5′-GTTAAAGAAGCATTGTTATTATGGGGAGGGGGGAGCAACCTCTGGGTTCAGAATCTACATATGCTGGAAGGCCCCAATGA-3′). Experimental details have previously been described (51Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2105-2107PubMed Google Scholar). A 4.6-kilobase fragment containing the promoter region and the noncoding sequence was isolated and subcloned in theEcoRI/SalI sites of the pBluescriptIISK vector (Stratagene). 32P-labeled primer (10 pmol) and total cellular RNA, isolated from normal cycling NIH3T3 cells, were denatured for 10 min at 65 °C and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Primer extension was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 75 mmKCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mmMgCl2, 400 μm dNTPs, 2 units of RNasin, and 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with EDTA followed by RNase treatment. The DNA was precipitated, redissolved, and separated by electrophoresis on a 6% acrylamide, 7 m urea gel. For cDNA synthesis (53Belyavsky A. Vinogradova T. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2919-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), 4 μg of total RNA were annealed to 1 μg of oligo(dT) and incubated with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase for 1 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 20 μl. One-tenth of the reaction mixture was amplified by 25 cycles of PCR in the presence of 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (38Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R.

Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13499) Google Scholar). The experimental strategy included the following precautions. (i) The number of PCR cycles was kept low to obtain a linear amplification of the PCR products, which was possible by the incorporation of radioactive precursor nucleotides and evaluation by autoradiography and β-radiation scanning. (ii) All results were standardized using the signal obtained with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, whose expression is independent of cell proliferation. (iii) All experiments were performed with at least two independent cDNA preparations. Primers carrying restriction sites were used for PCR with pBIISKcdc25B as the template to generate a series of 5′ terminal deletions with compatible ends for cloning as KpnI/NheI fragments into the multiple cloning region of the promoterless luciferase vector pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI). All PCR-amplified fragments were verified by DNA sequencing. 1–7-base pair mutations were introduced into the regions of the cdc25B promoter spanning −950 to +167 or −223 to +167 using PCR-directed mutagenesis (37Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Primers carrying the mutations (see below) and a second set of primers for subcloning (5′cdc25B, 5′cdc25B223, and 3′cdc25B) were designed. The first PCR reaction (54Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S.

Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13499) Google Scholar) was performed with the oligonucleotides (i) 5′cdc25B and 3′-primer carrying the mutation and (ii) 3′cdc25B and 5′-primer carrying the mutation. The resulting products were purified (QIAquick Spin PCR purification; Qiagen) and amplified in a second PCR reaction using 5′cdc25B or 5′cdc25B223 and 3′cdc25B as primers. Site-directed mutagenesis of the first E-box (−947) (mutated bases underlined) was generated by PCR with the primer 5′mE1 (5′-AGCTGGTACCTTCTCAAGCTTTCCCACTAGGTCCTTCCCAG-3′) and the primer cdc25B NheI (see below). The resulting fragments carrying the mutations were cloned into theKpnI/NheI sites of the promoterless luciferase vector pGL3-basic (Promega) and verified by DNA sequencing.

Preparation of nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described (55Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

EMSA reactions for Sp1/3 and NF-Y binding were performed at room temperature for 15 min followed by gel electrophoresis at 4 °C using 4% polyacrylamide gels. Supershifts were carried out by pre-incubating EMSA reactions on ice for 20 min with 1 μl of the indicated antibodies prior to addition of the radiolabeled probe. For detection of other protein-DNA complexes, EMSA reactions were carried out on ice for 15 min. Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies were obtained from G. Suske (IMT, Marburg, Germany). The NF-Y antibody was obtained from R. Mantovani (Milan). The following oligonucleotides were used as probes and/or competitors: cdc25B NF-Y, 5′-GGAACCGGCGCCCCCATTGGTCG-3′; bona fide NF-Y, 5′-GATTTTTTCCTGATTGGTTAAAAGT-3′; mcdc25B NF-Y (MY), 5′-GGAACCGGCGCCCCCATTAATGG-3′; GT box, 5′-AGCTTCCTTGCCACACCCCTGCAG-3′; −103/−80, 5′-GTTGGTCCCGCCCTCCCGGGAAC-3′; −120/−97, 5′-GTCAGCCTCAGCCCCGCCCTTGGT-3′; −209/−187, 5′-GCCGGGGCGGTACGTGTGGGG-3′; −226/ −206, 5′-GCAATGGGAGCGGGCGGGGC-3′; −64/−29, 5′-GCGTCTGG- CGGCGCTGCCGCTGTTATTTTTCGAATA; −64/−20, 5′-GCGTCTGGCGGCGCTGCCGCTGTTATTTTTCGAATATATAAGGAG-3′; −64/−20 3mCCRR, 5′-GCGTCTGGCGGCGCTGCCGCTGTTATTTTTATCATATATAAGGAG-3′; ns, 5′-GAATAAAGTTTTACTGATTTTTGAGACA-3′. Shown are the top strand oligonucleotides. For radioactive labeling by filling in with [32P]dCTP, an additional G was added to the 5′-end of the bottom strand oligonucleotides. Underlined letters represent mutated bases. For genomic footprinting (38Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Müller R.

Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), NIH3T3 cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 3 days for synchronization in G0, and stimulation was carried out for the indicated times with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were then treated with 0.2% DMS for 2 min. After DMS treatment, cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the DNA was isolated. As reference, NIH3T3 genomic DNA was methylated in vitro with 0.2% DMS for 10–30 s. Piperidine cleavage was performed as described. Genomic DNA (3 μg) was used for ligation-mediated PCR as described. The Stoffel fragment ofTaq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used instead of the native enzyme. Samples were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated before primer extension with32P-labeled primers. The following oligonucleotides were used as primers: first primer (Tm = 52 °C), 5′-d(AGTCACCCTAAGAAGCG)-3′; second primer (Tm = 74 °C), 5′-d(CGAGCAGAAGTAGCTGGTCCAGC)-3′; third primer (Tm = 88 °C), 5′-d(CTGGTCCAGCCTCAGCCTCAGCCCC)-3′. A mouse embryo genomic DNA library was screened with an oligonucleotide representing the mousecdc25B coding region. Several recombinant phage spanning ∼30 kilobases of genomic DNA were isolated and mapped (Fig.1 A). One phage clone (designated III in Fig. 1 A) was used to subclone a 1.1-kilobase fragment representing the sequence 5′ to the translation start codon. This fragment (B950) was linked to the firefly luciferase gene and transfected into NIH3T3 cells to test whether the isolated promoter fragment was functional in a transient expression assay. As shown in Fig. 2 A, B950 was cell cycle-regulated after serum stimulation of cells that had been synchronized in G0. Thus, hardly any luciferase activity was detectable in G0 cells and at early stages after serum stimulation, but there was an ∼4-fold induction at 18 h after serum stimulation, peaking at 22 h (8-fold induction). At this stage, most cells had entered or passed through G2 (data not shown). In addition, we determined the expression profile of the endogenous cdc25B gene in the same cell system and found a similar time course (Fig. 2 B;cdc2 induction shown for comparison). These data indicate that the isolated promoter fragment is sufficient to confer on a luciferase reporter gene a pattern of cell cycle regulation that mirrors its physiological regulation.Figure 2Cell cycle regulation of cdc25Btranscription. A, time course of luciferase activity in G0-synchronized NIH3T3 cells after transfection of the B950 construct and serum stimulation. B, kinetics of endogenous cdc25B mRNA expression in serum-stimulated NIH3T3 cells. The analysis was performed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. For comparison, the induction of cdc2 mRNA was also measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nucleotide sequence of B950 was determined for both strands (GenBankTMaccession number AJ296019). The most relevant part of the sequence, as determined below, is shown in Fig. 1 B. Inspection of the sequence revealed a match with a canonical TATA box motif 190 nucleotides 5′ to the ATG (Fig. 1 C). A single transcription start site cluster was identified by primer extension analysis ∼30 nucleotides downstream of this motif and overlapping with an Initiator (Inr) consensus sequence (Figs. 1 C and3). Although we cannot formally rule out the formal possibility that the cdc25B gene contains additional initiation sites outside the region analyzed, these observations strongly suggest that a TATA box and/or an Inr element direct the initiation of transcription and define the transcriptional start site. The A within the Inr motif was therefore designated position +1 (see Fig. 1 C). A search for potential regulatory sites revealed the presence of additional putative transcription factor binding sites: two E boxes (−947 and −800), three E2F sites (−232, −58, and −50), five Sp1 sites (−570, −217, −200, −105, and −95), and an NF-Y binding site (−70). To identify functionally relevant regions incdc25B promoter, a series of terminal truncations was generated from the B950 construct (−950/+167) and analyzed for expression in G0 versus normally cycling cells (N) (Fig. 4). This analysis led to the following conclusions. (i) The terminal deletion of 10 nucleotides, which removes a potential E box led to an increase in transcriptional activity of ∼40% but had no effect on cell cycle regulation. Truncation of the adjacent fragment spanning positions −980 to −768, which harbors another potential E box, had no detectable effect on transcriptional activity or cell cycle regulation. (ii) The region from −340 to −250 seems to have a negative effect on transcriptional activity. However, because no putative binding sites could be identified in this region, and there was no effect on cell cycle regulation, we did not pursue this finding. (iii) Further deletion of a fragment spanning nucleotides −250 to −223 and harboring a potential E2F site had no detectable effect. (iv) Truncation of a fragment spanning positions −223 to −180, which contains two potential Sp1sites, led to a clear reduction in transcriptional activity. This was further decreased by truncation of the adjacent region spanning nucleotides −180 to −87, which harbors two more potential Sp1 sites. The loss of these four potential Sp1 sites led to a total decrease in transcriptional activity of 60%, with only a marginal effect on cell cycle regulation. (v) The terminal deletion of an additional 20 nucleotides resulted in a further drop in transcriptional activity but also led to a clear decrease in cell cycle regulation, indicating that this promoter region, which harbors a potential NF-Y site, is of particular functional relevance. (vi) Further truncations had no additional effect on cell cycle regulation, presumably because these constructs all lacked the NF-Y site. To confirm and extend the findings obtained by promoter truncation, the putative E boxes and NF-Y binding site were altered by point mutations, and the functional consequences were analyzed in transient transfection assays. The proximal potential E2F sites were not included in this analysis because no binding of E2F-1, E2F-3, or E2F-4 to the cdc25B promoter could be detected in EMSA using either normal NIH3T3 cells or retrovirally transduced cells overexpressing the respective E2F pr"

PthlhThr and PthlhPro alleles were significantly linked with resistance and susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis in phenotypically selected Car-R and Car-S outbred mice. Transfection of human NCI-H520 squamous cell carcinoma cells with the PthlhPro allele resulted in cells growing in clusters, tending to pile up, and growing at a significantly faster rate in nude mice than non-transfected and PthlhThr-transfected cells. These results point to the role of the Pthlh gene as a cancer modifier gene in skin tumorigenesis."

We previously reported that two potential amphipathic helixes (Lys-327 to Ile-344 and Asp-357 to Val-374) of DnaA protein are involved in the functional interaction between DnaA and cardiolipin. In relation to one of these helixes (Asp-357 to Val-374), we demonstrated that basic amino acids in the helix, especially Lys-372, are vital for this interaction. In this study, we have identified an amino acid in the second potential amphipathic helix (Lys-327 to Ile-344), which would also appear to be involved in the interaction. We constructed three mutant dnaA genes with a single mutation (dnaAR328E, dnaAR334E, anddnaAR342E) and examined the function of the mutant proteins. DnaAR328E, but not DnaAR334E and DnaAR342E, was found to be more resistant to inhibition of its ATP binding activity by cardiolipin than the wild-type protein. The stimulation of ADP release from DnaAR328E by cardiolipin was also weaker than that observed with the other mutants and the wild-type protein. These results suggest that Arg-328 of DnaA protein is involved in the functional interaction of this protein with acidic phospholipids. We propose that acidic phospholipids bind to two basic amino acid residues (Arg-328 and Lys-372) of DnaA protein and change the higher order structure of its ATP-binding pocket, which in turn stimulates the release of ADP from the protein.

Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The numerous biochemical activities of this protein enable it to play important roles not only in the initiation reaction itself but also in the regulation of the initiation (1Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To fully understand the role of DnaA protein in initiation of DNA replication in cells, it is important to reveal the functional domain for each activity (2Mizushima T. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To initiate DNA replication, the duplex DNA must firstly be opened up to enable other replicative proteins to enter the origin of replication. DnaA protein is responsible for this through specific binding to the origin of replication (oriC) followed by self-oligomerization, which causes the duplex DNA to open up at oriC (1Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal regions of this protein are involved in the oligomerization and in the specific DNA binding, respectively (3Mima S. Yamagachi Y. Kondo T. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T.

DnaA protein has a high affinity for both ATP and ADP, but although the ATP-binding form is active, the ADP-binding form is inactive in DNA replication (7Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A.

ATP bound to DnaA protein is hydrolyzed to ADP by its intrinsic ATPase activity, and this hydrolysis is involved in inactivating DnaA protein following initiation of DNA replication (9Katayama T.

The Lys-178 and Glu-204 amino acids of DnaA protein have been shown to be essential for ATP binding and for ATPase activity, respectively (10Mizushima T. Nishida S. Kurokawa K. Katayama T. Miki T.

The membrane binding activity of DnaA protein also seems to be involved in the regulation of replication initiation, through modulation of the adenine-nucleotide binding capacity of the protein. Acidic phospholipids, in particular cardiolipin (CL),1 decrease DnaA protein's affinity for adenine nucleotides and activate the ADP-bound DnaA protein to the ATP-bound form in the presence of high concentrations of ATP by stimulating the exchange reaction of ADP with ATP (15Sekimizu K.

It has been suggested that DnaA protein is activated by acidic phospholipids to initiate DNA replication in vivo(19Shinpuku T. Mizushima T. Guo L. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, the precise molecular mechanism by which acidic phospholipids interact with DnaA to decrease the affinity of this protein for adenine nucleotides is still unknown. Identification of essential amino acids involved in the DnaA-membrane interaction is an important first step to identifying this mechanism. A CL protection assay of DnaA protein from trypsin digestion suggested that a potential amphipathic helix (Asp-357 to Val-374) is involved in the membrane binding activity of DnaA protein (24Garner J. Crooke E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3477-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We further identified that three basic amino acids in the helix (Arg-360, Arg-364, Lys-372), especially Lys-372, were important for the functional interaction between DnaA protein and CL, suggesting that this interaction is mediated by ionic interaction between these basic amino acids and the acidic moieties of CL (25Hase M.

A second potential amphipathic helix (Lys-327 to Ile-344), adjacent to the first, has also been demonstrated to be involved in the membrane binding activity of DnaA protein (27Yamaguchi Y. Hase M. Makise M. Mima S. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we have identified Arg-328 in the second amphipathic helix (Lys-327 to Ile-344) as playing an important role in the functional interaction between the DnaA protein and CL. We propose that a possible molecular mechanism for how acidic phospholipids decrease the affinity of DnaA protein for adenine nucleotides is that the interaction of such phospholipids with two basic amino acids (Arg-328 and Lys-372) of DnaA protein causes a conformational change of this protein's ATP-binding pocket. A crude extract for an oriCcomplementation assay was prepared from the WM433 strain of E. coli as previously described (28Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). CL was purchased from Sigma. [α-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) and [3H]ADP (40 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and DuPont, respectively. The mutant DnaA protein and the wild-type DnaA protein were purified, as described previously (29Kubota T. Katayama T. Ito Y. Mizushima T. Sekimizu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis was performed using the method described by Kunkel (30Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Briefly, uracil-containing single-stranded DNA of the M13 phage, containing the coding region of the dnaA gene, was hybridized with oligonucleotide primers representing each mutation (Fig. 1). The complementary DNA strand was synthesized in vitro, and the resultant double-stranded DNA was introduced into E. coli JM109 cells. The mutation was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing, and double-stranded DNA containing the mutation was prepared. To construct the plasmid for overproduction of each mutant DnaA protein, the EcoRI-HindIII region of the double-stranded DNA was ligated with pMZ001 plasmid (10Mizushima T. Nishida S. Kurokawa K. Katayama T. Miki T. Sekimizu K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3724-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which contains the arabinose promoter. To construct the plasmid for complementation analysis of the mutantdnaA gene, we introduced the coding regions of the mutantdnaA gene (BamHI-HindIII fragments of the double-stranded DNA) into pMZ002, which contains the wild-type promoter of the dnaA gene (10Mizushima T. Nishida S. Kurokawa K. Katayama T. Miki T. Sekimizu K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3724-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The stimulation of ATP or ADP release from DnaA·ATP or DNA·ADP complexes by CL was examined as described previously (18Mizushima T. Ishikawa Y. Obana E. Hase M. Kubota T. Katayama T. Kunitake T. Watanabe E. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3633-3638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, CL liposomes were prepared from dried phospholipids on the bottom of glass tubes through vigorous vortex mixing in water. The amount of phosphorus in the phospholipid fraction was determined using the method described by Chen et al. (31Chen Jr., P.S. Tpribata T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 18: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5837) Google Scholar). DnaA·ATP or DNA·ADP complexes were formed by incubation of DnaA with 1 μm [α-32P]ATP or [3H]ADP in 40 μl of buffer G (50 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.3 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 17% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm ammonium sulfate, and 0.005% Triton X-100) at 0 °C for 15 min. CL was added, and the mixture was further incubated at 37 °C. Samples were passed through nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore HA, 0.45 μm) and washed with ice-cold buffer G. The radioactivity remaining on the filter was counted with a liquid scintillation counter. The ATP or ADP binding activity of DnaA protein was determined by a filter binding assay (7Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). DnaA protein (2 pmol) was incubated with various concentrations of [α-32P]ATP or [3H]ADP at 0 °C for 15 min in 40 μl of buffer G. Samples were passed through nitrocellulose membranes and counted as described above. Inhibition of ATP binding to DnaA protein by CL was examined as described previously (32Hase M. Ishikawa Y. Sekimizu K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). DnaA protein (2 pmol) was preincubated with CL at 0 °C for 5 min and further incubated with 1 μm[α-32P]ATP at 0 °C for 15 min in 40 μl of buffer G. The amount of bound ATP was determined as described above. Replication of minichromosomes in a crude extract (Fraction II) was assayed as described previously (28Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Template DNA (M13E10) (200 ng, 600 pmol of nucleotides), 200 μg of Fraction II from WM433 (dnaA204), and DnaA protein were incubated in reaction mixtures (28Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by chilling on ice and the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were passed through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters. The amount of radioactivity on the filters was measured with a liquid scintillation counter, and the amount of synthesized DNA (picomoles of nucleotides) was then calculated. To reveal DnaA protein's functional membrane-binding domain, we constructed a series of mutant DnaA proteins using site-directed mutagenesis and examined their functional interaction with CL (25Hase M. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Ohba A. Guo L. Mima S. Makise M. Yamaguchi Y. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28651-28656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Makise M. Mima S. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 340: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We identified two mutant DnaA proteins, with a triple substitution for Glu of Arg-360, Arg-364, and Lys-372 (DnaA431), and Arg-328, Arg-334, and Arg-342 (DnaA433), which showed a decreased ability to interact with CL (25Hase M. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Ohba A. Guo L. Mima S. Makise M. Yamaguchi Y. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28651-28656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Yamaguchi Y. Hase M. Makise M. Mima S. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest not only that two potential amphipathic helixes (Lys-327 to Ile-344 and Asp-357 to Val-374) are important in the functional interaction between DnaA and CL, but also that this interaction is mediated by ionic interaction between these basic amino acids and acidic moieties of CL. In relation to the potential amphipathic helix (Asp-357 to Val-374), we previously identified Lys-372 to be the most important amino acid of this helix for interaction by constructing three mutant dnaAgenes, each with a single mutation (dnaAR360E,dnaAR364E, or dnaAK372E) (26Makise M. Mima S. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4513-4518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we tried to identify an additional amino acid in the second potential amphipathic helix (Lys-327 to Ile-344), which was important for functional interaction between DnaA protein and CL. We again constructed three mutant dnaA genes, each with a single mutation, as shown in Fig. 1. The coding region of each mutant dnaA gene was conjugated with the promoter of the arabinose operon to construct a plasmid that overproduced the mutated DnaA protein (DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, DnaAR342E, or DnaA433). To avoid contamination of the purified fraction of the mutant DnaA protein with wild-type DnaA protein, the KA450 strain (ΔoriC1071::Tn10, rnhA199(Am),dnaA17(Am), trpE9828(Am), tyrA(Am),thr, ilv, and thyA) of E. coli was used for overproduction of the proteins. Viability was not dependent on the function of DnaA protein in the KA450 strain. The addition of 1% arabinose caused significant overproduction of each mutant DnaA protein (data not shown). Purification of each mutant DnaA protein was done through ammonium precipitation, precipitation by dialysis, and gel-filtration column chromatography, as described previously (29Kubota T. Katayama T. Ito Y. Mizushima T. Sekimizu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All mutant DnaA proteins were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2), with approximately the same recoveries (6–9%) as for the wild-type protein (6%). The purity of each mutant DnaA protein was more than 90%, judging by densitometric scanning of the gel (Fig. 2). The migration of DnaA433 was a little slower than for other proteins, as was also the case for DnaA431 (26Makise M. Mima S. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4513-4518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Any decrease in DnaA protein's affinity for adenine nucleotides caused by CL was monitored both by CL stimulation of the release of ADP (or ATP) from DnaA protein and by CL inhibition of the ATP (or ADP) binding activity of DnaA protein (15Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore necessary for the mutant DnaA proteins in this study to maintain their ATP or ADP binding activities to examine their functional interaction with acidic phospholipids. The ATP binding activities of these mutant proteins were examined using a filter binding assay (7Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and a Scatchard plot analysis. As shown in Fig.3, each mutant DnaA protein demonstrated ATP binding activity. The K d values of DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, DnaAR342E, DnaA433, and the wild-type protein for ATP were determined to be 77, 101, 78, 127, and 57 nm, respectively. The number of ATP-binding sites per DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, DnaAR342E, DnaA433, and the wild-type protein was calculated to be 0.38, 0.28, 0.30, 0.24, and 0.44, respectively. The K d value and the number of ATP-binding sites for the wild-type protein were nearly the same as reported previously (7Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We also examined the ADP binding activity of these mutant DnaA proteins in the same manner. As shown in Fig. 4, each of the mutant DnaA proteins also demonstrated ADP binding activity. The K d values of DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, DnaAR342E, DnaA433, and the wild-type protein for ADP were determined to be 135, 151, 151, 184, and 184 nm, respectively. The number of ADP-binding sites for DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, DnaAR342E, DnaA433, and the wild-type protein was calculated to be 0.31, 0.38, 0.30, 0.22, and 0.60, respectively. The K d value and the number of ADP-binding sites for the wild-type protein were nearly the same as reported previously (7Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Because all the mutant DnaA proteins in this study showed both ATP and ADP binding activity, their functional interactions with acidic phospholipids could be examined by monitoring either CL-dependent stimulation of the release of ATP (or ADP) from DnaA protein or CL-dependent inhibition of ADP (or ATP) binding activity of DnaA protein. The observed slight, but significant, effects of these mutations, especially R334E, on the number of ATP- or ADP-binding sites suggests that this helix (Lys-327 to Ile-344) contributes to the adenine nucleotide binding activity of DnaA protein (see “Discussion”). We previously reported that the ATP binding activity of DnaA433 was found to be less inhibited by CL, suggesting that some of the mutations in DnaA433 affected the functional interaction between DnaA and CL (27Yamaguchi Y. Hase M. Makise M. Mima S. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we therefore compared the CL inhibition curve for ATP binding obtained for each single mutation mutant DnaA protein (DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, and DnaAR342E) with that of DnaA433 or the wild-type protein, to identify which of these amino acids was important for this functional interaction. DnaA protein was preincubated with CL and further incubated with [α-32P]ATP. The amount of bound ATP was determined using a filter binding assay. As shown in Fig.5, DnaAR328E was found to be more resistant to CL-dependent inhibition of ATP binding than the wild-type protein, as was DnaA433. The inhibition curve for DnaA433 was much the same as reported previously (27Yamaguchi Y. Hase M. Makise M. Mima S. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the CL inhibition curve for ATP binding to DnaAR334E or DnaAR342E was much the same as that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 5). These results suggest that Arg-328 is the most important of these three basic amino acids located in the amphipathic helix (Lys-327 to Ile-344) for functional interaction of DnaA protein with CL. We also examined the functional interaction between each mutant DnaA protein and CL by monitoring the release of ADP from DnaA protein in the presence or absence of CL. The activation of ADP-bound DnaA protein by CL is mediated by CL stimulation of ADP release from DnaA protein (15Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DnaA·[3H]ADP complex was incubated with CL at 37 °C, and the remaining ADP-bound DnaA protein was determined by a filter binding assay. The k app (apparent rate constant) can be calculated from the slope of the resultant graph (Fig.6 A). Thek app values for DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, DnaAR342E, DnaA433, and the wild-type protein, in the absence of CL, were 2.2 × 10−4, 6.0 × 10−4, 2.2 × 10−4, 1.4 × 10−3, and 2.4 × 10−4 (s−1), respectively. Thek app values for DnaAR328E and DnaAR342E in the absence of CL were nearly the same as that for the wild-type protein, suggesting that both the DnaAR328E- and DnaAR342E-ADP complexes are stable at 37 °C. In contrast, the DnaA433-ADP complex was unstable at 37 °C, even in the absence of CL, as reported previously (27Yamaguchi Y. Hase M. Makise M. Mima S. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DnaAR334E·ADP complex was found to be partly unstable, suggesting that Arg-334 is involved in the ADP binding activity of DnaA protein (see “Discussion”). The k app values for DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, DnaAR342E, DnaA433, and the wild-type protein, in the presence of CL, were 1.4 × 10−3, 2.2 × 10−3, 1.8 × 10−3, 1.7 × 10−3, and 3.4 × 10−3(s−1), respectively. Compared with the wild-type protein, CL stimulation of ADP release from DnaAR328E and DnaAR342E was found to be less, suggesting that these amino acids contributed to the functional interaction between DnaA protein and CL. We further examined the effect of various concentrations of CL on the release of ADP from DnaA328, DnaAR342E, and the wild-type protein (Fig. 6 B). DnaAR328E showed the lowest CL stimulation of ADP release (Fig.6 B), again suggesting that Arg-328 is the most important of the three basic amino acids in the amphipathic helix (Lys-327 to Ile-344) for the functional interaction between DnaA protein and CL. The ADP·DnaA433 and ADP·DnaAR334E complexes were unstable in the presence of CL at high temperatures (Fig. 6 A). We also examined the effect of CL on the release of ATP from these DnaA proteins, in the same way (Fig. 7). The results were basically the same as those obtained in relation to ADP (Fig. 6 A). The k app values for DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, DnaAR342E, DnaA433, and the wild-type protein, in the absence of CL, were 3.2 × 10−4, 7.3 × 10−4, 2.5 × 10−4, 1.7 × 10−3, and 1.6 × 10−4(s−1), respectively. The k appvalues for DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, DnaAR342E, DnaA433, the wild-type protein, in the presence of CL, were 7.5 × 10−4, 2.8 × 10−3, 7.3 × 10−4, 2.6 × 10−3, and 2.1 × 10−3(s−1), respectively. We measured DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, DnaAR342E, DnaA433, and the wild-type protein's ability to initiate oriC DNA replication using anoriC complementation assay in a crude extract (28Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, both DnaAR328E and DnaAR342E supported oriC DNA replication in vitro. The specific activities of DnaAR328E and DnaAR342E, and of the wild-type protein, were found to be 0.22, 0.09, and 0.38 × 106units/mg of protein, respectively (1 unit of protein promotes the incorporation of 1 pmol of nucleotides/min at 30 °C). DnaAR334E showed no oriC DNA replication activity, and neither did DnaA433 (Fig. 8), as reported previously (27Yamaguchi Y. Hase M. Makise M. Mima S. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 433-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of DNA replication activity observed in DnaA433 may be due to the R334E mutation. One possible explanation for this and for the results obtained in relation to DnaAR334E, is the low stability of their complexes with ATP at high temperatures (Fig. 7). They may be unable to form the ATP-bound form long enough to initiate oriC DNA replication. DnaAA184V, DnaA46 and DnaA5 required longer incubation periods for expression of their replication activity; however, a time lag for the DNA replication reaction has been previously reported for these mutant DnaA proteins (33Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For these last mutants, the time course of DNA replication was approximately linear, as was the case for the wild-type protein (data not shown). We used plasmid complementation analysis with temperature-sensitivednaA mutants to examine the DNA replication activities of these mutant DnaA proteins in vivo. The coding regions of these mutant dnaA genes, and of the wild-type, were conjugated with the wild-type dnaA promoter on pMZ002 (10Mizushima T. Nishida S. Kurokawa K. Katayama T. Miki T. Sekimizu K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3724-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Each resultant plasmid was introduced into a high-temperature-sensitivednaA46 mutant (KS1003) (34Mizushima T. Yokoyama K. Mima S. Tsuchiya T. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21195-21200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with mutations in the ATP-binding site, and incubations were performed at 42 or 30 °C. As shown in Table I, the ratio of colony formation efficiency at 42 °C to that at 30 °C of pMZ002 with both dnaAR328E and dnaAR342E was found to be ∼1, as was the case with the wild-type gene, suggesting that these mutant DnaA proteins were able to initiate oriC DNA replication in cells. We then performed the same experiments using a high-temperature-sensitive dnaA508 mutant (KS1007) (34Mizushima T. Yokoyama K. Mima S. Tsuchiya T. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21195-21200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with a mutation in DnaA protein's N-terminal region. The results were similar to those obtained with the dnaA46 mutant (data not shown). This would appear to rule out the possibility that these mutant DnaA proteins (DnaAR328E and DnaAR342E) become active by cooperating with the DnaA46 protein at 42 °C. The colony sizes and growth rates obtained with the temperature-sensitive dnaA mutants carrying pMZ002 with dnaAR328E or dnaAR342E were indistinguishable from those of cells carrying pMZ002 with the wild-type dnaA gene (data not shown). Thus, we consider that DnaAR328E protein, which shows a decreased activity for interaction with CL in vitro, is able to initiate DNA replication in cells.Table IComplementation analysis of temperature sensitivity of a dnaA46 mutant with plasmids carrying the mutant dnaA genesClonesColony formation efficiency (42 °C/30 °C)pMZ002 (vector)6.9 × 10−6pMZ002/dnaA+9.8 × 10−1pMZ002/dnaAR328E1.0pMZ002/dnaAR334E3.7 × 10−7pMZ002/dnaAR342E1.2pMZ002/dnaA4332.4 × 10−7KS1003 (dnaA46) cells were transformed with pMZ002 containing either the wild-type or each mutant dnaA gene.

Plates were incubated at 42 °C or 30 °C for 12 and 24 h, respectively, the number of colonies was counted, and the colony formation efficiency was determined. Ratios of colony formation efficiency, at 42 °C to that at 30 °C, are shown. Open table in a new tab KS1003 (dnaA46) cells were transformed with pMZ002 containing either the wild-type or each mutant dnaA gene. Cultures were diluted appropriately and spread on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Plates were incubated at 42 °C or 30 °C for 12 and 24 h, respectively, the number of colonies was counted, and the colony formation efficiency was determined. Ratios of colony formation efficiency, at 42 °C to that at 30 °C, are shown. In contrast, the mutant dnaA genes encoding DnaAR334E or DnaA433 could not complement the temperature sensitivities of both thednaA46 and dnaA508 mutants (Table I and data not shown). It would therefore appear that these two mutant DnaA proteins are defective for oriC DNA replication activity bothin vitro and in vivo. DnaA433, a mutant DnaA protein with three mutations (R328E, R334E, and R342E), shows two important defects. One such defect is in its functional interaction with acidic phospholipids, such as CL, and the other is a defect in oriC DNA replication. In this study, we constructed three mutant DnaA proteins, each with a single amino acid mutation (DnaAR328E, DnaAR334E, and DnaAR342E), and we demonstrated that DnaAR328E shows decreased functional interaction activity with CL and that DnaAR334E has a defect in oriC DNA replication bothin vitro and in vivo. We have therefore concluded that the defects described for the DnaA433 mutant in relation to CL interaction and oriC DNA replication are due to the R328E and R334E mutations, respectively. DnaA protein belongs to the AAA+ (ATPasesassociated with a variety of cellularactivities) family (35Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence alignment analysis of various AAA+ family proteins have revealed a number of conserved domains (35Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sensor 2 domain is thought to be important for the adenine nucleotide binding and ATPase activities of AAA+ family proteins (35Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA polymerase III δ′ and γ′ subunits also belong to the AAA+ family (35Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The γ′ subunit, but not the δ′ subunit, has both ATPase and adenine nucleotide binding activities. X-ray structure analysis of the DNA polymerase III δ′ subunit has suggested that defects of the δ′ subunit in relation to both these activities are partly due to the loss of an arginine amino acid (corresponding to Arg-215 in the sensor 2 domain of the γ′ subunit), which is conserved among various AAA+ family proteins (36Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). X-ray structure analysis of theE. coli HslU protein, which also belongs to the AAA+ family, further suggested that the conserved arginine of this protein (Arg-393) can interact with the β and γ phosphates of ATP (37Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Arg-334 of DnaA protein corresponds to this arginine (35Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From these previous studies, we predicted that DnaAR334E would have a defect in its adenine nucleotide binding activity. In fact, both the ATP·DnaAR334E and ADP·DnaAR334E complexes were unstable at higher temperatures when compared with the wild-type protein (Figs. 6 and 7). We have therefore concluded that the Arg-334 amino acid of DnaA protein is important for the protein's interaction with adenine nucleotides, as is the case for other AAA+family proteins. We previously reported that Lys-372 is the most important of the potential amphipathic helix (Asp-357 to Val-374) amino acids in the functional interaction between DnaA and CL. In this study, we further found that Arg-328 is the most important amino acid of the second potential amphipathic helix (Lys-327 to Ile-344) for this interaction. We have therefore concluded that DnaA protein may interact with CL through ionic interactions between the acidic moieties of CL and these two basic amino acids. Interestingly, Arg-334 (see above) is located between these two basic amino acids. Based on these facts, we have considered a possible model for the mechanism by which acidic phospholipids decrease the affinity of DnaA protein for ADP (Fig.9). In this model, we predict that CL binding to Arg-328 and Lys-372 causes a conformational change of the potential amphipathic helix (Lys-327 to Ile-344). This conformational change may in turn interfere with Arg-334's ability to interact with the β phosphate of ADP, resulting in the stimulation of ADP release from the DnaA·ADP complex. To examine the role played by membrane binding of DnaA protein inoriC DNA replication in cells, it was useful to study a mutant DnaA protein that showed decreased membrane binding activity but normal DNA replication activity. DnaAK372E is such a mutant that has been previously described (26Makise M. Mima S. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4513-4518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we added DnaAR328E to mutant DnaA proteins showing decreased membrane binding activity and normal DNA replication activity. If acidic phospholipids activate DnaA protein in vivo, as discussed above, these mutant DnaA proteins would be inactive in cells. Because acidic phospholipids inhibited in vitro DNA replication under some conditions (15Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is also possible that acidic phospholipids negatively regulate the activity of DnaA protein. In this case, these mutant DnaA proteins defective in acidic phospholipids binding would be hyperactive in DNA replication activity and possibly cause lethality. As was the case for DnaAK372E, the mutant dnaA gene encoding for DnaAR328E was found to be able to normally function for DNA replication in vivo, which would suggest that the regulation of the activity of DnaA protein by acidic phospholipids is not essential for DNA replication in cells. However, at present, the possibility that the remaining membrane interaction activities of these mutant proteins are enough to activate DnaA protein in cells cannot be dismissed. Similarly, the possibility that these mutant DnaA proteins can interact with membranes in cells through the aid of molecular chaperones cannot be overlooked. We thank Dr. Y. Ishikawa (Oita University) for his helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2139472443,"Bacteriophage T4-encoded Gp31 is a functional ortholog of the Escherichia coli GroES cochaperonin protein. Both of these proteins form transient, productive complexes with the GroEL chaperonin, required for protein folding and other related functions in the cell. However, Gp31 is specifically required, in conjunction with GroEL, for the correct folding of Gp23, the major capsid protein of T4. To better understand the interaction between GroEL and its cochaperonin cognates, we determined whether the so-called “pseudo-T-even bacteriophages” are dependent on host GroEL function and whether they also encode their own cochaperonin. Here, we report the isolation of an allele-specific mutation of bacteriophage RB49, called ε22, which permits growth on the E. coli groEL44 mutant but not on the isogenic wild type host. RB49 ε22 was used in marker rescue experiments to identify the corresponding wild type gene, which we have named cocO(cochaperonin cognate). CocO has extremely limited identity to GroES but is 34% identical and 55% similar at the protein sequence level to T4 Gp31, sharing all of the structural features of Gp31 that distinguish it from GroES. CocO can substitute for Gp31 in T4 growth and also suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the E. coli groES42 mutant. CocO's predicted mobile loop is one residue longer than that of Gp31, with the ε22 mutation resulting in a Q36R substitution in this extra residue.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both GroES and GroEL have been shown to be essential for E. coli viability under all conditions tested (6Fayet O. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Extensive structural analysis has revealed that both proteins are organized into rings with a 7-fold rotational axis (7Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar, 8Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). GroEL is arranged in two head-to-head stacked rings of seven subunits in whose central cavities various substrate proteins can bind, primarily through hydrophobic interactions (Ref. 9Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar; reviewed in Refs. 2Lorimer G.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). GroES is a heptameric ring of 10.5-kDa subunits from which mobile loops extend and interact with GroEL (10Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). A typical GroEL substrate is first captured in either of the GroEL central cavities, and the subsequent binding of ATP and GroES to the same ring (referred to as the cis ring) results in the formation of a dome-like structure over the substrate, which is now released into the GroEL cis cavity. The subsequent binding of ATP and substrate (and potentially GroES as well) in thetrans GroEL ring results in the release of GroES from thecis ring (4Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 12Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Howich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). If the substrate in the cisring is properly folded, or in a form that no longer binds GroEL, it is released into the medium, and this GroEL ring will become the newtrans ring in a new GroEL folding cycle. Houry et al. (13Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) have shown, by using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, that ∼10% of E. coli's polypeptides bind transiently to GroEL. Some of these proteins are encoded by essential genes, in agreement with the genetic observation that the groES andgroEL genes are both essential for E. coli growth (6Fayet O. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The bacteriophage T4, which is dependent on the host GroEL function for folding of its major capsid protein, Gp23, encodes its own GroES ortholog, termed Gp31. There is very little sequence similarity between GroES and Gp31 (14Keppel F. Lipinska B. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 90: 19-25Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Nivinskas R. Black L.W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 73: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), although there is a limited conservation in certain regions, most notably the mobile loop that becomes immobilized upon binding to GroEL (10Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16Koonin E.V. van der Vies S. Trends Biochem.

The functional importance of the mobile loop was first shown by sequencing mutations in groESthat blocked bacteriophage λ growth (λ requires both GroEL and GroES host functions for growth (10Landry S.J.

A. 1981; 78: 1629-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)). Similarly, T4 gene31 mutations, which allow T4 to propagate on certainE. coli groEL mutants, also affect the Gp31 mobile loop (14Keppel F. Lipinska B. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 90: 19-25Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar,19Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C. van der Vies S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 52-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Comparative studies of GroES and Gp31 have shown that while Gp31 can substitute for GroES, the reverse is not true; i.e. Gp31 can suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the E. coli groES42 mutant and can participate in the in vitrofolding of various substrates, but GroES is unable to substitute for Gp31 in T4 bacteriophage assembly, even when overproduced (21van der Vies S.M. Gatenby A.A. Georgopoulos C. Nature. 1994; 368: 654-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This may not be totally surprising, since it is likely that Gp31 evolved as a specialized ortholog of GroES that specifically folds the Gp23 substrate. Gp23 is 56 kDa, near the maximum limit allowed by the “Anfinsen cage” formed under the dome of the GroEL-GroES complex (reviewed in Refs. 3Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar and 4Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Structural studies suggest that the GroEL-Gp31 complex may result in the formation of a larger cavity under the dome of the Gp31 heptamer due to a longer mobile loop, the lack of the roof loop present in GroES, and lack of a conserved aromatic residue, which extends into the cavity of GroES (22Hunt J.F. van der Vies S.M. Henry L. Deisenhofer J. Cell. 1997; 90: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 23Richardson A. Georgopoulos C. Genetics. 1999; 4: 1449-1457Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, a large number of bacteriophages with T4-like morphology have been characterized according to their sequence homology with the classical T-even bacteriophages, T2, T4, and T6 (24Repoila F. Tétart F. Bouet J.-Y. Krisch H.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4181-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The vast majority of these bacteriophages are very closely related to T-evens at the DNA sequence level. However, a few of them have DNA sequences that differ significantly, and these have been termed “pseudo-T-even bacteriophages” (25Monod C. Repoila F. Kutateladze M. Tétard F. Krisch H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We investigated the genomes of the pseudo-T-even bacteriophages to determine whether they possess a gene encoding a homolog of either GroES or Gp31. Here, we report our findings on the bacteriophage RB49 gene 31 homolog, which we have named cocO (cochaperonincognate).

Top agar (6 g of agar/liter of LB) was used for seeding lawns with cells and/or bacteriophage. Ampicillin and tetracycline were added to the media at final concentrations of 100 or 15 μg/ml, respectively, when necessary. TSG buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4–7.5, 0.15m NaCl, 0.03% gelatin) was used for making serial dilutions of bacteriophage and for storing concentrated bacteriophage stocks. One liter of an RB49 lysate (2 × 109 pfu/ml) was concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation (34Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 85Google Scholar), followed by CsCl banding on a step gradient. The concentrated bacteriophage was dialyzed for 30 min in 500 ml 3m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, followed by two 30-min dialyses in 500 ml of 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1 mTris, pH 7.4. The dialyzed bacteriophage was treated with proteinase K, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction (34Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 85Google Scholar). The DNA was partially digested using Sau3A (New England Biolabs), and fragments of 1.5–5 kb were purified from an agarose gel. The fragments were ligated to the vector pMPMA4 (a derivative of pMPMA4Ω (32Mayer M.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 163: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) in which digestion by XbaI was used to remove the Ω fragment encoding spectinomycin resistance), which had been digested withBglII. The ligation reaction was transformed into competent DA1368 (MC1061endA::tetR)1bacteria, and transformants were selected on LB-agar-ampicillin plates at 37 °C. Cells growing exponentially at a density ofA595 = 0.1 were infected with the appropriate bacteriophage at a multiplicity of infection of 0.02 bacteriophage/bacterium. The cultures were aerated at 37 °C until lysed, ∼2 h. Chloroform was added to ensure lysis and the killing of all remaining cells. To check for wild type recombinants, 0.1 ml of the lysate was mixed with 0.3 ml of a saturated culture ofgroEL140 cells and 3 ml of molten top agar and then poured onto an LB-agar plate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight to allow plaque formation. E. coli groES42 cells were transformed with either the pcocO +34-2, p31 +, or pMPMA4 parental vector plasmids. (p31 + is a plasmid that complements the T431amNG71 mutant, which has an amber (nonsense) mutation in gene 31. The plasmid was isolated from a T4 genomic library cloned into the vector pBAD18 (33Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3933) Google Scholar).) Transformants were selected for ampicillin resistance at 30 °C. After overnight growth, two colonies from each transformation were resuspended in 100 μl of LB broth each. Three 5-fold dilutions were made of each culture. Ten μl of each dilution and the original suspension were spotted on LB-agar-ampicillin plates. The plates were incubated at 30 or 43 °C, and bacterial colony-forming ability was monitored following overnight incubation. Chain termination reactions were performed using the ThermoSequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the reactions were sequenced on a Li-Core sequencing apparatus (MWG Biotech). The primers used for sequencing and polymerase chain reaction amplification are as follows: cocO pBAD 5′, 5′-CGCAACTCTCTACTGTTAATGTAGATGGGCTGAC-3′; cocO 5′ RI/NdeI, 5′-GGAATTCATATGACCGTTAAAACTCCTAAAGC-3′;cocO 3′ XbaI, 5′-GCTC TAGAGGATATTCCCGCCGTTAAA-3′. ThecocO 5′RI/NdeI and cocO 3′XbaI primers were used to polymerase chain reaction-amplify the minimal cocO gene from wild type RB49 bacteriophage. The product was cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pMPM201 vector under the regulation of the PBADpromoter as previously described (32Mayer M.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 163: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was named pFScocO +. The cocOε22 allele was cloned in the same manner, using RB49 cocOε22 DNA as template, resulting in plasmid pFScocOε22. Six 1.5-liter cultures inoculated with DA1368 bacteria containing plasmid pFScocO + were grown in LB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Synthesis of CocO was induced atA600 ∼0.6 with 0.02% arabinose for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 15% (v/v) glycerol. The pellet was stored at −20 °C and gently thawed before lysis. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by two passes through a French press at 1,000 p.s.i. The following steps are adapted from the purification procedure used for Gp31 (21van der Vies S.M. Gatenby A.A. Georgopoulos C. Nature. 1994; 368: 654-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After removal of the debris by low speed centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g), followed by ultracentrifugation for 60 min at 145,000 × g, the supernatant was fractionated by a streptomycin sulfate (5% of 25% (w/v)) precipitation. The CocO-containing supernatant was further fractionated by a 35% (w/v) ammonium sulfate precipitation. Again, CocO remained in the supernatant. CocO was dialyzed into buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and applied to a Q-Sepharose column, which binds acidic proteins. Because of its neutral pI, CocO eluted in the flow-through. After a 70% (w/v) ammonium sulfate precipitation, CocO was resuspended and dialyzed into buffer C (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) and loaded onto an hydroxyapatite column to which a 20 mm to 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, gradient was applied. CocO eluted at ∼0.2 m sodium phosphate. After exchanging into buffer D (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), final impurities were removed by gel filtration (Hiload 16/60 Superdex G200 on a Waters HPLC). CocO eluted at 16 min, suggesting an approximate native molecular mass of 80,000 Da. Purification of the mutant CocOε22 protein was executed following its overproduction from plasmid pFScocOε22, using the exact steps described for the wild type protein. The procedure for chaperonin-dependent renaturation of pig heart citrate synthase has been described previously (35Zhi W. Srere P.A. Evans C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9281-9286Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, citrate synthase at 33 μm was denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mmEDTA for 30 min at 25 °C. Denatured citrate synthase was diluted to 0.2 μm into a renaturation mix containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm oxaloacetic acid and various combinations of the chaperonins at 4.2 μm (concentration given for monomers) as indicated under “Results.” The refolding reactions were performed at 27 °C in a total volume of 400 μl, and citrate synthase activity was measured after 60 min. The enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the decrease in absorption at 232 nm due to the cleavage of acetyl CoA and the utilization of oxaloacetic acid. Both polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA hybridization experiments with the pseudo-T-even bacteriophage RB49 suggested that this bacteriophage has no gene31 homolog with significant DNA sequence similarity to the T4 gene (data not shown). Thus, we determined if RB49 growth is dependent on the host GroEL and GroES functions. We found that, like bacteriophage T4, bacteriophage RB49 is totally dependent on theE. coli GroEL function for successful completion of its life cycle but is not dependent on GroES function. TableII shows that wild type RB49, which plates with an efficiency of 1.0 on the wild type host, does not form plaques on either the E. coli groEL44 or groEL515 mutant hosts but does propagate on the groEL140 andgroES42 hosts. Since bacteriophage T4 plaques normally ongroEL515, it appears that RB49 is more sensitive to thein vivo biological effects of this mutation.Table IIPlating properties of various bacteriophages on various bacterial hosts at 37 and 42 °CCG3014 wild typeCG3010groEL44CG3009groEL515CG3012groEL140DA1415 groES4237 °C42 °C37 °C42 °C37 °C42 °C37 °C42 °C37 °C42 °CRB49++−−−+++++RB49ɛ22−+++−−−+−+T4Do++−−++++++T431ɛ1+++−−−++++Each of the indicated bacterial strains was seeded in molten top agar on LB-agar plates.

In analogy with the isolation of the bacteriophage T431ε1 mutant (23Richardson A. Georgopoulos C. Genetics. 1999; 4: 1449-1457Crossref Google Scholar, 31Georgopoulos C. Hendrix R.W. Kaiser A.D.

One such isolate, RB49 ε22, forms wild type-size plaques on the E. coli groEL44 mutant host at 37° (Table II). It was found that RB49 ε22 cannot form plaques on either wild type, groEL140, orgroES42 hosts at 37 °C; however, it does form plaques on these same hosts at 42 °C. For comparison, we include the T4 mutant T4 31ε1 in Table II, which was originally isolated as a spontaneous plaque former on groEL44 (31Georgopoulos C. Hendrix R.W. Kaiser A.D. Wood W.B. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 239: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Previous analysis has shown that the T4 31ε1 mutation results in an L35I substitution in the middle of the mobile loop of Gp31 (14Keppel F. Lipinska B. Ang D. Georgopoulos C.

We obtained further evidence for a Gp31 homolog in RB49 by showing that the T4 gene 31 product complements the ε22 mutation (TableIII), allowing bacteriophage RB49 ε22 growth on the restricting E. coli wild type host at 37 °C. In contrast, a plasmid overexpressing both the E. coli groEL and groES wild type genes does not complement the ε22 mutation (data not shown). Earlier results had shown that overproduction of groES also does not complement the T431ε1 defect (21van der Vies S.M. Gatenby A.A. Georgopoulos C.

The CR63 strain carries thesupD suppressor, enabling bacteriophages that carry amber (am; nonsense) mutations to plaque. To identify the RB49 gene where the ε22 mutation resides, we constructed an RB49 DNA library in the multicopy plasmid pMPMA4. Although the construction of the RB49 DNA library was initiated with ∼1.5–5.0-kb-long DNA fragments, the resulting library was enriched in small DNA insert fragments, probably because of the toxicity of many of the RB49 DNA sequences in E. coli. We transformed the entire library into the E. coli groEL44 mutant, which is permissive for RB49 ε22 and used this library in a marker rescue scheme. Since it was unclear whether the wild type clone corresponding to ε22 would be underrepresented in our RB49 DNA library, we started with an initial pool of ∼105independent groEL44 transformants obtained with plasmid DNA purified from the original amplified library (itself consisting of ∼106 independent clones). This pool was divided into 45 groups each containing ∼2,000 transformants and allowed to amplify. RB49 ε22 was grown on these 45 groups of transformants, and 0.1 ml of each lysate was plated on the nonpermissive groEL140 mutant strain at 37 °C (Table II) to detect the presence of RB49 wild type recombinants or revertants. Whereas most of the transformant pools gave fewer than 20 plaques per plate, five of them gave significantly higher numbers, ranging from 50 to 200. The marker rescue scheme was repeated (five independent lysates each) for two of these pools, confirming that the elevated number of plaque formers (putative wild type recombinants) was not due to statistical fluctuation. One of these pools was chosen for further screening and, by repeating the marker rescue experiment with progressively smaller pools of transformants (250, 10, and finally individual transformants), we progressively obtained higher frequencies of RB"

Abnormalities in the expression, structure, or activity of proto-oncogene products contribute to the development and the pathogenesis of cancer. For example, thehuman epidermal growth factorreceptor (HER1)1is overexpressed in a number of epithelial tumor cells (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). HER2, the second member of the HER family, shares extensive sequence homology with the tyrosine kinase domain of HER1 (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar, 2Hynes N.C. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) and is overexpressed and/or amplified in a number of human malignancies, including breast, ovarian, colon, lung, prostate, and cervical cancers. Recently, HER3 and HER4 have been added to the family, as they share sequence homology with the tyrosine kinase domain of HER1 (2Hynes N.C. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Regulation of these receptor family members is complex, and they can be transactivated in a ligand-dependent manner. For example, binding of heregulin-β1 (HRG) to HER3 or HER4 can activate HER2 receptor as a result of HER2/HER3 or HER4/HER2 heterodimeric interactions (3Zhang K. Sun J. Liu N. Wen D. Chang D.

Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). HER1 and HER2 have been shown to induce transformation in recipient cell, possibly because of excessive activation of signal transduction pathways. In contrast, transformation by HER3 or HER4 requires the presence of HER1 or HER2 (3Zhang K. Sun J. Liu N. Wen D. Chang D. Thomas A. Yoshinaga S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3884-3890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Since growth factors regulate the proliferation of cancer cells by activating receptors on the surface of the cells, one approach to controlling cell proliferation is to use anti-receptor blocking monoclonal antibodies that interfere with growth factor receptor-mediated autocrine/paracrine growth stimulation. The humanized antibody C225 against the EGF receptor (EGFR) blocks binding of ligand and prevents ligand-induced activation of receptor tyrosine kinase (5Kawamoto T. Sato J.D. Le A. Polikoff J.

C225 is currently being used in phase IIA multicenter clinical trials alone and in combination with chemotherapy or radiation to treat to patients with head and neck, lung, or prostate carcinomas (7Mendelsohn J.

Anti-receptor antibodies are known to inhibit many processes, including mitogenesis, cell cycle progression, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, and DNA repair. Mitogenic growth factors stimulate protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Polypeptide elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that plays a key role in the elongation cycle during translation. EF-1α forms a complex with aminoacyl-tRNA and GTP that transfers the aminoacyl-tRNA group to the 80 S ribosome and hydrolyzes GTP (13Riis B. Rattan A.I.S. Clark B.F.C. Merrick W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 420-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). EF-1α is also involved in cytoskeleton reorganization (14Dharmawardhane S. Demma M. Yang F. Condeelis J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,15Okazaki K. Yumura S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 75-81PubMed Google Scholar) and proliferation (16Sanders J. Maassen J. Moller W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5907-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It can regulate embryogenesis (17Kreig P. Varnus S. Worminton W. Melton D. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), actin bundling, and microtubule severing and is associated with the centrosome and mitotic machinery (14Dharmawardhane S. Demma M.

Nature. 1990; 347: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). EF-1α is also one of the actin-associated activators of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, which regulates the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (20Yang W. Burkhart W. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These phospholipids regulate the capping of actin filaments by actin-binding protein (18Condeelis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 169-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In brief, EF-1α regulates cellular functions that are both dependent on and independent of translational controls. Next only to actin, EF-1α is the most abundant protein in normal cells, accounting for 1–2% of total protein. Regulation of its levels may be important for normal cell function; rapidly growing cells usually exhibit a large increase in their EF-1α mRNA levels (21Sanders J. Brandsma M. Janssen G.M.C. Dijk J. Moller W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); overexpression of EF-1α correlates with metastasis (22Taniguchi S. Miyamoto S. Sadano H. Kobayashi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 19: 6949Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar); and EF-1α mRNA levels decrease during murine erythroleukemic cell differentiation (23Roth W.W. Braff P.W. Corrias M.V. Reddy N.S. Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3929-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). EF-1α expression can be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (24Loreni F. Francesconi A. Amaldi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4721-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Jefferies H.B.J. Thomas G. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4367-4372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EF-1α mRNA levels have been shown to be up-regulated by oncogenes and induced by phytohemagglutinin in human blood lymphocytes (22Taniguchi S. Miyamoto S. Sadano H. Kobayashi H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 19: 6949Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Koch I. Hofschneider P.H. Lottspeich F. Eckerskorn C. Koshy R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of EF-1α in fibroblasts leads to increased susceptibility to oncogenic transformation (27Tatsuka M. Mitsui H. Wada M. Nagata A. Nojima H. Okayama H. Nature. 1992; 359: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition to its predominant cytoplasmic presence, EF-1α has been reported in the nucleus (28Billaut-Mulot O. Fernandez-Gomez R. Loyens M. Ouaissi A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) where it binds to RNA polymerase (29Das T. Mathur M. Gupta A.K. Janssen G.M.C. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, EF-1α has been shown to be physically associated with the novel zinc finger protein ZPR1 in A-431 cells and to be translocated to the nucleus in an EGF-dependent manner (30Gangwani L. Mikrut M. Galcheva-Gargova Z. Davis R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin can regulate translational elongation activity of EF-1α by regulating its phosphorylation by multipotential S6 kinase (31Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 33Chang Y-W.E. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28252-28257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Yet, despite knowledge of these cellular functions, the possible regulation of EF-1α by the EGF family of growth factors and by therapeutic anti-receptor antibodies remains unexplored. To identify genes whose expression may be down-regulated by anti-receptor blocking antibodies, presumably owing to ligand-induced activation of receptor tyrosine kinase and/or interference of receptor-associated functions, we used differential display approach to isolate differentially expressed cDNAs. We report that one of these clones had 100% identity with human elongation factor-1α (EF-1α). Both EGF and HRG induced EF-1α promoter activity and mRNA and protein expression that could be effectively blocked by pretreatment with anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies. Our results also suggest involvement of specific signaling pathways in the base-line regulation of EF-1α transcription. In addition, we also provide new evidence to suggest that HRG stimulation of EF-1α promoter requires the SP1 site and that the EF-1α promoter undergoes histone acetylation in response to HRG.

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was digested with RNase-free DNase (Promega) and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase reaction containing 200 ng of total RNA using four different degenerate anchored oligo(dT) primer set (dT12VA, dT12VG, dT12VC, dT12VT; Operon Technologies Inc.). Reactions were performed in a 20-μl volume using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Amplification of cDNA fragments was performed using 2 μl of the cDNA in reaction buffer containing 2 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 10 μCi of α-35S-dATP, dNTPs (2 μm), 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the same 3′-degenerate oligo(dT) primer, and 1 of the 10 5′-orbitary decamers (OP-26–01 to OP-26–10, Operon Technology, Inc.). PCR cycles were as follows: denaturation 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 30 s with a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and developed by autoradiography. Bands of interest were excised, extracted, and reamplified with same set of primers. Amplified DNA was separated on an agarose gel, and bands were purified and cloned into PCR2.1 vector using Topocloning kit (Invitrogen). Five to ten independent clones were isolated, miniprepared, and sequenced at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Core facility. Sequences were compared with GenBankTMsequences using BLAST search. Construction of deletion constructs pEF (construct numbers 1–7) was described (37Nielsen S.J. Praestegaard M. Jorgensen H.F. Clark B.F.C. Biochem.

The mutations in construct 9 were made using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions. To prepare cell extracts, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 mm NaVO5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 15 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the appropriate antibodies. An equal number of cells were metabolically labeled for 4–8 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in methionine-free medium containing 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum in the absence or presence of indicated treatments. Cell extracts containing equal trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were immunoprecipitated with the desired antibody, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed (34Kumar R. Mandal M. Lipton A. Harvey H. Thompson C.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1215-1219PubMed Google Scholar). Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 20 μg of RNA was analyzed by Northern hybridization using a 1.8-kilobase pair cDNA fragment of human EF1-α. rRNA (28 S and 18 S) was used to assess the integrity of the RNA, and for RNA loading and transfer control, the blots were routinely reprobed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. Cells were split in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) 24 h before transfection. Subconfluent cells were transiently transfected with pEFΔ1090CATSp1 or with other constructs as needed or control pSVb-Gal vector using LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 5 h of transfection, medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum. After 24 h, cultures were shifted to 0% serum (for growth factor treatment) or 2% serum (for antibody treatment) for 12 h before harvesting. CAT activity was measured 48 h after transfection using a CAT assay kit (Promaga) (39Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Talukder A. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7253-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). When indicated, cells were treated with HRG or EGF (30-ng/ml medium) or herceptin or C225 (50 nm final concentration). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 20 μm PD098059 (a MEK inhibitor), 20 μm SB203580 (a p38MAPKinhibitor), and 20 μm LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) for 1 h before HRG treatment. Each experiment was repeated two to five times and transfection efficiency varied between 30 and 50%. MCF-7 cells were split in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon). About 70% confluent dishes were serum-starved for 24 h followed by overnight treatment with HRG (30 ng/ml). Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was done as described previously (40Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 41Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 42Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Approximately 106 cells were treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link histones to DNA. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed and sonicated as described (40Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Sonicated lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatant was diluted 10-fold by dilution buffer containing 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A portion (1%) of the chromatin solution was kept to check the amount of input DNA in different samples before immunoprecipitation. Chromatin solutions were precleared with 80 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (60 mg/ml) saturated with salmon sperm DNA and bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C before immunoprecipitating with either anti-acetylated histone H3 or anti-acetylated H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes were recovered with 60 μl of protein A- Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed as described (40Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) on a rotating platform before eluting the immunocomplexes by incubation with 400 μl of 1% SDS containing 0.1 mNaHCO3. The elution was heated to 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-links. Phenol/chloroform extraction was performed, and the supernatant was ethanol-precipitated (using 20 μg of glycogen as an inert carrier). DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Quantitative PCR was done with 10 μl of DNA sample restricted to 25 cycles. The EF-1α DNA sequence of the 5′ primer was 5′ GATTTGTCCCGGACTAGCGAG and of the 3′ primer was 5′ TCTTCTCCACCTCAGTGATGACG 3′. The PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. In an attempt to identify genes whose expression may be modulated in human cancer cells by anti-receptor blocking antibodies, total RNA was isolated from two highly invasive human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB435 and MDA-MB231, and treated with or without C225 and herceptin for 10 h. Although MDA-MB435 and MDA-MB231 cells have normal levels of EGFR and HER2, the in vitro invasive properties of these cells were inhibited by herceptin and C225 (43Kumar R. Mandal M Vadlamudi R. et al.Semin. Oncol. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 160 reactions was performed using four 3′-degenerate oligo(dT) primers and 10 5′-random primers for each antibody treatment. Analysis of gels showed amplification of a number of bands ranging from 100 to 600 base pairs, and the majorities of the bands were of equal intensity. By using these bands as internal control, we analyzed for the bands with differences in intensity in C225- or herceptin-treated lanes. This analysis resulted in the identification of five differentially expressed gene products ranging in size from 120 to 350 base pairs. A representative portion of the gel is shown in Fig.1 A. Each differentially expressed gene product was amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The resulting sequence was compared with sequences deposited in GenBankTM. For each gene product five clones were sequenced, and all five sequences from one band were 100% identical to human elongation factor-1α from 1580 to 1694 (EF1α, GenBankTM accession number X16869) (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether EF-1α expression can be modulated by anti-receptor blocking antibodies C225 and herceptin on EF-1α mRNA levels in tumor cells, we did Northern blot hybridization using the 1.8-kilobase pair EF-1α cDNA as a probe. Treatment of human breast carcinoma cells (SK-BR-3, BT-474, and MDA-MB468) and vulvar carcinoma cells (A-431) with C225 or herceptin was accompanied by a significant decrease in EF-1α mRNA levels (Fig. 1 C). A-431 cells, which overexpress EGFR, are growth-stimulated by autocrine transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) and growth-inhibited by C225 (6Van de Vijver M.J. Kumar R. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 266: 7503-7508Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To determine whether TGF-α is involved in the regulation of EF-1α, we asked whether C225, which blocks TGF-α from binding to EGFR, could down-regulate the steady-state level of EF-1α mRNA. Treatment of A-431 cells with C225 was accompanied by a gradual decrease in EF-1α mRNA expression (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, herceptin treatment of BT-474 cells, which overexpress HER2, was associated with reduced expression of EF-1α mRNA (Fig.2 B). The observed suppression was not related to high levels of EGFR, as C225 was effective in selectively reducing EF-1α levels (but not EF-1β) in breast cancer MDA-MB231 cells, which have normal levels of EGFR and HER2 (Fig. 2 C). Since MDA-MB231 cells are known to constitutively secrete HRG, a combinatorial ligand for HER3 and HER4 that can transactivate EGFR and HER2, the above results raised the possibility that EF-1α mRNA expression could be induced by HRG. Indeed, both HRG and EGF were potent inducers of EF-1α mRNA (but not EF-1β) in MDA-MB231 cells (Fig. 2 D). EGF regulation of EF-1α mRNA expression was confirmed using a mouse NIH3T3 cell line (HER14) that stably expressed human EGFR and responded to exogenous recombinant EGF by growth stimulation (35Fan Z. Mendelsohn J. Masui H. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21073-21079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGF treatment of HER14 cells for 8 h was accompanied by a significant increase in EF-1α mRNA levels (Fig. 2 E). Taken together, these results suggest that EF-1α mRNA levels in a number of cell types are modulated by EGF, HRG, and anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies that interfere with EGFR and HER2. Western blot analysis was performed to determine whether the modulation of EF-1α mRNA levels by growth factors and anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies was associated with a corresponding modulation in the expression of EF-1α protein. Results demonstrated that A-431 cells and human colon carcinoma DiFi cells, which have a functional TGF-α autocrine loop (44Wakabayashi-Ito N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29831-29837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), expressed a lower level of the 51-kDa EF-1α protein, after C225 treatment (Fig.3, A and B). Similarly, herceptin inhibited EF-1α protein levels in BT-474 cells (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, treatment of MCF-7 cells with EGF or HRG significantly increased the level of EF-1α protein (Fig.3 D). To validate further the modulation of EF-1α protein expression by growth factors, we examined the effects of growth factors and anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies on the level of newly synthesized EF-1α protein in cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. Similar to our results from Western analysis, treatment with C225 or herceptin resulted in a reduction of35S-labeled EF-1α protein in A-431, BT-474, and MDA-MB231 cells (Fig. 4, A–C). In contrast, HRG treatment caused an increase in 35S-labeled EF-1α protein in BT-474 (Fig. 4 A) and MDA-MB231 (Fig.4 D) cells and EGF in HER14 cells (Fig. 4 E). The observed induction of 35S-labeled EF-1α protein by HRG and EGF was mediated through HER2 and EGFR, as it was effectively suppressed by herceptin and C225 (Fig. 4, A andE). These results indicate the ability of growth factors to induce expression of EF-1α and of growth factor receptor antibodies to block it. The regulatory elements in the humanEF-1α are not completely understood. Recently, Clark and colleagues (37Nielsen S.J. Praestegaard M. Jorgensen H.F. Clark B.F.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have shown the significance of specific elements (44Wakabayashi-Ito N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29831-29837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), located in the first intron and also close to the TATA box, in the regulation of EF-1α transcription. To examine the effect of growth factor-blocking monoclonal antibodies on EF-1αpromoter activity, tumor cells were transfected with theEF-1α promoter construct pEFΔ1090CATSp1, which contains all regulatory elements upstream of the human EF-1α TATA box fused to the thymidine kinase promoter (37Nielsen S.J. Praestegaard M. Jorgensen H.F. Clark B.F.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Treatment of A-431 and MDA-MB231 cells with C225 (Fig. 5, A andB) and of MDA-MB231 and BT-474 cells with herceptin (Fig. 5,B and C) resulted in a significant inhibition ofEF-1α promoter-driven reporter transcription. Conversely, exposure of HER14 cells to EGF was accompanied by 2–4-fold stimulation of EF-1α promoter-driven transcription, and EGF receptor antagonist C225 blocked the EGF-mediated stimulation ofEF-1α promoter activity (Fig. 4 D). Similarly, stimulation of EF-1α promoter activity by HRG was also suppressed by pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with herceptin (Fig.4 E). Distinct signaling pathways regulate different functions of growth factors. For example, HRG utilizes p38MAPK and PI3K pathways to regulate the spreading and formation of lamellipodia (39Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Talukder A. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7253-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 45Mandal M. Adam L. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1998; 18: 999-1007Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A careful analysis of EF-1α promoter (GenBankTM accession number E02627) revealed several important motifs, including AP1, SP1, CREB, CRE-BP, and NF-κB that are activated by multiple growth factor signaling pathways. To understand the nature of growth factor signaling pathways leading to stimulation of the EF-1α promoter, we employed cotransfection of EF1α promoter pEFΔ1090CATSp1 reporter with dominant-negative tagged mutants that specifically inhibit p38MAPK and PI3K activation or dominant-negative mutant of MEK (39Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Talukder A. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7253-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 45Mandal M. Adam L. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1998; 18: 999-1007Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 46Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chernoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In these studies, we used HRG as a model growth factor. Mutants of p38MAPK and MEK, but not PI3K, suppressed both constitutive and the extent of HRG-induced stimulation of EF-1α promoter activity in MCF-7 cells (Fig.6 A). The observed inhibitory effects of mutants were not due to variability in the expression levels of the transfected genes in cells treated with or without HRG, as shown by the expression levels of FLAG-tagged p38AF and HA-tagged Δp85 by antibodies against FLAG and HA moieties, respectively (Fig.6 B). To confirm these findings further, we next used pharmacological inhibitors, such as PD098059 (for MEK), SB203580 (for p38MAPK), and LY294002 (for PI3K), and similar results were obtained (Fig. 6 C). In brief, these results suggested a preferential involvement of MEK and p38MAPK, but not PI3K, in the base-line and HRG-inducible regulation of EF-1αpromoter activity. Stimulation of cytoplasmic kinases by growth factors leads to phosphorylation and activation of multiple transcription factors, including c-Jun, ATF-2, NF-κB, CREB, and SP1. Since the binding motifs for these transcription factors are present in theEF-1α promoter (GenBankTM accession numberE02627), it is possible that a combination of these factors may be responsible for optimal EF-1α promoter regulation. Recent studies have shown transcriptional regulation of the humanEF-1α gene by upstream sequences, including a novel C8-stretch element. 2H. F. Jørgensen and B. F. C. Clark, unpublished data. To understand the mechanism by which HRG mediates its effect onEF-1α promoter, we employed a series of deletion mutants to map the HRG-responsive regulatory region in the EF-1αpromoter. All mutants were fussed to a CAT reporter system. Initially, we used constructs 1–6, and we examined the effect of HRG on theEF-1α promoter activity. There was minimal effect of the deletions from −1090 to −393 of the EF-1α promoter on the levels of HRG-mediated up-regulation of EF-1α (Fig.7, construct numbers 1–6). To delineate further the minimal region required for HRG stimulation of the EF-1α promoter, we next used additional mutants (Fig. 7, construct numbers 8, 9, and 12). Constructs 8 (−393 to −204) and 9 (−313 to −314) responded to HRG well, whereas constructs 12 (−204 to −127) and 7 (−119 to −29) showed no regulation in response to HRG. The results indicated that −393 to −314 region contained the regulatory elements that may confer the HRG-mediated induction of EF-1α. Analysis of the transcription factor sites present in the −393 to −314 revealed presence of an SP1 site. Recently it was shown that HRG regulate the activity of SP1 transcription factor (47Alroy I. Soussan L. Seger R. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To verify the potential involvement of the SP1 site in HRG induction of EF-1α promoter, we next mutated the SP1 site at −369 to −363 (construct 11). Point mutation of the SP1 site completely abolished the HRG-mediated induction of the construct containing −393 to −314 region. Mutation of another region other than Sp1 site has no effect on HRG-mediated induction (construct 10), suggesting a role of SP1 in the HRG regulation ofEF-1α promoter. Interestingly, construct 8 (−393 to −204), which contains two Sp1 sites, demonstrated a significantly higher HRG-inducible activity (4-fold) than the construct containing −393 to −314 (construct number 10) with one SP1 site (2.1-fold). Together, these observations suggested a role of SP1 site in the observed HRG-mediated regulation of EF-1α promoter. The eukaryotic genome is compacted with histone and other proteins to form chromatin, which consists of repeating units of nucleosomes (48Chen W.Y. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 49Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). For transcription factors to access DNA, the repressive chromatin structure needs to be remodeled. Dynamic alterations in the chromatin structure can facilitate or suppress the access of the transcription factors to nucleosomal DNA, leading to transcription regulation. One way to achieve this is through alterations in the acetylation state of nucleosomal histones. Hyperacetylated chromatin is generally associated with transcription activation, whereas hypoacetylated chromatin is associated with transcriptional repression (48Chen W.Y. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 49Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the HRG regulation of EF-1α expression involves histone acetylation on the EF-1α gene, we next performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay of the target gene, i.e.EF-α around a target sequence in the promoter (−535 to −209) which has multiple SP1 sites by using antibodies specific for acetylated forms of H3 and H4. Representative results from several independent experiments are shown in Fig. 8. HRG treatment of MCF-7 cells was accompanied by a significant enhancement in the association of EF-1α promoter region with the acetylated histones H3 and H4 (5.0- and 3.5-fold induction of associated-acetylated H3 and -acetylated H4 by HRG as compared with untreated cells). In addition, there was also easily detectable levels of EF-1α promoter association with the acetylated H3 and H4 in control untreated cells (Fig. 8, lanes 1 and3), implying a potential role of histone acetylation in the base-line expression of EF-1α. Earlier reports have shown a close correlation of up-regulation of histone H3 and H4 acetylation with an increased transcriptional activity (48Chen W.Y. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 49Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). In brief, our findings clearly demonstrated the involvement of histone acetylation in HRG-mediated stimulation of EF-α gene expression. In summary, we have presented new evidence that treatment of tumor cells with growth factors significantly increases EF-1αpromoter activity and mRNA and protein expression and that HRG increases the acetylation of H3 and H4 on the EF-1αpromoter. Since constitutive EF-1α expression was not well correlated with EGFR or HER2 overexpression in different cell types, ligand-activated cellular pathways, rather than receptor levels, may be significant in the regulation of EF-1α expression. These views are supported by a recent report showing no effect of EGFR and HER2 overexpression on levels of related EF-1δ in human keratinocytes (50Kolettas E. Lymboura M. Khazaie K. Luomani Y. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 385-392PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the lack of correlation with receptor levels, the ligand-induced up-regulation of EF-1α expression was mediated by a specific ligand-receptor interaction, as the anti-receptor blocking antibodies C225 and herceptin could effectively reduce it. Our study also shows the potential roles of MEK and p38MAPK in the constitutive regulation of EF-1α promoter activity. There are a number of possible functional implications for growth factor-regulated EF-1α expression as follows: 1) promotion of polypeptide elongation and thus potential contribution to increased translation of mRNA encoding growth-related proteins; 2) increased reorganization of the cytoskeleton, since it is one of the earliest phenotypic responses of most cells to growth factors and since EF-1α regulates actin bundling; 3) potential undefined roles in the nucleus, due to the ability of EF-1α to form a complex with ZPR1 (30Gangwani L. Mikrut M. Galcheva-Gargova Z. Davis R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In summary, our findings have clearly demonstrated for the first time a potential role of EF-1α in the actions of HER growth factors that are widely deregulated in human cancers and that ligand-dependent EF-1α expression was effectively inhibited with humanized anti-receptor blocking antibodies C225 and herceptin. In addition, we also provide new evidence to suggest that HRG stimulation of EF-1α promoter requires the SP1 site and that the EF-1α promoter undergoes histone acetylation in response to HRG.

Transcription of specific sets of genes is activated at a certain cell density, which the bacteria sense as concentrations of small diffusible signal molecules, produced by the bacteria. Quorum sensing in Gram-negative bacteria involves acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs)1 as signal molecules, AHL-synthesizing protein, (LuxI homologue), and the transcriptional activator protein (LuxR homologue) (1Fuqua W.C. Winans S.C. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar, 2Salmond G.P.C. Bycroft B.W. Stewart G.S.A.B. Williams P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the AHL molecule binds to the LuxR, allowing it to function as a transcription activator, and most data are consistent with this hypothesis, although most data may also be explained by a signal transduction mechanism, an indirect effect of AHLs, involving other factors beside the LuxR homologues and the AHL signal molecules. LuxR, the Vibrio fischeri luminescence (lux) gene activator, is the best studied member of the LuxR family of bacterial transcription regulators required for cell density-dependent gene expression. LuxR homologues occur in a number of different Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. TraR in Agrobacterium tumefaciens and LasR and RhlR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa) regulating Ti-plasmid transfer and production of virulence determinants, respectively. Direct interaction between LuxR and its most studied AHL signal,N-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (OHHL), has not been clearly demonstrated in vitro (1Fuqua W.C. Winans S.C. Greenberg E.P. J.

Interestingly, Bassler et al. (7Bassler B.L. Wright M. Showalter R.E. Silverman M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 8Bassler B.L. Wright M. Silverman M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have found, in the Vibrio harveyiluminescence quorum sensing system, a potential AHL binding receptor LuxN, necessary for luminescence, with a membrane-spanning domain. They suggest a two-component signal transduction; i.e. the signal binds to a receptor, which then transfers information (e.g.by a phosphorylation step), leading to transcription. Also, Sitnikovet al. (3Sitnikov D.M. Schineller J.B. Baldwin T.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) hypothesized involvement of another factor beside the LuxR homologue, which may be species-specific in its AHL response in one strain of bacteria and more unspecific in another strain. Protein kinases play a key role in signal transduction pathways in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (9Norris V. Grant S. Freestone P. Canvin J. Sheikh F.N. Toth I. Trinei M. Modha K. Norman R.I. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3677-3682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Motley S.T. Lory S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5386-5394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) is a heterogeneous group of serine/threonine protein kinases often involved in cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters in eukaryotes. Recently, several studies have reported on discoveries of serine/threonine protein kinases also in prokaryotes (10Motley S.T. Lory S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5386-5394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kenelly P.J. Potts M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4759-4764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C requires membrane binding for maximal activity, and this binding requires Ca2+. Ca2+ decreases the amount of negatively charged phospholipids, thereby increasing PKC membrane binding (12Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7624-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), activity (14Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 41: 25959-25967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, intracellular Ca2+ is thoroughly studied. The level of [Ca2+]i is tightly controlled, and changes in [Ca2+]i are known to regulate a variety of processes such as secretion, cell cycle transition, fertilization, and chemotaxis. In prokaryotes, however, the role for [Ca2+]i is not well studied. As more data continuously are being revealed, it has become evident that many Ca2+-controlled processes in eukaryotes have parallels in prokaryotes. As for eukaryotic cells, the [Ca2+]iin bacteria lies in the submicromolar range and is regulated by cell membrane- and organelle-associated Ca2+ channels and pumps (9Norris V. Grant S. Freestone P.

In bacteria, the expression of certain genes has been demonstrated to be, at least in part, both extra- and intracellular Ca2+-dependent. Extracellular Ca2+can act as an environmental signal, sensed by outer membrane receptors possibly influencing gene transcription (17Smith R.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 83-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to low Ca2+ concentrations is suggested to involve a high affinity sensor protein, having either an extra- or intracellular localization (17Smith R.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 83-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ as a second messenger has been studied in bacterial chemotaxis, and it has been shown for E. coli that stimulation with chemotactic attractants and repellants induce changes in [Ca2+]i (19Tisa L.S. Adler J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10777-10781Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Watkins N.J. Knight M.R. Trewavas J. Campbell A.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present study, involvement of factors, such as changes in intracellular calcium concentration and protein phoshorylation, during AHL activation of LuxR homologues in quorum sensing was investigated. As models for AHL-induced quorum sensing, the Gram-negative bacteriaSerratia liquefaciens and V. fischeri were used. The potassium salt of Fura-2 was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Leiden, The Netherlands). Stock solutions of Fura-2 (5 mm) in water were prepared, and light exposure during cell loading and fluorescence measurements were kept to a minimum. OHHL was purchased from Sigma. N-Hexanoyl homoserine lactone (HHL) was purchased from Quorum Science Inc. (Coralville, IA). N-Butanoyl homoserine lactone (BHL) was a generous gift from Prof. P. Williams (School of Pharmaceutical Sciences/Institute of Infections and Immunity, University of Nottingham, United Kingdom). Stock solutions, 2.0 mm in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), of the AHLs were prepared 30 min prior to the experiments. BiotrakTM PKC assay system (RPN 77) and [γ-33PO]ATP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. As a model for quorum sensing, a mutant S. liquefaciens strain, SwrI−, from wild type strain MG44 was used. This mutant strain does not synthesize BHL and HHL, two AHLs known to be produced by wild type S. liquefaciens (21Eberl L. Winson M.K. Sternberg C. Stewart G.S.A.B. Christiansen G. Chhabra S.R. Bycroft B. Williams P. Molin S. Givskov M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In addition, a V. fischeri strain, MJ-215, was used. This strain is unable to produce OHHL and HHL, two of three known AHLs produced by V. fischeri (22Kuo A. Callahan S.M. Dunlap P.V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 971-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a non-AHL-producing or -responding Gram-negative control bacteria, we used the E. coli strain MG 1655. Cultures for experiments were grown in LB media, pH 7.5, at room temperature with moderate shaking overnight (16–17 h). SwrI− were grown in LB5 medium (5 g of yeast, 10 g of Tryptone, and 5 g of NaCl per liter) and MJ-215 in LB20 medium (5 g of yeast, 10 g of Tryptone, and 20 g of NaCl per liter). All AHLs were used at higher concentrations than what is considered optimal, since the AHLs are most probably not completely dissolved in the stock solution, and the concentration was consequently overestimated. V. fischeri (MN215) was tested for light production during these culture conditions. No decrease in light production was observed at the [OHHL] used in fluorescence experiments, 20 μm and 0.2 mm compared with 2 μm. Instead a slight increase in light intensity was observed with increased [OHHL], indicating an overestimation of [AHLs] in these experiments. BHL, which is the AHL signal most specific for S. liquefaciens, was used in the PKC assay, while HHL, which is also produced by S. liquefaciens wild type and known to have the same effect as BHL if used at higher concentrations (21Eberl L. Winson M.K. Sternberg C. Stewart G.S.A.B. Christiansen G. Chhabra S.R. Bycroft B. Williams P. Molin S. Givskov M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), was used in Fura-2 ratio fluorescence spectrophotometry and fluorescence imaging. Since the bacterial strains used in these experiments are AHL-synthetase mutants, unable to produce the AHL signal molecules, we know that the receptors for the AHL molecules are not activated by their ligands before the onset of the experiments. The potassium salt of Fura-2 was loaded into bacteria essentially as described by Tisa and Adler (19Tisa L.S. Adler J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10777-10781Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ml of cell culture grown overnight to an optical density of about 1.0 were collected at 6000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resolved in 2–3 ml of electroporation buffer (1 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) in 10% glycerol). This procedure was followed by two more washes in electroporation buffer, and finally the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of electroporation buffer. The washed cells were stored on ice until electroporation. Fura-2 (50 μm) was introduced into the cells (200-μl suspension in a cuvette, 0.2-cm electrode gap) by the use of a single pulse of electricity at a capacitance of 25 microfarads with a field intensity of 2.5 kV at 200 ohms for 4–6 ms in a Bio-Rad gene pulser. Immediately after electroporation cells were diluted in 2 ml filtered used LB medium and conditioned at room temperature for 15 min. After three washes in the same medium, the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of a Ca2+ buffer (120 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes-Tris (pH 7.2), 10 mm glucose, 10 mm CaCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 1.2 mmMgSO4) and kept at room temperature until use, within 2 h. Intracellular calcium measurements were performed in a double beam luminescence spectrometer at 340- and 380-nm excitation and 510-nm emission wavelengths in a quartz cuvette at 20 °C with slow magnetic stirring. For every measurement, 200 μl of the Fura-2-loaded cell suspension was added to a quartz cuvette filled with 3 ml of Ca2+ buffer. The cell suspension was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min before measurement. All additions to the cuvette had a volume of 30 μl, corresponding to 1% of the total cuvette volume. Typically, fluorescence intensity data were collected every 1.9 s for 4 min, and the ratio of light emission at the two excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) were recorded. The addition of PBS as control and the addition of AHL in PBS were performed after 120 and 180 s, respectively. In the Fura-2 ratio fluorescence images (see below), fluctuations in fluorescence intensity sometimes were seen for 30 s after the addition of AHL. Therefore, the average fluorescence ratio value during 60 s following the addition of AHL or PBS was calculated in each sample. AHLs were also added to Fura-2 loaded E. coli cells (strain MG 1655) to study possible activation of a Gram-negative bacteria without this BHL- and HHL-dependent quorum sensing system. Results are presented as the mean value ± S.E. (n = 8) for each AHL. Images of intracellular Ca2+ transients was monitored using Fura-2-loaded cells. The recordings were made with a Rainbow excitation wavelength filter wheel (Life Science Resources Ltd., Cambridge, UK) carrying 340- and 380-nm filters, attached to an inverted Diaphot 300 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with oil immersion, fluorescence objectives. The emitted light was recorded at 510 nm using a digital CCD video camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA) at 400× primary magnification. The photon sampling time was typically 2–5 s. Data obtained was processed by means of a calcium image software, MiraCal (Life Science Resources Ltd.). The calculated fluorescence ratios, proportional to [Ca2+]i, were displayed as a series of images, where a decrease in light intensity corresponds to a decrease in [Ca2+]i. Background fluorescence was measured and subtracted in all measurements. For each measurement, 40 μl of cell suspension was transferred to and spread out on a methylsilanized coverglass. After settlement, an attached cell was focused on, and image recording was initiated. After 30–60 s of base-line measurement, 5 μl of AHL stock or PBS were added. After an observed shift in fluorescence ratio, the recordings were continued for an additional 120 s. An overnight culture of S. liquefaciens was stimulated by BHL or OHHL (20 μm) for 90 s prior to centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min, resuspension in homogenization buffer, and cell disintegration (8 × 1-min ultrasonication). Protein kinase C activity was assayed by measuring the rate of 33PO incorporation from [γ-33PO]ATP in the cell homogenate in the presence or absence of a PKC-selective peptide substrate with serine/threonine residues (specific for the α-β-γ-isoforms of PKC) using the BiotrakTM protein kinase C assay system (RPN 77) as described. Data are presented as means ± S.E., and nranges from 12 to 23. To compare several unmatched groups, statistical analyses were performed using a computerized analysis of variance (StatView 5.01, Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). Upon the addition of PBS to a suspension of Fura-2-loaded S. liquefaciens, no change in fluorescence ratio was observed; i.e. there was no change in [Ca2+]i. When 20 μm of HHL was added, however, there was a decline in [Ca2+]i, here demonstrated as the mean fluorescence ratio value during 60 s after the addition of HHL (Fig.1 A). The change in [Ca2+]i differed significantly from the resting level (p < 0.05, n = 8). The addition of 20 μm OHHL (Fig. 1 B) did not induce changes in [Ca2+]i that differed significantly from the resting level (n = 8). Fura-2-loaded E. coli, treated with OHHL or HHL as described, did not demonstrate any change in fluorescence ratio (data not shown). The addition of 200 μm HHL to S. liquefaciens settled to silanized glass induced a transient decline in [Ca2+]i, observed as a decrease in light intensity in the ratio fluorescence images (Fig.2 A). Similarly, 200 μm OHHL added to V. fischeri induced a transient decrease in observed [Ca2+]i (Fig.2 B). Typically, the cells recovered after 5 s, but most often they exhibited short bursts of [Ca2+]ifluctuations after recovery. WhenS. liquefaciens had been stimulated by BHL for 90 s prior to homogenization, the γ-phosphate group transfer from ATP to a peptide or protein substrate in the cell homogenate was significantly higher compared with unstimulated cell samples (p < 0.05, n = 5). Stimulation with OHHL, prior to sample preparation, also seemed to increase the amount of transferred phosphate groups; however, this increase was not statistically significant. We assume that the measured phosphate transfer is due to an induction of kinase activity (Fig.3 A). When a PKC-specific substrate, a peptide with a serine/threonine residue of the α-β-γ type, was added during sample analysis, the kinase activity of the BHL-stimulated samples were decreased about 20%. Interestingly, when no AHL signal had been added to the bacteria, the samples exhibited PKC activity, although not significantly different from stimulated cells (Fig. 3 B). This is the first study of the involvement of intracellular [Ca2+] and protein phosphorylation in bacterial quorum-sensing signal transduction. We demonstrate that both intracellular [Ca2+] transients and kinase activity are induced by stimulation of the quorum-sensing bacteria with either of its specific AHL signal molecules, BHL or HHL. These substances are produced by S. liquefaciens, where HHL has the same effect as BHL if used at a higher concentration (21Eberl L. Winson M.K. Sternberg C. Stewart G.S.A.B. Christiansen G. Chhabra S.R. Bycroft B. Williams P. Molin S. Givskov M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The V. fischeri LuxR protein is a 250-amino acid polypeptide (23Devine J.H. Countryman C. Baldwin T.O. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 837-842Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Devine J.H. Shadel G.S. Baldwin T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5688-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Based on mutational analysis, it has been shown that LuxR consists of two functional domains where the C-terminal together with RNA polymerase, can interact with the lux-regulatory DNA, and the N-terminal contains an AHL binding domain that inhibits the activity of the C-terminal domain in the absence of the AHL signal molecule (5Hanzelka B.L. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 815-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Stevens A.M. Dolan K.M. Greenberg E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12619-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A LuxR mutant with the N terminus deleted is independent of cell density and shows the same or higher activity as LuxR in the presence of AHL molecules (3Sitnikov D.M. Schineller J.B. Baldwin T.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Choi S.H. Greenberg E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11115-11119Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Zhu and Winans (6Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) observed for the A. tumefaciens TraR protein that the AHL binding increases the affinity of TraR for the DNA binding site and that the binding might stabilize the TraR protein against cytoplasmic proteases. This stabilization is hypothesized to be a conversion from unbound TraR monomers to AHL-bound oligomers of the TraR protein (6Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). LuxR has been found to be associated with the cytoplasmic membrane, but it has no transmembrane structures (27Kolibachuk D. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7307-7312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When trying to purify LuxR from a cell membrane fraction of V. fischeri, it has been shown that LuxR remains associated to membranes in the presence of a number of detergents as well as KCl, but LuxR can be solubilized from membranes by EDTA treatment (27Kolibachuk D. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7307-7312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilization of LuxR from membranes by EDTA might indicate the involvement of Ca2+ as a factor for membrane attachment. It is known that Ca2+ may have a general role in the lateral distribution of membrane lipids (9Norris V. Grant S. Freestone P. Canvin J. Sheikh F.N. Toth I. Trinei M. Modha K. Norman R.I. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3677-3682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, Ca2+ might have a role in an eventual multimerization of the membrane-attached LuxR monomers. We assume that the transcription factor “SwrR” regulated by BHL and HHL in S. liquefaciens is a homologue to the LuxR protein inV. fischeri. In S. liquefaciens, DNA sequencing has revealed the presence of an open reading frame next to theswrI gene (coding for the SwrI protein, which synthesizes BHL and HHL signal molecules), denoted swrR, with homology to the LuxR family of AHL-binding transcriptional regulators (unpublished results referred to by Givskov et al.(28Givskov M. Eberl L. Molin S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 148: 115-122Crossref Google Scholar)). In trying to elucidate the role of intracellular Ca2+transients in quorum-sensing signaling, the total amino acid sequence of LuxR protein, as determined by Devine et al. (23Devine J.H. Countryman C. Baldwin T.O. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 837-842Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Devine J.H. Shadel G.S. Baldwin T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5688-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), was analyzed for calcium binding motifs, active sites of enzymes, and other functional regions, in the Prosite data base 2The Prosite data base is available on the World Wide Web. (29Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In the LuxR sequence, the data base search revealed identity with an ATP/GTP-binding site motif (residues 194–201) and predicted several sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C and casein kinase II. The data base analysis also predicted a site for myristoylation (residues 119–124). No identity for EF-hand calcium binding motifs was found in the LuxR sequence. However, when the requirement for similarity was set to 72%, an EF-hand motif was suggested (residues 74–86). The Prosite analysis thus provides support for more than one alternative hypothesis for how Ca2+ transients and/or protein phosphorylation might be involved in quorum sensing signaling. In both detection approaches used to study [Ca2+]i mobilization, ratio fluorescence spectrometry of cell populations and ratio fluorescence imaging for single bacteria analysis, we observed a decrease in intracellular [Ca2+] upon stimulation with a specific AHL molecule. When HHL was added to a suspension of S. liquefaciens, there was a decline in [Ca2+]i observed as a decrease in the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, the addition of a nonspecific AHL signal, OHHL (Fig.1 B) or the addition of PBS buffer only did not induce significant changes in [Ca2+]i. The cells thus respond with a mobilization of [Ca2+]i to HHL but not to OHHL, an AHL molecule that is not produced by S. liquefaciens. As a comparison, E. coli was not activated by either HHL or OHHL. During fluorescence experiment treatment with salt-free electroporation buffer, V. fischerirapidly and extensively formed mucus affecting the homogeneity and translucency of the cell suspensions, thereby invalidating the results. In Fura-2 ratio fluorescence imaging experiments, the addition of HHL and OHHL to settled S. liquefaciens and V. fischeri, respectively, induced rapid declines in observed [Ca2+]i. The cells recovered after a short series of repeated [Ca2+]i fluctuations (Fig. 2). The ratio imaging of settled single cells, where, roughly, a pixel corresponds to the size of a single bacterial cell, showed [Ca2+]i transients already after a few seconds, followed by [Ca2+]i fluctuations. Upon initial recovery, however, the cell [Ca2+]i continued to fluctuate for ∼15 s, sometimes even longer. To be sure to detect all of these fluctuations in the conventional Fura-2 fluorescence measurements, the average fluorescence over a longer time period, 60 s, was measured. Within these 60 s, the rapid [Ca2+]i responses demonstrated in the single cell measurements are well included. These [Ca2+]ifluctuations might explain the “noisy” appearance of fluorescence data from cell suspensions (data not shown). In eukaryotic cells, most often transient increases in calcium concentration have been coupled to signal transduction. The data presented here, showing a transient decrease in [Ca2+]i, are consistent with data from a bacterial chemotaxis study presented by Tisa and Adler (19Tisa L.S. Adler J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10777-10781Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), where stimulation of Fura-2-loaded E. coli cells with a chemotactic attractant (l-serine) also led to a transient decrease in [Ca2+]i. Tisa and Adler present a theory for the coupling between an observed decrease in [Ca2+]i and signal transduction. They suggest that Ca2+ might help stabilize and maintain a chemotactic protein in its phosphorylated state, stimulating tumbling. A decrease in [Ca2+]i would result in an unphosphorylated protein, stimulating running. Possible roles for the demonstrated Ca2+ transients in AHL-dependent quorum sensing may be involvement in the attachment of LuxR (or LuxR homologue) to the membrane or exposure of its AHL-binding site. A myristoylation site in LuxR, suggested by the Prosite data matching (i.e. an acyl-binding domain) is a possible site for membrane association or may be an AHL-binding site. Both of these alternatives might in turn be dependent on changes in intracellular [Ca2+], by a “calcium-myristoylation switch,” in which an acyl-binding site is exposed upon Ca2+ stimulation (30Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 398: 198-202Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Many bacterial regulators employ a signal transduction system, where a protein is activated by kinase-dependent phosphorylation. The AHL-induced [Ca2+]i response observed in the fluorescence experiments might indicate a possible activation of LuxR homologues by a Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation upon AHL stimulation. Kinase stimulation by Ca2+ activated calmodulin-like proteins have been described in bacteria (31Onek L.A. Smith R.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1039-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The data base search predicted an ATP/GTP-binding site motif (residues 194–201) in the LuxR sequence, and several sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C and casein kinase II. We therefore investigated possible protein kinase activity upon AHL stimulation of S. liquefaciens cell suspensions. We found an increase in kinase activity in cell homogenates from bacteria that had been stimulated with BHL. However, when a α-β-γ PKC isoenzyme substrate was present during measurements the kinase activity in BHL-treated samples was dampened about 20%. The finding may indicate a competitive inhibition of the BHL-induced kinase activity by the PKC-specific α-β-γ substrate. If so, a possible “non-α-β-γ substrate” is most probably synthezised by the cells and harbored in the homogenate. In contrast, when cell samples were not stimulated with AHLs prior to homogenization, kinase activity was measurable in the presence of the α-β-γ-PKC substrate type only, indicating a specific PKC activity. In Fig. 4 alternative roles for intracellular [Ca2+] and kinase activity in LuxR homologue activation is considered. We suggest a model where AHL interaction with the LuxR homologue is dependent on or synergistic with AHL interaction with a “non-LuxR AHL receptor” situated, presumably, in the periplasmic region. A direct binding of OHHL to a LuxR homologue, TraR, has been demonstrated (6Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Assuming the involvement of [Ca2+]i in this interaction, possible mechanisms for this may be exposure of the AHL binding site on the LuxR homologue upon [Ca2+]i changes or exposure of the site for membrane attachment, which in turn may affect the AHL binding site. In parallel to the suggested Ca2+effects, LuxR may be activated for transcription through phosphorylation by an AHL-activated, or possibly Ca2+-activated, kinase. Both direct AHL interaction with LuxR and AHL binding to a not yet identified “non-LuxR AHL receptor” may be essential for transcription activation by the LuxR homologue. However, one AHL interaction in this pathway may be more species-specific than the other. The conclusion of this study is that changes in [Ca2+]i are induced by quorum-sensing signals in the Gram-negative bacteria S. liquefaciens and V. fischeri. We also conclude that kinase activity is induced inS. liquefaciens upon AHL stimulation. We therefore suggest that transient intracellular [Ca2+] changes and kinase activity following AHL stimulation are critical for the quorum-sensing signal transduction in S. liquefaciens.

https://openalex.org/W2154538416,"To map the structure of a ligand-gated ion channel, we used the photolabile polyamine-containing toxin MR44 as photoaffinity label. MR44 binds with high affinity to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in its closed channel conformation. The binding stoichiometry was two molecules of MR44 per receptor monomer. Upon UV irradiation of the receptor-ligand complex, 125I-MR44 was incorporated into the receptor α-subunit. From proteolytic mapping studies, we conclude that the site of 125I-MR44 cross-linking is contained in the sequence αHis-186 to αLeu-199, which is part of the extracellular domain of the receptor. This sequence partially overlaps in its C-terminal region with one of the three loops that form the agonist-binding site. The agonist carbachol and the competitive antagonist α-bungarotoxin had only minor influence on the photocross-linking of 125I-MR44. The site where the hydrophobic head group of 125I-MR44 binds must therefore be located outside the zone that is sterically influenced by agonist bound at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. In binding and photocross-linking experiments, the luminal noncompetitive inhibitors ethidium and triphenylmethylphosphonium were found to compete with 125I-MR44. We conclude that the polyamine moiety of 125I-MR44 interacts with the high affinity noncompetitive inhibitor site deep in the channel of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, while the aromatic ring of this compound binds in the upper part of the ion channel (i.e. in the vestibule) to a hydrophobic region on the α-subunit that is located in close proximity to the agonist binding site. The region of the α-subunit labeled by 125I-MR44 should therefore be accessible from the luminal side of the vestibule. To map the structure of a ligand-gated ion channel, we used the photolabile polyamine-containing toxin MR44 as photoaffinity label. MR44 binds with high affinity to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in its closed channel conformation. The binding stoichiometry was two molecules of MR44 per receptor monomer. Upon UV irradiation of the receptor-ligand complex, 125I-MR44 was incorporated into the receptor α-subunit.

The large N-terminal domain and the relatively short C-terminal part of the subunits are oriented toward the extracellular side. A large connecting loop, which is found between transmembrane sequences M3 and M4, is assumed to extend into the cytoplasm.

A binding site for noncompetitive inhibitors (NCIs), such as chlorpromazine, ethidium bromide, and triphenylmethylphosphonium (TPMP+), has been found within the channel lumen (6Hucho F. Oberthür W. Lottspeich F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 19Giraudat J. Dennis M. Heidmann T. Chang J.Y. Changeux J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These NCIs are assumed to enter the ion channel from the extracellular side and to bind deep in the channel lumen, thereby inhibiting the ion flow. Photoaffinity labels derived from well characterized NCIs have been developed to characterize the structure of the nAChR ion channel. [3H]chlorpromazine and [3H]TPMP+ are preferentially photocross-linked to amino acid residues within the M2 transmembrane sequence of the desensitized receptor, thus demonstrating that these compounds bind deep in the ion channel and close to the selectivity filter (6Hucho F.

Philanthotoxin-433 (PhTX-433) is a neuroactive, polyamine-containing toxin found in the venom of the digger wasp Philanthus triangulum (20Eldefrawi A.T. Eldefrawi M.E. Konno K. Mansour N.A.

We have synthesized a series of polyamine-containing analogues of PhTX-343 in the search for a ligand with high affinity and specificity for Torpedo californicanAChR for photocross-linking studies. This approach resulted in the discovery of a photoactivable compound, MR44, which binds to the nAChR with high affinity (26Bixel M.G. Krauss M. Liu Y. Bolognesi M.L. Rosini M. Mellor I.S.

In the present work, we showed that two molecules of MR44 bind with high affinity in the lumen of the nAChR ion channel. Using125I-MR44 as a photoaffinity label, we localized the site of interaction of the aromatic head group of MR44 in the vestibule of the ion channel. The sequence that was labeled by 125I-MR44 was found on the α-subunit close to, but not overlapping with, the agonist-binding site. In addition, we found that bound MR44 was displaced by luminal NCIs and calcium, suggesting that the positively charged polyamine moiety of MR44 binds deep in the channel lumen at the high affinity NCI site. Liquid nitrogen-frozen tissue from T. californica was supplied by C. Winkler (Aquatic Research Consultants, Sa Pedro). Carbamoylcholine, calcium chloride, ethidium bromide, and HEPES were from Sigma. Dithiothreitol, TPMP+, and chloramine T were from Aldrich. K125I was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.125I-Labeled α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ArgC protease, AspN protease, LysC protease, endoglycosidase H (Endo H), and V8 protease were obtained in sequencing grade from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). MR44 was radioactively iodinated with 125I using the chloramine T method (31Greenwood F.C. Hinter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (6717) Google Scholar). The mono-125I derivative was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC (Waters model 626, Eschborn, Germany) on a Vydac C18 column applying the following linear gradient (1 ml/min): solvent A (aqueous solution containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid). The UV absorption of the eluent was determined at 305 nm, and the radioactivity of each fraction was detected using a γ-counter. 125I-MR44 was characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry. AChR-rich membranes were prepared from frozen T. californica electric organ as described earlier (32Schiebler W. Lauffer L. Hucho F. FEBS Lett. 1977; 81: 39-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of125I-MR44 (5,000 cpm/nmol) were added to a constant amount of nAChR-rich membranes (0.3 mg/ml protein, diluted in 100 mm NaPi, pH 7.4; total volume per sample, 200 μl) and were incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Bound ligand was separated from the free ligand by ultracentrifugation in a Beckmann tabletop ultracentrifuge for 10 min at 80,000 × g and 4 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn prior to centrifugation to determine the total radioactivity, and duplicate aliquots of the supernatant were removed after centrifugation to determine the free ligand concentration. Nonspecific binding was determined from bound125I-MR44 in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of I-MR44. 125I-Labeled α-BTX binding assays have been performed as described previously (33Hartig P.R. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, nAChR-rich membranes (10 μg/ml) diluted in 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.5, were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled α-BTX (0–1 μg/ml) for 45 min at room temperature (final volume 200 μl). 50 μl (duplicates) were adsorbed to DE81 filters. The filters were washed three times for 10 min with 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.5. The radioactivity of 125I-labeled α-BTX bound to the filters was determined in a γ-counter. The number of α-BTX binding sites was calculated according to Hartig and Raftery (33Hartig P.R. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For NCI and α-BTX competition experiments, 125I-MR44 (9 μm; 5,000 cpm/nmol) and increasing concentrations of NCI or α-BTX were added to a constant amount of nAChR-rich membranes (0.3 mg/ml protein). In the following, the samples were treated as described above. 125I-MR44 (9 μm; 5,000 cpm/nmol) was added to a constant amount of nAChR-rich membranes (0.3 mg/ml of protein) diluted in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4 (total volume per sample, 200 μl) containing increasing concentrations of CaCl2. In the following, the samples were treated as described above. Dissociation constants (Kapp values) for competing calcium were derived from analysis of its capacity to displace125I-MR44 from its binding site at the nAChR. For calculation of Kapp values, the binding data were plotted according to a logarithmic formula described by Herzet al. (34Herz J.M. Johnson D.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7238-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TE671 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1 mm pyruvic acid, 4 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. Cells were divided 1:10 when they were ∼75% confluent. For electrophysiology, cells were grown on glass coverslips (5 × 20 mm) in 35-mm Petri dishes and transferred to a perfusion bath mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope. The whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was used to record whole-cell currents evoked by acetylcholine (ACh). Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (GC150–10; Clarke Electromedical Instruments) using a Sutter (P-97) programmable puller. Pipette resistances were ∼5 megaohms when filled with 140 mm CsCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2, adjusted with CsOH). The cells were constantly perfused with rat saline containing 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). Membrane currents were monitored using a List Electromedical L/M-EPC7 patch clamp amplifier. The patch clamp amplifier and DAD-12 Superfusion system were controlled by pClamp 5.7.2 software (Axon Instruments), which simultaneously acquired data to the hard disc of an IBM-compatible PC. Concentration-inhibition relationships for MR44 were measured to determine the IC50value for inhibition of the peak current evoked by ACh (10 μm) at holding potentials (VH) of −25, −50, and −100 mV. Experiments were performed at 18–22 °C. All data analyses were performed on an IBM-compatible PC using pClamp 5.7.2 software (Axon Instruments). Curve fitting was performed using Graphpad Prism software. IC50 values were determined by fitting a four-parameter logistic equation to the concentration-inhibition/response data. p values were determined by the unpaired Student's t test, and differences were considered to be significant for p < 0.05. nAChR-rich membranes (50 μg) were diluted in 0.1 m NaPi, pH 7.4, to a final receptor concentration of 140 nm. After the addition of carbachol (500 μm), the samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, TPMP+, ethidium, α-BTX, or unlabeled MR44 was added, and the samples were incubated for further 30 min at room temperature. The radioactive125I-MR44 (10 μm; 250,000 cpm/nmol) was mixed with the sample solution and irradiated with UV light at 254 nm (distance, 15 cm; quartz lamp; Desaga, Heidelberg, Germany) for 15 s. Longer irradiation times resulted in a significant loss of label, presumably because the aromatic group of MR44 releases125I, and in irreversible damage of the nAChR, resulting in high molecular weight aggregates of the receptor (data not shown). Unbound 125I-MR44 was separated from 125I-MR44 bound to nAChR-rich membranes by centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 15 min). The pellet was dissolved and separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% SDS-PAG (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206251) Google Scholar). The stained gel was dried, and radioactive receptor subunits were visualized by autoradiography. 180 μg of nAChR-rich membranes were centrifuged after labeling with125I-MR44 and resuspended in 50 μl of 100 mmNaPi buffer, pH 6.5. 5 μl of 1% SDS was added to this suspension, followed by 10 milliunits of Endo H in 3 μl of NaPi buffer. As a control, buffer was added instead of Endo H. The incubation was carried out overnight at 37 °C. 10 mg of nAChR (0.25 mg/ml in 0.1 m NaPi buffer, pH 7.4) was incubated with 50 μm125I-MR44 for 30 min following UV irradiation at 254 nm for 15 s. Unbound toxin was separated from 125I-MR44 bound to nAChR-rich membranes by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The pellet was dissolved in 2 ml of gel loading buffer. For preparative gel electrophoresis (model 491 prep cell; Bio-Rad) the sample was loaded onto a 1.5-cm-wide cylindrical gel containing a 10-cm-long separating gel (10% (w/v) acrylamide) and a 3-cm-long stacking gel (3% (w/v) acrylamide). The electrophoresis was carried out overnight at 15 mA. Proteins eluting from the gel were collected in 1.5-ml fractions in 150 mm Tris/HCl, 380 mm glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.3. Fractions were assayed by SDS-PAGE and by counting the radioactivity of each fraction in a γ-counter. Fractions containing pure α-subunit were pooled. Typically, about 600 μg of α-subunit was recovered containing 600,000 cpm. For deglycosylation of 20 μg of125I-labeled α-subunit in 70 μl of 50 mmNaPi buffer, pH 6.5, 2 μl of 10% SDS and 10 milliunits of Endo H was added. As a control, buffer was added instead of Endo H. The incubation was carried out overnight at 37 °C. Proteolytic mapping was performed using the method of Cleveland et al. (36Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) withS. aureus V8 protease. The proteolytic cleavage takes place during the stacking phase of electrophoresis in the Laemmli gel system. Typically, 30 μg of pure α-subunit were lyophilized, dissolved in 25 μl of loading buffer (175 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 6.8), and incubated for 10 min at 70 °C. 4 μg of V8 protease were dissolved in 6 μl of loading buffer and added to the α-subunit. The entire sample was loaded immediately onto the stacking gel. Stacking and proteolysis were carried out for 30 min at 12 mA. Then the current was shut off for 30 min to allow further digestion by the protease, after which electrophoresis was continued. The separating gel contained 15% (w/v) acrylamide to allow adequate separation of the low molecular weight cleavage products. After Coomassie staining, the gel was dried, and radioactive peptides were visualized by autoradiography. Since the proteolytic activity of AspN protease is drastically reduced in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) SDS in the electrophoresis buffer (37Drapeau G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 839-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proteolytic cleavage was carried out in solution prior to electrophoretic separation of the proteolytic peptides using the Tricine gel system described by Schägger and von Jagow (38Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10449) Google Scholar). 25 μg of 125I-MR44-labeled α-subunit in 100 mmNaPi, pH 7.5, were incubated with 2 μg of AspN protease for 27 h at 37 °C. The sample was lyophilized, dissolved in 25 μl of Tricine gel loading buffer, and incubated for 10 min at 70 °C. The samples were loaded on a Tricine gel containing a 3% spacer gel and a 16% separation gel. Electrophoresis was carried out overnight at 30 V. After Coomassie staining, the gel was dried, and radioactive peptides were visualized by autoradiography. 25 μg of125I-MR44-labeled α-subunit in 12.5 mmCaCl2, 0.5% EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, were incubated with 2 μg of ArgC protease for 27 h at 37 °C (39Mitchell W.M. Harrington W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4683-4692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sample preparation, Tricine gel electrophoresis, staining of the peptides, and detection of labeled peptides were performed as described above. 25 μg of125I-MR44-labeled α-subunit in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS were incubated with 2 μg of LysC protease for 27 h at 37 °C (40Jekel P.A. Weijer W.J. Beintema J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Sample preparation, Tricine gel electrophoresis, staining of the peptides, and detection of labeled peptides were performed as described above. For determination of N-terminal amino acid sequences, the peptides obtained by V8 digestion or AspN digestion and subsequent SDS-PAGE or Tricine-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively, of125I-MR44-labeled α-subunit were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After Coomassie staining, the peptides of interest were excised and submitted to Edman degradation. Protein sequence analysis was performed using a Type 473A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Binding of the radioactively labeled polyamine-containing toxin MR44 (Fig.1 A) to the nAChR was investigated (Fig. 1, B and C). 125I was introduced as radioactive label into the aromatic head group of MR44. 125I-MR44 was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (data not shown). Specific binding of125I-MR44 to nAChR-rich membranes from T. californica was determined by subtracting the nonspecific component from the total binding curve (Fig.2 B). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of nonradioactive I-MR44. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Bmax was obtained at 2.11 ± 0.38 μm (n = 4). The Scatchard plot shows a straight line indicating that125I-MR44 binds to a single class of noninteracting binding sites with a Kapp value of 0.82 ± 0.22 μm. In the presence of the agonist carbachol, which results in nAChR desensitization, the binding affinity of125I-MR44 was increased by a factor of 1.4, but theBmax value was not changed (data not shown). Using 125I-labeled α-BTX in a binding assay to determine the number of receptor monomers per μg of protein (33Hartig P.R. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the binding stoichiometry of 125I-MR44 was calculated to be 2.16 ± 0.18 mol of 125I-MR44/mol of nAChR monomer, demonstrating that two molecules of 125I-MR44 bind per receptor monomer.Figure 2A, ethidium displaced bound125I-MR44 at the nAChR. nAChR-rich membranes preincubated with carbachol were incubated with 125I-MR44 (9 μm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the luminal NCI ethidium. The IC50 value was determined to be 20.4 ± 3.6 μm (n = 3).B, calcium prevented binding of 125I-MR44 to the nAChR. nAChR-rich membranes were incubated with 125I-MR44 (9 μm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of calcium with (▪) and without (▴) the agonist carbachol (n = 3). According to a logarithmic equation described by Herz et al. (34Herz J.M. Johnson D.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7238-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Kapp values for calcium binding were calculated to be 12.3 ± 1.8 μm, and in the presence of carbachol they were 14.6 ± 2.2 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The influence of MR44 on the agonist-mediated ion conductance of the nAChR was investigated electrophysiologically using cells that express muscle-type nAChR (cell line TE671). MR44 inhibited ACh-mediated whole-cell currents of TE671 cells with IC50 values of 16.1 ± 4.6 μm (n = 5), 17.5 ± 7.1 μm (n = 6), and 16.9 ± 4.0 μm (n = 7) at VHof −25, −50, and −100 mV, respectively (Fig. 1 D). The well characterized luminal NCI ethidium interacts with a binding affinity of 1 μm (41Sterz R. Hermes M. Peper K. Bradley R.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1982; 80: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with the high affinity NCI site of the nAChR. The binding of125I-MR44 was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of ethidium bromide. Fig. 2 A shows that bound125I-MR44 was displaced by ethidium with an IC50 value of 20.4 ± 3.6 μm(n = 3). The competitive antagonist α-BTX had no influence on the binding of 125I-MR44 (data not shown). It was shown previously that the NCI ethidium could be completely displaced by cations, indicating that NCIs and channel-permeating cations bind to the nAChR ion channel in a competitive manner (42Herz J.M. Kolb S.J. Erlinger T. Schmid E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16691-16698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the divalent cation calcium displaced125I-MR44 from its binding site with an IC50value of 2.4 mm. According to a logarithmic formula described by Herz et al. (34Herz J.M. Johnson D.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7238-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), theKapp value for calcium binding was calculated to be 12.3 ± 1.8 μm (n = 3). In the presence of carbachol, the affinity of calcium for the MR44 binding site was not significantly changed (Kapp = 14.6 ± 2.2 μm). For photocross-linking, 125I-MR44 (10 μm) was incubated with nAChR-rich membranes. 125I-MR44 was covalently cross-linked to amino acid residues facing the ligand-binding pocket by irradiation for 15 s at 254 nm. The125I-labeled receptor subunits were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (Fig.3 A). 125I-MR44 was"
https://openalex.org/W1970278974,"Despite much interest in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFRs -1 and -2), VEGF-induced signalling cascades remain incompletely defined. Attempts to assign individual responses to a particular receptor have used either transfected cell lines, receptor-specific growth factors or antisense oligonucleotides. Such studies have attributed the majority of VEGF-induced responses to activation of VEGFR-2. As a consequence of poor growth factor-induced VEGFR-1 autophosphorylation however, observations from these studies may instead reflect the relative activation of the two receptors. We have generated novel chimeric VEGF receptors in which the dimerization domain of the B subunit of DNA gyrase is fused to the cytoplasmic domain of VEGFRs -1 and -2. When expressed in porcine aortic endothelial cells, both chimeric VEGFR-1 and -2 autophosphorylate in response to addition of the small-molecule dimerizing agent, coumermycin. Once activated, both receptors induce downstream signalling cascades, exemplified here by the activation of MAPK, PLCγ and PKB/Akt. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Y1175 residue of VEGFR-2 is essential for the activation of PLCγ mediated by this chimeric receptor. In contrast to previous reports which show a limited ability of VEGFR-1 to mediate signalling cascades, we show that once sufficiently activated, VEGFR-1 signals in a similar manner to VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038247481,"Mutations of Ras with three extra amino acids inserted into the phosphate-binding (P) loop have been investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Such mutants have originally been detected as oncogenes both in the ras and the TC21 genes. Biochemical experiments reveal the molecular basis of their oncogenic potential: the mutants show a strongly attenuated binding affinity for nucleotides, most notably for GDP, leading to a preference for GTP binding. Furthermore, both the intrinsic as well as the GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis are drastically diminished. The binding interaction with GAP is reduced, whereas binding to the Ras-binding domain of the downstream effector c-Raf1 is not altered appreciably. Microinjection into PC12 cells shows the mutants to be as potent to induce neurite outgrowth as conventional oncogenic Ras mutants. Unexpectedly, their ability to stimulate the MAP kinase pathway as measured by a reporter gene assay in RK13 cells is much higher than that of the normal oncogenic mutant G12V. This characteristic was attributed to an increased stimulation of c-Raf1 kinase activity by the insertional Ras mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1971312187,"p53-germline mutations located in the core DNA-binding domain have been associated with a more dominant tumor penetrance especially for breast cancer and brain tumors. We previously reported an unusual accumulation of CNS tumors associated with a unique p53 germline mutation, Y236delta (deletion of codon 236). To test whether this tissue-specific tumor predisposition reflects a gain-of-function activity of Y236delta, we generated transgenic mice expressing Y236delta in astrocytes using the regulatory elements of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene. After transplacental exposure to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (25 mg/kg BW) brain tumors developed in 18% (7/39) of GFAP-Y236delta transgenic p53-/- mice, while in p53+/- mice the incidence was 28% (11/40) (P>0.3). However, the mean tumor latency for GFAP-Y236delta/p53+/- mice was significantly shorter than for p53+/- mice, with 19.9 weeks vs 31.6 weeks (P=0.039), respectively. Taken together, cell specific expression of Y236delta results in an acceleration of tumor progression but does not confer a higher tumor penetrance. Conceivably, the transdominant effect of Y236delta provided a growth advantage early in the progression of neoplastic cells, since the endogenous p53 wild-type allele was lost in all brain tumors independent of the genotype. This reflects well observations from human astrocytic neoplasms with p53 mutations."

Moreover, a large variety of metabolic effects has been shown to occur in several tissues due to purinergic receptor activation. In the present work we studied the effects of exogenous Mg-ATP in rat liver cells perifused with dihydroxyacetone to investigate simultaneously gluconeogenetic and glycolytic pathways. We found a significant effect on oxidative phosphorylation as characterized by a decrease in oxygen consumption rate and in the cellular ATP-to-ADP ratio associated with an increase in lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. In addition, exogenous Mg-ATP induced rapid and reversible inhibition of both gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. The main effect on gluconeogenesis was located at the level of the fructose cycle, whereas the decrease in glycolysis was due to a strong inhibition of pyruvate kinase. Although pyruvate kinase inhibition induced by exogenous Mg-ATP was allosteric when assessed in vitro after enzyme extraction, we found a large decrease in the apparent maximal velocity when kinetics were assessed in vivo in intact perifused hepatocytes.

Interestingly, although pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) inhibition induced by exogenous Mg-ATP was allosteric when assessed in vitro after enzyme extraction, we found a large decrease in the apparent maximal velocity when kinetics were assessed in vivo in intact perifused hepatocytes.MATERIALS AND METHODSMale Wistar rats (200–250 g), fasted for 24 h, were anesthetized intraperitoneally with sodium thiopental (125 mg/kg).

Hepatocytes were perifused at 37 °C at a flow rate of 5 ml·min−1 with Krebs bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) continuously saturated with O2/CO2 (19:1) and containing calcium (1.3 mm) (32Argaud D. Roth H.

After an initial period of 45 min, a first steady state was reached and liver cells were exposed to a mixture of 100 μm MgCl2 and 100 μm ATP (Mg-ATP) for 30 min. After this period, Mg-ATP infusion was stopped, leading to a rapid decrease in ATP in the perifusate (3 min), and cells were further perifused for another 40 min in the absence of Mg-ATP. Perifusate samples were taken at different time intervals as indicated.To study the metabolic effect of exogenous ATP, perifused liver cells were titrated with DHA and in the presence or absence of exogenous Mg-ATP (100 μm). After an initial steady state had been reached (45 min) in the absence of DHA, seven successive steady states were obtained in the presence of increasing DHA concentrations (0.15, 0.30, 0.60, 1.20, 2.40, 4.80, and 9.60 mm) as indicated. Each of the successive steady states was obtained after 20 min, then both perifusate and cell samples were taken for subsequent analysis. The steady state was always confirmed by stable values of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate in three successive perifusate samples taken at 1-min intervals. Because these three values were always very close they have been averaged. Proteins in the perifusate were denatured by heating the samples (80 °C for 10 min) before centrifugation (36Leverve X.M.

Glucose, lactate, and pyruvate were measured in the perifusate and DHAP; glucose 6-phosphate; fructose 6-phosphate; 3-phosphoglycerate; and PEP were measured in the cellular fraction as described previously (31Groen A.K.

The net fluxes (micromoles/min/g of dry cells) of gluconeogenesis (Jglucose), glycolysis (Jlactate + pyruvate), and DHA metabolism (JDHA), were calculated from the total cell content of the perifusion chamber, the perifusate flow rate, and the concentration of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate in the perifusate. All determinations were made by enzymatic procedures (37Bergmeyer, H. U. (ed) (1974) Methods in Enzymatic Analysis, Vol. IV, pp. 1127-1624, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar) with either spectrophotometric or fluorometric determination of NADH.The effects of addition of exogenous Mg-ATP on cytosolic and mitochondrial adenine nucleotide content were studied in similar steady-state conditions as described above for the time course effect of Mg-ATP. After a first steady state in the presence of DHA (9.6 mm), Mg-ATP was added (100 μm) and, at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min, cells were taken from the chamber for intracellular and mitochondrial nucleotide determinations. Experiments were performed with or without Mg-ATP. Samples of cell suspension were quickly removed from the chamber, and cellular content was separated from the extracellular medium by centrifugation of the cell suspension through a layer of silicone oil as described previously (21Lee J.W. Filkins J.P. Circ. Shock. 1987; 22: 205-219PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial fraction was obtained by liver cell fractionation with digitonin as described previously (38Zuurendonk P.F. Tager J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 333: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Cytosolic adenine nucleotide concentrations were calculated by subtraction of the mitochondrial from the total intracellular value. ATP, ADP, and AMP were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (32Argaud D. Roth H. Wiernsperger N. Leverve X.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).After centrifugation of the cell suspension, pyruvate kinase activity was assessed on cell pellets resuspended in 1.5 ml of a buffer containing: 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4); 0.25m sucrose; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mmdithiothreitol. After homogenization for 1 min with an Ultraturax, this homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min (Beckman J 21). Pyruvate kinase activity in the supernatant was determined in 2 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 μl of the supernatant. To obtain partially purified enzyme (L form), 0.4 ml of the supernatant obtained after homogenization was washed with 0.3 ml of 100% (NH4)2SO4 (final concentration 40%) and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min; the pellets were suspended in a medium (2 ml) containing 20 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 30% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, and pyruvate kinase activity was measured in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2 (39Llorente P. Marco R. Sols A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 13: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 40Riou J.P. Claus T.H. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 656-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was expressed as the ratio of activity measured at 0.4 mm PEP to that at 4 mm PEP (v/Vmax), because this expression of the results has been shown to accurately reflect the phosphorylated state of the enzyme (41Claus T.H. El Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7855-7864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maximal velocity (Vmax, μmol/min/mg of proteins) was determined at 4 mm PEP. The velocity obtained at 4 mm PEP was very close to that obtained from a kinetic analysis of the saturation curve (data not shown). Protein content was determined in the supernatant by the Biuret method after homogenization. Due to the limited volume of samples and to the low protein content of the samples after partial purification by ammonium sulfate denaturation, we have determined in separate experiments the ratio of the protein content before and after purification in similar conditions. This ratio was 4.9 ± 0.2 (n = 4), and this value was used as the correcting factor for the protein content of the purified samples.The oxygen consumption rate in hepatocytes was determined after incubation in closed vials with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate and DHA (20 mm) with or without 100 μm Mg-ATP. After 15 min, cells samples were removed from the vials and placed in an oxygraph vessel equipped with a Clark electrode at 37 °C for oxygen determination. Respiratory rate was expressed as micromoles of O2/min/g of dry cells.Results are expressed as means ± S.E.; Mg-ATP effect was assessed either by a one-way analysis of variance (StatView, Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkley, CA) or by Student's t test.DISCUSSIONThe clear inhibitory effect of exogenous Mg-ATP addition on DHA metabolism in intact hepatocytes reported in this work consists of a decrease of gluconeogenesis associated with a potent inhibition of lactate-plus-pyruvate production. In addition, there seems to be a new mechanism for pyruvate kinase regulation after exogenous Mg-ATP addition occurring only in vivo in intact cells.By investigating DHA metabolism with successive steady states and measuring glucose and lactate-plus-pyruvate fluxes simultaneously with cellular intermediate concentrations, perifusion of liver cells is a suitable tool to determine the step(s) affected by exogenous Mg-ATP. Glucose production accurately reflects the rate of gluconeogenesis, because glycogen synthesis in these conditions is negligible as compared with the flux of glucose production. Moreover, glycogen synthesis is inhibited by exogenous ATP (18Keppens S. Gen. Pharmacol. 1993; 24: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The flux of lactate-plus-pyruvate truly reflects the pyruvate kinase flux (i.e. glycolysis) only in the absence of significant pyruvate oxidation or transamination. Pyruvate oxidation or transamination may lead to an underestimate of glycolytic flux, but this is probably limited because of the very low pyruvate concentration due to the continuous rinsing of the perifusate.Moreover, if decrease of lactate-plus-pyruvate production by Mg-ATP had been the consequence of an increased pyruvate oxidation or transamination, PEP should not accumulate, in contrast to our findings (Fig. 5).Considering the pathway between DHAP and glucose production, it appears that exogenous Mg-ATP is responsible for a minor effect at the level of glucose/glucose 6-phosphate cycle (Fig. 4 A), whereas the main effect is located at the fructose 6-phosphate/fructose 1,6-bisphophate step (Fig. 4, C and D). A cAMP-dependent phosphorylation has been reported to inhibit 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (47Castano L.G. Nieto A. Feliu J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5576-5579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this enzyme is not very active in hepatocytes from fasted rats (48Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). On the other hand, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase can be activated by a c-AMP-dependent phosphorylation (49Claus T.H. Schlumpf J.R. El-Maghrabi L.R. McGrane M. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, such effects of cAMP-related phosphorylation on 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase or on fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase seems to have a minor functional impact (48Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), and it is believed that fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is the main regulator via changes in the bifunctional enzyme: 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (50Hers H.G. van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Bartronset al. (12Bartrons R. van Schaftingen E. Hers H.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have reported that adenosine as well as the adenosine analogue 2-chloroadenosine are responsible for a decrease in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate due to an activation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase by adenylate cyclase activation and cAMP rise. Both adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine increase cAMP and decrease fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, but adenosine is responsible for a decreased rate of gluconeogenesis, whereas 2-chloroadenosine increases it (12Bartrons R. van Schaftingen E. Hers H.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Adenosine is responsible for an inhibition of gluconeogenesis (11Asensi M. Lopez-Rodas A. Sastre J. Vina J. Estrela J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R1522-R1526PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bartrons R. van Schaftingen E. Hers H.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,20Lavoinne A. Claeyssens S. Chedeville A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22Lund P. Cornell N.W. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1975; 152: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) at the level of fructose cycling. Hence, our results might support the view that the effect of exogenous Mg-ATP on gluconeogenesis from DHA are similar to, if not mediated by, the effect of adenosine as was suggested by Asensi et al. (11Asensi M. Lopez-Rodas A. Sastre J. Vina J. Estrela J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R1522-R1526PubMed Google Scholar).The most striking finding of this work is a significant decrease of lactate-plus-pyruvate production resulting from a potent inhibition of pyruvate kinase. Cytosolic adenine nucleotides are potent regulators of glycolysis, but given the decrease in cytosolic ATP-to-ADP ratio following exogenous Mg-ATP, an activation of glycolysis would actually have been predicted (32Argaud D. Roth H. Wiernsperger N. Leverve X.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 34Leverve X.M. Fontaine E. Putod-Paramelle F. Rigoulet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Piquet M.A. Fontaine E. Sibille B. Filippi C. Keriel C. Leverve X.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The increased cytosolic NADH/NAD ratio as shown by the increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (Fig. 7) could theoretically account, at least partly, for such an inhibition of lactate-plus-pyruvate production. But in the presence of Mg-ATP, the relationship between PEP and lactate-plus-pyruvate production reached a plateau indicating a clear saturation of the substrate PEP (Fig.5 A). Hence, the Mg-ATP inhibitory effect of lactate-plus-pyruvate production cannot be explained by a decrease in PEP concentration. Thus it can be concluded that acute administration of exogenous Mg-ATP strongly decreases the apparentVmax of pyruvate kinase when determined in vivo in intact cells. It has already been reported that Mg-ATP was responsible for a decrease in pyruvate kinase activity in vivo, but this was observed 4 h after exogenous Mg-ATP administration and was related to a transcriptional effect (25Mahmoud M.S. Wang P. Chaudry I.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 546-549Google Scholar). In our experiments the effect was observed after a few minutes, indicating that another mechanism must be involved.The second striking finding of the present work is related to the fact that the change in apparent maximal velocity of pyruvate kinase was found only when determined in vivo but not in vitro after enzyme extraction and partial purification. This indicates that the amount of enzyme was not modified by such short-term effect, which is not surprising. Actually, we found an allosteric inhibition of this enzyme when assessed in vitro. An acute inhibitory effect of adenosine on pyruvate kinase, due to a cAMP-related phosphorylation, was already described by Bartronset al. (12Bartrons R. van Schaftingen E. Hers H.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, in the present work the allosteric inhibition was not apparent when enzyme activity was determined in intact cells. This finding indicates that another mechanism controls this step in vivo. Because this effect disappears after enzyme extraction, an intracellular metabolite could be involved. Indeed, there are several cellular metabolites, such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, alanine, ATP, and ADP known to regulate pyruvate kinase, but these effectors act via an allosteric mechanism (48Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) and do not affect the Vmax in contrast to the present results. In the presence of Mg-ATP, the hypothetical inhibitor should be noncompetitive with PEP and does not bind abnormally tightly to the enzyme, because it is lost after extraction. Such a hypothesis opens the possibility of a new regulatory mechanism of pyruvate kinase, which can be detected only in vivo in intact cells.The question of the nature of the cellular effects of exogenous Mg-ATP is obviously complex. Although some effects of Mg-ATP seem to be similar to those of adenosine or adenosine agonists, others are different. Indeed, besides cAMP-related phosphorylation, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, calcium, and phospholipase C signaling, other receptors and signaling pathways are also probably involved, resulting in a very complicated and subtle regulation leading to multiple metabolic responses as described in this paper (including changes in oxidative phosphorylation, redox state, phosphate potential, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, etc.).Given the clear beneficial effect of exogenous Mg-ATP administration demonstrated by Chaudry (7Chaudry I.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603 (; discussion 140–141): 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Chaudry I.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: R117-R134PubMed Google Scholar) in several animal models of shock on survival and organ or cellular functions, a possible link with the present finding can be hypothesized. It has been recently demonstrated that isolated rat hepatocytes can signal to other hepatocytes by the release of ATP, suggesting a novel paracrine signaling pathway exists (51Schlosser S.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9948-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This finding favors a physiological role of exogenous ATP, which may trigger a protective effect. Numerous publications have emphasized the beneficial role of Mg-ATP infusion in various models of shock or severe trauma in animals. Dysfunction of heart (1Robinson D.A. Wang P. Chaudry I.H. J. Surg. Res. 1997; 69: 159-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), kidney (2Wang P. Zhou M. Rana M.W. Singh G. Ba Z.F. Ayala A. Chaudry I.H. Can. J. Physiol.

Because such a benefit was independent of hemodynamic status (4Wang P. Ba Z.F. Chaudry I.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1390-H1396PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chaudry I.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603 (; discussion 140–141): 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a metabolic mechanism was proposed (8Chaudry I.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: R117-R134PubMed Google Scholar). Because the liver plays a central role in the metabolic response to such severe illnesses, it may represent a major target for Mg-ATP (9Hayashi H. Chaudry I.H. Clemens M.G. Hull M.J. Baue A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: R573-R579PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mahmoud M.S. Wang P. Hootman S.R. Reich S.S. Chaudry I.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1804-R1809PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that purinergic receptor activation is responsible for a large variety of metabolic effects (11–24). ATP or adenosine or several analogues of purinergic receptors have been noted to affect liver glucose metabolism: i.e. stimulation of glycogenolysis (12Bartrons R. van Schaftingen E. Hers H.G.

These effects have been related to a cAMP-dependent mechanism (12Bartrons R. van Schaftingen E. Hers H.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a cAMP-independent inositol 3-phosphate/calcium-mediated signaling (13Buxton D.B. Robertson S.M. Olson M.S. Biochem.

The abilities of the resulting proteins to bind to DNA containing AraC half-sites separated by the usual four bases as well as an additional two or three helical turns of the DNA were measured. The inability of some of the protein constructs to bind to widely separated half-sites indicates that the C-terminal 14 amino acids of AraC are firmly bound to the rest of the DNA binding domain.

The inability of some of the protein constructs to bind to widely separated half-sites indicates that the C-terminal 14 amino acids of AraC are firmly bound to the rest of the DNA binding domain. More than 100 different proteins currently can be found in sequence data bases to possess significant sequence identity and a similarity to the DNA binding domain of AraC, the regulator of the arabinose operon in Escherichia coli. The pairwise identity between these domains often is below the 25% threshold for assurance that a pair of proteins possesses the same tertiary structure (1Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins. 1991; 9: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, 2Holm L. Ouzounis C. Sander C. Tuparev G. Vriend G. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the fact that the family of homologs is so large, and the fact that many whose functions have been determined are transcriptional regulators and that similarity extends across 120 amino acids all greatly raise the likelihood that the family members have the same structure. The structures of two members, MarA (3Rhee S. Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10413-10418Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and the DNA binding domain of Rob (4Kwon H.J. Bennik M.H. Demple B. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), with a 40% identity between the two and 16 and 20% identity, respectively, to the DNA binding domain of AraC have been determined and do have the same structure. AraC has a poor similarity with MarA and Rob over its final 14 amino acids residues 282–292 (Fig. 1). Is this region a structureless tail extending into the solvent, or is it firmly bound to the protein as is the same sequence region of MarA and Rob? This information is important in the construction of variants of AraC in which arms must be added to the protein to enable it to bind to other proteins. The engineering of such arm domain interactions is appealing in the construction of alternative regulation schemes (5Schleif R. Proteins. 1999; 34: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As of yet, no structure has been reported for the DNA binding domain of AraC. Thus, structure information about the DNA binding domain of AraC and particularly whether the C-terminal amino acids of the protein are free in the solvent or bound to the rest of the domain must be obtained by indirect means. By connecting two DNA binding domains of AraC with arms connecting to different places on the DNA binding domain, we have been able to show that the final 14 amino acids are firmly bound to the rest of the domain. Genes coding for the double DNA-binding proteins and DNA used in the DNA migration retardation assays were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides approximately 60 nucleotides long, purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, synthesized at the 200 nm scale, purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and dissolved in dH2O at 1 mg/ml.

The double DNA-binding proteins were constructed using the two-step polymerase chain reaction protocol as described previously (6Prytulla S. Dyson J.H. Wright P.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All genes described here were cloned into pSE380, a 4.4-kilobase plasmid containing the promoter p trc, aColE 1 origin of replication, lacO operator,LacI q repressor gene, and ampicillin resistance (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA).

Open table in a new tab The connector shows the final amino acid of the first AraC DNA binding domain, the connector sequence including any natural AraC linker, and the first amino acid of the second AraC DNA binding domain. The first DNA binding domain of each double domain protein consists of AraC amino acids 169–283 at least, and the second DNA binding domain consists of AraC amino acids of at least 175–292. For the linkers connecting the DNA binding domains, we chose amino acids from the linker region of the yeast mating-type repressor protein, α2 (7Astell C. Ahlstrom-Jonasson R. Smith M. Cell. 1981; 27: 15-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The linker provides the yeast repressor protein with sufficient flexibility that it can bind to a variety of spacings and orientations of its DNA half-sites (8Sauer R.T. Smith D.L. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The linker was flanked on either side by two amino acids dictated by the restriction endonuclease sites Eco RI and Bam HI. The proteins were expressed in strain SH321 (F−, araC − leu1022,lac74, galK −, str r) (9Hahn D. Dunn T. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Arabinose isomerase was assayed as described (10Schleif R.F. Wensink P. Practical Methods in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1981Crossref Google Scholar). Cells were grown in liquid minimal salts media with 0.4% glycerol and 0.4% casamino acids to an apparent optical density at A 550 nm of between 0.300 and 0.600 in the presence and absence of 0.2% arabinose as noted. DNA migration retardation assays were performed as described (11Hendrickson W. Schleif R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 611-628Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Proteins were overexpressed in a 5-ml culture, which had been inoculated with 16 μl of stationary phase SH321 cells and then grown in the absence followed by the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 90 min. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 300-μl buffer containing 100 mm K2PO4, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithioerythritol, and 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride, and then lysed by sonication. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was added to 175 μl of 100% glycerol. Western transfer experiments coupled with stained SDS gels show that the various linker proteins constitute about one-twentieth of 1% of the protein in the lysates. Radiolabeled DNA template was incubated in the presence of calf thymus DNA, arabinose, and buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 25 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm dithioerythritol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm K-EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1% arabinose. 1 μl of cell lysate was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then loaded on a gel containing 6% acrylamide, 0.1% bisacrylamide, 0.1% ammonium persulfate, and 0.2%N,N,N′N′-tetramethylethylenediamine. The gel was run in a recirculated chilled buffer containing 10 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm K-EDTA, pH 7.4, at 75 V for 1 h. Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed overnight to phosphor plates. A Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager was used to scan and analyze the gels. The C terminus of MarA consists of amino acids 111–124, corresponding to AraC amino acids 278–291. This C-terminal stretch lies across the side of the protein opposite the DNA binding site. If the corresponding C-terminal stretch in AraC is attached tightly to the core, shifting the attachment point of the linker to the first DNA binding domain toward the C-terminal end of the protein should effectively shorten the maximum distance that the two DNA binding domains can be spaced when binding to direct repeat half-sites as illustrated in Fig. 2. If instead, the C-terminal stretch is loosely attached as also shown in Fig. 2, moving the attachment point toward the C terminus of the protein effectively lengthens the linker and increases the maximum distance that the two DNA binding domains can be separated when binding in a direct repeat orientation. To test whether the C-terminal stretch of AraC is held firmly against the body of the DNA binding domain or whether it is loosely attached, we performed a series of DNA binding assays with the double AraC DNA binding domain proteins and three DNA templates, wild type ara I 1 I 2,I 1 -21-I 1, which contains two helical turns between the half-sites, andI 1 -32-I 1, which contains three helical turns. If the C-terminal stretch is held tightly to the body, shifting the linker attachment point to the first DNA binding domain from AraC amino acids 263 to 292 will result in a shortening of the maximum distance of separation between the centers of the structured cores of the two DNA binding domains and decrease the binding ability to widely spaced DNA binding sites. However, if the association is weak, shifting the linker attachment point will result in a lengthening of the maximum separation among the centers of the structured cores of the DNA binding domains. This will allow the protein to bind to DNA with more widely separated half-sites. Fig.3 and TableII show that pTH11 binds not as well as pTH13 does with increasing distance between the binding sites. This result indicates that the C-terminal stretch, indeed, is held firmly to the body of the protein.Table IISummary of resultsProteinLinker lengthAttachment pointMaximum reachInductionI 1 I 2 p BADBinding to template DNAI 1 I 2I 1-21-I 1I 1-32-I 1aa 2-aaa, amino acid.Å%pTH117292603000.110.080.03pTH137283905100.350.140.35pTH1013292903700.150.340.22pTH16252861601900.520.990.96pTH1527286170880.490.961.0Linker length is the number of amino acids between attachment points to the two AraC DNA binding domains.

Binding to template DNA was determined by in vitro DNA migration retardation assays, and the number reported is the fraction of DNA found in the protein-DNA complex. In this work, we have shown that the C terminus of AraC residues 278–292 binds tightly to the body of the AraC DNA binding domain. This was determined by changing the attachment points of the linker to the first DNA binding domain of double AraC DNA binding domain proteins, assaying the binding abilities of the resulting proteins to DNA templates with AraC half-sites separated by the wild-type spacing, and assaying the binding abilities of the resulting proteins to DNA templates with the half-sites separated by two and three additional helical turns of the DNA. The binding of the C-terminal stretch to the body of AraC is strong enough that this interaction remains intact when attached to a second AraC DNA binding domain via a flexible linker and when this entire protein is bound to DNA. The binding energies required to bind a double AraC DNA binding domain protein toI1 half-sites separated by three helical turns are insufficient to strip the C-terminal stretch from the body of the DNA binding domain. This work also provides data against a proposal for the mode of dimerization of AraC in the absence of arabinose and the mechanism of response to arabinose made on the basis of the crystal packing arrangements of the dimerization domain of AraC in the presence and absence of arabinose (12Soisson S.M. MacDougall-Shackleton B. Schleif R. Wolberger C. Science. 1997; 276: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). AraC protein was proposed to loop between distal DNA half-sites and repress the araBAD operon in the absence of arabinose when dimerized by a face to face interaction that allowed the DNA binding domains to be separated by 140 Å or greater and to cease looping and activate transcription when the separation distance was decreased by a shift in the dimerization interface. The proteins encoded by pTH15 and pTH16 allow greater than 140-Å separations, and as shown in Table II, strongly induce the ara p BAD promoter. Other data also show that the alternative interface mechanism is inapplicable to AraC (13Saviola B. Seabold R. Schleif R.F. J. Mol.
